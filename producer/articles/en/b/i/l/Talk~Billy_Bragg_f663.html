<p>Does the image add anything extra to info about Billy Bragg? Do we have rights to display it? If it does stay, should it be a bit smaller, with text wrapping around it? <a href="../../../k/a/b/User%7EKabads_c148.html" title="User:Kabads">Kabads</a></p>
<p><i>Re the image adding info- possibly not, but does make the page look more visually interesting and breaks it up a bit... actually thinking about it, I think it does add something to the article information wise- apparently using pictures like this (record covers) is OK as it's 'fair use'... You casn wrap the text if you like- Sam (Tzartram) does this alot, but I think on the whole pictures look better free standing but don't have strong felings either way... I'll reduce the image size later if I remember.. Cheers <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a></i></p>

<p>To be frank, this reads like a fanzine article. The authour(s) opinions are smattered all over the place. For example: "Billy Bragg, has been described as being amongst the best known and best loved popular musicians". Putting 'described' in the middle doesn't it make appear any more neutral. Moreover, you may be surprised to know that he really isn't that well known, especially in the states. ~~anon.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure it is a question of POV so much as one of accuracy. In no meaningful sense can he be described as 'well known' compared to M Jackson or Elvis or whoever. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonk_Bretton_219b.html" title="User:Monk Bretton">Monk Bretton</a> 17:36, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"<i><b>Well known</b></i>" is a relative term. He might not be a household name to the extent of the examples given, but he is well known in certain circles. Someone has a beef with whoever wrote the original text. Best thing to do is go to the article and amend it rather start off a time wasting discussion. Just amend it to show where he is well known. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 17:58, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've changed it. MPLX is correct that "well-known" is a relative standard, but I cannot think of any way the phrase could be construed in an encyclopediac manner. It's sufficient to allow the reader to know that Bragg's well-known enough to have a wikipedia entry, and let the rest of the article stand for itself in establishing his level of prominance. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 23:52, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on political life if too long-winded. Basically, he is aligned with various left wing causes and link to them. The places where you have specific instances of his political actions are fine...just trim this down. If I find my wikipedia password I might start working on this. ~~anon</p>

<dd>He is now more of a political activist and campaigner for House of Lords reform than he is a musician, so it seems fair to have a largish section on his activities in this area, in fact the section will probably get proportionally bigger, in comparison to the music section as time goes by. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonk_Bretton_219b.html" title="User:Monk Bretton">Monk Bretton</a> 17:36, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Billy Bragg has always been a political figure who sings his messages.

<p>Rather than contribute new annonymous account 213.122.71.37 has decided to hack at the article and without telling anyone what was hacked the history just says "removed POV".

You can get to this by going to "history" and clicking the "last" link for the edit you want to see. It seems to me to be cutting out material that is florid and largely POV; this is hardly butchery. I don't understand why you accuse it of being "POV in reverse of the worst sort" when you apparently don't even know what changes were made.

<dd>My gripe is that when someone edits the entire article and just notes that they have removed POV material, they they do not say what they mean. First of all the term POV is highly subjective, because it may be to one editor and it may not be to others. Secondly I don't want to waste time hunting around trying to find out what was changed. The note is supposed to explain just that: "<b>I changed section X which contained y to z</b>", something very specific. It is courteous to everyone involved.</dd>

<p>Okay, so I took the extra time to follow the link and it seems to me that what this other editor did was to hack the article:</p>

<dd><b>Stephen William Bragg</b> (born <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>), known as <b>Billy Bragg</b>, is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> musician, with a career spanning 20 years.

</dl>
<p>The only POV bits were:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>His music is a fine blend</b>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all it may well be that Bragg has been described as "<b>being amongst the best known and best loved popular musicians</b>" - what is missing is a REFERENCE to who said this. Otherwise it could be a factual statement. The "fine blend" bit could be fixed by cutting out the word "<b>fine</b>".</p>
<p>What actually happened is that someone came in on a rampage and hacked at the article. (By the way, I did not write the text in question!) <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 13:19, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the term "POV" shouldn't be entirely subjective, as it results from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> policy. There are however always grey areas, and I think there may be one here. Anyway, let's look at the disputed passages again:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>...has been described as being amongst the best known and best loved popular musicians, with a career spanning 20 years.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if this had a reference to who said it, it would still be POV, because it is a contentious statement presented without any counter-claim. As it stands, it is essentially being presented as truth stated by an unknown authority. Do you even think it's true? Is Billy among the best-known popular musicians? Compared to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>? <a href="../../../r/2E/e/R.E.M._%28band%29_efbe.html" title="R.E.M. (band)">R.E.M.</a>? Or even <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie.html" title="Kylie">Kylie</a>? It cannot stand as it is. Aside from the POV issue, I also think a clearer and more informative, if prosaic, list would make a stronger opening: "...Billy Bragg is a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singer.html" title="Singer">singer</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songwriter.html" title="Songwriter">songwriter</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_activist.html" title="Political activist">political activist</a>, or something like that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>His music is a fine blend of poetry and political comment, with a dash of romance, demonstrating his musical flexibility.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Fine" is a problem, but I also would argue that "poetry" is a term of high praise when applied to the work of a jobbing singer-songwriter; I suspect there are those (poets, perhaps) who would object to the description of Bill's work as "poetry". (I couldn't name any names, though). Take "poetry" out and the rest of the sentence collapses. However, I do think this sentence needed rewriting, not complete removal: The intro should give some idea of the sort of music Bill makes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So that's why I think these sentences were bad and removing them was more a case of pruning than butchery or vandalism. --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a><a href="../../../r/b/r/User_talk%7ERbrwr_b76f.html" title="User talk:Rbrwr"><sup>±</sup></a> 17:47, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Fine" in "Fine Blend" does not equate to excelent, it's fine as in fine sand, "fine blend" means well mixed. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamie_Kitson_b9e6.html" title="User:Jamie Kitson">Jamie Kitson</a></p>
<p>I don't know where this is going because when <a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a> wrote: <i><b>I also would argue that "poetry" is a term of high praise when applied to the work of a jobbing singer-songwriter; I suspect there are those (poets, perhaps) who would object to the description of Bill's work as "poetry".

What do you mean by calling Billy Bragg a <i><b>jobbing singer-songwriter</b></i>? Then you added: <i><b>I suspect there are those (poets, perhaps) who would object to the description of Bill's work as "poetry".</b></i> That is outrageous snobbishness in the form of a subjective POV. Billy Bragg <b>IS</b> a poet-songwriter because that is what he is and does for a living: he writes poetry and prose and puts it to music. I don't necessarily agree with the thrust of some of his lyrics (poetry), but I do like him as an artist because I like his presentation. Now that you have stated your own position it would appear that you want to flush Mr. Bragg down the toilet because he is beneath your subjective POV that defines poetry. Many will disagree with you. I don't know why you chose to go off on that tangent. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 00:46, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All the recent back-and-forth in the Controversy section seem over-the-top to me. Is this sardonic comment really worth the page space? Especially when our article seems to be misrepresenting what was actually said, according to the Guardian article. Do we need a string of extreemist webpages as sources? The Guardian is the only reputable source listed. So what if he's caught the attention of a racist website? Who hasn't? It is perfectly reasonable to provide counter-balance and criticisms if an article is in danger of gushing about a figure, but those criticisms need to be reasonable and well-documented ones, not celebrity gossip from partisan rags. I'm afraid this article has become the target of someone with political motives that have little to do with Bragg. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 01:44, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So right-wingers are all neo-nazis? Steady on. But I wonder: do you think Billy should arguably live nearer his roots and in a community more closely reflecting his support for issues around anti-racism and/or anti-facism?

<dd>OK, I'll rephrase - come up with a non-neo-nazi/far rightist who has accused Bragg of being a hypocrite because of where he lives. Even "moderate" right-wingers support the right of people to live where they choose. If someone campaigns say, against poverty, are they hypocrites if they don't live in a poor area?</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'm sure Bragg would be quite amused to see himself attacked by the far-right. He probably would consider that he'd failed if the neo-fascists weren't up in arms against him. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 00:46, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they could campaign more effectively there, yes they would be a hypocrite. And if they made a big fing of their roots in the poor district but didn't live there no more, they would be doubly a hypocrite. Both of those apply to Billy. Also, someone who campaigns against poverty thinks poverty is a BAD thing. Billy thinks multi-culturalism and multi-racialism are v. v. GOOD things, yet he chooses to live in a mono-cultural, mono-racial village where his children are not exposed constantly to other cultures and races. So here's my question again:</dd>

<dd>Guess Condie Rice is also a hypocrite then? What a nonsensical argument. It's possible to support a cause that applies to one area while living in another; you might as well say that anyone who supports, say, ending famine in Africa but who lives in the USA and eats a healthy, balanced diet is a terminal hypocrite. He seems to desire greater social and financial equality between folk of various ethnicities - probably he wishes there was more diversity in the place where he lives. Moving to an inner-city wouldn't make that place more diverse, or society more equal, as he sees it. He is just one person.

<dd>Fine, add Garry Bushell's comment. Everyone knows, as you do, that Bushell's a wanker. And I remember him as a big fan of many extremely dodgy neo-fascist bands in the 80s. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Bushell votes BNP.

<dd>Some might conclude from your repeated failure to answer my simple question that you're on the list too, but I won't embarrass you by asking it again. You're still evading the point by talking about his right to live where he chooses. No-one to my knowledge disputes his right to live in a lovely big house in a 99% white Dorset village. If you know different, add it to the article. <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxonomyyeti_758c.html" title="User:Taxonomyyeti">Taxonomyyeti</a> 14:59, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er, what "list"?</dd>
<dd>I don't know the demographics of the village where he lives. Without knowing, I don't assume that all non-white people live in poor areas. How do you know that his village is 99% white? It might be different if Bragg lived in a closed village where no non-whites were allowed to live. I find it completely normal that someone who's had a bit of success would choose to live in a pleasant country village, there's nothing to stop a succesful non-white person moving there - thankfully, the BNP and their ilk are a tiny minority, always will be, so there's no areas in the UK where non-whites can't live. If most of the people who criticise Bragg got their way, there'd be no non-whites at all in the UK. So to be called a hyprocrite by those low-lifes is something that I guess he can put up with. <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 19:50, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't think he's a hypocrite. Neither do I think he's a saint. He's a succesful musician who's earned some money, moved to the country, as many would love to do, but still remembers his roots. I don't have high jesuitical standards for "rock stars" - I don't expect them to wear hair shirts.</dd>
<dd>But the real point is, what you or I think is not the issue here. The discussion page is for discussing changes to the article. I've stated that mostly the far right calls him a hypocrite. You've added a comment from Garry Bushell. That's fine by me.

<p>Ho Ho! Far from being a Bragg fan, I don't think I could name one of his songs. I came to this article in a round-about way after finding that some "Hitler fan" had been adding links to finalsolution88.com, Redwatch (including addresses and phone numbers of various anti-fascists) and various other far-right web-sites, and had added blatant lies to this article. As for being "embarassed", personally, I'd be embarassed if the only "authorities" I could find to back up my arguments were the BNP and that "wanker" Garry Bushell.

<dd>I see: you indulged in evasion, non sequitur etc because you support Billy's politics, not his music. This further proves your dishonesty in referring to him as a "rock star", because you aren't interested in him as a "rock star", only as a political mouthpiece. As for the BNP, w*nk*r Bushell etc: ask yourself where they would <i>want</i> Billy to live. And the answer is... Exactly where he lives now! How strange.

<dd>Please stop making personal attacks on me, such as "dishonesty". Stick to the contents of the article.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your GB and Independent quotations, having investigated them, I'm not impressed. The GB article contains just your quote - without refering to what Bragg actually said, it's hard to judge if he was "pontificating" or being "hypocritical" - without this, it just comes across as a snide remark.</dd>
<dd>And the Independent (left-wing?) - wow, a <i>musician</i> spends 1000 pounds on a guitar! What's more, a <i>socialist</i> musician!!!! I guess left-wing musicians should build there own instruments? Maybe if it had been 100,000 pounds - but a <i>whole</i> 1000 nicker! BIG DEAL!</dd>
<dd>I can't find the original article (only a repetition of your quotation - though i see you dropped the bit about him having a big nose - wise), so I don't know about the "Coffee Republic" remark - like, does he drink there regularly, or was he spotted there once? And whatever - big wowsy! A socialist drinks a coffee in a multinational shop! Scandalous! Is it possible to live in modern society and not partake of goods produced by multinationals?</dd>
<dd>Braggs most vociferous critics would have all non-whites deported from the UK. The crime of spending 1000 quid on a guitar rather pales into insignificance - that's just my opinion - you'd probably say it's a non-sequitur - but what's that about where tht BNP would want Bragg to live? No, not in a big house in Dorset - they'd have him in a concentration camp...</dd>
<dd>Is it impossible to be left-wing/political and also be a "rock star"? <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 17:17, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In the meantime, however, they want him to live somewhere that makes him look like a hypocrite. Fortunately for them, he does what they want. <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxonomyyeti_758c.html" title="User:Taxonomyyeti">Taxonomyyeti</a> 16:02, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If they made a big fing abaht veir "roots" too, doubly so. <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxonomyyeti_758c.html" title="User:Taxonomyyeti">Taxonomyyeti</a> 09:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A whole one other editor takes issue with you, once, and you call it tag-bragg...</dd>
<dd>The "big fing abaht veir roots" is just caricature, spiteful hyperbole - sounds more like someone out of Eastenders - are you really saying that's how Bragg talks? <a href="../../../c/p/m/User%7ECPMcE_3017.html" title="User:CPMcE"><i>Camillus</i></a> <a href="../../../c/p/m/User_talk%7ECPMcE_6ecc.html" title="User talk:CPMcE">(talk)</a> 17:17, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I remember, he does talk like that. Wevver his children will too I have very serious doubts. It'll be interesting to see where he sends them to school.

<dd>Frankly, this is all non-notable fringe criticism which borders on the absurd. He seems to be a socialist from the article (I have no knowledge of him.) The average income in the UK is around £20k a year before tax, yes? Therefore even if all earned an equal amount of money, all could afford a thousand pound guitar and a nice house in the country if that is what they choose. I know at least one poor student who spent much of their loan on such a guitar - and they don't rely on making music for their income! This criticism lacks merit and is absurd - frankly its arrant nonsense and rank NPOV absurdity. It makes as much sense to criticise someone who campaigns for better flood defences for living on a hill. Surely much of the BNP are hypocrites for detesting multiculturalism yet failing to move to more white-dominated areas or countries.</dd>

<dd>I am certain that he leaves this reputed village occasionally, and has lived in other locations in the past. Perhaps he should have a black person stapled to him, as this would make him less hypocritical? That makes a lot of sense, right?</dd>

<p>Perhaps it should be mentioned that Billy Bragg was mentioned in Rancid's song "The Wars End"?</p>
<p>"Little sammy was a punk rocker you know his mother never understand him went To his room and smashed his billy bragg record didnt want him to hear that Communist lecture you know his mother tried to take him to war sammy now the War is over now were at the wars end now its time for you to leave home"</p>

<dd>In 2001 <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_Frederiksen_and_the_Bastards_b0f2.html" title="Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards">Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards</a>, a American punk band featuring Rancid's guitarist Lars Frederiksen covered Billy's famous "To have and to have not" with slightly altered lyrics. In the chorus of Billy Bragg version the lyrics are "Just because I dress like this, doesn't mean I'm a public menace", where as the Lars Frederiksen version "Just because I dress like this, doesn't mean I'm a communist".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Firstly, I don't believe that "Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards" are important enough to justify the inclusion. And secondly the stuff about the changed lyrics is just nonsense. The "altered" lyrics quoted from the Bastards version are the original lyrics from the version of the song on "Life's a Riot". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavorg_6fe7.html" title="User:Davorg">Davorg</a> 06:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"at the 2006 Glastonbury festival,"</p>
<p>There <i>wasn't</i> a 2006 Glastonbury Festival - it took a year off last year. There was a 2005 one though, and I believe he did play there (although I forgot about it and missed him - d'oh!)</p>

<p>Does anybody mind if I take the flag down? There has been a real proliferation of these on musical articles recently, and reading <a href="../../../f/l/a/WP%7EFLAG_2e4a.html" title="WP:FLAG">WP:FLAG</a> has made me realise just how unnecessary they are. Bragg, as an avowed internationalist, seems a particularly unsuitable candidate for the St George's Cross treatment. No information would be lost, just a reversal of the slight dumbing-down of the article that the flag implies. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:24, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
