<p>The claim that BBN reaches 200 million people does not reflect the truth. About 90% of all stations owned and operated by BBN are low powered and have a very limited range. This is specially true of radio stations overseas, but also a reality in the United States (even in Charlotte, where BBN is headquartered, its presence is negligible). In Latin America there is not a single station that ranks at the top of its market share . Furthermore, many of the outlets are found in unregulated countries where a myriad of stations abound and where finding a BBN station is almost an impossible task. BBN also sabotages its impact by purchasing AM stations, a medium that is unanimously seen by experts as decadent. These undeniable facts translate into very few listeners and invalidate any claim that millions are reached in the Americas. BBN also claims that by streaming into several languages the exposure of its message is amplified. The only three countries where online streaming could be of any impact would be Japan, USA and Germany, where broadband is easily accessible. All the remaining countries where BBN streaming ministry is present, the standard venue is still dial up, which makes it prohibitive for most people to listen to the ministry on a regular basis. The concept of streaming a radio programing is not one that promises success. During the daytime, most businesses and companies frown upon their employees using their broadband to listen to radio stations, be they secular or evangelical. Nightime is usually reserved for family and other endeavors. The percentage of people dropping everything off to sit around the computer to listen to BBN at night(like our grandparents used to do in order to hear president Truman on the radio) is statistically null. The streaming concept is a very shrewd marketing tool but a poor and unwise use of donated funds. BBN depends on the generosity of its listeners. This is a theme focused ad naseum during Shareatons and spots encouraging people to contribute. This concept, however, is obliterated once you consider how the ministry deals with its employees. This is specially true when employees decide to leave the ministry or are laid off. Severance pay is never considered and ex employees are forced to come to the realization that most secular companies will treat you in a more Christlike manner than the Bible Broadcasting Network.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>What is original research?</i></dd>
<dd><i>Original research is a term used on Wikipedia to refer to material added to articles by Wikipedia editors that has not been published already by a reputable source. In this context it means unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, and ideas; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation".</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also we need to try to write this as an enclyclopedia article. That's why I moved this section to the talk page back in Dec. The points made in this section need to be backed up by a published, reputable source.</dd>

I agree. The large majority of the section in question is not written from a neutral viewpoint and is not verifiable. I am going to go ahead and chop out a lot of it, and leave some basic parts that we can continue to debate about. <a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 04:37, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:That'sthewayitis is at it again. He has gone and placed the same preachy and biased paragraph right back into the article. He didn't even bother to modify it so as not to repeat information that was left in above. What's the next step in preventing this from continuing? Do we need to get a lock on the page or have his user banned?

<p>There has been an ongoing problem with That'sthewayitis adding "The Scoop" to the main BBN page for awhile now. If you go to <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThat%27sthewayitis_29f1.html" title="User talk:That'sthewayitis">User talk:That'sthewayitis</a> you can see where he tried to give citations for his work. but it's just <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. He seems to be unaware what <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> is all about. He mentions there that he worked at BBN for 10 years. It appears he has an axe to grind with Lowell Davey! There has been a Rfc for a week or so at the [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Religion and philosophy ]] It looks like the next step according to the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Resolving disputes</a> page is putting a request in with the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a> for help.

<p>Greetings everyone, a request for mediation was recently followed and I am the mediator who's taken this case. I'll send messages to all of your talk pages so we can get all of your input as soon as possible. I know an initial statement of the disagreement has already been made <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-02-21_Bible_Broadcasting_Network_b1de.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-02-21 Bible Broadcasting Network">here</a> but I'd like to hear what the rest of you have to say regarding this. So, now is a good time for opening statements to get me up to speed with what you think is going on. Ohh, and as always, please keep <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> in mind.

<dd>Thanks for the mediation <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a>. I think this a pretty straightforward POV dispute. The section called "The Scoop" has been placed on the main article page several times by the editor User:That'sthewayitis. It is POV and stems from his personal experience at BBN during a 10 year time span. He needs to acknowledge and abide by Wikipedias <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> guidelines. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMytwocents_13d6.html" title="User:Mytwocents">Mytwocents</a> 06:54, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alrighty, I shall await his input on the matter then. I see the last time he edited the page was four days ago; is he perhaps done on this issue? --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">Cyde Weys</font></a> 07:34, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, I just stopped by from the template and now it appears that maybe I shouldn't have stuck my nose in, but I'll reprint here why I stuck the noncompliance tag in: These paragraphs are not encyclopedic as written. Do you have any ways to cite what BBN feel their mission is, and whether their listeners agree with this assesment? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>â˜…</sup></a> 17:08, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and PS: pardon my stupidity, but where on the BBN website can we find confirmation of what this page says? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>â˜…</sup></a> 17:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a soapbox.

<p>A talk page is research for the article, and the policies that apply to articles also apply to talk pages.
