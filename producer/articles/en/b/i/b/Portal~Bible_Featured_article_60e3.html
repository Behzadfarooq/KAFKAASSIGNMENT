<p><i><b>Torah</b></i> (<span class="Unicode">תּוֹרָה</span>) is a <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> word meaning "<a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaching.html" title="Teaching">teaching</a>," "<a href="../../../i/n/s/Instruction.html" title="Instruction">instruction</a>," or "<a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>". It refers primarily to the <b>Five Books of Moses</b>, also known as the <b>Law of Moses</b> (<i>Torat Moshe</i> תּוֹרַת־מֹשֶׁה) or the <b><a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentateuch.html" title="Pentateuch">Pentateuch</a></b> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> for "five containers," which refers to the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scroll.html" title="Scroll">scroll</a> cases in which books were being kept). Other names include <i>Hamisha Humshei Torah</i> (חמשה חומשי תורה, "[the] five fifths/parts [of the] Torah") or simply the <i><a href="../../../h/u/m/Humash.html" title="Humash">Humash</a></i> (חומש "fifth"). A <a href="../../../s/e/f/Sefer_Torah_b441.html" title="Sefer Torah">Sefer Torah</a> is a formal written scroll of the five books, written by a Torah <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scribe.html" title="Scribe">scribe</a> under exceptionally strict requirements. The term is sometimes also used in the general sense to also include both <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>'s written law and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_law.html#Oral_law_in_Judaism" title="Oral law">oral law</a>, encompassing the entire spectrum of authoritative <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> religious teachings throughout history, including the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>, the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrash</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The Torah is the first five books of the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, and of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. The five books, their names and pronunciations in the original Hebrew, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> (בראשית, <i>Bereshit</i>: "In the beginning...")</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> (שמות, <i>Shemot</i>: "Names")</li>

<li><a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuteronomy.html" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> (דברים, <i>Devarim</i>: "Words", or "Discourses")</li>
</ul>
<p>(The Hebrew names are taken from initial words within the first verse of each book. See, for example, <a href="../../../1/_/_/Genesis_1%7E1.html" title="Genesis 1:1">Genesis 1:1</a>.)</p>
<p>Written in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>, the oldest Jewish language, the Torah is the central and most important document of Judaism revered by Jews through the ages, and very important to Christians. It is traditionally accepted as the literal word of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_God_in_Judaism_474b.html" title="Names of God in Judaism">God</a> as told to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>. For many, it is neither exactly history, nor theology, nor legal and ritual guide, but something beyond all three. It is the primary guide to the relationship between God and man, and the whole meaning and purpose of that relationship, a living document that unfolds over generations and millennia.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, <b><a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a></b> was a massive <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat.html" title="Boat">vessel</a> built at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monotheism.html" title="Monotheism">God</a>'s command to save <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a>, his family, and a core stock of the world's animals from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Flood_9076.html" title="Great Flood">Great Flood</a>.

According to one school of modern textual criticism — the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_hypothesis.html" title="Documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a> — the Ark story told in Genesis is based on two originally quasi-independent sources, and did not reach its present form until the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century_BC_f46f.html" title="5th century BC">5th century BC</a>. Nevertheless, many <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Jews_cec6.html" title="Orthodox Jews">Orthodox Jews</a> and traditional <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> reject this analysis, holding that the Ark story is true, and that any perceived inadequacies can be rationally explained.

This is asserted in the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Gospels_5bc3.html" title="Synoptic Gospels">Synoptic Gospels</a>, the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Writings</a>. He is also commonly referred to as <b>John the Forerunner/Precursor</b> because Christians (but not Mandaeans) consider him as the forerunner of Christ. In <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandaic.html" title="Mandaic">Mandaic</a> he is called <i>Yihja jahane</i>. The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> provides the sole account of his infancy. According to Luke, John the Baptist was the son of <a href="../../../z/e/c/Zecharia.html" title="Zecharia">Zecharia</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_%28biblical_person%29.html" title="Elisabeth (biblical person)">Elisabeth</a>; his birth, name, and office, were foretold by the angel <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel.html" title="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> to Zecharia, while Zecharia was performing his functions as a priest in the temple of Jerusalem. Zecharia was a priest of the course of Abijah, and his wife, Elisabeth, was of the <a href="../../../d/a/u/Daughters_of_Aaron_5804.html" title="Daughters of Aaron">Daughters of Aaron</a>; consequently John automatically held the priesthood of Aaron, which, to the Jews' eyes, gave him authority to baptize in the name of God. Luke states that John was born about six months before Jesus, and that Zecharia's unbelief over the birth of his son led to him losing his power of speech, which was only restored on the occasion of John's circumcision. According to the Canonical Gospels, John the Baptist's public ministry was suddenly brought to a close, probably about six months after he had baptized Jesus. According to these Gospel narratives, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_Antipas_f79b.html" title="Herod Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> jailed him, with the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> arguing that Herod was punishing John for condemning Herod's marriage to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herodias.html" title="Herodias">Herodias</a>, the former wife of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_Philip_56b4.html" title="Herod Philip">Herod Philip</a>, Herod's own brother. The narrative states that although Herod himself respected John's authority and the clout of his following, to the extent that he would do John no further harm, Herod's bloodthirsty wife had other ideas, and persuaded her daughter, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salome.html" title="Salome">Salome</a>, to trick Herod. At a party for Herod, Salome danced so beautifully that, according to the Canonical Gospels, Herod foolishly offered her anything she requested. She asked for John's head on a silver platter, and so John was <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decapitation.html" title="Decapitation">beheaded</a>. His disciples, after consigning his headless body to the grave, told Jesus all that had occurred.</p>

We have observed the rising of his star, and we have come to pay him homage." Herod is disturbed by the magi's words and questions them closely, attempting to determine when the child was born. The king asks his advisors where the messiah is supposed to be born. They answer Bethlehem, which had been the birthplace of King <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a>, and quote from the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Micah_76bd.html" title="Book of Micah">Book of Micah</a>.

<p>The <b><a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Standard_Version_3dd6.html" title="Revised Standard Version">Revised Standard Version</a> (RSV)</b> is an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_translation.html" title="Bible translation">translation</a> of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> that was popular in the mid-20th century. The RSV is a comprehensive revision of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a> of 1611, the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Revised_Version_4fc3.html" title="English Revised Version">English Revised Version</a> of 1881-1885, and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Standard_Version_d556.html" title="American Standard Version">American Standard Version</a> of 1901, with the ASV text being the most consulted. It sought not only to clearly bring the Bible to the English-speaking church, but to "preserve all that is best in the English Bible as it has been known and used through the centuries." The copyright to the ASV was acquired by the International Council of Religious Education in 1928, and this Council renewed the ASV copyright the next year. In 1935, a two-year study began to decide the question of a new revision, and in 1937, it was decided that a revision would be done and a panel of 32 scholars was put together for that task. The New Testament was released in 1946, and the Old Testament in 1952. The RSV New Testament was well received, but reaction to the Old Testament was different. Many accepted it as well, but many also denounced it. Minor modifications to the RSV text were authorized in 1959 and completed in 1962. In 1971, the RSV Bible was rereleased with the Second Edition of the Translation of the New Testament. In 1989, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Council_of_Churches_120c.html" title="National Council of Churches">National Council of Churches</a> released a full-scale revision to the RSV called the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Revised_Standard_Version_bdd6.html" title="New Revised Standard Version">New Revised Standard Version</a></i>. There have been many adaptations of the RSV over the years. 2002 marked the 50th anniversary of the 1952 edition of the RSV. To mark this event, Oxford University Press issued a special edition of the RSV.</p>

<p>The role of <b><a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_in_the_Bible_d6d4.html" title="Salt in the Bible">Salt in the Bible</a></b> is relevant to understanding Hebrew society during the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> periods. Salt is a necessity of life and was a mineral that was used in Biblical times as a seasoning, a preservative, a disinfectant, a component of ceremonial offerings, and as a unit of exchange. The Bible contains numerous references to salt. In various contexts, it is used metaphorically to signify permanence, loyalty, durability, fidelity, usefulness, value, and purification.</p>
<p><b>Salt in the Old Testament:</b> The Hebrew people harvested salt by pouring sea water into pits and letting the water evaporate until only salt was left.

He may be exhorting them to usefulness, or to fidelity, or referring to their role in purifying the world. In Roman times, salt was an important item of trade and was even used as money. Roman soldiers received part of their pay in salt. "Salt of the Earth" may, in this context, refer to the listeners' value. The reference to Jesus' followers being "salted with fire" in Mark 9:49 may refer, in part, to the purifying effect of salt in Jewish liturgical use. In <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Colossians_39f2.html" title="Epistle to the Colossians">Colossians</a> 4:6, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul</a> exhorts, "Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you know how you should respond to each one."</p>

<p><b><a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a></b> is a legendary <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrews.html" title="Hebrews">Hebrew</a> liberator, leader, lawgiver, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a>, and historian. Moses is one of the greatest figures in Biblical history. According to the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Exodus_bed1.html" title="Book of Exodus">Book of Exodus</a> in the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Hebrew Bible</a>, Moses was a son of <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amram.html" title="Amram">Amram</a> and his wife, <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jochebed.html" title="Jochebed">Jochebed</a>, a <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levite.html" title="Levite">Levite</a>. Moses led the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israelites.html" title="Israelites">Israelites</a> out of slavery in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and into the desert, and received the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> from <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> on <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Mount_Sinai_73d2.html" title="Biblical Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a>. In the Exodus account, the birth of Moses occurred at a time when the current Egyptian Pharaoh had commanded that all male children born to Hebrew slaves should be killed. Jochebed kept him concealed for three months. When she could keep him hidden no longer, she set him adrift on the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a> river in a small craft of bulrushes coated in pitch. The <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bithiah.html" title="Bithiah">daughter of Pharaoh</a> discovered the baby and adopted him as her son. After Moses had reached adulthood, he went to see how his brethren who were enslaved to the Egyptians were faring. Seeing an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. Moses soon discovered that the affair was known, and that Pharaoh was likely to put him to death; he therefore escaped to the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinai_peninsula.html" title="Sinai peninsula">Sinai peninsula</a> and settled with Jethro, priest of Midian, whose daughter <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipporah.html" title="Zipporah">Zipporah</a> he in due time married. One day, as Moses led his flock to <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Horeb_5eec.html" title="Mount Horeb">Mount Horeb</a>, he saw a <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_bush.html" title="Burning bush">burning bush</a> that would not be consumed. When he turned aside to look more closely at the marvel, God spoke to him from the bush revealing his name to Moses. God also commissioned him to go to Egypt and deliver his fellow Hebrews from their bondage. He then returned to Egypt. Moses was met on his arrival in Egypt by his elder brother, Aaron, and gained a hearing with his oppressed brethren. It was a more difficult matter, however, to persuade Pharaoh to let the Hebrews depart. This was not accomplished until God sent <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_plagues.html" title="Ten plagues">ten plagues</a> upon the Egyptians. These plagues culminated in the slaying of the Egyptian first-borns whereupon such terror seized the Egyptians that they ordered the Hebrews to leave. <b><a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Read more...</a></b><br clear="all" /></p>

<p><b><a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_%28Biblical_figure%29_65cb.html" title="Job (Biblical figure)">Job</a></b> is a figure in the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, his story concentrated in the book bearing his name. He was "blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil".</p>
<p>In an assembly of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels.html" title="Angels">angels</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> asserts that Job does not really love God, but fears God for blessing. To show that this is not so, God tests Job by giving Satan power over his property and family. Four different tragedies strike his household. His house is destroyed, his sons and daughters and most of his servants are killed, and all of his animals are stolen. Job responds by saying, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."</p>
<p>Job maintains his righteousness despite his loss, but Satan is still unsatisfied. Therefore, he receives permission to afflict Job's person, though he cannot take his life. So, Job becomes diseased with painful sores. His wife incites him to "curse God, and die" but Job answers "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?"</p>
<p>Job's friends accuse him of having sinned in some way to explain his punishment, urging him to repent, but Job argues that God sometimes tries those He loves, to allow them to grow spiritually, or for some reason unknown to mankind.</p>
<p>God appears in a cloud and decides in favour of Job, but He did not approve of the harsh words Job used in his suffering. Job humbly acknowledges his fault and asks forgiveness. God restores Job to good health, gives him double the riches he had previously possessed, blesses him with a beautiful and numerous family, and crowns a holy life with a happy death. Job lived 140 years after his time of trial, 248 years in all, long enough even to see his great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Job is also mentioned in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Book of Ezekiel</a>, along with <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel.html" title="Daniel">Daniel</a>, as among the most righteous men to emphasize the intensity of Jerusalem's sin.</p>

<p>The <b>ethic of reciprocity</b> (or the <b>Golden Rule</b>) is a general <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">moral</a> principle found in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> and virtually all <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religions.html" title="Religions">religions</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">cultures</a>, often as a fundamental rule. In Western culture, it is most commonly rendered by the active formulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Love your neighbor as yourself</b>" as given by <b><a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a></b> in the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=%20Leviticus%2019:18&amp;version=31" class="external text" title="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=%20Leviticus%2019:18&amp;version=31" rel="nofollow">(Leviticus 19:18)</a> and affirmed by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=%20Luke%2010:27&amp;version=31" class="external text" title="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=%20Luke%2010:27&amp;version=31" rel="nofollow">Luke 10:27</a> etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Do to others as you would have them do to you.</b>" as given by <b><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a></b> in the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a>, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=%20Luke%206:31&amp;version=31;Matthew%207:12&amp;version=31;" class="external text" title="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=%20Luke%206:31&amp;version=31;Matthew%207:12&amp;version=31;" rel="nofollow">Luke 6:13, Matt7:12</a> popularly rephrased as:</li>
<li>"<b>Treat others as you want to be treated</b>".</li>
<li>"<b>Do ut des</b>" Latin motto meaning I give that you may give.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most other formulations are passive/negative. e.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>"<b>What you do not want others to do to you, do not do to others.</b>" - Chinese sage <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucius.html" title="Confucius">Confucius</a></li>
<li>"<b>What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man.</b>" - Jewish sage <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_the_Elder_502d.html" title="Hillel the Elder">Hillel</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This traditional guiding rule was (and is) so highly valued that it has for centuries been known in English as the "Golden Rule".</li>
</ul>
<p>Its universality suggests it is related to innate aspects of human nature (see <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altruism.html" title="Altruism">altruism</a>).</p>
<p>Others hold that the Golden Rule or ethics of reciprocity may replace all other moral principles or at least that it is superior to them. The golden rule <b>does</b> provide one with moral coherence -- it is a consistency principle. One's actions are to be consistent with mutual love and respect to other fellow humans. Arising as it does in nearly all written-language cultures on the Earth, the ethic of reciprocity is a tool that differing cultures can readily use in handling <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict.html" title="Conflict">conflicts</a>. Given the modern global trend of political, social, and economic integration (see <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalisation.html" title="Globalisation">globalisation</a>), the ethical Golden Rule may be becoming even more relevant and important than ever.</p>

<p>The <b>Binding of Isaac</b>, in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 22, is a story from the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> in which God asks <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> to sacrifice his son <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac.html" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> on <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moriah.html" title="Moriah">Mount Moriah</a>. To many readers the tale is one of the most challenging, complex, mystifying, and perhaps ethically troublesome episodes in the entire Bible. The story is referred to as the <i>Akedah</i> or <i>Akedat Yitschak</i> (עקידת יצחק) in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> (the binding of Isaac) and as the <i>Dhabih</i> in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>.</p>
<p>Abraham agrees to God's command without argument, even though God gives him no reason for the sacrifice (called an <i>Olah</i> in Hebrew -- for the significance of sacrifices, especially in Biblical times, see the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korbanot.html" title="Korbanot">korbanot</a>). The text of the story says that God wishes to test Abraham, which indicates that he does not intend for Abraham to actually sacrifice his son. Indeed, after Isaac is bound to an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altar</a>, an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel.html" title="Angel">angel</a> stops Abraham at the last minute, at which point Abraham discovers a <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ram_%28sheep%29.html" title="Ram (sheep)">ram</a> caught in some nearby bushes. Abraham then sacrifices the ram in Isaac's stead.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>, Isaac is twenty-five years old at the time of the sacrifice, while the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmudic</a> sages teach that Isaac is thirty-seven. In either case, Isaac is a fully grown man, strong enough to prevent the elderly Abraham (who is 125 or 137 years old) from tying him up had he wanted to resist.</p>

<p>The <b>Bible</b> (Hebrew תנ״ך tanakh, Greek η Βίβλος [hē biblos] ) (sometimes The Holy Bible, The Book, Good Book, Word of God, The Word Scripture, Scripture), from Greek (τα) βίβλια, (ta) biblia, "(the) books", is the classical name for the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> Bible of Judaism or the combination of the Old Testament and New Testament of Christianity. Many Christian English speakers refer to the Bible as "the good book" (Gospel means "good news"). Most sects of Christianity and Judaism regard the Bible as the revealed word of God in some sense, or an authoritative record of the relationship between God, the world and mankind, or some combination of the two. Differences about what those terms mean, and even how precisely to express the idea, are some of the most important distinctions among sects.</p>
<p>Both Bibles have been the most widely distributed of books. They have been translated more times and into more languages (more than 2,100 languages) than any other book. It is said that more than five billion copies of the Bible have been sold since 1815, making it the best-selling book of all-time.</p>
<p>Because of Christian domination of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> from the late Roman era to the Age of Enlightenment, the Bible has influenced not only religion but language, law and, until the modern era, the natural philosophy of mainstream Western Civilization. The Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution in Europe and America brought skepticism regarding the divine origin and historical accuracy of the Bible. Although some critical scholars, including archeologists, continue to use the Bible as a point of reference in the study of ancient Near Eastern history, most have come to view it as a cultural and literary document.</p>
