<p>I'm no fan of G.W. Bush at all, but I don't think he belongs in this particular entry, any more than Bill Clinton or Martin Luther King or other faith-espousing leaders who come these states. (Besides, Bush like his dad was raised in Connecticut more than Texas) Bush's self-serving religiosity is a topic for his biography article, or perhaps the article on Protestant fundamentalism, but not in a geographic, semi-dictionary entry, I think. So I'm going to remove it again - and not call it "minor" this time, sorry about that. What do you think? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidWBrooks_491e.html" title="User:DavidWBrooks">DavidWBrooks</a> 14:05, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Bush lived in Texas from the age of 3. I agree that there's no particular purpose in including him here, though.</dd>

<dd>I believe that was his official residency. He spent most of his time in New England I'm assuming, due to his Maryland DWI.</dd>

<p>I spent the most significant amount of my life in the midst of the bible belt and have spent a bulk of my time out of the belt studying the influence and perception of the religious south in the rest of the country. I think I would have to disagree with your assertion about excluding southern politicians from an understanding of the bible belt. The term "bible belt" is not a geographical distinction but a cultural one. The way G. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, MLK Jr., Jimmy Carter and many other politicians have used evangelical religion to shape their message and administrations is very much a part of the landscape of the south. Religion in the south is highly political and thus so are southerners. The interplay between religion and political figures is integral in the cultural identity of the region.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following is included June 2005 for the use of further editors:</p>
<p><i>The term Bible Belt is used mainly, but not uniquely, by detractors of or negative commentators about a people or region that is said to be very religious, perhaps too religious. The term is not strictly regional, like <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flyover_country.html" title="Flyover country">flyover country</a> or the less negative <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heartland.html" title="Heartland">heartland</a>, but is often used to describe the middle of the country in a way that diminishes that region. Politically, the term is often a shorthand to describe <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_conservatives.html" title="Cultural conservatives">cultural conservatives</a> whose beliefs in part stem from the Christian Bible.</i></p>
<p><i>Some facts contradict, color or challenge the current use of the term:</i></p>
<p><i>1. The South is currently majority Baptist, with a significant amount of African-American adherents.</i></p>
<p><i>2. The Coastal Southeast to Florida has a low religious attendance among Protestant adherents, like the industrial Midwest. Protestant attendance is highest in a "Bible Strip" in from Texas through the Plains to the Dakotas.</i></p>
<p><i>3. Religious attendance is highest among Catholics, who often attend mass daily, and geographically, Christian attendance is highest on the Coasts, which are majority Catholic, and along the sunbelt, in cities like Boston, New York, Miami, and Los Angeles.</i></p>
<p><i>4. The biggest change in 50 years in religious attendance is the significant drop in Protestant attendance in the industrial midwest and the Northeast. Because the Midwest is majority Protestant, there is still a significant number of active Protestant adherents attending church in the region. Because the Northeast (or West Coast) is majority Catholic, the diminished number of Protestants attending church has left the bicoastal regions without the large Protestant churches. This reduction in Protestant churches, relative to the rest of the country especially the South, has created an anomolous situation whereby the center of gravity of American Protestantism has moved to the middle and south, policitically and culturally cleaving these regions.</i></p>
<p><i>5. Finally, because Protestants put a bigger emphasis on personal Bible instruction away from any Priestly class, it might be said that Protestantism is more associated with the term Bible Belt or the nasty, "Bible Thumpers", than is Catholicism. If attendance were the key context for this term, then in truth, the "Church Buckles" of Boston, New York, Miami, and LA would be America's centers of religious adherants and attendance. But since the term is used to describe a religious people with a strong association with bible literalism, with a deep connection to the South and rural plains, and with social and political beliefs that agnostics negatively compare to provincialism and anti-intellectualism, its use is widespread. In reaction or revenge, the more rabid citizens of the Bible belt have developed negative stereotypes of the coasts and urban areas, which they wrongly describe as godless, decadent, or centers of criminality. In truth, the two coasts are just as religious (because of their majority Catholic population) and quite wealthy and civil.</i></p>

<dd>This new section (apparently anonymous) is certainly very valuable and thought provoking. However, it seems to need a certain amount of editing to ensure compliance with Wikistyle and NPOV. I'll try to work on it when I can. However, some seems a little ambiguous/indecipherable.

<dd>I agree. The section needs cleaning up and wikifying.

<dd>Also, regarding Catholicism in the US...only a tiny, tiny minority of Catholics attends daily Mass, so much so that even without statistics easily accesible (for me), I am willing to wager that the number is so small that it (as an independent factor) does not have a notable impact on cross-denominational statistics (sadly so IMHO). ~ <a href="../../../d/p/r/User%7EDpr_d663.html" title="User:Dpr">Dpr</a> 02:04, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am disturbed by the rather uncharitable assessment of an entire demographic that I am seeing here. The notion that adhering to a literal interpretation of Scripture is "uncritical" or in any other way negative presents not only an unfair stereotype, but also a personal bias on the part of the authors.</p>

<p>It seems some Canadians have such a low self-esteem that they want to see the word "Canada" mentioned in every article possible. It seems for example that some people refer to any rural farming area in Canada as a "bible belt". I have spent time in the south of the USA and I have lived in rural Ontario, and I can honestly say, how in the world is rural southern Ontario inlcuded in this? Is this the work of a Torontonian who thinks anyone who does not live in Toronto is a hick&#160;? The only people who objected to the teaching of evolution when i was going to school were a couple of jehova witness's. There is no bible belt there. For a bible belt go to the south of the USA. What about germany's bible belt in Bavaria, what about Pennsylvania's bible belt? What about California's bible belt and what about New england's bible belt and Slovakia's. We could start finding bible belts in lots of areas if we are gonna count rural southern ontario. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 20:39, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take a drive through many of the smaller communities. You'd be amazed once you get an hour outside of Toronto (which is anything but a bible belt)...also many of those areas in the states mentioned would qualify as mini-Bible Belts themselves... <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyC83_1bc7.html" title="User:CrazyC83">CrazyC83</a> 02:28, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. The Bible Belt is a term that specifically refers to a certain area in the USA. Although some areas of California for example may have higher rates of church attendance, it is not what one refers to when one says the "bible belt". As for rural Ontario, I am not so sure what I would see one hour out of Toronto. There is Collingwood, Orangeville, even a town like Wingham, etc...they are not Bible belts. They are rural yes, culturally diverse, not really, are there churches yes, do they have a higher percentage of religious people than Toronto, I doubt it, and the churches that are there, if one would go in them on sunday, you will be surprised that you will probably see mostly old people. Go to Georgia - and these rural ontarians will have as much culture shock as any torontonian. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 04:34, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anyway, compared to a "post-modern" city like Quebec City, Toronto <b>is</b> a bible belt (there are some mega-churches in Toronto, this does not exist in Montréal or Québec City), if one wants to define a bible belt by using post-quiet revolution Quebec as a barometer (instead of Toronto) for example. Anyway, I think we must stick to the traditional definition for these reasons, otherwise what is or is not a bible belt is very relative. Stettlerj.</dd>

<p>I have added a section on the UK to the list of other countries. It might be sensible for someone to reformat this entire article to provide a better structure for non-USA bible belts. My entry is based on personal memory of recent writings in the UK Christian press that have labelled both the areas specified as bible belts, supported by my own knowledge of UK christian demography. As such, I am sure that what I have written is accurate and authoritative. I cannot provide any hard references at this time, but also note a lack of references for other non-USA bible belts. DaveDave 14:45, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've lived in the UK all my life and never once heard of any areas in it being described as a bible belt (I even live in Brighton which would fall into the second category). In a yougov poll on 44% of English citizens believe in God (and not all of those are Christian). I think referring to any part of the UK as a bible belt is misleading. Speedything 10:24, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I appreciate your point. I have reworded the caveat I included to make it clearer that these areas do not fit the strict definition of Bible Belt, so this should reduce the scope for confusion. However, I do feel that their inclusion here is worthwhile.'</p>

<p>Mt Roskill might have more churches per capita than anywhere else (though I can't find any source for that...) but I have to say it is a stretch to call it NZ's bible belt when we have more muslims than any where else. Not sure how this discussion bit works but thats my two cents.</p>

<p>Ok, this definitition of the Bible Belt refers to areas where right-wing evangelical protestantism is the norm. Louisiana is 60% Catholic! Not just the area around New Orleans, but at least the majority of the state probably within 50-100 miles of the Arkansas border. Aside from that, some areas have a substantial Jewish population that also detracts from the uber-protestants.</p>
<p>Louisiana defenitely needs to be taken off this list. We share neither the religious affiliations nor the need to legislate faulty morality that is inherent in the true Bible Belt.</p>
<p>I suppose you could classify it as I was told it is referred to by some states in the Bible Belt as the 'Bible Crotch' -- that sometimes naughty area just below the bible belt. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.187.106.1_7c58.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.187.106.1">80.187.106.1</a> (talk) 19:59, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Tall Tales of The Bible Belt</p>
<p>Another edition of "Tall Tales of The Bible Belt" has been released. This one's the 29th edition and contains a good baker's dozen tales devoted to a variety of subjects. Chief among them the child evangelist Billy Bible who at the age of seven had saved three thousand souls, the many farmers who grew vegetables big as houses, so they rented them out. And we rejoiced at learning about a talking rabbit who travels the Appalachian Trail preaching the gospel in small country churches, possums who read your fortune, singing bears, the ghost of Elvis Presley attending Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting, Bibles giving birth to children and rabbits, an assortment of lamb's tales, cow's tales, pig tales. Farm animals possessed of gifts to spread the gospel.</p>
<p><br />
The Evangelical Spectator particularly enjoyed the one about the church offering plate that floated around the sanctuary of the First Methodist church in Blountville, Tennessee. The offering plate would hover above the congregation and dip to allow tithing. The plate would spin after each contribution and whisper its gratitude. As well, we enjoyed the splendid episodes about the Devil. The Devil Bakes A Cake, The Devil and His Chain of Barbecue Rib Restaurants, and The Devil Sings On The Radio.</p>

<p>This section needs some citations soon or else should be deleted. At present it is at best misleading and at worst complete rubbish. A bible belt suggests to most people an area where the overwhelming majority of the population are Christian Evangelical Protestants. I can't speak for all countries on the list but I can say that this definition doesn't apply to a single area of England. If this list is unverifiable it should be deleted. I leave this open to discussion for now but unless someone can provide a good reason for its inclusion I'll propose to delete it. Speedything 12:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's been a week now and there's been no response so I'm gonna guess it's probably ok to remove this section. I won't do it just yet but in another week I'll remove unless someone says otherewise Speedything 11:08, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since when are Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Ohio part of the Bible Belt? In addition to the fact that all three are Northern states, Maryland is furthermore one of the most liberal states in the country and Pennsylvania has voted Democratic since 1992. This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Indiana isn't in the bible belt either.</p>

<p>Living in small town Oklahoma, the term Bible Belt comes up very very often. I personally have only heard Bible Belt used as a strictly informal term in the vein of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tornado_Alley_d5da.html" title="Tornado Alley">Tornado Alley</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_Belt_116c.html" title="Corn Belt">Corn Belt</a>, and never as an empirical list of states or regions, or an otherwise formally designated area. I have modified the article's tone in the first few paragraphs to reflect this somewhat.</p>
<p>If the term Bible Belt has no verifiable boundaries, I don't see how there can be a rigidly defined list of states, or, even more humorously, a list that purports to know partially bounded states. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantosh_fa6c.html" title="User:Bantosh">Bantosh</a> 21:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bible Belt is as well defined as any term in social science and has been widely accepted by scholars. It is much more than an informal local term. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
