<p>The article claims that "most" scholars regect the story of the magi as fictitious, with no citations or proof given. When I tried to correct this by deleting the unsupported assertions, and clarifying that it is those who reject traditional Christian belief who deny their historicity, the changes were immediately edited out by a regular at Wikipedia...this is SOP here, as evidenced in so many articles. You don't have to support your claims, as long as your statements subvert Christian belief or the moral order of society. Sad.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please read any of the numerous references given at the end of this article. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 02:09, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I just did...no specific citation is given for these broad claims, such as the supposed majority of scholars who reject the historicity of the magi. Normally, statements of this type are quite simply unsupportable; one would have to do a global poll of "scholars" after giving some reasonable definition of whom would qualify as such (scripture scholars alone, or historians? If historians would be included, would they have to specialize in the time period in question?). The mere assertion that "most scholars" believe this or that is worthless, even if there is an academic source for the assertion, unless the methodology behind the claim is given. However, in this case there is no clear academic source -- merely a bibliography at the end of the article.</p>
<p>The bias is even more clear, given the fact that no counter-arguments to this claim are given, although the supposed neutrality policy would require it.</p>

<dd>So we can not capitalise pronouns referring to my God and the one I belief? The bible capitalises the nouns referring to Jesus Christ, in my opinion they should be capitalised here too, as a sign of respect to our beliefs.</dd>
<dd>Note: I would not feel offended if you capitalised nouns referring to other God's that I don't belief in, and I would understand this sign of respect to wards other people. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyC_8907.html" title="User:PaddyC">Paddy</a> 19:20, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And what about people who don't believe in any gods? It is in general a box of worms. What about Satan? Surely, His pronouns would need to be capitalized. Some Pastafarians have said that any pronoun reference to Spaghetti or any of Its forms should be capitalized. Should Wikipedia toss in some caps for that too?

<p>The Zoroastrianism connection is a common speculation in regards to the Magi. Though this article presents it as fact, it is only a speculation. The author of this text only presents the onesides argument of it referring to Zurvanism. However their are strong arguments for the Magi to be located from other groups and location.

<p>"This is likely linked to Old Testament prophesies that have the messiah being worshipped by kings." I moved this here: if there is a relevant O.T. prophecy, it should be noted explicitly, along with the the unexpected circumstance that the author of Matthew, whose narrative is constructed to link one OT "prophecy" concerning the messiah with another, missed such a rich opportunity, if the visitors were indeed expected to be kings. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 20:33, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to Brown's <i>The Birth of the Messiah</i> the verses commonly mentioned as being linked are Isaiah 60:3, Psalm 72:10, and Psalm 68:29. The issue of why Matthew adds so few OT references to the Magi story is one that is discussed among scholars. The main focus of this debate is on Numbers 24:17, which pretty clearly predicts a star but is also unquoted by Matthew. One view, supported by Schweizer, is that the author of Matthew never adapted the narrative to fit OT quotations, rather he adapted the quotations to fit his narrative. Matthew would have been more likely to make up a quotation that referred to magi than turn the people he believed were magi into kings. Brown feels that OT references were left out because the author of Matthew himself felt the story was somewhat incredible and doubted the accuracy of his material. C.S. Mann believes that Matthew did not want to associate astrology with the word of God.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The statement that "alternate traditions have as little as two and as many as twelve visiting Jesus" also comes straight from Brown, though he does not mention which traditions. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 21:13, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hope you'll agree it was right to remove the statement: If the author of Matthew's intention was that the verses in Isaiah and Psalms should have been recognized by hearers of his narrative, then state so. Matthew's narrative is a string of fulfilled prophecies; scholars' discussion how this has come about might be summarized in a subsection. If the issue of why Matthew adds no explicit references to the Magi story is one that is discussed among scholars, a summary of the discussion is encyclopediable. If Brown's <i>The Birth of the Messiah</i> is a reference that comes up in Discussion, why not enter it among References or Sources or Further reading? Indeed the "Star prophecy" of <i>Numbers</i> 24:17 was not mentioned in Greek <i>Matthew</i>: can you see any <i>political</i> reason why it might not have been wise to make it explicit? --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 22:05, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No I don't think it was right to remove the statement, but it seems to have been unclear. No one I have read believes that Matthew was indirectly referencing Psalms and Isaiah. The idea that the magi were kings only arose sometime after the Gospel was written. There is no evidence that the author of Matthew thought that the magi were kings. The sentence does not mean that "Isaiah and Psalms should have been recognized by hearers of his narrative" as the author of Matthew did not see any links to the OT as he did not consider the magi to be kings. It means that later readers, who were perhaps less familiar with what the word magi meant and were more willing to abandon realism, made the magi into kings to fit with the OT. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:26, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>SimonP has also returned to the article two fragments of fluff that he seems to admire: <i>This is likley linked to Old Testament prophesies that have the messiah being worshipped by kings in <a href="../../../3/_/_/Isaiah_60%7E3.html" title="Isaiah 60:3">Isaiah 60:3</a>, Psalm 72:10, and Psalm 68:29. Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the magi to kings.</i> "Likely linked" by SimonP apparently, but not by the author of <i>Matthew</i> it would seem, as he has stated already. Who is saying this link is "likely"? "Early readers" is the intellectual equivalent of "some", so often a disguise for ignorance or laziness, is it not? If the author of <i>Matthew</i> was not referencing Psalms and Isaiah, then Simon P's instancing of them is irrelevant. In addition, the reader of Wikipedia is still treated to the following owlish proposition: "Alternate traditions have as little as two and as many as twelve visiting Jesus." "Alternate traditions"! Scarcely an improvement, but SimonP must have it so.</dd>

It might make more sense to call Jesus a demon-slayer, but then Jesus is not called a "magus" in the NT as far as I know. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:58, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted 66.121.73.94's recent edits to this section, especially because of the way it was worded. Starting off with "But as is often the case with Jehovah's Witnesses positions..." and going from there into speculative talk just to discredit the Witnesses is not the way to do it. What is written on the Witnesses viewpoint is cited, and provides the scriptural reasons.</p>
<p>My responses to the poster are: If God wanted to enlighten the Magi, who, being Magi and astrologers, were practicers of something God dislikes, as to the nature of the child they already referenced as "king", why in such a way that resulted in the end of a large number of innocent children's lives and hurt families? How is the promotion and celebration of practicers of what God dislikes *not* contrary to the Bible's "internal logic"? They were reading signs from the stars, from the East, and called Magi which was used in other verses to mean sorcerer and were sent to a hostile ruler first. The Bible gives no extra commentary on them good or bad other than this and the scriptures referenced in the section, and so the burden of proof is on those claiming that they were not astrologers.</p>
<p>In the end, if you want to write something about common responses to these views, do so higher up in the main part of the article or in a very different way, please. <a href="../../../o/s/c/User%7EOscillate_1952.html" title="User:Oscillate">Oscillate</a> 22:59, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i><b>Anything</b></i> touching religious beliefs is bound to be a sensitive subject. Still, these topics should have entries in Wikipedia. The key guidelines to follow include maintaining a neutral point of view and showing respect for the beliefs of others.</p>
<p>The overwhelming bulk of this article treats Matthew's story of the Magi as if it were true History. Only near the end does a section expressing doubt appear. While this is not a quantitative balance, it seems to be reasonably acceptable.</p>
<p>In the section "Contemporary skepticism," an extremely well-respected scholar's six reasons for doubt are listed. This is immediately followed by a quote attempting to explain away these doubts. In fact, this explanation, which is as long as the six points combined, only deals with the first point. This can hardly be considered balanced. Still, answers are usually longer than questions, so this, too, can be overlooked.</p>
<p>However, please note that whoever inserted the attempted explanation states that there are several creditible ones.</p>
<ol>
<li>Creditible to whom? Obviously the contributor. But his statement is merely his opinion. Others can, and do, find no strength to the explanation.</li>
<li>This is the best of the several explanations. Yes? Says who? Again, obviously the contributor. Others may find more power in a different explanation to assuage the original scholar's doubts. And what <i>are</i> these other possible explanations? We are never told. Do they, in fact, even exist? It can't be demonstrated by what's here as they were never given.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we are told that other points could be raised, but not told what they are, told that <i>this one</i> is the best, on the basis of one person's opinion, and we are to be satisfied with that.</p>
<p>Clearly the personal opinions should be edited out.</p>
<p>But I didn't do that. What I <i>did</i> do was add one sentence at the end. In politer terms, I pointed out that the "explanation" related to events in 2 and 3 BC, but that Herod had died in 4 BC, so this "best" explanation was pointless. This was obviously too much for some people.</p>
<p>First my sentence was mutilated by some anonymous vandal. I restored it.</p>
<p>Then it was mutilated again by <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscillate.html" title="Oscillate">Oscillate</a> who has suddenly discovered that</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The date of Herod's death is debated, with some chronologers holding that he died in 5-4 B.C., which would be before the Magi appeared, while others place his death at a later time."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have no idea who these "chronologers" are since we are not told. Are they associates of the "top scientists" who are forever being quoted in supermarket tabloids? I could just as easily say that whether the Earth is round or flat is dabated because I can dig up <i>somebody</i> who says it's flat. I am unaware of any respected historian who <b>doesn't</b> give 4 BC as the date of Herod's death.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I wouldn't have done anything about it if <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscillate.html" title="Oscillate">Oscillate</a> hadn't wiped out my sentence when adding his own. Once again, we have a case where someone not only wishes to present his own points, but won't allow anyone else to present anything on the other side.</p>

<dd>First of all, the wording on your sentence reads like personal commentary, with nothing to back it up. Tell me how "Interesting as all this may be" belongs in an encyclopedia? If you would bother to follow the link I added to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html#Date_of_Herod.27s_death" title="Herod the Great">Herod_the_Great#Date_of_Herod.27s_death</a>, it explains the debate. My replacement: "The <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html#Date_of_Herod.27s_death" title="Herod the Great">date of Herod's death</a> is debated, with some chronologers holding that he died in 5-4 B.C., which would be before the Magi appeared, while others place his death at a later time." contains your sentence in a better format, plus a link for the user to follow to see some debate on the topic. You think that's mutilation? I did not present "my viewpoint only", what I wrote well-contains your sentence without the personal commentary. Maybe "generally accepted" is better than "some chronologers", no problem with me.

<p>An idea I recently heard about that makes me curious: the view of the magi presenting the gifts as bribes. I've been Googling around but I can't seem to locate anything about this, and it's not referenced in the article either (nor am I suggesting its addition, as it seems slightly obscure and undocumented). Normally I'd just forget about it, but I've heard this independently from two people and wonder if there is a book or site my Google-fu has failed to dredge up.</p>

<p>There is an italian folk story about the Magi encountering a witch. The story basically goes that she didn't believe the Wise Men and because of her unbelief she aged quite quickly. To undue the curse of the Wisemen she had to find the male child in the manger. When she eventually found the Christ child she set her son's items before him. The new born child called out to her as "Befano" and from that point on she was instituted into the capacity of giving treats to children throughout the world. Anyhow I am not sure but that is the only witch story I know in connection to the Magi. (71.49.41.95 02:58, 24 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Actually I think "obscure" is justified here; though it is clear to scholars, most people are not bible scholars, and one of the key things about cultural depictions of the three gifts is that when it comes to myrrh people react with "what?" or "whats it for?", or as in the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_of_Brian_e306.html" title="Life of Brian">Life of Brian</a>, "myrrh?". <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 19:46, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"<i>According to Matthew, they followed a star, and as they approached Jerusalem, Herod tried to trick them into revealing where Jesus was, but once they had found Jesus they left by a different route</i>." No, according to Matthew before they left (some place in the east) they "saw a star in the east". If the star was in the east and they travelled west then the star was behind them. If "saw a star in the east" means "saw a star while THEY were in the east" then we do not know where the star was. Matthew tells us that they were seeking the newly born "King of the Jews". It is obvious that if you were looking for a Jewish king then you would head for Jerusalem.</p>

<p>A start, at least.

In a few places I've tweaked text to read (IMO) more smoothly or to shorten long multi-clause sentences. The one thing I hope I haven't tweaked is anyone's feelings...</p>

<p><i>According to Austrian Professor Konradin Ferrari d'Occhieppo in 1965, 1969, 1999 and 2003, it happened not only a triple conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BC. The astronomer interpret the words "stood over" as a term that refer respectively to the retrogradation and stationing of the royal star Jupiter/Saturn in the sign of Pisces (=land in the west) in 12 November 7 BC since 854 (!) years. The term "stood over the house" is taken as detail-faithful eyewitness report, refers to the star already standing, like Occhieppo assumes. The large joy refers clearly to the end of the journey, finding the place of birth of the king looked for a long time.</i></p>

<p>I removed the following unsubstantiated (and illogical) speculation (removed text is in italics): After having consulted with these religious individuals, Herod is described as secretly meeting with the Magi<i>, which while fitting with Herod's paranoid nature, does beg the question of how Matthew could possibly have known that the events took place</i>.</p>
<p>Matthew certainly could have known. The Magi met with Herod, <i>then</i> Mary and Joseph. If the Magi were concerned for the life of the child they would have warned Mary and Joseph of Herod. Even more likely, the Magi could have simply told Mary and Joseph that Herod also wanted to "worship" the child, which may have seemed innocent enough to the foreign Magi, but would have certainly alerted the parents. Matthew could have been told this by Jesus (assuming his parents told him about it when he was older), or even by Mary herself.</p>

I intend to correct this section to a fairer and hopefully more accurate treatment of the subject. Any objections/comments?--Rwphan 06:51, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did persians have that many kings? I thought there was no persian empire at that time.</p>
<p>East doesn't tell much.

<p>In this article, sometimes Greek words are spelled with Greek letters, other times with Roman letters. I would recommend that Greek letters be used first, then Roman in parentheses and in later usages.</p>

<p>Bible historian Chuck Missler in a write-up mentions about an Armenian tradition identifying the 'Magi of Bethlehem' as Balthasar of Arabia, Melchior of Persia and Gasper of India.

<p>I'll let someone else edit the article if it's deemed appropriate, but I'd like to see some mention of the prophet Daniel in the history of the magi. While many people have been pointing to astrological signs as the explanation how the magi knew that a king was born in Judea, it need not be so. In the book of Daniel, the prophet is placed in charge of all Babylon's wise men (Dan. 2:48), apparently the same category of astrologers, magicians, advisers and diviners (Dan 4:7-9) which Matthew calls Magi. Daniel may have been the source of the their knowledge of the star. To those who believe the Bible is literal truth, Daniel foretold world history accurately and in great detail. His prophecies (including many, presumably, not recorded in the Bible) would have been preserved and studied by his fellow magi and future generations of magi. The magi may have seen a miraculous star appearing at the right time in history, and used Daniel to interpret the meaning of the new star. Some will object to any belief in miracles. But then why waste time falling back on astrological signs as an explanation? If magi saw a conjunction of planets, guessed that it meant a king was born in Judea, and travelled a thousand miles to arrive just when Jesus was born, either that's a miracle of timing, or a vindication of astrology (also miraculous), or a truly incredible coincidence, or it never happened at all. If you're going to believe in the miraculous, why not just accept the miracle as recorded? If not, astrology does not give a way out.</p>

<dd>I agree that the article is remiss in not mentioning Daniel. As it is written, the article implies that they were Zoroastrians from Persia, but it unlikely that Matthew was familiar with this group. The approach of puzzling out who the magi were as if they were real people has some problems. Why would anyone travel hundreds of miles just give gifts to a child? The account in Matthew is constructed to glorify Jesus and fulfill as many Old Testament prophecies as possible. The article should simply present the various common interpretions of the magi, as given by <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> and others. Anything beyond that is OR.</dd>
<dd>BTW, there is no suggestion in the Bible that the magi arrive "just when Jesus was born." Jesus is already a child by the time the magi arrive, not a baby anymore. <a href="../../../k/a/u/User%7EKauffner_58c3.html" title="User:Kauffner">Kauffner</a> 07:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to snopes.com, Islam says that there were twlve magi. There should be a mention of that and additional detail here.
