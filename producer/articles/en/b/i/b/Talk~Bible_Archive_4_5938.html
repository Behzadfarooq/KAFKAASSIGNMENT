<h2><span class="mw-headline">Weasel words?</span></h2>
<p>THE BIBLE IS JUST USED TO EXPLAIN WHY THINGS WERE GOING ON IN THE PAST AND DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE TRUTH AT ALL!!!</p>
<p><br />
Jerry Falwell has objected to terms like "Wiccan Bible", and I am certain that he is not alone. On the other hand, the objection is far from universal. Since the article lacks footnotes, I will have to go back to the bibliography to see which source documents that, but I am sure it is in one of them. (Wikiholic that I am, I am risking being late for a weekend trip to write even this much -- I'll look when I get back.) Since <s>Storm Rider</s> Jayjg objected to "weasel words", what would be a better way to phrase this? M-U-S-L-I-M not Moslem Similarly, some (but not all) Muslims object to calling the Qur'an the "Moslem Bible" on any or all of three grounds: It is not the divine name for the book, the term recalls past attempts at forced conversion and suggest a second-class status for the Qur'an, and the term is misleading, since Islam reveres the Bible, even citing New Testament passages as prophesying the coming of Mohammed. Without going into excruciating detail, how would <s>Storm Rider</s> Jayjg phrase this? I added an external link to provide a citation.</p>
<p>Some Wiccans object to terms such as the "Wiccan Bible" on grounds that there is no single, authoritative source for Wicca, and often on anti-Christian grounds as well. This I have from primary sources, which is why I was not specific and relied on the better-documented Moslem objections. There may well be secondary sources of which I am not aware.</p>
<p>Again, what would <s>Storm Rider</s> Jayjg suggest as an improvement to avoid weasel-words, yet keep the (relatively minor) point short? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 11:56, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize, but at the moment I sincerely don't know what you are talking about. I don't recall a recent edit where I called an edit weasel-words. I will review the article's history to see if I can find what you are talking about. If you could point to the exact edit you are referring to, I would be happy to discuss it. Can anyone else help? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:52, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I went back to the history on the article; you must be talking about the link to an Islamic Bible commentary. I was recently corrected on another article to state "Christian" Bible, rather than just Bible. To me when someone says Bible, they are always talking about the Christian Bible. However, so as not to sound too POV I consented to state Christian bible. I really am not aware of many other books that are referred to as "the Bible". Frankly, I still don't have a problem with stating, "An Islamic commentary on the Bible". I don't think it is being too POV, though obviously one person felt it was. Do other non-Christians feel the same way? Robert, I hope this helps. I never accused you of using weasel words, there just was no explanation of a new link being added. If you have a better descriptor, but all means use it. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:02, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My bad. I misread the page history.

Weasel-words" in the edit summary. While I can go back and find exhibit exactly where I got that from, I am not sure what Jayjg thinks is weasel-wording.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>As with any other popular article, the See also and External links sections are getting out of hand, along with an excess of wikilinks in the article. I see that a few months back there was some disagreement over which external links were appropriate to keep. Per the guidelines at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and in the interest of keeping the links limited and relevant, I'd suggest two links tops to websites which provide different translations (i.e. www.biblegateway.com), as there's plenty of duplication; a few to pro and con sites criticizing/supporting the Bible which encompass a broad variety of opinions; and another couple to sites examining significant historic/cultural contributions of the Bible, so long as they take a scholarly view. I don't see links to Bible studies, churches, or individual faith groups as being appropriate. I realize that there may be some subjectivity to those suggsetions, so I'd like to hear from others before starting to edit the list.</p>
<p>Concerning the See also section and wikilinks, in the next few days (I hope), I'll try to trim it down some. I'd appreciate having some editors check the difference to make sure I wasn't overzealous in removing repeated links.

<p>For those monitoring this, please look over the changes I've made. Two issues came up as I went about cleaning up:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sections The canonization of the Bible, Bible versions and translations and The introduction of chapters and verses all frequently repeat content found elsewhere in the article, but also contain new, significant information. They could probably be merged or at least shortened. Anybody else see a need for this?</li>
<li>I changed "Bible Trivia" to "Widely-quoted facts abot the Bible" to give at least an air of encyclopedic content. Nonetheless, I'm not sure if this section is all that appropriate for Wikipedia... almost looks like fancruft, in a religious sense. Is it really necessary to list the amount of words in the Bible, the middle verse, etc etc? It can be easily found elsewhere on the web; I would have no objection to providing an external link which would do just that.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Partial transclusion (tool useful for Bible texts)</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I would like to direct contributors' attention to a tentative software suggestion on the partial transclusion of texts, mostly intended for use at Wikisource, and described on <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/en:" class="extiw" title="s:en:">my user page there</a>. This would allow for the flexible presentation of all classical texts that exist in numerous complementary versions or with multiple commentaries (such as the Bible).</p>
<p>Please leave feedback on the idea (approval/disapproval, suggestions) at <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/en:User_talk:Dovi" class="extiw" title="s:en:User_talk:Dovi">my Wikisource talk page</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 03:22, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cracking the Code</span></h2>
<p>There has been no discussion pro or con about the Modernity translation under Calan's response above, so let's enter into a little sensationalism. Should Wikipedia enter into the fray, well go offsite <a href="http://religion.wikia.com/wiki/Cracking_the_Code" class="external autonumber" title="http://religion.wikia.com/wiki/Cracking_the_Code" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>(Wikia, anyway). The discussion should not be part of the Bible, but Modernity is the only translation to present Mary Magdalene as Jesus' favorite student, with pictures, word pictures , that is. Of course, you have to fill in the blanks, like Chapter 4 through 21. I have included my random thoughts on both sides of the question which can be molded into an article or discussed there at Wikia. - <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthrash_522a.html" title="User:Athrash">Athrash</a> | <a href="../../../a/t/h/User_talk%7EAthrash_bea5.html" title="User talk:Athrash"><sup><font color="#006633">T</font><font color="#00AAAA">a</font><font color="#00BBBB">l</font><font color="#00DDDD">k</font></sup></a> 14:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Widely-quoted_facts_about_the_Bible" id="Widely-quoted_facts_about_the_Bible"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Widely-quoted facts about the Bible</span></h2>
<p>The "Widely-quoted facts about the Bible" section seems largely inappropriate for this article. First, as was mentioned <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Bible_b36e.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Bible">here</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Talk%7EBible_751f.html#Cleanup" title="Talk:Bible">Talk:Bible#Cleanup</a>, this list of what is essentially random trivia seems rather un-encyclopedic.</p>
<p>Since that has already been pointed out elsewhere, though, I'd like to point out a separate issue: most of the facts aren't about the <i>Bible</i>, they are about specific translations or versions of the Bible. Look at all the facts that mention "in the King James Version". If these facts are worth keeping, they should be in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Version of the Bible</a> article. Even many of the ones that don't mention the KJV seem to be highly translation-dependent, such as the number of chapters and verses.</p>
<p>If this section must be kept, then my suggestion is to reduce this section to a short list of links to other articles. For example (and I realize this may be a bit rough, it's only meant to illustrate):</p>
<p><b>Trivia</b> <i>&lt;-- should be a heading, but I don't want to disrupt the talk page with that markup</i><br />
Some interesting trivia about the Bible is found in other articles.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_wept.html" title="Jesus wept">Jesus wept</a>, often cited as the shortest verse in the Bible</li>
<li>The middle verse of the Bible</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahershalalhashbaz.html" title="Mahershalalhashbaz">Mahershalalhashbaz</a>, often cited as the longest word in the Bible.</li>
<li>King James Version trivia <i>&lt;-- link to a new section in <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Version of the Bible</a> that contains this trivia</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I hesitate to make these changes myself, especially without saying anything, because I have a suspicion some people might disagree. Any comments? -- <a href="../../../z/a/w/User%7EZawersh_d0f7.html" title="User:Zawersh">Zawersh</a> 08:06, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As this has been brought up before, I'm going to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and remove it. There are countless Bible fact/trivia sites on the internet which contain this type of information, and it's not encyclopedic — think of how silly it would be to have similar details on middle sentence, longest name, and so forth on Moby Dick or Julius Caesar. Out of curiosity, do other religious faiths do this with their religious texts? <b><a href="../../../t/i/j/User%7ETijuana_Brass_50f8.html" title="User:Tijuana Brass"><span style="color: #FF4500; font-family: Times New Roman; font-variant: small-caps;">Tijuana Brass</span></a><sup><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color: #228B22;">E@</span></a></sup></b> 23:04, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed the sentence: "(It should however be noted that no Septuagint that predates the fourth century contains the Deuterocanonical texts)"</p>
<p>The statement does not concur to the general view held on various articles discussing the deuterocanonical books that they are included (either explicitly or implied) in the septuagint since the first century. Furthermore these books appear in the writings of ancient Christians as early as the second century (church fathers and notable leaders), effectively debunking the claim that they aren't in the texts which existed before the fourth century. <a href="../../../i/s/i/User%7EIsidore2k_7931.html" title="User:Isidore2k">Max Sterling</a> 09:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">pseudopigraphal</span></h2>
<p>Due to the recent publicity of the Book of Thomas and the Book of Judas, shouldn't there be a section on the Pseudopigraphal texts associated with the bible? Letter of I Clement alone warrents some mention. I wouldn't say this but we seem to be using the term apocrypha for only the deuterocannonical texts of the catholic church.

<dd>I don't think it really fits. The Bible isn't so much meant to be read from cover to cover. Each book contained within, perhaps, acts as a self-contained story, so a "spoiler" tag within an article for each book (for instance, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">Gospel of John</a>) may be appropriate. I think labeling the entirity of the Bible as a "novel" worthy of a spoiler tag smacks of ignorance (or arrogance) regarding it's everyday usage. --<a href="../../../e/a/z/User%7EEazieCheeze_16c7.html" title="User:EazieCheeze">EazieCheeze</a> 15:39, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The spoiler tags are reserved for works of fiction and illusion, and not for works that claim to be factual narratives. For example, the Bible. It doesn't matter whether or not you believe it to be factual or ficitonal, what matters is how the author presents the work, and how the work presents itself. Save for some short parables, the Bible claims to be true and factual, right? So no spoiler tags, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 16:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

It also is largely speculative and unsourced.

<li>The more conservative literalist denominations interpret the term "Word" as a mandate to compel a fundamentalist interpretation of the text,<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> while liberal denominations may interpret the term "Word" as a metaphor for Jesus; hence the name of God is the Word, not the book itself. Liberal free will denominations tend to give the teachings of Jesus greater weight, while more conservative literalists may not. Both views have clashed over the concept of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>, with strict Calvinist and Reformed denominations interpreting the term "flesh" as "sin nature" in the English text, placing blame upon mankind for its <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_Man_58ca.html" title="Fall of Man">Fall</a>. Southern Baptists tend to accept the Calvinist assertion of a "sin nature." On the other hand, liberal free will denominations such as Methodists and Episcopalians, follow the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Trent_988c.html" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a>'s determination of sin as a "wounded nature," placing blame upon evil for its affliction of mankind.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with the full removal of this text. Firstly, it needs a lot more technical NPOV terminology. For instance "strict Calvinist" - "Liberal free will" are POV. Further, the first line of that paragraph is misleading. John 1:1 calls Jesus the Word (λογος) of God. Jesus' title as the Word of God is not in dispute by "literalist fundamentalist" or frankly anyone who accepts the Canonosity of the Gospel of John. It is a name for Jesus when the gospel according to John's prologue was claiming the preexistance of the one called Jesus. Further, liberals and conservatives both consider the bible, as the Word of God, that to say the book in which the teachings of the followers of God are contained. The difference is that some believe this to be completely inspired by God, word for word, to the point that the writers personality is secondary to God's inspiration. Frankly, and most basic, this discussion is not inclusive of the Jewish Scripture, which this article includes. If it were a discussion on the Christian canon alone, then perhaps this would be appropriate (in a greatly edited form) in the prologue's synopsis. But since it includes Jewish scripture, this is very inappropriate as a synopsis that applies to the whole article. <a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHopquick_fff0.html" title="User:Hopquick">Hopquick</a> 14:06, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Issues_to_Address:" id="Issues_to_Address:"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Issues to Address:</span></h2>
<p><i>Intro</i>: Tanakh is not synonymous with the Old Testament if one includes the deuteron-canonical books of the Septuagint. The comment about a different numbering for the Ten Commandments is unnecessary, the actual text of the Bible does not have numbers, and this is about the Bible. The information about Biblical interpretative methods should be in its own paragraph.</p>
<p><i>Distribution</i>: That 5 billion copies of the Bible have been sold since 1815 needs a reference. That the Bible is "considered" to be the most stolen book "in some cities" is not relevant to distribution. The comment about the Bible influencing "Western Civilization" completely ignores the Near Eastern civilization of Byzantium and mistakenly labels Christianity as a "Western" religion. That the word "Bible is used to describe texts of other faiths" is irrelevant to distribution, it might have a place in the intro.</p>
<p><i>the four sources</i>: This section seems out of place and a bit disorganized; it discusses nineteenth century literary criticism, divine inspiration, and divine commandments – an odd assortment.</p>
<p><i>Nevi'im</i> The final comment about "heroes" and "antiheroes" seems to be a certain judgement (PoV) based on a particular literary reading of the plot of the collection of books. It doesn't seem appropriate in its current form and place.</p>
<p><i>Ketuvim</i>: What does it mean to say that these were the last books to be "canonized" – the process of discerning a canon needs more description, otherwise this statement just floats. Who canonized it, when, on what criteria, what was "last" about this, &amp;c.?</p>
<p><i>Translations and editions</i>: I think the discussion of the Septuagint ought to be reconciled with the like discussion under the "Christian Bible" section, especially since it has had a far greater impact on Christianity than on Judaism. This would help the section on the Septuagint there, which lacks a proper introduction.</p>
<p><i>The Christian Bible</i>: Again, "Hebrew Scriptures" is not synonymous with "Old Testament" except outside of Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy. I have never heard the Old Testament called the "first testament" – source? The sentence "there are many different translations of the Bible in current use" just hangs there with no point other than to state the obvious.</p>
<p><i>Theology</i>: This section sounds weak to me, I have nothing specific, but it must either be out of place, of missing sufficient content. To me, just saying "there are a whole lot of opinions" doesn't really serve the purpose of giving information – perhaps a proper discussion of those opinions, in its own section, would do well.</p>
<p><i>Original Language</i>: The mention of different "text-types" seems out of place – what does this have to do with "language"? This brings me to my point that I think we need a real section and explanation given of the manuscript traditions of the Bible, especially since the "historic editions" section is very very light on this. The passage below the quote says that "logia" is being translated as "words", but in the quote it is untranslated.</p>
<p><i>historic editions</i>: Again, as stated about, this cuts right to the printed text, and I think we need a section on the manuscripts available prior to Gutenberg (or Erasmus), and that it should come first. There is only a minor discussion of these earlier texts, and it is at the end, oddly. In my understanding the only part of Erasmus's edition not taken from Greek was the last sentence of Revelation – the paragraph reads as though he took a lot more, which is correct? The paragraph says that some papyrus fragments have been found dating "within a few decades" of the composition of the text – like what! This needs a source. If by "fragment" we mean an actual scrap of paper (which is not what "fragment" necessarily means when talking about ancient texts) then I know of no such case except perhaps a tiny scrap of Mark, which cannot really be used to correct other manuscripts due to is brevity.</p>
<p><i>Canonization of the Bible</i>: See my previous post in talk</p>
<p><i>Bible versions</i> This section has good information, but it is all disjoined. We need to make proper sections and move this all into its right place.</p>

<dd><i>The Bible as used by the majority of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> comprises the Hebrew Scripture, known to Christians as the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> or First Testament; and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, which relates the life and teachings of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistles.html" title="Epistles">letters</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul_d96a.html" title="St Paul">St Paul</a> and other disciples to the early church and the book of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">Revelation</a>.

</dl>
<p>To this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Bible as used by the majority of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> includes the Hebrew Scripture and the <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">Deuterocanonical books</a> (various writings important in the Second-Temple period of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>); and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, which relates the life and teachings of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistles.html" title="Epistles">letters</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul_d96a.html" title="St Paul">St Paul</a> and other disciples to the early church and the book of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">Revelation</a>. The Deuterocanonical books are not used by some <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestants.html" title="Protestants">Protestants</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Since the first sentence read "The Bible as used by the majority of Christians…" I thought the list should include the Deuterocanonical books, since, after all, that is the Bible used by the majority of Christians. All the information, other than this rearrangement, remained the same.</p>

<p><i>"Distribution</i></p>
<p><i>The Bible is the most widely distributed book in the world. Both Hebrew Scripture and the Christian Bible have been translated more times and into more languages — more than 2,100 languages in all — than any other book. It is said that more than five billion copies of the Bible have been sold since 1815, making it the best-selling book of all-time."</i></p>
<p>The number is far greater than five billion<a href="http://www.biblesociety.org/sdr_2005.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblesociety.org/sdr_2005.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (one has to count all the different years' statistics).</p>
<p>The distribution only for 2005 alone was 372 585 792.</p>
<p>Here's some more figures:</p>
<ul>
<li>1996: 19 370 487 (19,3 million)</li>
<li>1997: 20 035 360 (20 million)</li>
<li>1998: 585 023 708 (500 million/ half a billion)</li>
<li>1999: 627 925 260 (600 million/ more than half a billion)</li>
<li>2000: 633 335 638 (600 million/ more than half a billion)</li>
<li>2001: 390 544 073 (300 million)</li>
<li>2002: 578 029 863 (500 million/ half a billion)</li>
<li>2003: 431 741 291 (400 million)</li>
<li>2005: 372 585 792 (300 million)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Total: 3 286 005 680</b></p>
<p>Considering these are the total recorded number of copies sold over a period of nine years, it is absurd to imply that the overall total of Bibles sold is five billion. In just nine years the figure is already at 3,2 billion. Maybe it should be made clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Bibles were sold to individuals or simply major distributors</li>
<li>Which term of billion is used, e.g.:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>1 000 000 000 (one thousand million: used by most English-speaking countries (American and usual modern British meaning); or</li>
<li>1 000 000 000 000 (one million million: used by most other countries outside Asia (older British meaning))</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it should be clarified that this number is only the number of distributed Bibles, not necessarily the number of Bibles paid for with money.</p>
<p>It would be appreciated if someone would find some statistics about previous years. --<a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdriaan_1_fe26.html" title="User:Adriaan 1">Scotteh</a> 09:43, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reliability of it's content, the bible I mean</span></h2>
<p>I've read a lot of books and watched a lot of docos from both sides, ones that go out of the way to prove the bible is historically factual and the be all end all to life, to people casually mentioning that they discovered summat that fits into the bibles claims and timelines and the flip side people saying that they have found things in the bible to be total rubbish or not true (such as Jericho was already in ruins from an earthquake years earlier before the Christians came in, so rather than a valient and majestic conquest, it would have been more like a slaughter on the shanty towns of the people the Christians found when they got there) and of course books and programs going out of their way to prove the bible as a complete farse.</p>
<p>In any case, my question is, why is this article sort of saying that the bible is all fact without bias, and even touches on that it is a historically accurate artifact. Perhaps my words are muddled here, is anyone else understanding? it is hard to know if this article is talking about the bible baseed on unbiased research into it, or if it is under the impression that because it is THE Christian book that you don't need to question if it is accurate or not, you just need to push it as fact? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayKeaton_01af.html" title="User:JayKeaton">JayKeaton</a> 18:04, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not believe that this article should make any argument about the accuracy or the reliability of the Bible - but, to be fair, I do not think it does (if you come across any sentences that explicitly claim the Bible is accurate or reliable, you should feel free to change them to "Some people believe" or something like that. My take on this article is that it is just descriptive, stating what the Bible is and what it says without making any judgement one way or another as to its historical accuracy. You should follow links to other articles that are explicitly about the historicity of the Bible and there you will find more of the discussion i think you were expecting. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 19:40, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JayKeaton, if you are talking about the fall of Jericho described in Joshua 6, this predates Christ and therefore Christians, hopefully you meant to say the Israelites, and you did not actually see a documentary that made this claim using 'Christians', if so the authenticity should be questioned and verified.</dd>

<dd>I do agree with the general theme you were attempting to put forth, that is that we should not present this section on the bible as if society accepts it as factual. Although there have been many recent discoveries that have validated portions of the bible, there are certain aspects that will never be proved out by evidence, so personally I believe that we will never get to the point where it is accepted as factual, even though as a society we do not hold other works of antiquity to the same decree of scrutiny and evidence.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism of the Bible</span></h2>
<p>In my view (as a devout Christian), mentioning massacres that have the blessing of God or the practice of polygamy is not POV. It's stated in the Bible and is there for anybody to see. We should not deny that there are troubling passages in the Bible, <b>that</b> would be POV. From a Christian perspective, a discussion about this topic and how to interpret them would be beneficial, but that particular disucssion is of course not suited for an article in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> 13:27, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree, although I appreciate your well articulated argument. In this rather long article, I don't think that the short section on criticism creates any lack of balance, quite the opposite. If you compare this article with the article on the Book of Mormon, you will find that the criticism included in that article in miuch longer than in this article. I don't see any problem in briefly mentionin the main parts that attract criticism and point to the articles that deals more in-depth with the issues. Isber 15:28, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>I took "a living" out of "a living God" from the introduction. They aren't trying to understand "a" god (notice the lower case g), they are trying to understand God. Also, it's pointless to say "living God". For example I don't introduce myself as the living Eric. People don't say "I'm trying to get a better understanding of the living Regis Philbin."<a href="../../../t/y/p/User%7ETyphoid_Orchid_efe4.html" title="User:Typhoid Orchid">Typhoid Orchid</a> 23:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another thing about the Introduction, it doesn't say anything about the people that think the Bible is bunk (no, I'm not in that catagory). It asumes that everyone believes in the Bible to some extent or another. <a href="../../../t/y/p/User%7ETyphoid_Orchid_efe4.html" title="User:Typhoid Orchid">Typhoid Orchid</a> 23:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"as there are archeological sites that match biblical descriptions of events and places, including possible sites for Sodom and Gomorrah..." How does a "possible site" equate to a definite archeological site? The sites are being debated over now and hardly any resectable acheologists think that they are the true sites. This is hardly proof and should not be listed under an archeological site that matches biblical descriptions.</p>

<dd>From an ethical perspective, the moral message of the Bible has also been questioned, which generally originate from passages in the old testament with widespread polygamy and passages in which God appears to order mass killings, punishes innocents for the crimes of their parents, or appears to enforce cannibalism as a punishment for disobedience - all of which contrast sharply with modern Christian values.</dd>

<dd>Archeologist questioned the existence of King David, because there were no records of him dating from the time of his rule (traditional dates 1025-985 b.c.). Scientists speculated that the legend of David may have been added by a scribe recopying documents at a much later date, trying to improve the history of Israel. In 1993 an inscription in stone dating from about 900 b.c. was found in modern Israel containing the phrases 'House of David', and 'King of Israel'. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>

<dd>As has been pointed out by others, almost all articles on crucial religious texts and persons come with a paragraph containing criticism. Either they should all be changed or then there should be some criticism on this page as well. We cannot escape the fact that the things mentioned - polygamy, genocide, racism - are found in the Old Testament and to try to suppress that kind of information is not in line with my Christian faith. The precise wording of the criticism section can and should be discussed, but in a mature and respectful way, just as Znuttyone is already doing. <a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> | <a href="../../../j/d/e/User_talk%7EJdeJ_830a.html" title="User talk:JdeJ">Talk</a> 07:48, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All of this started with a simple, good-faith, non confrontational, polite remark:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This sounds like original research:
<dl>
<dd>From an ethical perspective, the moral message of the Bible has also been questioned, which generally originate from passages in the old testament with widespread polygamy and passages in which God appears to order mass killings, punishes innocents for the crimes of their parents, or appears to enforce cannibalism as a punishment for disobedience - all of which contrast sharply with modern Christian values.</dd>

<p>Isber and Jded are the ones who are reacting defensively, and confrontationally, and in bad-faith. Moreover, they completely misunderstand and misrepresent the issue. Thie issue is <i>not</i> whether or not this article has a "criticisms" section. It is not even over what criticisms are included. It is <i>solely</i> over the fact that any criticisms included need to follow our core policies. I provided the linkes to verifiability ahd cite sources above, here is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> the no original research one. JdedJ and Isber must comply with these policies. If they do, the content stays (regardless of what the content covers), if not, it goes (regardless of the content it covers). This has <b>nothing</b> to do with polygyny, mass killings, etc. It has to do <i>only</i> with following our core policies. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 15:37, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then perhaps you could define what you mean by original research. Judging by your talk page, it appears that you have made a habit out of accusing people from original research in many different contextes. That does not have to mean that you're just employing it when you disagree with someone; perhaps you have been right all those times, who knows. If you would inform us what you mean that the original research in this page is, it would probably be a way forward. <a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> | <a href="../../../j/d/e/User_talk%7EJdeJ_830a.html" title="User talk:JdeJ">Talk</a> 16:21, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've reverted Shrubenstein's deletion for now but I think we should still discuss the format of the paragraph. I'm not entirely happy with Isber's version either, although I don't agree with deleting things without providing good reasons. I inserted some of the sources. I don't think they are ideal in any way so by inserting them I only removed them from the talkpage and inserted them in the article where they belong. I think this paragraph should reflect the fact that the Bible does include the things now mentioned but it should be written in a better way. <a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> | <a href="../../../j/d/e/User_talk%7EJdeJ_830a.html" title="User talk:JdeJ">Talk</a> 16:35, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Suggestion</b>. What I would suggest is that instead of the sources Isber gave us, the actual Bible passages would serve better. Slrubenstein first questioned whether there were sources to confirm that the Bible has been criticised for these things. Well, obviously it has and the present sources show that to be true. But are they helpful for the reader? No, not as I see it. Slrubenstein should be able to accept that it is not controversial to state that the Bible has been criticised and Isber should be able to give us the exact passages as a better source. <a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> | <a href="../../../j/d/e/User_talk%7EJdeJ_830a.html" title="User talk:JdeJ">Talk</a> 16:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The sources cited need to be of scholarly level, the ones listed are very poor, and of a nature that would call into question the validity of Wikipedia in general. The subject has been analyzed and studied for years, there are plenty of good resources to cite.. See <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html#Research" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_great_article#Research</a> for ideas on research.</li>
<li>2. This section needs to be concise overview to 1: Establish that there is, 2: Point readers to the sub-sections that go into excruciating detail of each area. Listing a few hot button issues does not due justice to all the other scholarly work that has been done on this subject. This is akin to a section on US presidents only talking about our current president. If wikipedia is ever going to be a serious resource, we need to raise the standards. Additionally to be neutral on this subject you would need to list alternative views which would make the section why to large and add to the cumbersome flow and increse the resources needed to maintain and edit.</li>

<dd>There was only one person that commented on the replacement section above, can some of you elaborate on your views of this.

<p>I generally agree with Znuttyone. I won't delete the paragraph in question again ... <i>yet</i>. But aside from Znuttyone's suggestions, whoever is committed to this paragraph still has to get rid of the passive voice and tell us who has made these criticisms. It is not enough to provide a source, we need information to evaluate a source. for example, is it one self-proclaimed Christian's opinion? Is it the opinion of one Christian, but published by a scholarly journal or a publication of a Church (if so, what are the credentials of this person? PhD. in Biblical literature? Geology? Doctor of Divinity?)? Or is it the view of an official organ or representative of a particular Church (e.g. the Pope or the Vatican)? Identifying the POV is essential to comply with NPOV. Do not ask me to explain NPOV to you. That is not my job. You need to make the effort to read our policies. I already provided you with the links, you can't even follow them you have to instead just insult me? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we're getting somewhere. Znuttyone, Slrubenstein and myself at least agree on the limited value of the sources. My suggestion is this:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1. Get rid of the sources because they are not needed. Those who are interested can check the Bible for themselves, and I don't think anyone questions the fact that the Bible has been criticised.</li>
<li>2. The present paragraph is a bit confusing. Better to divide it into a few short stances (Historical criticism, Scientific criticism, Ethic criticism) and <i>briefly</i> mention what the <i>main</i> points in each section are and provide a link to the respective pages.</li>
<li>3. Get rid of the passive voice. Instead of saying "The Bible has been criticised" (by whom, is the question), it would be better saying "The Bible contains passages contrasting with modern mainstream Christian ethics".</li>

<dd>If you feel JdeJ misrepresents your position, perhaps you should ponder whether you could express your views in another way.

<dd>Hardly had I written that before Slrubenstein again deleted the whole paragraph. The one that he himself had edited. I consider the deletion vandalism and will reinsert it. If Slrubenstein is interested in discussing it, he's very welcome to do so. Isber 17:02, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reverted my edits and took out the paragraph. Not because I don't agree with it but because I don't see the point of a constant inserting-deleting war. It does not benefit the article. I hope others can comment on this. Slrubenstein has not explained what he thinks is original research in this very short paragraph. I hope he does so and I hope JdeJ and Znuttyone can comment on the last and very short version that I edited out for the moment but think should be left in. Isber 17:13, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is original research because you take primary sources (Bible quotes) and provide your own interpretation (these are at odds with Modern Christian values). Adding as references links to Biblical quotes onlyu makes it clearer that it is original research because you are using primary sources to forward your own view. I have explained twice already what you could do to make this passage comply with both our NPOOR and NPOV policies: avoid the passive voice and correctly identify whose point of view this is, and p`rovide the verifiable source/citation that tells us whose point of view this is. Above I responded to your query and said "It is not enough to provide a source, we need information to evaluate a source. for example, is it one self-proclaimed Christian's opinion? Is it the opinion of one Christian, but published by a scholarly journal or a publication of a Church (if so, what are the credentials of this person? PhD. in Biblical literature? Geology? Doctor of Divinity?)? Or is it the view of an official organ or representative of a particular Church (e.g. the Pope or the Vatican)? Identifying the POV is essential to comply with NPOV." Unless you are clear about whose points of views you are representing, and unless you provide reliable verifiable sources for those views, it appears that you are expressing your own view, and that is original research. Now tell me why you think I am not being clear? (By the way, isn´t it already clear that for Christians the New Testament supercedes the Hebrew Bible? Shouldn´t we expect Christians to reject views in the Hebrew Bible? It seems to me that all your edit amounts to is that Christians do not accept the Hebrew view of God, which we already know, from this and other articles). <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:24, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Archeologist questioned the existence of King David, because there were no records of him dating from the time of his rule (traditional dates 1025-985 b.c.). Scientists speculated that the legend of David may have been added by a scribe recopying documents at a much later date, trying to improve the history of Israel. In 1993 an inscription in stone dating from about 900 b.c. was found in modern Israel containing the phrases 'House of David', and 'King of Israel'. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></dd>

<dd>Part of the problem here is that there are seldom sources for the obvious. It is an undisputable fact that genocide is encouraged in the Bible. It is also undisputable that not all Christians (to put it mildly) support genocide. I still don't understand exactly what sources are needed for this. Any statement in Wikipedia or in this article could be questioned in theory. We definitely need sources when claiming something that is uncertain, but I don't think you mean to tell me that we need sources to claim that encouraging genocide is contrary to what many Christians believe. Znuttyone and I are both Christians, and I think we both agree that genocide is not something we condone. I agree with Isber that there seems to be a certain degree of double standards at play here. I should also point out that I did not write the original paragraph, all I've done is to insert it once, and that was some time ago. My interest here is to try to keep an even line across the table, something I feel is lacking at present. <a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> | <a href="../../../j/d/e/User_talk%7EJdeJ_830a.html" title="User talk:JdeJ">Talk</a> 08:23, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeJ_ce08.html" title="User:JdeJ">JdeJ</a> . The sources that are needed are those of a scholarly nature that back the contents of a given thought or view. But it is not just a reference issue. The problem I have with this is not that we have criticism; it is in the logistics and manner in which it is represented. 1) it is inefficient, hard to read and follow, 3) is not neutral. If you are going to be fare, when you state that genocide is encouraged, you must also stat that it is discouraged (GOD does both in the old testament and New) but I have yet to see any contributors who place the statements give a balanced and accurate view. As I review this article, it is full of statements revealing the lack of understanding and knowledge of the subject. Too many times statement are made lack references to support them, and are one sided. In looking at these it is clear bias influenced the statements. If one is to be fair and neutral then the contributor must list all major views with supported references at that point the article becomes why to growled.</dd>

<p>Take for example slavery in the bible, if someone were to offer an argument concerning this they may add the following to the criticism section.</p>
<p>When studying works of antiquity , scholars recommend understanding the times and context of period the manuscripts were written in order to understand their meaning. So what did slavery mean in biblical times.</p>

<dd>Scholars do not agree on a definition of "slavery." The term has been used at various times for a wide range of institutions, including plantation slavery, forced labor, the drudgery of factories and sweatshops, child labor, semivoluntary prostitution, bride-price marriage, child adoption for payment, and paid-for surrogate motherhood. Somewhere within this range, the literal meaning of "slavery" shifts into metaphorical meaning, but it is not entirely clear at what point. A similar problem arises when we look at other cultures. The reason is that the term "Slavery" is evocative rather than analytical, calling to mind a loose bundle of diagnostic features. These features are mainly derived from the most recent direct Western experience with slavery, that of the southern United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. The present Western image of slavery has been haphazardly constructed out of the representations of that experience in nineteenth-century abolitionist literature, and later novels, textbooks, and films...From a global cross-cultural and historical perspective, however, New World slavery was a unique conjunction of features...In brief, most varieties of slavery did not exhibit the three elements that were dominant in the New World: slaves as property and commodities; their use exclusively as labor; and their lack of freedom..."

<dd>"Freedom in the ancient Near East was a relative, not an absolute state, as the ambiguity of the term for "slave" in all the region's languages illustrates. "Slave" could be used to refer to a subordinate in the social ladder. Thus the subjects of a king were called his "slaves," even though they were free citizens. The king himself, if a vassal, was the "slave" of his emperor; kings, emperors, and commoners alike were "slaves" of the gods. Even a social inferior, when addressing a social superior, referred to himself out of politeness as "your slave." There were, moreover, a plethora of servile conditions that were not regarded as slavery, such as son, daughter, wife, serf, or human pledge." [HI:HANEL:1.40]</dd>

<p>Now if you are going to give a view that GOD encouraged slavery, then you must give both sides of the scholarly arguments, not those that consist of POV. If we do this for each area then what you have is a HUGE hard to read and follow article. The solution I have proposed is the most logical choice to resolve this and make for a more professional look and feel, while allowing for the reader to explore these topics. <a href="../../../z/n/u/User%7EZnuttyone_982b.html" title="User:Znuttyone">Znuttyone</a> 06:39, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
