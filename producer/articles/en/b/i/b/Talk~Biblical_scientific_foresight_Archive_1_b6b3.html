<p>I created a thread giving both sides. I cited skeptic and non-skeptic sides of the aisle. I think if someone is going to question the neutrality of the article they should put exactly why in the talk page why they found it objectionable.</p>

<dd>Hi, KDBuffalo. I put the POV notice because it appears to me (as a conservative Christian) that the article seems to be trying to persuade the reader of a position and is not encyclopedic in tone. For instance, it says, "Let us look at a few examples." and "Each person has to study the issue for themselves vis a vis Biblical exegesis and the various studies and works that have been done on this issue." The skeptics' positions should also be more developed to give a fair representation. On a stylistic note, vis-Ã -vis is overused and should be hyphenated. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 20:59, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the topic was on foreknowledge I took the skeptics of Levitical foreknowledge using their objections to the levitical food laws being advanced which is in opposition to hayward and Dr. Macht. I also used the "circle of the earth" and "path of the seas" argumentation out of Till's article on Bible foreknowledge. Till is the only one I could find who did any significant "Bible exegesis" in his article which I don't think he really did in "Bible biology". I thought the article I picked of Till was the better of the two. I thought "Bible biology was poorly researched and didn't focus on foreknowledge which his foreknowledge article did.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the "let us look at a few examples".</p>
<p>I didn't write a strong conclusion in terms of taking sides but made it non committal in its conclusions. That is why I wrote: "Each person has to study the issue for themselves vis a vis Biblical exegesis and the various studies and works that have been done on this issue."</p>
<p>I am going to get rid of "let us take a look at a few examples".</p>

<p>Here are few more arguments for those interested (and there are more by the way):</p>

SNAKES EAT DIRT?</p>
<p>Here is another interesting thing about those verses:</p>

<p>I also cite:</p>
<p>QUOTE Speaking of the "tasting" ability of snakes, Dr. William R. Teska, a biology professor at Furman University who specializes in snakes informed me that snakes "taste" both dirt and air to navigate.</p>

Also, I suggest readers go to this resources in order to discover the exegesis that I thought was poor in regards to Mr. Till:</p>

<p>Lasly, there are a number of good sites on the exegetical and science issues regarding the hare/cud issues (see: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=hare+and+cud&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=hare+and+cud&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=hare+and+cud&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a> ).

<p>(from a paragraph I reverted of kdbuffalo)</p>
<ul>
<li>One would expect the benefits from eating less toxic food to be a long term benefit.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure why this is not obvious? Eating less toxins will have long term benefits.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>For example, the Arabs while they generally do not eat pork due to religious observances freely eat camel which is non-kosher and more toxic according to Dr. Macht's test.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What are you saying here? Are Arabs unhealthy because they eat camel, or healthy because they don't eat pork, or a combination?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps eating less toxic food is advantageous.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Again, it's a bit redundant. Nobody disagrees that some animals are more likely to be bad for you than others. Even the CDC agrees <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/trichinosis/factsht_trichinosis.htm#risk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/trichinosis/factsht_trichinosis.htm#risk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Here is some additional information:</p>
<p><br />
Lancet. 1985 Mar 23;1(8430):681-3.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Relationship between pork consumption and cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Nanji AA, French SW.</p>
<p>An investigation of the relationship between per-caput consumption of total fat, beef, and pork in several countries and mortality rates for cirrhosis showed a correlation between alcohol consumption and cirrhosis mortality of 0.64 (p less than 0.01), and a correlation between pork consumption and cirrhosis mortality of 0.40 (p less than 0.05). The correlation between cirrhosis mortality and the product of both alcohol and pork consumption was highly significant (r = 0.98, p less than 0.001). In countries with low alcohol consumption, no correlation was obtained between alcohol consumption and cirrhosis. However, a significant correlation was obtained between cirrhosis and pork. A similar relationship was seen in the ten Canadian provinces, where there was no correlation between cirrhosis mortality and alcohol consumption, but a significant correlation was obtained with pork."</p>
<p><b>Also:</b></p>
<p>Dr. Macht showed:</p>
<p>-the harmful effects of meat and milk combinations</p>
<p>- toxic effects of animals slaughtered by conventional means as opposed to those slaughtered in accordance with Jewish law.</p>
<p>-the differences in puerperal blood according to gender of the child (see Leviticus 12:1-5).</p>

<dd>KD, I don't think people would debate that consuming certain animals carries an increased risk of certain health problems. The case you have to make here is what it actually means that the bible forbade certain animals. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 17:34, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And can you come up with some studies more recent than Machs, which are about 50 years old. Science (relevantly <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrition.html" title="Nutrition">Nutrition</a> and <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemiology.html" title="Epidemiology">Epidemiology</a>)has progressed a lot since then. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 17:38, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Egyptians, for example, were medicated with lizard blood, crocodile lung, the teeth of swine, and fly specks. If patients did not succumb of their disease, they had a good chance of dying from its treatment. Diabetes Spectrum 14:116-117, 2001</p>

Antifungal Activity of the Essential Oil of Hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis)</p>
<p>M. P. Letessier, K. P. Svoboda &amp; D. R. Walters</p>
<p>The antifungal and fungicidal effects of hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis) oil and its individual components were studied in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Mycelial growth of the plant pathogenic fungi Pyrenophora avenae and Pyricularia oryzae was completely inhibited by 0.4% hyssop oil. Volatile components diffusing from agar medium containing 0.4% hyssop oil also completely inhibited the growth of these two fungi. Various components of hyssop oil (L-bornyl acetate, isopinocampheol and pinocamphone), used individually, reduced growth of P. avenae and, where combinations of individual components were used, any mixture containing isopinocampheol completely inhibited fungal growth. Growth of P. oryzae was less affected by individual components of the oil. Hyssop oil reduced germination of Botrytis fabae conidia and uredospores of Uromyces viciae-fabae, but in contrast to the data from in vitro experiments, its effects on pathogen infection were less clear cut. Thus, although 0.05% hyssop oil reduced rust infection of broad bean when applied 1, 2 or 3 days before, or 1 or 2 days after inoculation, its effects against barley powdery mildew and apple powdery mildew were variable. It is suggested that this variability might be the result of the volatile components of the oil diffusing away from leaf surfaces, thus reducing the concentration of active components on the leaf surface.</p>

<p>Quote: One of the oldest explanations is the hygiene/health one. This is âprobably the most popular explanation of the food laws. The unclean animals were recognized by the ancients as a danger to health, and were therefore pronounced unclean,â writes Gordon Wenham.79 Roland E. Clements says, âWhat we have here is a simple andcomprehensive guidebook to food and personal hygiene.â80 The hygienic position issupported also by others, including William F. Albright.81 Roland K. Harrison is a modern commentator who makes a strong case for the hygiene/health rationale for the dietary laws. He lists various parasitic organisms and worms that can be contracted from unclean animals including fish.82 Much more could be said on the subject of health as regards unclean and clean animals. Its validity cannot be easily overturned.</p>

<dd>Homer's Odyssey declared regarding the ancient Egyptians that "the Egyptians were skilled in medicine more than any other art". However, medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian medicine was large ineffective. For example, 72% of medical 260 presciptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements according to medical experts. The use of dung and other waste products was very prevalent in ancient Egyptian medicine so much so that medical historians have labeled it "sewage pharmacology". While Louis Pasteur found that bacteria in the bodies of humans and animals release byproducts into dung and urine which are antibiotic they are not without risk. For example, it has been found that Pakastani caregivers who use topical antibiotics for their babies circumcision wounds instead of using dung, ghee, urine etc, prevent that babies from getting neo natal tetanus. It is thought that Egyptian medicine which used fly specks, fly dung, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remdies could be harmful (to stop a baby from crying a seed and fly dung paste mixed with water was given to to babies for four days).</dd>

<p>Go for it, I won't delete any more for now. But I really do think you are obscuring the point. I think it's well established that there is some benefit to some of the directives in the bible. The question is, does this require some superhuman influence? Dietary recommendations could easily be arrived at via observation and oral tradition over several generation before being codified in written form. It might be better to concentrate on things that could not possible be know (such as things that would require a microscope or telescope), rather than things which could easily be know, (diet, hygiene etc). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 22:31, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hygiene is a well understood. That is why we have sewers to take care of human excrement. That is why doctors wash their hands after handling dead bodies.</p>
<p>As far as diet, and food toxicities, I feel comfortable letting readers decide if more toxic or less toxic food is better for you. Second, as far as pork there is the Lancet study and what other readers added to my BAR pork commentary.</p>
<p>After all is said and done, I believe in the principle of total evidence and not arbitrarily removing evidence. Let each side bring forth its best case fairly using evidence and let each reader decide what weight to give that evidence. I have no problem with you presenting the skeptic resources you did although I do not agree with them. I think it is important to stay civil and for each side to act fairly. 15:03, 29 July 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>

Yeah, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a debating forum, and not a place for dumping scientifically indadequte information (Macht's paper is 50 years old, and is not cited in any other paper). Articles should be concise and factual in a relevent manner. I think you are hurting your case by presenting a large volume of low quality "evidence", much of which has not been addressed by scientists simply because it's obviously specious. What do you consider to be the strongest single piece of evidence of divine inspiration of science in the Bible? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 18:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">to: mickwest</span></h3>
<p>Dr. Macht was a medical researcher at John Hopkins. Dr. Macht was published in notable science/medical peer reviewed journals regarding toxicology. Dr. Macht was recognized by the NY Times for being a snake venom expert. Dr. Macht's study was published in John Hopkin's publication. I realize that not many scientist are interested in clean/unclean animal toxicities nor are many peer reviewed publications since most Christians do not see themselves under the Mosaic law and most Orthodox Jews are probably quite content to eat kosher without needing lots of studies. Orthodox Jews have been eating kosher for some time and they never needed Dr. Macht's study since they believe God said to do it which in their eyes is a considerable higher authority than Dr. Macht or John Hopkins. I see the non duplication issue not to be a large one at all. Dr. Macht did multiple test on many differenct kinds of animals. The test he used was recognized by the peer reviewed literature and Dr. Macht said the test used was reliable and gives consistent results in the peer reviewed literature. Also, Dr. Macht's results are confirmed in the case of the swine by the Lancet article I cited in the discussion area. Lastly, the 50 year old is not a large issue either. It is not the newness of studies that are most important but the validity. Logicians refer to this as a appeal to novelty fallacy. I don't think you are going to be able to show studies that Dr. Macht's study was in error. In short, science is always a probabilistic endeavor and the best evidence points to Dr. Macht being correct. It is not like Dr. Macht was some scoundrel or crackpot. A award is still given out in his name at John Hopkins which I don't think they would do if he was a crackpot or scoundrel.</p>
<p>Again, I have no problem with you researching matters and citing material on the skeptical side. I believe in the principle of total evidence and not arbitrarily trying to screen your material out. Post as much of it as you like. However, I do ask for fairness and civility on your part as well. So far I really have no problems with you and I would hope you see this on my side of the aisle as well. I wish to see the civility level to be maintained at their current levels or even improved and for both sides to respect each sides position to be presented. This after all is the stated position of Wikipedia which is neutrality. Let each side present evidence from respectable sources (which John Hopkins and Dr. Macht certainly are) and respectable information and let the readers decide.</p>

He published it in 1953, aged 71, and died 8 years later. Given the factors I mentioned above, there seems to be every reason to believe that either Macht fudged his numbers to fit his beliefs, or that the study is otherwise flawed due to some methodological problems. The study has no scientific value. No scientist would give it credence.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h2>
<p>Specifically to address the NPOV question the following things are required. Although I'm not especially knowledgeable about Christian theology, I think it extremely unlikely that if it has any theological importance or recognition it has not been addressed by more mainstream Biblical scholars.</p>
<p>Now I'd expect them to say that the Bible was intended for deep mystical understanding of ancient peoples, who needn't have waited for the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_revolution.html" title="Scientific revolution">scientific revolution</a> to believe in it. I think this raises some similar theological points that are not addressed, (but I don't know how to express coherently here). One can also discuss the history of the Bible and how it was written and how that affects its contents.</p>
<p>Other points such as Kosher meat, not eating shellfish because they can be poisonous are not really foreknowledge because ancient peoples knew that eating them wasn't a good idea because it gave them tummy ache or worse, but they just didn't know why.</p>
<p>There will be examples of possible predictions that have been contradicted by modern science (try Genesis 1 for a start).</p>
<p>It is important for a discussion of why it would be considered <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> by the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_community.html" title="Scientific community">scientific community</a>.</p>
<p>Until it addresses these issues it just presents one side of the argument.

I think the post above was somewhat emotional. Secondly, logicians rightly say it is not the source of information that is important in science but the validity (genetic fallacy). There is no "fundie science" nor is there "militant atheist science" there is only science data which admittedly needs to be interpreted.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would appreciate it if you did not engage in internet armchair psychological analysis of me. You do not know how unemotional or emotional I am about the scientifc foreknowledge issue. I do rightly believe that the Mayo Clinic and John Hopkins tend to do careful research and are known for judicious material and quality personnel. I therefore infer that Dr. Macht was probably a careful scientist and so far you have given me no information showing otherwise.</p>
<p>Lastly, I do think Dr. Macht's study was somewhat corroborated by the Lancet study.</p>
<p>I cite:</p>
<p>Lancet. 1985 Mar 23;1(8430):681-3.</p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Relationship between pork consumption and cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Nanji AA, French SW.</p>
<p>An investigation of the relationship between per-caput consumption of total fat, beef, and pork in several countries and mortality rates for cirrhosis showed a correlation between alcohol consumption and cirrhosis mortality of 0.64 (p less than 0.01), and a correlation between pork consumption and cirrhosis mortality of 0.40 (p less than 0.05). The correlation between cirrhosis mortality and the product of both alcohol and pork consumption was highly significant (r = 0.98, p less than 0.001). In countries with low alcohol consumption, no correlation was obtained between alcohol consumption and cirrhosis. However, a significant correlation was obtained between cirrhosis and pork. A similar relationship was seen in the ten Canadian provinces, where there was no correlation between cirrhosis mortality and alcohol consumption, but a significant correlation was obtained with pork.</p>

<p>I notice the article was gutted so that the "star" versus were removed. For example, the sands of the sea being compared to the stars was removed along with only 4,000 stars being visible with the naked eye (see: <a href="http://www.bible.org/qa.asp?topic_id=53&amp;qa_id=141" class="external free" title="http://www.bible.org/qa.asp?topic_id=53&amp;qa_id=141" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.org/qa.asp?topic_id=53&amp;qa_id=141</a> ).</p>
<p>I also notice that other parts were gutted.</p>
<p>For example, this was removed:</p>
<p><b>Mosaic Code practices compared to other cultures</b> The ancient Egyptians and other ancient societies of that day had primitive medicine that could be dangerous (For example, 72% of medical 260 presciptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements according to medical experts.). In 18th century medicine, the bleeding of patients was occurring which was not helpful to patients but weakened them. Even today, harmful medicine is recalled.</p>
<p>The Mosaic code on the other hand does not proscribe harmful medical advice and in fact was more preventive in focus. Dr. D. T. Atkinson states regarding the Mosaic code: "In the Bible greater stress was placed upon prevention of disease than was given to the treatment of bodily ailments, and in this no race of people, before or since, has left us such a wealth of laws relative to sanitation and hygiene as the Hebrews."</p>
<p>In respect to the dangerousness of ancient medicine it is appropriate to look at Egyptian medicine since it is well documented and in addition Homer's Odyssey declared "the Egyptians were skilled in medicine more than any other art".</p>
<p>Medical historians have labeled ancient Egyptian medicine "sewage pharmacology" due to the high use of dung and other waste products. For example, donkey dung was put on wounds. While Louis Pasteur found that bacteria in the bodies of humans and animals release byproducts into dung and urine which are antibiotic they are not without risk. For example, it has been found that Pakastani caregivers who use topical antibiotics for their babies circumcision wounds instead of using dung, ghee, urine etc, prevent that babies from getting neo natal tetanus. It is thought that Egyptian medicine which used fly specks, fly dung, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies could be harmful (to stop a baby from crying a seed and fly dung paste mixed with water was given to to babies for four days). The Mosaic code borrows none of the "dung practices" or other dangerous practices of the Egyptians which were said to be skilled in regards to ancient medicine.</p>
<p>In addition this was removed along with other material:</p>
<p>A law ahead of its time <a href="http://www.godstruth.org/chap08" class="external free" title="http://www.godstruth.org/chap08" rel="nofollow">http://www.godstruth.org/chap08</a></p>
<p>Is there a reason you wish to have a strawman presented rather than a mere conveying the relevant facts?</p>
<p>Obviously, gutting the material is a rather contemptible attempt at "winning". The "fundy" comments are not appreciated either from the other side of the aisle either. While I do appreciate your apology regarding the "emotional" comments I do think the other side of the aisle is acting unreasonable. By the way, a website location which has a high ranking at the search engines is going to host this material. Also, I think a site which has heavy traffic will pick it up also. I don't think your attempt at removing this material from the public forum is going to be successful.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is not a "public forum", it's an encyclopedia. The article should be <b>about</b> BSF, describing what it is, not a dumping ground what the supporters of BSK consider to be knowledge. There are ample references, and if you want to write a lot on a particular topic (The unhealthiness of pork, or Egyptian medicine), you should start a new article, and reference it from the appropiate place. I edited for clarity (especially in the introductary paragraph), and I try to present things as point/counterpoint. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 17:40, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>That doesn't explain why the Alan Hayward info and stars info was gutted does it? Also, if the common knowledge argument is to work it should explain why there are no harmful practices listed in the Torah and why the Torah is not littered with ineffectual medicine (although it does have rituals once people are clean as well). Plus, a while a Encyclopedia is not a forum it should be informative and neutral and not suffer the gutting of people who want to remove information arbitrarily. I think most readers understand that in the John Hopkins researcher versus Mickewest match you are greatly mismatched. Also, I did not mean to convey that Wikipedia was a forum in the broadest sense. I meant public square in respect to people being aware of relevant information.</p>
<p>Regardless, your attempts to limit the publics access of this information will likely not be successful given its likely aforementioned future exposure to the public. By the way, I also plan on relaying this information to a widely published author who has written about this general subject already but was not aware of much of this information like the Macht study, Britannica update, lions, etc, etc. I hope you enjoy your pyric momentary victory for it likely will not last.</p>

<p>What is the biblical attitude towards personal hygiene during vaginal bleeding?</p>
<p>Ben-Noun LL.</p>
<p>Department of Family Medicine, Faculty for Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Family Physician Specialist, P.O. Box 572, 82104, Kiryat-Gat, Israel. lbennun@zahav.net.il</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: To analyze biblical passages associated with personal hygiene during vaginal bleeding. According to the Bible, a woman who is menstruating or who has pathological vaginal bleeding is unclean. Anybody who touches such a woman's bed or her personal things is also regarded as unclean and should therefore, wash carefully. Sexual relations are forbidden within 7 days from the beginning of menstruation and during pathological vaginal bleeding. Seven days after the cessation of vaginal bleeding, a woman is considered as clean, and therefore, sexual contacts are permitted. From a modern perspective sexual contacts during menses are associated with the development of chlamydial and gonococcal diseases, the risk of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus infection, endometriosis and subsequent infertility.This report indicates that the roots of contemporary obstetric preventive medicine can be traced to Biblical times.</p>

Mold: "tsara'at," Leviticus, and the history of a confusion.</p>
<p>Heller RM, Heller TW, Sasson JM.</p>
<p>Radiology and Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA. richard.heller@vanderbilt.edu</p>
<p>The noun tsara'at appears about two dozen times in the Hebrew Bible, almost exclusively in Leviticus, where it is used to describe a state of ritual defilement manifested as a scaly condition of the skin, a condition of cloth, leather, and the walls of houses. In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, negac tsara'at was translated as aphe lepras; in the Latin Vulgate, this became plega leprae. These words in Greek and Latin implied a condition that spread over the body, not a term of ritual impurity. Tsara'at has continued to be translated as "leprosy," even though this term is not appropriate, as there was no leprosy as we know it in the Middle East during the time period the Hebrew Bible was written. Others have suggested that the proper translation of tsara'at is "mold." The recent identification of a specific mold (Stachybotrys sp.) that contaminates buildings and causes respiratory distress, memory loss, and rash, and the fact that mold has been present for millennia, lend support to the translation of tsara'at as "mold."</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">TO: the poster of the adventist article regarding Machts work</span></h3>
<p>I think if you are going to critique Dr. Macht's work you need to elaborate more giving both sides of what food is kosher and non-kosher and any possible translation issues (swan). Also, giving both sides, you need to discuss the peer reviewed articles on the test Dr. Macht used.</p>
<p>Below are some resources:</p>
<p>Kosher versus non-kosher fish/seafood:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kashrut.com/articles/fish/" class="external text" title="http://www.kashrut.com/articles/fish/" rel="nofollow">KASHRUT.COM - Kosher and Non-kosher fish</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Macht toxicological test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macht, D.I. and Macht, M.B. : Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine 1941, 26: 597</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Macht, D.I. , Science 1930, 71 :302</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the Science 1930 article:</p>
<p>Summary of Macht, D.I. , Science 1930, 71 :302:</p>
<p><br />
1. Dr. Macht says the results of phytopharmocology (using plants/seed for toxicology) method aforementioned in this thread "are certainly just as reliable as those gathered from animal test subjects, if not more so".</p>
<p>2. Here is a key quote: "....While poisons elaborated or produced by animals or zoologic poisons, are commonly much more toxic for living plant protoplasm than for living plant tissues."</p>
<p>Here is something I read:</p>
<p><br />
QUOTE I obtained a New York Times article in which Dr David Macht, a leading authority on cobra snake venom,.......</p>
<p>taken from: Britinanica versus the Bible at: <a href="http://www.adam.com.au/bstett/BWilliamsvsAnon71to73.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.adam.com.au/bstett/BWilliamsvsAnon71to73.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.adam.com.au/bstett/BWilliamsvsAnon71to73.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
It seems to me as if this is a key point. Dr. Macht is a leading expert in a branch of zoological toxins. The Dr. Macht kosher/non-kosher/meat/fish/ toxin study is attempting to study zoological toxins. Phytopharmocological (plant based) methods appear to be more sensitive to zoological toxins at least at the time of Dr. Macht's study according to Dr. Macht a leading expert on cobra snake venom which is a zoological toxin.</p>
<p>3. It apppears as if Dr. Macht's phytopharmalogical methodology is not as good as zoological based methods for detecting plant based toxins (nicotine atropine, morphine, etc ) and it seems to be in general or at the very least in many cases. For example, alkaloid cocaine is toxic for animals but not the seed growth. However, Dr. Macht was not testing plant based toxins in the Dr. Macht kosher/non-kosher study he was studying meat and fish! Of course this is somewhat of a negative in regards to Dr. Macht's study of kosher and non-kosher food showing divine intelligence but I think this would be like looking at one dandelion on a golf course and saying because of a exception (the one dandelion) the golf course was a total mess especially since Dr. Macht's method seemed to be good for detecting zoological toxins. I am guessing there may be some exceptions but exceptions do not invalidate general principles. BUT one of the byproducts of cocaine hydrolysis is far more sensitive to the seed growth than to animal tissue and which suggest phytopharmocology can be used to detect poisons that ordinary zoopharmicological methods are not readily able to detect.</p>
<p>4. Dr. Macht said phytopharmocology is still in its infancy but in the Dr. Macht kosher versus non-kosher meat study he said he had been using phytopharmocology to detect toxins for 30 years.</p>
<p><br />
So a summary of 1-4 is that overall phytopharmocology is just as reliable if not more so for the toxins that would likely be most relevant in the Dr. Macht kosher/non-kosher/toxin study . Of course, there may be some exceptions in some zoological toxins for diseased people/animals , however, both kosher and non-kosher animals have disease. But exceptions do not invalidate general principles and I will offer a demonstration. For example, normally I do not pull over to the side of the road for cars behind me. However, if it has a red flashing light and a police siren I do. I would encourage people to read the actual article to see some of the details.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So, 75 years ago, <b>Dr Macht</b> said his phytopharmocological methods were good. 50 years ago he used them to vindicate Leviticus. Nobody else seems to have EVER used phytopharmocology for testing animal toxins. I would encourage people to read the <a href="http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/web/ministry-1954-March-p37.htm" class="external text" title="http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/web/ministry-1954-March-p37.htm" rel="nofollow">rebuttal by his peers</a>.

<p>There's a lot of links regarding the posited scientific basis of the health benefits of kosher food. Perhaps there is enough material for a seperate article focussing on that topic?

<p>It appears as if the swan, eel, and related kosher/non-kosher commentary by your scientist was in error. At least if you are to believe some leading Orthodox Jewish organizations.</p>
<p>Secondly, I could find no Bible translation in regards to the Mosaic law which uses the word "coot" (bird) although I am pressed for time. Perhaps, you should give the various translations for the "coot issue" in regards to your scientist commentary for your Adventist scientist source. I realize Bible exegesis is multi-disciplinary and your scientist may be weak in Hebrew and he seems to recognize the fact that his Hebrew is weak.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if you are going to claim my sources are "psuedo" perhaps you should explain why and start with the peer reviewed ones first. For example, why don't you discuss the tetanus issue in regards to using excrement/urine/ghee etc. in relation to one of your sources. Then discuss the "menstruation/disease" citation from the peer reviewed medical literature. I have a feeling you won't do this based on your past performance. It seems the exclusion fallacy is your modus operandi.</p>

<p>While confirming the scientific basis for some of your assertions (non-kosher food is toxic, touching menstuating women is unhealthy, etc.) is useful, the bigger issue is establishing divine inspiration and inerrancy. The vast amount of evidence you are prepared to present does not actually help your case - so far your evidence (if accepted) simply supports the fact that there is useful medical and hygine practices in the bible, and maybe that it was better in some respect than Egyptian medicine. To actually be relevant, you need to demponstrate that there is <b>scientific opinion</b> that the evidence indicates divine inspiration - otherwise you are simply presenting evidence and drawing your own conclusion. Why don't you quote me some peer reviewed papers that claim to show that the Bible contains any statistically meaningful scientific foreknowledge. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 18:18, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

While I defer to the experts in their reasoning why "coot" is always included in the list, I does seem to be because "water-hen" is often used as a translation of the word "tinshemeth" in Lev 11:18, and coot is a kind (myn) of water-hen.</p>
<p>Swan (Heb. <b>tinshemeth</b> ), thus rendered by the Authorized Version in (Leviticus 11:18; 14:16) where it occurs in the list of unclean birds But either of the renderings "porphyrio" (purple <b>water-hen</b>) and "ibis" is more probable. Neither of these birds occurs elsewhere in the catalogue; both would be familiar to residents in Egypt, and the original seems to point to some <b>water-fowl</b>. The purple <b>water-hen</b> is allied to our corn-crake and <b>water-hen</b>, and is the largest and most beautiful of the family <b>Rallidae</b> . It frequents marshes and the sedge by the banks of rivers in all the countries bordering on the Mediterranean and is abundant in lower Egypt. <i>Source: Smith's Bible Dictionary</i></p>

<p>I'd imagine you'd prefer "ibis", but can you then explain why coot is considered unclean? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 20:22, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>TO: mick</p>
<p>I just did a introductory look at Leviticus 11: 18 given the clue of your last post as this being the verse in question. I used <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Lev/Lev011.html#18" class="external free" title="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Lev/Lev011.html#18" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Lev/Lev011.html#18</a> and the various translations there as a introductory look. It seems as if the translators have different opinions. I am guessing it is due to sparse information to base their translations on. I would have to look at the Hebrew exegesis via various Christian, rabbinical, and other scholars. I doesn't appear though at first glance as if the "coot" and "swan" objection has much weight.</p>
<p><br />
I cite the following unclean animal translations and feel free to cite more:</p>
<p>NASB version: Lev 11:18 and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture,</p>
<p>NKJV version: Lev 11:18 the white owl, the jackdaw, and the carrion vulture;</p>
<p>RSV version: Lev 11:18 the water hen, the pelican, the carrion vulture,</p>
<p>KJV version: Lev 11:18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,</p>
<p><br />
Plus the "ask the rabbi" source said the swan was kosher and Dr. Machts test showed less toxic.</p>
<p>If memory serves, the large orthodox Jew organizations say eel is not kosher and Dr. Macht said it was more toxic.</p>
<p>The problem with scientists giving their proclamations about the Bible is that often they fail to do their Bible exegesis which includes translation and cultural issues (what is a scale? for example). Dr. Macht said he likes individuals who are more interdisciplinary in their focus and are well read outside their specialty. I tend to agree.</p>

<p>But two of the "unclean" translations you list are "water hen" (coot is a kind of water-hen) and "swan", both of which Mach said were clean. So my question is: What is the unclean animal refered to by tinshemeth in Lev 11:18, and if not coot, then why is coot considered unclean by everyone? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 22:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Macht's test was verified to be good for zoological toxins in the Journal Science. He got great results and he tested a whole lot of animals. I cited a rabbi who said swans were kosher and Macht said they have low toxicity. Your eel and other seafood arguments are frying on the major kosher website and Jewish organization skittles. You are acting like a desperate atheist trying to throw the "Hail Mary I think it might be a unclean water hen in the Bible" pass while all the while ignoring the bulk of evidence. In the meantime, I have talked to a owner of a high volume site who wants to see my writing based on the links I presented him. Also, another gentleman who makes videos and publishes material and has a website wants to feature some of the information I found. You can stick your finger in the "alleged water hen" hole but I think you should know the dam is bursting. If you think your efforts here at argumentation via the edit key is convincing or effective perhaps you should reconsider.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">POV still affirmed</span></h3>
<p>The practices in the Egyptian papyrus in question had much ineffective medicine and some dangerous medicine which I supported. Your attempt to obscure the issue is duly noted and rejected.</p>
<p>I also state this in regards to Egyptian medicine:</p>
<p>Edwin Smith papyrus</p>
<p>"In 1920, the Society asked James Breasted to translate it, completing it by 1930. It changed medical history, since it showed that medicine on the Egyptian battle field stood in stark contrast with the irrational modes of healing the rest of Ancient Egypt utilized, as exemplified in the Ebers papyrus."</p>
<p>taken from: <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-smith-papyrus" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-smith-papyrus" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-smith-papyrus</a></p>
<p>I assert you are trying to <b>cherry pick</b> and take the best out of Egyptian medicine and that the Ebers papyrus was crude, ineffectual, and had dangerous practices.</p>
<p><br />
In short, I still believe the following is true:</p>
<p>Mosaic Code practices compared to other cultures The ancient Egyptians and other ancient societies of that day had primitive medicine that could be dangerous (For example, 72% of medical 260 presciptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements according to medical experts.). In 18th century medicine, the bleeding of patients was occurring which was not helpful to patients but weakened them. Even today, harmful medicine is recalled.</p>
<p>The Mosaic code on the other hand does not proscribe harmful medical advice and in fact was more preventive in focus. Dr. D. T. Atkinson states regarding the Mosaic code: "In the Bible greater stress was placed upon prevention of disease than was given to the treatment of bodily ailments, and in this no race of people, before or since, has left us such a wealth of laws relative to sanitation and hygiene as the Hebrews."</p>
<p>In respect to the dangerousness of ancient medicine it is appropriate to look at Egyptian medicine since it is well documented and in addition Homer's Odyssey declared "the Egyptians were skilled in medicine more than any other art".</p>
<p>Medical historians have labeled ancient Egyptian medicine "sewage pharmacology" due to the high use of dung and other waste products. For example, donkey dung was put on wounds. While Louis Pasteur found that bacteria in the bodies of humans and animals release byproducts into dung and urine which are antibiotic they are not without risk. For example, it has been found that Pakastani caregivers who use topical antibiotics for their babies circumcision wounds instead of using dung, ghee, urine etc, prevent that babies from getting neo natal tetanus. It is thought that Egyptian medicine which used fly specks, fly dung, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies could be harmful (to stop a baby from crying a seed and fly dung paste mixed with water was given to to babies for four days). The Mosaic code borrows none of the "dung practices" or other dangerous practices of the Egyptians which were said to be skilled in regards to ancient medicine.</p>

<p>It appears as if the Edwin Papyrus, Hearst Payrus, and Ebers Papyrus were written about the same time. Of course, this strengthens my POV claim and that relevant evidence about the ineffectiveness and sometimes harmful medicine of the ancient Egyptians is being supressed and arbitrarily excluded (Please see: <a href="http://www.aams.org.au/contents.php?subdir=library/history/&amp;filename=pharonic_egypt" class="external free" title="http://www.aams.org.au/contents.php?subdir=library/history/&amp;filename=pharonic_egypt" rel="nofollow">http://www.aams.org.au/contents.php?subdir=library/history/&amp;filename=pharonic_egypt</a> ).</p>

<p>Ken, I'm curious as to how you can characterize this as a "forensic science investigation"? Can you give an example? Surely your original contention was that the Bible makes scientific statements that can then be tested, like the Macht study? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 01:06, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would say:</p>
<p>"Surely your original contention was that the Bible <b>made</b> scientific statements that can then be tested, like the Macht study?"</p>
<p>I think this is a important distinction as it puts it partly in the social science of history which is a forensic science. At the present time (and arguablably forever) no man both living or dead can go back in history and write or not write Bible scientific foreknowledge statements. Thus, the question is did or does the Bible have advanced scientific statements in it. To do this we merely need to examine the current science or past science <b>and do it fairly</b> and not cherry pick in relation to the Torah (The Hearst and Eber papyrus are relevant as is the lack of corresponding ineffective/harmful medical practices in the Torah). In regards to the Big Bang theory and other forensic science questions in that we cannot go back in history but must rely on forensic science investigations because history is not repeatable.</p>

In the meantime, I suggest looking the Alan Hayward link and the lion links in particular since these links bring up points which can be commented on quickly although the other links certainly have very germaine information as well. My next suggestion would be for a Wikipedian to fairly comment on the St. Peter/nuclear fission and snake material in a scholarly tone and then sequentially go down the links and make other commentary. Also, if anyone does an investigation via the internet and written sources they will find more germaine Bible scientific foreknowledge info and my links are certainly not the last word on this subject.</p>

<p>Ken, I'm afraid I've got to go away for a few days. I must thank you for introducing me to a number of interesting topics, specifically comparative ancient medicine. Should the article not be deleted by the time I return, then I look forward to continuing to contribute. I do suggest though, that as you consider Hebrew medicine to be a significant advance on Egyptian medicine (and in some ways more advance than C19th medicine) that you add a section to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_medicine.html" title="History of medicine">history of medicine</a> page, to put things in proper contex. I feel the focusing on matters like vegetarian lions, strangling lions, regurgitating rabbits, snakes' ears, etc., are not going to help your argument, as they are so open to intepretation, and can all be explained by simple observation (or in the case of the lion, it got its protein from milk and eggs, and died young). You are simply putting up easy targets, and making the article seem far less scientific. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 16:22, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears the lion experts changed their ideas in the late 1970's in regards to how lions kill their prey. It appears as if Schaller examined the lions kiling their prey for 2,900 hours and did autopsies to see how lions killed their prey.

<p>I am impressed with your Dr. Macht research in the bio section. Here is a tip for further research regarding Dr. macht being a snake venom expert as reported by the NY times.</p>
<p>Here is the quote:</p>
<p>"I obtained a New York Times article in which Dr David Macht, a leading authority on cobra snake venom, claimed cobras hear the music of snake charmers and that the Bible agrees with this but that biologists since the time of Shakespeare had taught that snakes are deaf.

<p><br />
Also see:</p>
<p>"Dr. David I. Macht, research pharmacologist of the Mount Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, is one of the worldâs leading authorities on cobra snake venom. (Cobra venom is an accepted medication, in blood disorders for instance.)</p>
<p>Dr. Macht reported that in working with cobras and cobra venom he became acquainted with a number of Hindu physicians, well educated, and from different parts of India. All agreed that cobras respond to some musical tones"</p>

<p>Well, if the Hindus knew it, then what is so surprising about the Hebrews knowing it? Are you claiming some Hindu Scientific Foreknowledge? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 00:43, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The NY times article (Jan 10, 1954, pg. E9) was only about if the snakes are charmed by the music or the motion of the charmer. I quote: "Zoologists have scoffed. Snakes do not have a highly developed sense of hearing, some said. Others have maintained that snakes are stone deaf".</p>
<p>The NY Times also reports the hearing abilities of cobras as common knowledge: "Indian children [...] are warned not to sing lest their sounds attract cobras, [Dr Macht] said".</p>
<p>I think the "snakes can hear" does not really qualify as even potential BSF, as it's an easy observation that even children can make. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 00:58, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not think the Bible saying snakes can hear can be used to show divine inspiration although it could show the Bible had foreknowledge. Also, it could be be used to show that there are cases where the scientific consensus is wrong and the Bible was right. With that being said, I like the Investigator Magazine and they seem to relish revising the Britannica. LOL</p>
<p><b>However,</b> the main reason I gave you the snake info was in case you wanted to look up the other NY Times article on Dr. Macht since I do appreciate your efforts in researching the Dr. Macht bio info and you seemed to have some interest in this area.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">St. Peter and nuclear fission</span></h3>
<p>I would like to hear about including this information in the article:</p>
<p>"Fulfillment: There are a number of fascinating words in this prophecy:</p>
<p>"Elements" - The ancient Greeks thought there were 4 elements (earth, air, fire, and water). the English word "element" comes to us from the Latin "elementum", which is a translation of the Greek word "stoicheion" used here by Peter. Liddell and Scott in their Greek-English Lexicon claimed that in the field of physics "stoicheia" was defined as "the components into which matter is divided." In today's English, "stoicheia" would be expressed by the word "atoms".</p>
<p>"Destroyed" - The Greek is "luo", which means to "break up" or "melt". It is translated "unloose" in Mark 1:7, Luke 3:16, John 1:27, and Acts 13:25, in connection with John the Baptist's declaration that he was not worthy to untie the latchet on Christ's shoe. After raising Lazarus from the dead, Christ commanded that he was to be untied. "Loose him," He said (John 11:44). As the word is used in the New Testament, it conveyes the thought of setting free something that has been bound.</p>
<p>The elemental particles of matter, which we now call atoms, will be dissolved, untied, released. Their energies, now imprisoned, will be set free. The principle of nuclear fission, which is the base of the atomic bomb, is clearly implied in Peter's words.</p>
<p>"Roar" - Comes from a single Greek word found nowhere else in the New Testament: "rhoizedon". It refers to the whizzing of an arrow rushing to its target. According to W.E. Vine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, the word also signifies "with rushing sound as of roaring flames."</p>
<p>"Fire" - A translation of the Greek word "kausoo", a medical term denoting a fever. Peter's use of it is said to be the only known application of the word to inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Peter accurately described the untying of the atom and the resulting rushing, fiery destruction that follows it."</p>

<p>You are shooting yourself in the foot if you add that. It seems like a prime example of wishful thinking. You take what seems like a poetic description of the end of the world, which could be read in many different ways, and attempt to showhorn it into a specific interpretation. The word "rhoizedon", as a hapaxlegomenon, is obviously open to a variety of interpretations. Any specific interpretation of a phrase including a hapaxlegomenon is always suspect. The fact that the word is only used once also does not make the verse special - word distribution follows <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipf%27s_law.html" title="Zipf's law">zipf's law</a>, meaning there will inevitably be a large number of words used only once.</p>
<p>The greater problem here is that you are writing your own opinions into the article. As an encyclopedia editor, you should be reporting facts. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 19:20, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, no. It was only certain greeks who believed in the 4 elements. Others believed in atomic theory. Indeed that is where we get the word "Atom" from. E.g. <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democritus.html" title="Democritus">democritus</a> (5th century BC)</p>
<p>And taking Peter's words to be about fission is completely wishful thinking. They could equally describe <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grape_shot.html" title="Grape shot">grape shot</a>, which plausibly existed at the time, and a number of other things. It could be a prediction of what happens when you put a CD in a microwave. This is ridiculous. Where is the mushroom cloud? --francis 11:10, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since, as it says, it would only be foreknowledge if the crucifixion account was <b>made up</b>!

</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Here is the full info from footnote 10 above:</b></p>
<p>"A medical doctor named Samuel Houghton, a great physÂ­iologist from the University of Dublin, wrote the following concerning the physical cause of Jesusâ death:</p>
<p>âWhen the soldier pierced with his spear the side of Christ, He was already dead; and the flow of blood and water that followed was either a natural phenomenon explicable by natural causes or it was a miracle. That St. John thought it, if not to be miraculous, at least to be unusual, appears plainly from the comment he makes upon it, and from the emphatic manner in which he solemnly declares his accuracy in narrating it.</p>
<p>Repeated observations and experiments made upon men and animals have led me to the following results-When the left side is freely pierced after death by a large knife, comparable in size with a Roman spear, three distinct cases may be noted:</p>
<p>1st. No flow of any kind follows the wound, except a slight trickling of blood.</p>
<p>2nd. A copious flow of blood only follows the wound.</p>
<p>3rd. A flow of water only, succeeded by a few drops of blood, follows the wound.</p>
<p>Of these three cases, the first is that which usually occurs; the second is found in cases of death by drowning and by strychnia, and may be demonstrated by destroying an animal with that poison, and it can be proved to be the natural case of a crucified person; and the third is found in cases of death from pleurisy, pericarditis, and rupture of the heart. With the foregoing cases most anatomists who have devoted their attention to this subject are familiar; but the two following cases, although readily explicable on physiological principles, are not recorded in the books (except by St. John). Nor have I been fortunate enough to meet with them.</p>
<p>4th. A copious flow of water, succeeded by a copious flow of blood, follows the wound.</p>
<p>5th. A copious flow of blood, succeeded by a copious flow of water, follows the wound.</p>
<p>Death by crucifixion causes a condition of blood in the lungs similar to that produced by drowning and strychnia; the fourth case would occur in a crucified person who had previously to crucifixion suffered from pleuÂ­ritic effusion; and the fifth case would occur in a crucified person, who had died upon the cross from rupture of the heart. The history of the days preceding our Lord's crucifixion effectually excludes the supposition of pleurisy, which is also out of the question if blood first and water afterwards followed the wound. There remains, therefore, no supposiÂ­tion possible to explain the recorded phenomenon except the combination of the crucifixion and rupture of the heart.</p>
<p>That rupture of the heart was the cause of the death of Christ is ably maintained by Dr. William Stroud; and that rupture of the heart actually occurred I firmly believeâ¦</p>
<p>(The apostle John recording a minutely detailed description of his observations at Golgotha. Houghton came to the following conclusion)</p>
<p>The importance of this is obvious. It (shows) that the narrative in St. John xix. Could never have been invented; that the facts recorded must have been seen by an eyewitness and that the eyewitness was so astonished that he apparently thought the phenomenon miraculous.â</p>

<p><b>Here is the full quote of Dr. Houghton taken from footnote number 11:</b></p>

<p>Ken, I have read the material. I agree with the conclusions (Jesus was dead. The water and blood incident was recorded by an eyewitness. The eyewitness thought is was a miracle". None of this is in dispute. None of the conclusions in Houghton imply any kind of foreknowledge. What forekowledge does it take to record the observations of an eyewitness? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 20:06, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And here's the quote actually in question: John 19:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>34 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</i></dd>
<dd><i>35 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>See John goes to great length to say "this is an eyewitness account". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 20:36, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">to: mickwest</span></h3>
<p>In all probability, the writer of John thought it was miraculous. At the time, it was likely thought to be impossible. It wasn't impossible as we know now and at the time of Dr. Houghton who was a member of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> and highly knowledgeable. Thus, the Bible likely contains scientific foreknowledge. I am restoring the material.</p>

<p>Ken, I appreciate that you are entering into debate on this, and I'll leave the matererial there while we thrash things out here. I've got to pop out for a while, but I urge you to consider the implications of claiming this is foreknowledge. To do so is essentially claim that the write of John made up the account <b>based on divine scientific foreknowledge</b>. I don't think you are claiming this. I think you have simply be a little overeager to incorporate this as an example of potential foreknowledge. BRB <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 20:56, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Let me try and clarify matters.</p>
<p>The material you quoted notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bible states that when Jesus was pierced in the side, blood and water immediately came out</li>
<li>This only happens to dead people.</li>
<li>The Bible states this event was seen by at least one person, who later related it to the writer of John.</li>
<li>Medical knowledge was not advanced enough to figure out what might happen when a dead person is stabbed without actually seeing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>and concludes</p>
<ul>
<li>The events must have happened as described, since nobody could make it up, hence Jesus died on the cross.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ken notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Medical knowledge was not advanced enough to figure out what might happen when a dead person is stabbed without actually seeing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>and concludes</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bible has medical foreknowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do you reach a different conclusion? Your conclusion implies that the account of the blood and water was made up by someone with medical foreknowledge. Is that your contention?</p>

<p>That is not what I am saying. I am saying the Bible has expressed a event which shows "Biblical scientific foreknowledge". John needn't have known this. I am guessing Moses did not do toxicity test via phytopharmocology or work as a medical researcher at Johns Hopkins University like Dr. Macht. LOL</p>

How exactly is the <b>reporting of an eyewitness account</b> indicitive of <b>foreknowledge</b>? If I stabbed a dead body in the side, and blood and water came out, and I wrote a description of this, then where is the foreknowledge? I simply observe something (blood and water), and write down what happened. That is what the bible says ON THE NEXT LINE: <i>And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</i> John 19:35. How do you reconcile your claim with this? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 22:00, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Ken, if you don't respond to the above, I'll assume you don't mind if I remove the crucifiction material tomorrow. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 03:31, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is the definition of Biblical scientific foreknowledge according to the article (and I believe you wrote this):</p>
<p>"Biblical scientific foreknowledge is the belief that the Bible contains scientific knowledge that shows an understanding of science beyond that presumed to exist at the time the Bible was written."</p>
<p>Nowhere does it say the author has to understand the scientific foreknowledge. The Gospel of John verse is Biblical. It contains scientific foreknowledge. I am putting it back in.</p>

<p>I've not taken it out, as I'd like to discuss it first, and if we can't reach an agreement, then we should ask for a third opinion. I'd just moved it down the page, as it was in an inappropiate place, now it's just before the Macht Study. I've removed the duplicate, but your paragraph is still there for now.</p>
<p>Most of the other points you make can at least be argued one way or the other, but I think you are basing the crucifixion claim on a misreading of Cook/McDowell/Houghton. Can you explain how an eyewitness account of something demonstrates medical foreknowledge? If you were there, and you saw the blood and water, then you later write "at once blood and water came out", are you not simply writing down what you saw? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 17:25, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a>. If we accept the definition of scientific foreknowledge above, the John verse fails the test: it makes no assertion, or even implication, of understanding of the mechanism behind the observation.

<p>I maintain what went on in the Gospel of John's author's head is irrelevant in relation to the definition of given for Biblical scientific foreknowledge.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of Biblical scientific foreknowledge according to the article (and I believe you wrote this):</p>
<p>"Biblical scientific foreknowledge is the belief that the Bible contains scientific knowledge that shows an understanding of science beyond that presumed to exist at the time the Bible was written."</p>

The verse in question is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>John 19:34-35 (NRSV) <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/browser.cgi?passage=john+19.34-35" class="external autonumber" title="http://bible.oremus.org/browser.cgi?passage=john+19.34-35" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>
<dl>
<dd><i>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once blood and water came out.</i></dd>
<dd><i>(He who saw this has testified so that you also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now this is a description of what happened when Jesus was pierced in the side. As it says: blood and water came out. It is just a simple description of what happened. The event itself is significant as evidence that Jesus died on the cross, and that is why researchers refer to it.</p>
<p>In addition, you do not give any references to anyone who considers this to be scientific foreknowledge, and it should be removed on the basis of being original research. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 21:28, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
