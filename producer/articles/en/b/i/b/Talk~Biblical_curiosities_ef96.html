	    <p><i>Psalm 46:3</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Psalm 46:9</p>
<dl>
<dd>He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As sometimes presented: the forty-sixth word in the psalm is "shake" (in verse 3 above). If we decide, for some reason, not to count the "selah" at the end, the forty-sixth word from the end (in verse 9 above) is "spear." William Shakespeare was baptized in 1564, and could arguably have been 46 years old when the King James version was published in 1611, or when the translation was completed. Therefore: William Shakespeare was secretly one of the King James translators.</dd>

<p>The "and when they rose in the morning, they were all dead corpses" doesn't merit inclusion here. It's not really famous or notable for anything and seems to be added here only due to someone's misunderstanding of the language in the King James Version of the Bible. "They" could refer to the people inside the besieged city, or to the remaining soldiers in the camp. "they were all dead corpses" might be rendered as "there were all dead corpses" in a less archaic mode of writing. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilsor_f92e.html" title="User:Silsor">silsor</a> 06:37, Mar 7, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand. The KJV text is:</p>

<p>I'm snipping the comment</p>
<dl>
<dd>One probable explanation is that when one of the Thirty died, someone else would be recognized to replace them. Thus, at the time of the writing, there were probably 30 living, with seven who might have died (in battle, or for natural causes).<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>because, <i>as written,</i> it appears to be personal speculation.

<p>I was reading the chapter and noticed there are 36 names given in all:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
2 Samuel 23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in
the seat, chief among the captains; the same was <b>Adino</b> the Eznite: he lift up his spear
against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
9 And after him was <b>Eleazar</b> the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men
with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
the men of Israel were gone away:
10 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the
sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
to spoil.
11 And after him was <b>Shammah</b> the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were
gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people
fled from the Philistines.
12 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the
LORD wrought a great victory.
13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the
cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
14 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of
Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
16 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of
the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
17 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the
men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
these three mighty men.
18 And <b>Abishai</b>, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he
lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
19 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained
not unto the first three.
20 And <b>Benaiah</b> the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done
many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of
a pit in time of snow:
21 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he
went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
with his own spear.
22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
23 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David
set him over his guard.
24 <b>Asahel</b> the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; <b>Elhanan</b> the son of Dodo of
Bethlehem,
25 <b>Shammah</b> the Harodite, <b>Elika</b> the Harodite,
26 <b>Helez</b> the Paltite, <b>Ira</b> the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
27 <b>Abiezer</b> the Anethothite, <b>Mebunnai</b> the Hushathite,
28 <b>Zalmon</b> the Ahohite, <b>Maharai</b> the Netophathite,
29 <b>Heleb</b> the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, <b>Ittai</b> the son of Ribai out of Gibeah
of the children of Benjamin,
30 <b>Benaiah</b> the Pirathonite, <b>Hiddai</b> of the brooks of Gaash,
31 <b>Abialbon</b> the Arbathite, <b>Azmaveth</b> the Barhumite,
32 <b>Eliahba</b> the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, <b>Jonathan</b>,
33 <b>Shammah</b> the Hararite, <b>Ahiam</b> the son of Sharar the Hararite,
34 <b>Eliphelet</b> the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, <b>Eliam</b> the son of
Ahithophel the Gilonite,
35 <b>Hezrai</b> the Carmelite, <b>Paarai</b> the Arbite,
36 <b>Igal</b> the son of Nathan of Zobah, <b>Bani</b> the Gadite,
37 <b>Zelek</b> the Ammonite, <b>Naharai</b> the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of
Zeruiah,
38 <b>Ira</b> an Ithrite, <b>Gareb</b> an Ithrite,
39 <b>Uriah</b> the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
</pre>
<p><br />
Though this may be a scribal error, I am not so sure. I suspect the 37 refers not to the "30" but rather to the "mighty men" described in v. 37. So though there are 30, we see continually a theme of apparently two groups of 3 outside these 30.</p>
<p>Eleazer is said to be one of the first three, and apparently behind Adino, with Shammah the last of the 3 (who is also in the list. But then it says this:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
2 Samuel 23:13 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time
unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
</pre>
<pre>
18 And <b>Abishai</b>, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he
lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
19 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained
not unto the first three.
</pre>
<p><br />
That v. 19 is key. We see now there are 6 outside the original 30. The "three of the thirty chief" are now considered a specific 3 for their valiant deed, yet as not attaining to "the first three." So there are now 2 groups of 3 altogether, aside from the 30. The second group includes Abishai, Benaiah, and someone else not listed, perhaps Joab?</p>
<p>Where it gets confusing is now seeing some are listed more then once. Shammah and Benaiah both are since they were apparently originally of the 30, but then counted in this second group of 3.</p>
<p>So so far there are 2 groups of 3, one a new one that has men from the old group of 30 and one apparently who we don't know yet. So of the 31 at the bottom, add the first group of 3 for 34 so far. And if the yet unknown person of the 2nd group of 3 should not be in the list at the bottom, that still makes only 35... but it's closer to explaining things.</p>
<p>And honestly, I don't have a full answer yet, and am just figuring this out as I go.</p>
<p>I notice the list has similar names to that in 1 Chronicles 11 though so let's go there and see what that looks like.</p>
<p>Very interesting... the two accounts look identical almost, don't they?</p>
<p>I'm going to contrast them for differences... AHA! (this feels almost like a treasure hunt) :)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
1 Chronicles 11:6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and
captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
</pre>
<p><br />
We can see here Joab is the chief of one of the 2 groups of 3. That would make sense since he was mentioned in 2 Samuel 23, just seemingly as a relative rather then one of the number. Let's see, next is mentioned Jashobeam in v. 11, who we didn't see mentioned in the other passage at all.</p>
<p>In v. 15 we see the pattern again of a 2nd group of 3 created... OHHH... I just realized... Joab isn't one of EITHER of the 2 groups of 3... He's the head of them ALL... that makes sense since he's said to be commander in chief essentially to David elsewhere and is so heavily mentioned in the Bible. That means Jashobeam must be the last missing member of the 2 groups of 3, making for 7 in all outside the group of 30.</p>
<p>But since Shammah and Benaiah were mentioned in the 1st list of 31 from the original passage, they get subtracted from those 31, making only 29 to add to the 7, making 36. Some apparently were added to replace the absences in the 30 of those moving up the ranks to the 7, so maybe we'll be able to figure out more from the list.</p>
<p>In verses 20-22 we see Abishai and Benaiah repeated as 2 of the 7 once more, but now it seems Jashobeam is the 3rd in the group.</p>
<p>WOW....</p>
<p>I was just contrasting the 2 accounts, and I think HERE is the problem. But see for yourself, compare the 2 lists:</p>
<pre>

<p>I'm beginning to think I might be out of my league trying to decipher all this... Umm...</p>
<p>The following names remain the same in both lists [if city is in parentheses it means the city/family names differ slightly in each list, if name then the names differ slightly]:</p>
<p>Asahel, Elhanan, Shammah (city, name), Helez the Paltite (city), Ira, Abiezer (city), Maharai, Heled (name), Ithai (name), Benaiah, Hurai (name), Abiel (name), Azmaveth (city), Eliahba, Jonathan (city), Ahiam (city), Eliphal (name, city), Hezro (name), Zelek, Naharai (city), Ira, Gareb, Uriah .</p>
<p>Now the trick is figuring out if any of the remaining ones are the same. Here's the verses again, but with the names/sections taken out where we've found matches, to narrow down who's left:</p>
<pre>
2 Samuel 23:25 <b>Elika</b> the Harodite, 
34 <b>Eliam</b> the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
36 <b>Igal</b> the son of Nathan of Zobah, <b>Bani</b> the Gadite,
</pre>
<pre>
1 Chronicles 11:36 <b>Ahijah</b> the Pelonite,
38 <b>Joel</b> the brother of Nathan, <b>Mibhar</b> the son of Haggeri,
41 <b>Zabad</b> the son of Ahlai,
42 <b>Adina</b> the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with
him,
43 <b>Hanan</b> the son of Maachah, and <b>Joshaphat</b> the Mithnite,
44 <b>Uzzia</b> the Ashterathite, <b>Shama</b> and <b>Jehiel</b> the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,

47 <b>Eliel</b>, and <b>Obed</b>, and <b>Jasiel</b> the Mesobaite.
</pre>
<p>EDIT- I removed from the above list the following: Ilai/Zalmon (v. 28, 29, reason - same city name, early in list), Mebunna/Sibbecai (v. 27, 29, reason - same city name, early in list), "the son of the Maachathite"/Hepher (v. 34, 36, reason - similar city name, spot in list, apparently name just wasn't given in Samuel list), Paarai/Naarai (v. 35, 37, reason - very similar first names, similar city names, and same spot in lists)</p>
<p>Any ideas? Eliam (v. 34) might be the same as Eliel (v. 47) but without a city name it makes it harder to be sure. Elika (v. 25) might be the same as Ahijah (v. 36) but the names are close somewhat, but not so much the city names.</p>
<p>Either way, it looks like for whatever reason, there are another 15 in the Chronicles list then in the Samuel list, confusing things all the more. Many match up but it's like one list was compiled years afterward or something because of all the slight name changes.</p>
<p>Ohh... it says the Chronicles list is just one of the valiant men of the armies (v. 26), not necessarily whatever 37 grouping is the Samuel list. Interestingly, there are 45 listed in the bottom list for 1 Chronicles 11 and only 31 for the 2 Samuel list. I suppose though, knowing that Joab when mentioned in 2 Samuel 23:18 is to be counted among the 3 group makes 1 more, which I believe brings to 37 all known valiant men in 2 Samuel ch. 23... although that still doesn't explain where the Jashobeam guy from 1 Chronicles 11 fits in among the 2 groups of 3. Maybe he came in later?</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just my musings on the topic. Feel free to tell me what you think. Here's a final sorting of all charachters in 2 Samuel 23 [reminder, see v. 23 to note 2 groups of 3]:</p>
<pre>
"Chief and captain" of all, 2nd only to David [1 Chr. 11:6]: Joab (v. 18)
</pre>
<pre>
1st 3 "mighties" [see 1 Chr. 11:12 for name]: Adino (v. 8), Eleazar (v. 9), Shammah (v. 11)
2nd 3 : Abishai (v. 18), Benaiah (v. 23) [
</pre>
<pre>
Remaining 
</pre>
<pre>
1-Asahel (v. 24)
2-Elhanan (v. 24)
3-Shammah (v. 25) [note-not to be confused with Shammah the Hararite of v. 11, 33, who has been
removed from list as he should be]
4-Elika (v. 25)
5-Helez the Paltite (v.26) 
6-Ira (v. 26) 
7-Abiezer (v. 27) 
8-Mebunnai (v. 27) 
9-Zalmon (v. 28) 
10-Maharai (v. 28) 
11-Heleb (v. 29)  
12-Ittai (v. 29) 
13-Hiddai (v. 30) 
14-Abialbon (v. 31)  
15-Azmaveth (v. 31)
16-Eliahba (v. 32) 
17-Jonathan (v. 32) 
18-Ahiam (v. 33) 
19-Eliphelet (v. 34)
20-son of the Maachathite? (v. 34) [note the blank where a name should be, perhaps the human
writer did not know it?  Perhaps Hepher of 1 Chr. 11:36] 
21-Eliam (v. 34)
22-Hezrai (v. 35)
23-Paarai (v. 35)
24-Igal (v. 36)
25-Bani (v. 36) 
26-Zelek (v. 37) 
27-Naharai (v. 37)
28-Ira (v. 38)
29-Gareb (v. 38)
30-Uriah (v. 39)
</pre>
<p>Ultimately it does add up to 36 people, all told. The study of 1 Chr. 11 shone where the misreading was, v. 20 was overlooked since it didn't have a name until doing a thorough analysis it appeared a name should be there, apparently Hepher's. Also, Joab as one of the 2 groups of 3 shows up, and is now apparent his name does not appear accidentally as a relative in v. 18, but is to be included among all these.</p>
<p>Remaining questions to be asked: Since Jashobeam is revealed to be the missing member of the 7 key leaders and described as "the chief of the captains" in 1 Chr. 11:11, is he the missing 37th member? Could he be referred to somewhere in this chapter that we are not seeing?</p>
<p>AHA! I have it. By using cross-references, I found Jashobeam referenced in 1 Chronicles 27:2 (also another list of all charachters involved again). And from there, the reference points back to, where? 2 Samuel 23:8. Someone in there must be Jashobeam, but who?</p>
<pre>
2 Samuel 23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in
the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear
against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
</pre>
<p>It would seem from reading Adino and the Tachmonite are one in the same... but what if they're not? Jashobeam is called in 1 Chronicles 11:11, "Jashobeam, the HACHMONITE". Hmm... and yet... since Adino and Eznite are both words appearing only once in the Bible, I must honestly conclude Jashobeam is not a missing member here. Rather, him and Adino are one and the same, he is Jashobeam the H/Tachmonite, also known as Adino the Eznite.</p>
<p>So that solves the riddle above. Joab perhaps is the 6th member of the 2 groups of 3, rather then perhaps the leader of them all. Which would mean there is still one member missing somehow... oh. wait. umm. that can't be... could David count HIMSELF as one of the mighty men in 2 Samuel 23? Then that WOULD bring the total to 37... and since all 6 leadership positions of 2 groups of 3 would be filled, and the 30 member total of non-leaders... it wouldn't make him break into any of those and thus break that...</p>
<p>I wonder... could David himself be the 37th? The giant killer and one of the greatest warriors in the Bible, the Psalmist who fought even until he was practically on his deathbed? The old guy had to be told by his own people not to go out to war any more...</p>
<pre>
2 Samuel 21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down,
and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
16 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three
hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain
David.
17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him.
Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle,
that thou quench not the light of Israel.
</pre>
<p>Could he be the 37th warrior? If so, the entire equation is over and done with. Every member would indeed be listed... no scribal errors, just very hard to figure out, that's all... interesting. In 2 Samuel 23:39 it says 37 in all, but not that the number excluded David, the leader of them all... it simply states the total... so David... could be the 37th.</p>

<p>I couldn't help noticing one of the verses quoted concerns Satyrs and Lilith. I want to check on here before I attempt posting, but would it be a good idea for me to add some other notable verses relating to pagan rituals?</p>
<p>Apparent references to something very similar to Christmas trees, and God's condemnation of them as idols:</p>
<pre>
Jeremiah 10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at 
the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work
of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it
move not.
5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
