<h2><span class="mw-headline">pseudoscience charge</span></h2>
<p>Mickwest wrote with a few comments by me: "BSF is often related to the mainly fundamentalist Christian <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">Creation science</a> movement and many of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html#Scientific_criticisms_of_creation_science" title="Creation science">same criticisms</a> made against creation science also are made against BSF. Specifically that its lack of adherence to the standards of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> mean that BSF, cannot be said to be scientific, at least not in the way that science is conventionally understood and utilized. As a result, scientists characterize BSF as pseudoscience. However, advocates of BSF contend that the investigation is a forensic science investigation and to ask for repeatable experiments is unreasonable. For example, the universe beginning was a one time event and cannot be duplicated though experiments."</p>
<p><br />
<b>WHY THIS IS ORIGINAL RESEARCH, UNSUBSTANTIATED, AND MISDIRECTED</b></p>
<p>1. BSF is a belief and not a science. I did not see any Christian websites or Jewish websites calling it a science. Bible prophecy is a belief too and not a science.</p>
<p>2. This is original research. Since no Christians or Jews have called Bible scientific foreknwledge a science its critics have not called it a pseudoscience.</p>
<p>3. Which scientists have called the general area of BSF a pseudoscience? I don't see where this claim was ever substantiated.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 16:57, 3 September 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>
<p>The characterization of BSF as pseudoscience is in part based on it being closely related to Creation Science. Most scientists characterized CS as PS. BSF is a small sideshow to CS and most scientist are not even aware of it. The fact that scientists are generally unaware of a fringe subject does not lend it validity. Most scientists are unaware of the science of dowsing for tumors with pendulums, yet that does not make it any less of a pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Anything that claims to be scientific, particularly something that makes such extraordinary claims as BSF, bears the burden of evidence. Is there any indication that the "scientific" claims meet any standard of modern science? Clearly not. Does it meet the criteria that most scientists would agree with as constituting pseudoscience? Yes it does. You do not need to conduct a survey of scientists to establish this any more than you would suvey them on the scientific basis for pendulum dowsing. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 18:56, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">what I wrote an admin about, plus.....</span></h2>
<p>Here is an abridged statement I made to an admin who has offered to help me in the past when problems arose regarding certain individuals:</p>
<p><br />
"[Two individuals] are trying though edits to make my material buried in long documents hid in footnotes and not brought out while [a certain person's]] material is front and center in the area <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_scientific_foresight.html" title="Biblical scientific foresight">Biblical scientific foresight</a> For example, if the Egyptians used fly dung and other dung a lot in their medicine (historians of medicine have called ancient Egyptian medicine "sewage pharmocology") and this can cause tetanus it should be brought out and not hid in some big document. This is the biggest area I could use your help in. If you could work this out though the mechanisms Wickipedia offers I would appreciate this."</p>
<p>Secondly, while I do not agree with the pseudoscience opinion I had a overly restrictive definition of pseudoscience. Pseudoscience can be a theory or a body of alleged knowledge as not necessarily have to call itself I social science or physical science discipline. Again, I think it is errant to call BSF pseudoscience but I am willing to not have a overly restrictive definition of it so its detractors are not allowed to voice their opinions about it although as I stated before I disagree with them.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">regarding the Lancet/pork study</span></h2>
<p>Someone wrote:</p>
<p>A 1985 study by Nanji and French found that there was a significant correlation between cirrhosis and pork consumption (Macht claimed that swine meat was more toxic than the animal meat the Bible called clean). [38]. <b>However the study use a small number of data points, and may have been a spurious relationship.</b></p>
<p><br />
Could you be more explicit? If I am not mistaken Lancet is one of Britains premier medical journals if not the premiere medical journal. I don't see them publishing flimsy and spurious science based very limited data as a general practice although certainly no person or institution is perfect.</p>

<p>I am researching some new BSF areas.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Little Tyke (veggie lion)</span></h2>
<p>There seem to be rather a lot of external links in the "Little Tyke" section. Nearly all of them are Christian or Vegetarian websites that contain a paraphrasing of the original children's book <a href="http://remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Children's/Little-Tyke-small.pdf" class="external text" title="http://remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Children's/Little-Tyke-small.pdf" rel="nofollow">Little Tyke</a> (which should also be linked). The story seems to be based entirely on this book, with NO sources of verification of aspect of the story regarding not eating meat. Unless some other source is found, I would consider the vegeterian part of the story too suspect to be included as fact. I'll edit it appropiately in a few days, pending comments. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 03:47, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>to: Mickwest</b> Entirely wrong. You didn't mention the swami's vegetarian lion. Second, you failed to mention the domestic cat experiment and observations. Third, if you wish to assert the Little Tyke book is a lie you need to demonstrate this matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely, kdbuffalo</p>
<p><br />
kdbuffalo, I'd appreciate it if you could log in when making edits or entries to talk pages. Since you seems to be editing from various IP addresses, it makes it difficult to follow the discussions, and raises the possiblity of someone impersonating you. This will also allow you to sign with ~~~~</p>
<p>Regarding "Little Tyke" (which is the only subject I was addressing, the swami lion and domestic cats are seperate topics), surely the burden of proof lies with the claimant? For you to use Little Tyke as evidence, you need to establish the veracity of the <a href="http://remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Children's/Little-Tyke-small.pdf" class="external text" title="http://remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Children's/Little-Tyke-small.pdf" rel="nofollow">Little Tyke</a> story. Since there is nothing available other than abstracts of the original book, then really the book is the only evidence you have. This does not seem like very stong evidence, and the section should accurately reflect the actual evidence. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 20:44, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But what Noah feed the lions on in the Ark? He must have fed them vegetables because animals for meat'd take up too much space. I know, I'll scientifically test it, - next time I go to the zoo, I'll take some brocolli.

<p>If you can name a dangerous Hebrew medicine practice then do it. Please cite medical authorities such as I did. I notice that none were offered so far. Lastly, I do recall reading in my internet sources a believer in BSF saying that Moses did not borrow any of the dangerous practices of the Egyptians. If not, then I know Grant Jeffrey did in one of his books. Believers in BSF believe this. Not original research.</p>

Addendum:</p>
<p>I found this:</p>
<p>To understand how unique these laws are, we need to compare them with the cultures that should have influenced Moses when he wrote the first five books of the Old Testament. It is mentioned in Homer's Odyssey that "the Egyptians were skilled in medicine more than any other art", yet most of Egyptian medicine consisted of a series of fruitless rituals and grotesque concoctions that would intensify disease in most cases, rather than cure it. Egyptian doctors would advise a mixture of worm's blood and ass's dung to treat imbedded splinters. People with any form of eye disease were required to rub gall of tortoise mixed with honey in their eyes, and then have repeated washings of cattle urine mixed with pig bile. As a matter of fact, waste products figured so often in the prescriptions that medical historians have labelled the Egyptian practice as sewage pharmacology. Babylonia, the other predominant culture at the time the Mosaic Law was recorded, used the same products only for a different reason. They used swine's fat and all kinds of excrement because they believed that these products would disgust the demon that inflicted the disease and the demon would leave the patient.</p>
<p><b>Pretty disgusting stuff today, yet you would think that if these culture's medical practices were so respected by the rest of the world, the Bible would just mimic what they taught. But it doesn't! Of all the sacred writings of every major religion in the world, only the Bible sidesteps the errors that pervaded the medical sciences of its time.</b> In fact, scholars are nearly unanimous in attributing the world's first system of sanitary laws to the precepts laid down in the first five books of the Bible.</p>

<b>I also cite:</b></p>
<p>The Bible records that Moses was adopted and grew up as the son of "Pharaoh's daughter." As a royal prince, he was taught the secrets of the most advanced culture of the day, including it's medical arts. The Book of Acts (7:22) tells us that; "<b>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds."</b></p>
<p>Moses Resisted the natural human tendency to add his own education to what God told him and wrote exactly what God inspired him to write. <b>Any intelligent reader must ask this question: Where did Moses obtain his advanced medical knowledge if God did not tell him? The ancient cultures did not understand germs, sanitation and other medical advances taught in the Bible thirty-five centuries ago.</b></p>

<p>It's hard to find "dangerous Hebrew medicine practices", because there is practically NO medicine in the Old Testement, just some general instructions on cleanliness encoded as ritual. The egyptian texts on the other hand cover a vast amount of highly specific medical conditions, many of them very accurately. Show me some effective medicines in the Bible? The Egyptians had hundreds of effective remedies, treatments and surgical procedures. Why did Moses not include the effective remedies in the Bible?</p>
<p>But the point was that your edits are POV. You recollecting something you read does not make them less so - we need some quotes. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 00:20, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Moses appears to have borrowed practically NO Egyptian medicine other than the rituals of hygiene. There was a lot of other very effective Egyptian medicine that Moses ommitted from the OT. He omitted ALL the pharmacological and physiological remedies, regardless of if they worked or not. He kept rituals of cleanliness which obviously evolved away fromt he Egyptian rituals as the Hebrew culture evolved. Your "evidence" consists of things like pointing out that Egyptians used fly dung and Moses did not, so Moses must have channelled God. Moses, or whoever wrote the OT, simply omitted all the Egyptian remedies. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 00:47, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Obviously we disagree, the question is what should go in the article. Is there any evidence that Hebrew medicine is an impossible advance over the medicine that existed at the time (and for two thousands year prior to that time?).</p>
<p>Would you dispute that the Egyptians had rituals of cleanliness?

<p><b>To: mickwest</b></p>
<p>I had some curiosity about the lion/cat material. I did more research and my copy of the material post will reflect this. Secondly, I am willing to work with you and made some modifications which I will post. I also will introduce your zoo figures on lifespan along with mine. I will briefly respond to your last post here plus offer other comments.</p>
<p>With that being said you wrote:</p>
<p>"Non-meat-eating lions and the Bible Genesis 1:30 says, “And to every beast of the earth, ... , I have given every green herb for food ...”. Isaiah 11:7 and Isaiah 65:25 say " ... the lion shall eat <b>straw</b> like the ox ...".</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> Georges H. Westbeau, wrote a short non-fiction children's book: "Little Tyke - The True Story of a Gentle Vegetarian Lioness". <a href="http://remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Children's/Little-Tyke-small.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Children's/Little-Tyke-small.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The subject of the book, Little Tyke, was a lioness owned by Westbeau that had developed a <b>pathological</b> aversion to meat as a cub. Subsequently the lion was domesticated and raised on a diet of cooked grain, milk and eggs. Little Tyke <b>seemed reasonably healthy</b>, but contracted <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> after a long trip and died at the age of 9 years (the lifespan of lions in captivity is about 25 to 30 years <a href="http://www.oaklandzoo.org/atoz/azlion.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oaklandzoo.org/atoz/azlion.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).</p>
<p>The story of Little Tyke is notable in that it has been frequently quoted by vegetarians, Biblical inerrantists and proponents of BSF as evidence that animals can exist on a vegetarian diet, validating the Biblical quotes above. However the diet described consists of processed ingredients not available to the lion in the wild. Vegetarian <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_food.html" title="Cat food">cat food</a> is currently widely available, but is generally supplemented with vitamins and <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taurine.html" title="Taurine">taurine</a> (an amino acid found mostly in meat, essential to the long term health of cats). Lions cannot digest <b>straw.</b> "</p>
<p><b>my comments:</b></p>
<p>1) Who said the aversion was pathological? Is this original research?</p>
<p>What reports do you have that the lion was "reasonably healthy"? I do think historical immediacy applies and everyone who apparently reads the book says the animals health was better than average. Also, the people who wrote the book were apparently not veggie fanatics. They tried to feed the animal meat.</p>
<p>I will grant you that the animals in the wild without man would not have eggs and milk.</p>
<p>Second, I see no reason to leave out the first lion and I found the original source. Ditto for the cat study and feline observations.</p>
<p>Third, is straw the only translation. I don't think it is. Second, a principle of Bible <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a> is determine the limits of the passage. Does the verse say lions will ONLY eat "hebrew word which some translate straw"? Lastly, how do you know that lions cannot eat straw. Is this original research? I believe there is a canadian study showing that cattle are given straw along with other food.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 01:17, 7 September 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>
<p>1) The description in the books makes it look pathological - I mostly used the word as it seemed a good description of the extreme aversion to meat and blood (even a few drops in some milk). But you could maybe change it to "exreme aversion".</p>
<p>2) There are no indications in the books the the lion was above average in health, and the early death of pneumonia is indicitive a weak immune system - a symptom of taurine defficiency. But maybe it could be changed to "good health"</p>
<p>3) "Straw" is the only translation in published bibles - most readers assume it's either figurative, or indicating a future time when lion's digestive systems will be modified to allow them to eat straw. Do you want to give another translation. Lions can *eat* straw, they just can't digest it for nutrition as it's high in cellulose that requires bacteria to break down, which lions do not have (note how Little Tyke "eats" grass to "condition his stomach" - just like dogs do, conditioning it by vomiting). "Cattle" can digest straw - but I imagine you were thinking of something else. Maybe that distinction could be made. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 01:50, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>to: mickwest</p>
<p>You still have not substantiated that lions cannot eat straw. I do recall reading a study which says cattle in Canada were fed a diet of partial straw (probably to save money). Second, please use a concordance or list out all the major translations. I recall in Strong's it could mean more than straw.</p>
<p>Second, I believe you wrote the material in bold letters:</p>
<p>A 1985 study by Nanji and French found that there was a significant correlation between <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirrhosis.html" title="Cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> and pork consumption (Macht claimed that swine meat was more toxic than the animal meat the Bible called clean). <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2858627&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2858627&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. However the study use a <b>small</b> number of data points, and may have been a <a href="../../../s/p/u/Spurious_relationship.html" title="Spurious relationship">spurious relationship</a>.</p>
<p>What is small? Who said it was small? I am not being difficult here but you did not really suppport this statement. I am reasonable. But just asserting its small is not enough. I have no problem if it is small to say its small. The reason I am relucant to just accept this statement is Lancet has a great reputation. I have asked you about this matter before.</p>
<p>my next post will get to your second last post.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 02:06, 7 September 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>
<p><br />
to: mickwest, addendum</p>
<p>First, I have used sources from these categories&#160;: creationist/vegetarian/general website. They all have a report of radiant/above average health. They all appear to have read the book. The book is the immediate witness. I see no reason to water down the health or water down the fact that the reports say the lion died at 9 years ago due to pneumonia. There are zero reports of "good health". I cannot in good conscience make a false report. It would also be original research.</p>
<p>Before I respond to your second last post I will address the below as it pertains to it.</p>
<p>Common knowledge</p>
<p>It is well known that ancient cultures had a significant body of medical knowledge based on oral traditions and written manuscripts, dating back to at least the time of <a href="../../../i/m/h/Imhotep.html" title="Imhotep">Imhotep</a> in 3000BC. Some critics argue that the effects of eating meats prone to infection could have been and probably were observed regularly, and that the committing of those observations to paper was a preservation of previously gained knowledge, and not necessarily the result of divine inspiration. It is also suggested that the Jewish people obtained a portion of their medical knowledge from the Egyptians. Critics point to the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Smith_papyrus_74d9.html" title="Edwin Smith papyrus">Edwin Smith papyrus</a> and the <a href="../../../e/b/e/Ebers_papyrus.html" title="Ebers papyrus">Ebers papyrus</a> which date back at least a thousand years before the writing of the Pentateuch, and contain a surprising amount of accurate and extremely technical medical knowledge, for example indicating awareness of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebrospinal_fluid.html" title="Cerebrospinal fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a>. It is conceivable that Hebrew medicine is simply Egyptian medicine with <b>two thousand</b> years of additional knowledge. <a href="http://www.bibleandscience.com/science/biology.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bibleandscience.com/science/biology.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>No knowledge</p>
<p><b>Cultural anthropologists, such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Douglas_1e1c.html" title="Mary Douglas">Mary Douglas</a> have argued that the seemingly arbitary nature</b> of the demarkation between "clean" and "unclean" in dietary laws, concepts of holiness and taboos, functions within social groups to symbolise and demark social boundaries. Psychology professor <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Rozin_18f9.html" title="Paul Rozin">Paul Rozin</a> suggests food taboos might simply be a codification of the natural "disgust" reaction people generally show to novel meats (for example, horse meat). (See <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pork.html#The_pork_taboo" title="Pork">The pork taboo</a>)</p>
<p><br />
<b>my comment:</b></p>
<p>First conservative scholars say 15th century BC. for the Torah and liberal ones say 600BC at the very latest.</p>
<p>Now here is what I wrote at another website and I will highlight the bold for especially important points:</p>
<p>Again setting aside the issue of whether the current Egyptian chronology is correct proposed by most scholars, if generous dating of the <b>Edwin Smith Surgical Papyus was errantly granted (this will be discussed shortly), the document is thought to be dated at 1600 BC by most scholars. In addition, these scholars believe the Edwin Smith Papyrus ancient Egyptian medical treatise is a copy of a work dating from c. 3000 BC.</b> <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&amp;query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&amp;query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> The scholar Reeves argued that archaic words in the Edwin Smith Papyrus points to it being copied from an earlier text. <a href="http://www.bibleandscience.com/science/biology.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bibleandscience.com/science/biology.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Now the argument from word usage to date a text has failed before according to linguist and Bible scholar Robert Dick Wilson who was a scholar who learned 45 ancient languages. In his essay, "What is an expert?" Dr. Wilson states that the attempts to date the Old Testament late via alledged anachronisms failed. <a href="http://www.gracebiblefellowship-tx.org/Providential%20Preservation%20Appendix.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gracebiblefellowship-tx.org/Providential%20Preservation%20Appendix.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <b>With that in mind, if late dates for the Ebers Papyrus and Hearst Papyrus were granted the Ebers Papyrus is commonly dated at about 1550 BC. and the Hearst Papyrus is dated at 1450 B.C.</b> <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9031856" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9031856" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://www.mun.ca/classics/mouseion/2000/forsyth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mun.ca/classics/mouseion/2000/forsyth/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <b>Now certainly archaic/anachronisms have a place in dating a text, however, caution and dilgence certainly apply.</b></p>
<p>My commnent:</p>
<p>According to the liberal scholars, The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus was the way it was in 1,600 BC . The liberal scholars date the Ebers and Hearst Papyrus documents to abount 1,500 BC. Now even if you grant (and I believe errantly) a date of 600BC for the Torah that is still about a 1,000 years space. And the fact is Hearst Papyrus medicine according to the scholarship I cited from a medical historian was no Cadillac. It was ineffective in about 3/4 of the cases according to the medical historian I cited. Please revise the page content to say 1,000 years if the dating by the majority of scholars is correct.</p>
<p>Next, where did Mary Douglas argue for the arbitrariness? I am the one who first offered her and I saw no reports of her saying arbitrary. Second, who are the other anthropologist? I have no problem with the Paul Rozin remark.</p>
<p><br />
Finally, (I did promise to get to it)</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<p>Would you dispute that the Egyptians had rituals of cleanliness?</p>
<p>My reply:</p>
<p>Please cite medical historians saying they were notable.</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<p><br />
Would you dispute that much of Hebrew culture must have been influenced by Egyptian culture since the Hebrew people lived in Egypt for several generations?</p>
<p>My reply:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Influenced yes. The Jews did cry out for the Egyptian onions in the desert according to the Biblical account. But I see no adoption of the Egyptian medicine in the Torah or any reported other Hebrew documents. Also, no bad medical/sanitation/health practices reported in the Torah but we do have medical people and medical historians who rave about the Torah. In short, there is no "sewage" practices but we do have raves. also, there is no "Hearst Papyrus quackery" reported by the medical historians or medical doctors.</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<p>Is it not reasonable to assume that the Hebrew rituals were simply more modern versions of the Egyptian rituals?</p>
<p>my reply:</p>
<p>Why do you say that? I see bad practices practiced in medicine in the 17th and 18th centuries. I see bad practices now.</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<p>Is there <i>specific</i> evidence otherwise?</p>
<p>my reply:</p>
<p>Raves and no sewage/or ineffective Hearst practices.</p>

<p><b>to: Mark</b></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time trying to have a dialogue with Mickwest. I am not saying nothing was agreed upon. However, by in large MickWest want to go with what he wants the reports to say rather than what they said. I see this as original research. I have quoted a wide variety of sources. I used a neutral site, a vegetarian site, and a creation site. They all say the same thing regarding the major thrust of what they report about the lions health. They all very likely refer to what the book said (Little Tyke). Also, he refuses (without saying why ) why the swami vegetarian lion is excluded. He just erases it without saying why he erases it.</p>
<p>Also, I have cited science studies from the scienfitic literature but he erased those (see cat studies). Also in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_medicine.html" title="History of medicine">History of medicine</a> section he will not allow what the medical historians say in regards to Egyptian medicine. I cite a veternarian and other sources and he erases them.</p>
<p>In short, I think he is acting unreasonable. Please do something.</p>

<p>I think the primary issues are those of relevance and POV. I have discussed the reasons for removal of the lion material (way up above - this talk page gets long quickly). I've been removing material that does not pertain to the subject matter. I've also removed very dubious material (like the other vegetarian lion - only reference being a book from the 30s full of descriptions of magical happenings). I've then been trying to make entries conform to POV - which here is primararily violated by having facts placed out of context. Ken has been very selective in adding fact, yet he adds a large number of low quality facts - placing these facts in context would require either short dismissive rebuttals (whcih would not be acceptable), or an expansion of the article to about a hundred times it's already bloated size. Hence, I've been cutting back and trying to focus on the actual issues. Vegetarian lions would not even deserve to be in there, except that it's widely quoted on apologist sites. But that's a good example of a flood of very poor "facts" that are irrelevent, out of context or wrong. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 04:33, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The position of Mary Douglas on Levitical codes</span></h2>
<p>It was contended that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Douglas_1e1c.html" title="Mary Douglas">Mary Douglas</a> did not argue that the Levitical codes were Arbitary. The contended sentence was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Cultural anthropologists, such as Mary Douglas have argued that the seemingly arbitary nature of the demarkation between "clean" and "unclean" in dietary laws, concepts of holiness and taboos, functions within social groups to symbolise and demark social boundaries</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This simply states that the demarkation <b>seems</b> to be arbitary (e.g. why is Swan clean, but not Coot?), then offers a possible explantion for it.</p>
<p>I did not write the contended sentence, and I think it does not fully state Douglas's theory in the function of the codes. In her book <i>Purity and Danger</i>, she argues more that the physical state of cleanliness was an extension of the mental state of holiness and so "<i>Observance of the dietary rules would thus have been a meaningful part of the great liturgical act of recognition and worship [...]</i>" (Purity and Danger, Ch 3, pp 71)</p>
<p>The "other anthropologists" are quoted in Purity and Danger, Chs 2-3, there are lots of them, and they have varying theories, including arbitariness. Douglas discusses all the arguments in some detail. It's an interesting read and I'd be happy to answer questions on it.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should we include Krishnananda's vegetarian lion?</span></h2>
<p>Aside from the point of if Vegetarian lions such as "Little Tyke" are at all notable, it was argued that there is some significance in the report of a second vegetarian Lion, based on one sentence and a photograph from the book "Autobiography of a Yogi" <a href="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_42" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_42" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, (<a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramahansa_Yogananda_25ad.html" title="Paramahansa Yogananda">Paramahansa Yogananda</a>, 1946 ), which reads:</p>

<dd>"<i>[Krishnananda's tame lioness] refuses all meat in favor of rice and milk</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not sufficient evidence of anything. No indication is given of how long the lioness has survived on this diet (it may have just been eating this for a few months), nor if anything other than rice or milk was included in the diet.</p>
<p>Also, <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> is full of magical happenings, such as Yogananda's guru teleporting from one continent to another<a href="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_19" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_19" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, a woman who never eats<a href="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_46" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_46" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and a man being raised from the dead <a href="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_32" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi_-_Chapter_32" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> - all of which cast substantial doubt on the usefulness of Yogananda as a reliable source. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 16:57, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although I do not agree with Eastern religions as I am a Christian I do not necessarily doubt all reports of the supernatural in other religions. Marco Polo reported seeing monks levitating. Now if you can show the miraculous does not happen then the swami lion report will not be mentioned. You are free to add your doubts though. Please don't forget to mention Marco Polo.</p>

Lastly, Guettarda spent a lot of time referencing the historical context in regards to the reported noteworthy good and deleterious practices. He spent a lot of time period on the footnoting. Please do not vandalize.</p>

Once you decide on a stable version I'll clean it up. I hadn't thought of that drawback when I started with that type, but it's no big deal to clean up. When I get the time I'll convert the rest to footnotes - I think it's better to have footnotes than inline references inasmuch as it lets you see <i>what</i> the ref is without following the link. Seemed like it would be useful for clarifying the debate. Absolutely should not <i>get in the way</i> of moving toward a stable version. After all, it's Wikipedia - as it says below "<b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</b>" I am quite aware of that part of the rules. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:44, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">regarding wikipedia rules</span></h3>
<p>Mickwest is breaking Wikipedia rules. He said critics compare BSF to the ancient astronaut theory. He never supported that or referenced that. I can give other examples as well (lions cannot digest straw, off the cuff not substantiated remarks about the Lancet study. I have asked him politely to stop doing this. Yet he put the lions cannot digest straw material in again after I reasonably asked him to support it. From a Biblical view, I think the lion/straw material is not valid anyway as there is evidence according to the Scripture that nature will be changed in the future. He also erases material arbitrarily to make the article skewed. He wants only the good mentioned in regards to ancient Egyptian medicine and not the bad. I ask admins to do something about Mickwest.</p>

You wrote that critics of Bible scientific forewknowledge (BSF) liken it to the ancient astronaut theory.</p>
<p><br />
He is what wikipedia says:</p>
<p>"Wikipedia:Neutral point of view is one of three content policies. The other two are Wikipedia:No original research and <b>Wikipedia:Verifiability</b>. The three policies are complementary, jointly determining the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should therefore not be interpreted in isolation from each other, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three."</p>
<p><br />
Do critics say this? If so, where? The same applies to many of your other comments.</p>
<p>Also, you want only the good practices of Egptian medicine mentioned in the Historical context section and not the bad. Sorry that is POV.</p>

<ol>
<li>Shorten...be concise...the article is <i>way</i> too long and at times difficult to follow. I'd say you coulc cut it <i>in half</i> and still get a decent article.</li>
<li>Cut most external links. Most external links on most pages are silly. Just post 5-10 really, really good ones (and 5-10 from the opposing side), and you'd go a <i>long</i> way in improving the article.</li>
<li>18 citations? Cut that number in half, too.</li>
<li>I say this as an evangelical Christian: the article's subject is a minority view, and in an NPOV encyclopedia needs to be treated as such. Mainstream science isn't <i>opposed</i> to the idea; it's pretty much <i>ambivalent</i>. Note that appropriately.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">to: to mark</span></h2>
<p>I wish it could be said that the revert situation with MickWest and I was due to a misunderstanding. Regretably, I cannot. He has repeatedly wanted to whitewash the beginning off the article and skew readers perception in the beginning of the article. For example, although Egptian medicine has its good points which I brought up I think I should be able to mention the bad practices as well in the historical context. Also, where do critics of BSF compare it to the ancient astronaut theory. No references given. I think he is making it up frankly. I believe Mickwest has wanted to keep the examples of BSF hidden deep in footnotes.</p>
<p>After all is said and done, I do not see good faith efforts in MickWest. Maybe MickWest will change his behavior. I hope so. But once the page is unlocked I see him doing the same thing unless he wishes to change his behavior. I wish I could say it was unintentional and short lived. It hasn't been.

<p>Here is something I posted at <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a> and I would be interested in research on the article in regards to substantiating the 1980's claim which I read in one source.</p>
<p>Here is the article:</p>
<p><b>BSF and asteriods</b></p>
<p>"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. (Revelation 8:8-9).</p>
<p>The idea that large rocks from space occasionally hit Earth and could greatly influence its life remained rejected until the 1980s. Catastrophism, including impacts of asteroids, was was unfashionable and considered unscientific. It contradicted Uniformitarianism which was made popular by Sir Charles Lyell in Principles of Geology (1830-33).</p>
<p>NASA, however, now has Near Earth Object Program and it is believed that objects such as the object that hit Siberia in 1908 can have catastrophic effects. <a href="http://www.psi.edu/projects/siberia/siberia.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psi.edu/projects/siberia/siberia.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></p>

<dd>Are you sure that you've represented Lyell's method accurately? Are you really sure that Lyell's version of uniformitarianism was the cause of rejecting the idea "until the 1980s"? Was it really as popular as this paragraph suggests it was? Are you sure that as late as the 1980s people doubted that large rocks could strike the earth, affecting life here? Are you sure that a "large rock" is what is meant by "great mountain burning with fire" in Rev 8? Does it strike you as logical to say that this ignorant belief prevailed until the 1980s, and then to illustrate the enlightened view by pointing to an event 72+ years earlier?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>These are the sorts of questions that are raised about very many of the statements throughout the article, ken.

<p><b>None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views.

<p><b>My view:</b></p>
<p>Materialism/naturalism/atheism is not considered scientific also. True science should go where the evidence leads. Also, "trimming" the supernatural view in BSF would not be acceptable as the Biblical view is that miracles do occur and this article which is about this minority view should not "trim miracles". Again, I will reiterate: <b>None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views.

<dd>I just hate it that I end up on the opposite side from you, over and over. Ken, the issue is not whether miracles occur; but only whether this is relevant to the article.

<p>Ken, I appreciate you working towards a compromise. I wonder if you could address a concern I have. The gist of the "dung" argument is that Hebrew medicine omits the harmful practices of Egyptian medicine. However they also omit the useful practices, keeping only the ritual cleanliness of the Egyptians. If the omission of harmful practices is worthy of note, then is not the omission of useful practices? One could envisage answering the "dung" paragraph with other paragraphs describing effective practices (like using garlic as an antibiotic), complete with modern studies into the effectiveness of garlic, and a query as to why this was left out of the Bible. However I'd not like to make the article too long, and so the compromise suggested would be acceptable to me. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 22:04, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no problem with you stating that good Egyptian medical practices are not in the Torah <b>if</b></p>
<p>1. You show they are useful scientifically.</p>
<p>2. I am allowed to say that putting good practices would impede future progress so that good practices could not be made better plus it would turn the Bible into a huge collection of medical volumes which nobody would probably read. Also, the Bible does say "I am the Lord your healer" (paraphrasing perhaps).</p>
<p>3. I am allowed to say that just because the Torah does not have them does not mean they were not written down elsewhere or kept in oral tradition. See <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hackett_Fischer_d647.html" title="David Hackett Fischer">David Hackett Fischer</a> rules of historiography.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Paragraph compromises</span></h2>
<p>If you'll look at the paragraph compromises I've suggested, there's a common theme- removing off topic material.</p>
<p>In the first paragraph, we go into a lengthy discussion of the pros and cons of Egyptian medicine. I chopped it down to something that is still longer than I'd like, but removed the most off-topic part of all- a discussion on the qualities of dung as an antibiotic. I would strongly suggest leaving this out, and then placing a foot note saying something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For more information on the pros and cons, see (insert appropriate article)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The lions paragraph to me isn't so important, as long as the word <b>valid</b> is removed.</p>
<p>The third paragraph, with its discussion of miracles, seems off-topic to me. Ignoring for a moment the scientific validity of miracles, the simple fact is that the article's topic is Bible scientific fosight- if a miracle (divine intervention) is required, it doesn't count as foresight since miracles, <i>by definition</i> act outside natural scientific laws. Furthermore, since evidently no miraculous intervention is needed to make lions herbivores, I really don't see the need for the comment, even from a creationist standpoint.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if someone could conduct a straw poll on the contentious sections (I can't, since my internet is so erratic right now).

<li>And I don't particularly want to be the moderator, and I don't view myself as one. MY entire goal here is to reach a compromise so that I can take that ugly "protected" tag off of this article. Since neither of you have proven adult enough to discuss things rather than revert warring, you're stuck until I or some other administrator comes along and unprotects the page. Now that I've cleared that up, my personal pov (<b>full disclosure</b>) is that I'm a creationist who believes that the Bible is inerrant. Having said that, I refuse to allow my POV to infest this article. In my opinion, lengthy diatribes on Egyptian medicine and miracles serve no purpose in this article and are off topic. Hence, I suggest a footnote pointing to the correct article. You disagree. I'd like a straw poll, and if my internet ever straightens out, I'll conduct one, since I certainly have no right to unilateraly implement my opinion, just because I have the power to do so. Lastly, your suggestions that the other user be banned would carry more weight if you provided links.

<p>I did not engage in a diatribe against Egyptian medicine. A diatribe is a bitter and abusive denunciation. I am the one who said Homer complemented Egyptian medicine. I hardly engaged in a diatribe. I just stuck to the facts in a encyclopedic tone and relayed what the medical historians and experts said.</p>
<p>Second, the title of this thread is "Biblical Scientific foresight" . The Biblical worldview is that miracles have happened and do happen. I do recall Jesus saying all things are possible to those who believe. I don't recall Jesus or the Apostles saying miracles will end before the end of the earth occurs. I refuse to have a "gimpy" non miraculous Biblical position adopted where a new creation cannot have transformed creatures. I politely say and without rancor that just because you are a creationist does not mean you have not allowed naturalistic philosophy to have a influence on you.</p>

<p>My reply:</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a article on the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. This is not an article about the Bible but an article on "Biblical scientific foresight". If something is called foresight there must be something to compare it to. Thus there need to be made fair comparisons. If the Bible is a Cadillac in medicine at a given time, and it can be shown that the best at a given time was a Yugo then this should be allowed. There is no size limit to Wikipedia in regards to minority view articles. This is the policy. Please respect the policy. I insist on this.</p>

<li>There is nothing in Wikipedia policy that states an article should be 3000 kb long and include information on everything. However, it does state that articles should be <b>readable</b>. In my opinion, lengthy discussions of Egyptian medicine belong in the Egyptian medicine article, not here. By your reasoning we should include not just Egyptian medicine, but Assyrian, Persian, Median, Sumerian, Greek, Babylonian, etc., etc., etc. We DO NOT DO THIS.

<p>Why spend time on Babylonian or other medicine? I gave that Homer had a very high opinion of Egyptian medicine. I then proceeded to show it was "sewer pharmocology" that was ineffective and that dung medicine causes tetanus although I mentioned its good points as well either in this article or the one I wrote at <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a>. I did this via medical historians and medical experts.</p>
<p>Second, this article may get much longer. There are 101 examples of Biblical scientific foresight that were reviewed by Duanne Gish and others which I have not looked at yet. If I do look at them, I will pick the ones I think can be argued in the future if I so wish and Lord willing. I may wind up with more than a 101.

<p>The idea that large rocks from space occasionally hit Earth and could greatly influence its life remained rejected until the 1980s.

YOu replied with:</p>
<p>Are you sure that you've represented Lyell's method accurately? Are you really sure that Lyell's version of uniformitarianism was the cause of rejecting the idea "until the 1980s"? Was it really as popular as this paragraph suggests it was? Are you sure that as late as the 1980s people doubted that large rocks could strike the earth, affecting life here? Are you sure that a "large rock" is what is meant by "great mountain burning with fire" in Rev 8? Does it strike you as logical to say that this ignorant belief prevailed until the 1980s, and then to illustrate the enlightened view by pointing to an event 72+ years earlier? These are the sorts of questions that are raised about very many of the statements throughout the article, ken. Each one is full of assumptions that seem to beg a reply; and many of your sources simply adopt those assumptions uncritically. — Mark (Mkmcconn) **</p>
<p>I did research about the 1980's claim. Unfortunately most of all my sources promoted the evolutionary view so I chose not to use them. I did find one creationist source which I posted at the <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a> article at: <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Bible_scientific_foreknowledge" class="external free" title="http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Bible_scientific_foreknowledge" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Bible_scientific_foreknowledge</a> but the article was not as definitive as the other articles I found but chose not to utilize due to their other content.</p>
<p>I also provided some Bible <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a> from MacArthur. I think it is the best fit but if you want to defend another view go ahead. As far as the Siberian event it was very much a mystery but if I am not mistaken the consensus now is an asteroid/meteor.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have no desire to get into a Lyell debate as I have found that the creation/evolution discussion at Wikipedia is rather puerile and low calibre. There are definitely higher calibre places on the internet were both sides are presented. I nearly gave some Darwinist a heart attack when I presented some medical journal articles about <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin%27s_illness_f5c0.html" title="Charles Darwin's illness">Charles Darwin's illness</a>. The page was put up for deletion like this page but failed to be deleted. I guess some Darwinist were not happy about what science had to say about this issue.</p>

<dd>It's not really necessary to copy entire blocks of the article and comments, with every remark. And why won't you conform to talk page conventions? Your way of doing things does not thread, and it creates extremely long and cluttered talk pages. \</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that there are assumptions throughout the article, which would take considerable article space to expose and then exercise critically. MacArthur's interpretation is an example. Dispensationalism has many advocates these days, but its manner of reading helicopters and asteroids into the Bible, where the Scriptures speak (meaningfully, not ignorantly, I would argue) of locusts and angels casting a mountain into the sea, is distinctive and distinctively modern. \</dd>
<dd>With regard to Lyell, my question is not about evolution, which I care nothing about. My question is whether this quoted paragraph actually make sense as written.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Boundaries and fringes</span></h2>
<p>I've mentioned in another context that I have a problem with this article. The worst thing about it is that it discusses BSF as though it were a boundary issue, separating "conservative" and "evangelical" Christians from those who are "non-religious" or "liberal". It most definitely is not. It is much more typical of Seventh-day Adventists and similar modern, divine science groups, than of evangelicalism, or of conservatives so called.</p>
<p>The perspective represented in this article is disturbing. It actually seems to argue that modernity is a kind of gold standard for truth, reading back into the Bible that modern measure, as though the Bible is demonstrated true according to how prescient is its anticipation of modern scientific ideas. This is an argument for the divine inspiration of Scripture? It sounds more like an argument for the divine inspiration of modern science, and its supersession of Scripture as a more reliable source of truth!</p>
<p>A divine science view is assumed to be the correct interpretation of some passages that for thousands of years have been interpreted in very different ways. These are fringe beliefs, when located in relation to "evangelicalism" as a broad movement; and frankly, in relation to "conservative" Christianity in sweeping terms, I'm not sure that this view really counts as "conservative" after all. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 04:17, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say it <i>is</i> "conservative", but not really "evangelical". I am an evangelical, but probably not a conservative (that's a guess, mind you...just a self-evaluation). The article disturbs me in two ways...
<ol>
<li>It is not only a minority view in terms of science, it is a minority view in terms of Christendom, even evangelicalism...my fear is that people read it and think that this is what most evangelicals believe. But some NPOV editing at a later date can probably fix that problem.</li>
<li>More importantly, who's going to read it? It's <i>way</i> too long and not particularly well written (with all due respect). It will be pretty useless as an article, in my view, if it is not drastically simplified, presenting the key arguments, counter-arguments, links to related Wikipedia articles, and a representative sampling of the external links out there (opponents could cite THOUSANDS of scientific resources on the other side of this debate...why the need to list so many in support?).</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the problems with the length of the article come mostly with the excessive amounts of "evidence" in support of the various proported instances of BSF. Obviously there is no limit to the number of articles, scientific papers and web sites that could be quoted as "evidence" for either side. I've tried not to add to this, and I tried to cut back where I saw it as excessive.</p>
<p>On another note, I think it's important to provide some context to the subject. I started doing this by writing the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_scientific_foreknowledge.html#Historical_Context" title="Biblical scientific foreknowledge">Historical Context</a> paragraph. I'd also planned to write something about the history of the subject itself, showing examples of it from the past and how it developed (like during the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolaus_Copernicus_4033.html" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">Copernican</a> revolution, and the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_revolution.html" title="Scientific revolution">Scientific revolution</a>) - basically a (very short) overview of attempts to reconcile the Bible with science. I'd not got too far with the research though. I was wondering if people think the subject of reconciling <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> with the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> is a seperate subject from BSF, is it its own subject, or part of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a>? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 16:26, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Keith, I'm using "conservative" in the sense of "traditional", as I assume the article is. If traditionalists conserve the past and pass on what they have received, modernism in contrast replaces what has been passed on with something fundamentally new. "Conservatives" think that we shouldn't permit ourselves to do what modernists do. "Liberals" think that we should be free from the constraints of traditionalism.</dd>
<dd>MickWest, this subject is founded on a view of biblical inerrancy; but it is not identical with it. There are many approaches to reconciling what we learn from observation, and what we learn from the Bible: it is a fundamental task of the Christian faith, which every Christian who is not a Gnostic must engage in. This article presents one of the approaches, made more mainstream recently through the creation science movement. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 17:02, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no problem with you not agreeing with this article.</p>
<p>Second, there is more of a pronounced clash of ideas between believers of BSF and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialism.html" title="Materialism">materialism</a>. Since Darwin there is the notion the science refutes the Bible. The idea that creationism could be right and that there are many instances where the science community consensus was wrong and the Bible was right causes a clash of these worldviews. I believe there is good evidence to support the idea that the Bible has no historical or scientific errors and that it is mankind that is often errant in these fields.</p>
<p>Secondly, I don't know what Bible <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a> views you hold but I support the Grammatico-Historical Exegesis view of Bible exegesis. <a href="http://www.godward.org/archives/BS%20Notes/Basic%20rules%20for%20NT%20exegesis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.godward.org/archives/BS%20Notes/Basic%20rules%20for%20NT%20exegesis.htm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a><a href="http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_inerrancy_france.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_inerrancy_france.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a><a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v16/i1/genesis.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v16/i1/genesis.asp" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> which is a view very prevalent among evangelicals if I am not mistaken. Time does not allow me to delve into this matter at length.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I think any view can have errant ideas. I am not advocating finding toaster ovens in the Bible.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I do not find the physical sciences to be the gold standard. I take a cummulative view of apologetics taking into account: history, prophecy, moral arguments (I think the sermon on the mount is very convicting), miracles, archaeology, other sciences (besides the social science of history), personal experience, etc I don't think it could be said I consider BSF to be the gold standard. If that were the case I would have likely started with this article first. I don't believe I did this if memory serves.</p>
<p>Fifthly, I am not a dispensationalist.

<dd>Many Christians (I hope!) would see this as a completely wrong-headed statement of the relationship between the Bible and experience. The Bible's divine authority is not measured by the gold standard of modern scientific veracity. This is why it matters who your sources are, and what they believe, more than it matters what your beliefs are. The article needs to do a better job of exposing the basic assumptions that many of these "subscribers" have in common, and there needs to be a discussion of how others interact with those assumptions. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 17:32, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">comments on resolving the dispute</span></h2>
<p>I realize that BSF was not likely to be a popular view at Wikipedia judging from the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> article which I think is poorly written. However, popularity is not my benchmark for truth. I also know given the up and down vote for the articles deletion that some people share my BSF position or at least want to know more. One person spent a lot of time footnoting it which tells me perhaps they share the BSF view although they may not.</p>
<p>Secondly, I do not consider myself to be above criticism. I listen to criticism. I like to improve. With that in mind, I did have second thoughts about including the vegeterian lion reported by the swami at the time I posted it and should have reconsidered before I did. I like to do due diligence and that is how I found the medical historians, science studies, etc to support the subject of BSF. I think I should have done more due dilgence. I have no objection to removing it at this time as I am an "agnostic" regarding the swami lion at this point. Perhaps this view will change. I do believe in applying historiography principles. For example, some testimony of <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suetonius.html" title="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> I believe while I am skeptical about certain testimonies of his. I also wish MickWest had given more details or links or citations regarding his objections in regards to "Autobiography of a Yogi" contents.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I am not overly concerned whether MickWest is an atheist or not. My problem with MickWest is not his views. One person told me in private that they thought MickWest's habit of often removing my material without discussion in the talkpage was inappropriate. I think this was inappropriate too obviously. MickWest did this from the beginning. Needless to say this was not productive to us having a good Wikipedia relationship. I think the reason why he often did this was he could not support his deletions.</p>
<p>Fourth, I do have a problem with MickWest deleting my material even after he post to the talk page now although this may change in the future. Why? For one, he wanted the Little Tyke info deleted from the beginning because if memory serves he was not sure if the story of the vegetarian lion was true despite the book, reported pictures, reported Hollywood appearances, etc Also, I will cite the policy again:</p>
<p><b>None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia.</b> But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in <b>great detail</b>, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth.</p>
<p>Now given that I am posting the minority view in a minority view article I do not see where MickWest can delete my material if I am following the Wikipedia rules ("according to" or "it was reported by", etc etc.). Given my current material in the Wikipedia article I do not believe that anyone can say I am breaking any policies whatsoever. I think I have a airtight case here. Although even in this area I do not claim infallibility of course. So I feel I do not have to spend lots and lots of time trying to convince people in talk pages of the reasonableness of my BSF views. If you disagree with BSF so be it. I am not going to be upset. I also think I have shown by my current "swami vegeterian retraction" comment that I am at least interested in the truth although by Wikipedia rules I am allowed to keep it. The policy says, "we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth." Thus as long as I say "according to" Wikipedia policy is that I can keep it in the minority view article. Case closed. Now I am interested in the truth. I think I have shown my interest in the truth by my repeated references to history of medicine historians, science studies, etc. and by my references to historiography principles. I only say I am within my right to keep material in by saying "according to" in a minority view article in order to protect my minority view material from the unreasonable efforts of others. Now if MickWest chooses to break Wikipedia policies by deleting minority view material or acts poorly in other ways I think he should be banned although that is not what I prefer.</p>
<p>Fifth, I do not think anyone could say I am rude, a tyrant, or totally unreasonable. Mark knows that my most vociferous detractor of my material at Wikipedia was quite rude to me (not MickWest) yet that person said they respected my politeness. Not to pad myself on the back but I believe this shows I can be reasonable and that I am not some mean spirited person with a vendettta of some kind towards any particular worldview or aderents of such a view.</p>
<p>Sixthly, I do not think about a paragraphs worth of material on the pros and cons of Egyptian medicine was acting like a tyrant or unreasonable. I think that one or more people want it removed because it deflates the anti-BSF material expressed in the current article.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think I have a solution which may lesson the conflict level. Allow me to use a illustration to demonstrate my point. Charasmatic and pentecostal Christians are 25% percent of Christendom and they are growing according to a church historian I read. Many people are vociferously against this and quite angry. This has led to a anti-Charasmatic article to be created. Perhaps that is a solution here. Have a anti-BSF article where the anti-BSF people can write as long as they want about their anti-BSF views. I would not be upset about this. I am confident enough in my BSF views and I am tolerant enough not to have a heart attack or to go on a unreasonable deleting spree. I certainly have not done this with any articles at Wikipedia. I don't see myself wanting to delete any of it as long as Wikipedia protocol was being employed. <b>I would like some feedback particularly about this last paragraphs offered solution.</b></p>

<p>I insist on having my content restored and I stated why in my last post. For example, I ask that all of tthe pros and cons of Egyptian medicine I gave restored and not deleted again. I ask this be done before the article is unlocked. It would help as I am not too Wiki tech saavy. I think this would be fair to me given the anti-Wiki policy deletes plus Guitterda (I might be spelling wrong) spent a lot of time on the footnotes. I also said what I expect from MickWest and others which is in accordance with Wikipedia policy. I want assurances that this will not be breached. I do think given my current article that I show I am not in breach of policy. If anyone says I am then I ask them why this is so. If this cannnot be agreed on then the article should remain locked. I say this because what I wrote in the last post was stating Wikipedia rules. I also think I offered a good solution that nobody mentioned so far and I credit KMH03 because he suggested this idea in a conflict with another article.</p>

<p>I broke the 3R rules because I saw admins doing nothing about what I saw as egregious wrongs being done. I don't beleive anyone can deny that the deletes of MickWest were breaking Wikipedia policy. He deleted minority views which Wikipedia says he could not do in a minority view article. you have my assurance I will not break the 3R rule.</p>
<p>But before you unlock the page I do ask four questions for the participants involved in the talk page and I ask they be answered before the page is unlocked:</p>
<p>1. Did MickWest break policy by deleting my minority view material?</p>
<p>2. Is there any objection as per Wikipedia rules for me to have my pro and con Egyptiam medicine paragraph of material restored?</p>
<p>3. Is there any objection to having both sides given in decent proportion overall for each issue raised. Obviously intentional fillerbustering by one side would be inappropriate. So far nobody has accused me of intentional fillabustering. I do not see me belaboring a point.</p>
<p>4. Could someone more technically saavy restore what MickWest deleted so Guittarda's hard work is not lost? Could this be done before Mickwest and I could post again?</p>

<li>The best way to restore to the article with least damage would be to revert to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_scientific_foreknowledge&amp;oldid=22749603" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_scientific_foreknowledge&amp;oldid=22749603" rel="nofollow">this</a> version, which is the one before I removed the paragraph on Egyptian medicine and research into the modern uses of dung as an antibiotic.

<li>MickWest has said that he will not delete material without discussion. Material shouldn't be deleted just because it's unusual.</li>
<li>Wikipedia "rules" are not the only guideline for cooperation: badly written, redundant or marginally relevant material will not be kept; but, if you can conform the Egyption material to the narrow purpose of this article - it is a very narrow purpose - then it will likely survive.</li>
<li>Proportionality is not a measure of neutrality.</li>
<li><a href="#Should_we_include_Krishnananda.27s_vegetarian_lion.3F" title="">Guettarda has already said</a> that the footnotes will be replaced, and reminds us how to keep a cool head about hard work being undone: <i>"If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it."

<p>I could go rant and rant about the wrongs done. I think it is best to put that away and try to start fresh. Believe it or not I have at least once or twice done some things wrong in my life. With that being said, will you delete my material if I follow "according to" and other protocol? I see this as reasonable and in full accordance with Wikipedia rules. By the way, I do plan on honoring my deletion of the Swami lion until I do more research on it (which might be never as I plan on looking into other BSF issues which might keep my plate full given my present responsibilities).</p>

<p>You have written that my Egyptian material will likely survive. I don't see this as coming to any agreement.</p>
<p>Here is the guidelines for wikipedia again:</p>
<p><b>None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia.</b> But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in <b>great detail</b>, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth.</p>
<p>Now I have said I think this material is relevant although I admit it is very unpopular. I said it was to show foresight and give context. So far nobody disagrees it gives historical context. I don't see how they can say it doesn't as I quoted a medical historian! Now I think the other side of the aisle has to assume good faith by me. Now Wikipedia states that my minority view regarding the historical context which is of course necessary in a foresight article should be given as much atttention as you can possibly give me in my minority view article. Is one paragraph following the spirit of that policy? I didn't even have two paragraphs. Am I being reasonable? Did the other side make a mistake in deleting it? I do not see where it is only likely that the material be kept. There should be no doubt whatsoever. I hate to belabor this point but I don't want to have history repeat itself here.</p>

<dd>Stop worrying. Start trusting. Relax and enjoy. Sorry to turn maternal on you, but really, work with your opponent rather than against him. More advice from mom: don't quote the rules so much. Seek to cooperate, more than to force submission, and you'll be much nearer the spirit of the rules. With regard to the material you want, keep it narrowly focused on the topic.

<dd>I have tried to have dialogue. I have answered the questions posed to me. I spent a lot of time doing this. I did ask one main question to have the issue resolved in order to have dialogue. I frankly received stonewalling and a loose promise. I was told my Egyptian paragraph would likely remain. What does that mean? In two days, MickWest can delete it and Mark can then say, "Well I only said likely." What is the point of talk pages if nothing is ever attempted to be truly resolved. Mark stress assume good faith but both sides have to do their part in dialogue on the key issue. One side stonewalling is not acting in good faith in regards to the key question although I will admit that the section was restored so there is at least some agreement that it was justified. <a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 20:41, 8 September 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</dd>

<dd>to: mark Thank you for the compliments. I do support my work and I try to use as many historian and science sources as I can and do it succinctly. I wanted to show that ancient Egyptian medicine was one of the Cadillacs. I did that via Homer. I added a few complimentary statements. Second, in medicine the first rule of thumb is "Do no harm". I showed Egyptian medicine did harm. That is crucial. To do that I had to show lots of dung and then tetanus from the dung. I did that via a medical historian. The second rule of medicine is effectiveness. I showed it was not very effective at all in pharmocology which is a huge aspect of medicine via a medical historian. I did all of this in one paragraph I believe. I know I was succinct. I frankly thought the succinctness complaint is wrongheaded and cannot be supported. I also showed it to be a Cadillac of the times and went out of my way to tell a few of its more notable accomplishment at least in the CreationWiki article I believe although I may have let Mick do that at Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Enough said. I don't MickWest will likely mess with the article anymore unreasonably but with the internet it is hard to judge. I am assuming good faith but I think it would have been better if some true agreement were done. I realize that by MickWest saying he wouldn't do it anymore would be admitting wrong which is repugnant to many people and impossible. I am not asking for "miracles". The bottom line is I don't want to be unreasonably hassled and will take steps to avoid it. As long as MickWest acts reasonably I am not the type to hold a grudge. I did admit where I did things wrong but I see no need to demand reciprocity. Again, the bottom line is I don't want to hassled a lot in contrariness to Wikipedia rules. I don't think anyone should be above the law just because there views are more popular.</dd>

<dd>Keep up the good work of supporting your statements.

<p>I have no problem with reasonable edits. People fix grammar or fix mistakes of clear and introvertible fact. I just have a problem with people who do not have the same view and rather than suppport a contrary view they simply use the edit key for a variety of reasons. I think those days are over now here at least for a while. It will be interesting to see what happens in the future. I should have said something earlier.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One more thing:</span></h2>
<p>I'd almost forgot in the excitement, but the disputed paragraph also exists verbatim in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_medicine.html#Egyptian_medicine" title="History of medicine">History_of_medicine#Egyptian_medicine</a>. I'd removed it after some brief talk on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Talk%7EHistory_of_medicine_c0a4.html" title="Talk:History of medicine">Talk:History_of_medicine</a>, but it was reinstated.

<p>1. I don't buy the "mainstream argument". I cited medical historians and respected scientific journals. Mark talks about good faith and I think it is important to act in good faith. There is nothing non-mainstream about my sources.</p>
<p>2. I would ask Scimitar how he would attempt to show an entire medical system of the world at one period was often harmful and ineffective and do it all in one short paragraph. There is nothing to pare down. I could have played games and wrote a monster paragraph and then bargained down. I acted in good faith. I was told by Mark that this is a worthwhile community. I acted decently and I merely expect decency in return.</p>
<p>I have strived to be polite. I asked for dialogue earlier with each side answering each others reasonable questions. I got stonewalled even though I answered the other sides questions from multiple people. I think both sides have to show courtesy to each other and make reasonable attempts to communicate. I don't see that happening now.</p>

<p>addendum:</p>
<p>Here is what Wikipedia states on its opening webpage info in response to common objections about Wikipedia:</p>
<p>....There is a problem with the concept of peer review in general. Many great advances in the social and natural sciences have come by challenging the status quo and, because of that, their contributions were ignored or belittled by their peers. For example, George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics in 2001, had his classic paper (for which he won the Nobel Prize) entitled "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism" rejected by the American Economic Review for being trivial and by the Journal of Political Economy because it conflicted with economic theory. Only after submitting it to a third journal, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, did the breakthrough article become published. <b>Wikipedia allows for discourse where other venues would not.</b></p>
<p>This is exactly why the minority view quote I cited earlier is in existence.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Here is the policy once again:</p>
<p>None of this, however, is to say that <b>minority views</b> cannot receive <b>as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views.</b> <b>There is no size limit to Wikipedia.</b> But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in <b>great detail</b>, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth.</p>
<p>Is the policy going to be respected or not?</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a> 02:43, 9 September 2005 (UTC)kdbuffalo</p>
<p>It certainly is going to be respected by me. I'm quite interested in this subject, albeit a minority view, and I'm happy to give it a fair degree of attention and an corresponding degree of detail. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 05:06, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>to: MickWest</b></p>
<p>MickWest I appreciate your last comment. It displayed courtesy and kindness</p>
<p><br />
<b>to: All</b></p>
<p><b>Re: Wikipedia being alledgedly merely a tertiary source</b>.</p>
<p>It is untrue. The Wikipedia paragraph cited above regarding the weakness that peer entails and the welcoming of minority views by Wikipedia clearly demonstrates this.</p>
<p><br />
<b>re: Conciseness/brevity and minority view articles</b></p>
<p>The Wikipedia people were astute enough people to recognize the foibles of men and that they would use brevity/conciseness complaints in order to exclude minority views from being full expressed. Therefore, they were quite clear that minority views can go into "great detail" in minority view articles and that there is "no size limit to Wikipedia". The minority view status of this article overrules any brevity/conciseness claims. In short, Wikipedia set up a system of checks and balances so the majority view would get more attention but at the time allowing very liberal rights to minority view articles with few restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="Why__the_article_is_POV" id="Why__the_article_is_POV"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why the article is POV</span></h2>
<p>I wanted the article to be de-protected, so I agreeded to let a paragraph back in the article. However, I still feel that the overall tone of the article is overly slanted towards promoting BSF, rather than providing a balanced look at the subject.</p>
<p>Specifically, many "facts" are noted without enough context to be meaningful, and without the context that really explains how they fit into the whole argument.</p>
<p>Here's one sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For example, it has been found that Pakastani caregivers who use topical antibiotics for their babies circumcision wounds instead of using dung, ghee, urine etc, prevent that babies from getting neo natal tetanus.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Interesting stuff. Types of dung, <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghee.html" title="Ghee">ghee</a> (clarified butter) and urine have been used for thousands of years (since pre-egyptian times) for their anti-biotic and other medicinal purposes. Yet what does this have to do with BSF?</p>
<p>Examine the chain of logic implied by the presence of that sentence in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since: Use of antibiotics to treat circumcisions leads to less neo-natal tetanus than the use of dung.</li>
<li>Therefore: Dung might be a contributing factor to neo-natal tetanus when applied to open wounds (the study's conclusion).</li>
<li>Therefore: The use of dung as a medicine is harmful</li>
<li>Since: The Egyptians used dung in some remedies</li>
<li>Therefore: Egyptian medicine contains harmful remedies</li>
<li>Since: The Mosaic code contains no harmful remedies</li>
<li>Therefore: The Mosaic code is more advanced medicinally than Egyptian medicine</li>
<li>Therefore: The Mosaic code must have been the word of God.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problems here are obvious: this argument is basically an appeal to emotion - "Egytian medicine was based on excrement, Mosaic medicine was based on cleanliness". This ignores that fact that there are thousands of detailed and effective remedies and medical procedures in the Egyptian papyri, and almost <b>none</b> in the Mosaic code. The ommision of context makes the inclusion POV.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The levels of hygiene suggested by a strict following of the Mosaic rituals of cleanliness are relativly modern.</li>
<li>A small minority of fundamentalist Christians regard this as evidence of knowledge not possible at that time, and hence of the inerrancy and divine inspiration of the Bible.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it for that topic. Very little other than is actually adding to the article qua Wikipedia article. The dung argument is POV, and if mention of it is to be made in the article, it needs to be in proper context. Other than readability (an overlooked issue here) I have no problem with spelling out the BSF minority view in great detail, so long as we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth.</p>
