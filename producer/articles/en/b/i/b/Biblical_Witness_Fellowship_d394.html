	    <p><b>Biblical Witness Fellowship</b> is a conservative evangelical affinity group composed of members of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Christ_7fcb.html" title="United Church of Christ">United Church of Christ</a>. Founded in 1978 as the <b>United Church People for Biblical Witness</b>, the movement reorganized as the Biblical Witness Fellowship at a national convocation in <a href="../../../b/y/f/Byfield%2C_Massachusetts_78e2.html" title="Byfield, Massachusetts">Byfield, Mass.</a> in 1984, hosted by the current president of BWF, the Rev. Dr. William Boylan.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of BWF is "to renew spiritual vitality through faith in Jesus Christ in every local congregation, restoring commitment to the original call and vision of these churches and their denomination." The BWF holds that congregations of the United Church of Christ have been in numerical and spiritual decline, citing denominational statistics that report net losses of members and congregations in every year since 1963.</p>
<p>BWF has consistenly voiced its criticism of UCC statements for regarding things they believe to be contrary to the Bible, such as <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/-/Bi-sexual.html" title="Bi-sexual">bi-sexual</a> relationships. Several of these statements have included the "<a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_and_Affirming_a30d.html" title="Open and Affirming">Open and Affirming</a>" resolution of 1985, the 2004-2007 "<a href="../../../g/o/d/God_is_Still_Speaking%2C_165c.html" title="God is Still Speaking,">God is Still Speaking,</a>" advertising campaign, and, perhaps most strongly of all, the 2005 "<a href="../../../r/e/s/Resolutions_of_United_Church_of_Christ_General_Synod_XXV_f696.html" title="Resolutions of United Church of Christ General Synod XXV">Equal Marriage Rights For All</a>" resolution. The BWF espouses a strong stance against <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, an affirmation of marriage as between men and women only, and opposition to non-marital sexual practices, sometimes in strong opposition to the stances taken by UCC General Synods and leadership. In response to the "Equal Marriage Rights for All" resolution of 2005, BWF Executive Director David Runnion-Bareford, a pastor in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candia%2C_New_Hampshire_517f.html" title="Candia, New Hampshire">Candia, N.H.</a>, called for the resignation of UCC President John Thomas.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Witness_Fellowship_d394.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings of BWF">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings of BWF</span></h2>
<p>The impetus for the birth of Biblical Witness Fellowship was a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">human sexuality</a> report accepted by the General Synod in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. Since that time the BWF has consistenly voiced its criticism of UCC statements for supporting beliefs and beahviors that they believe unsupported by the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> or orthodox (particularly <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed.html" title="Reformed">Reformed</a>) doctrine.</p>
<p>Members of the BWF affirm a statement of Christian faith known as the "Dubuque Declaration" (named for the <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubuque%2C_Iowa_2ac1.html" title="Dubuque, Iowa">city</a> where it was drafted), as well as affirming the historic creeds and statements of the Protestant <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a>. The movement and its supporters declare that the name reflects its high regard for the authority of Scripture on matters of faith and morals, while critics regard the group as <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literalist.html" title="Literalist">literalist</a> in its interpretative methods, hostile to contemporary Biblical and theological scholarship.</p>
<p>In 1984, the BWF decided to expand from its original emphasis on protesting national policy stands into a full-fledged para-church program agency, offering alternatives to the UCC system for its member congregations such as support for the training of evangelical (e.g., non-<a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a>) pastors and endorsement of international mission work, a field in which it criticizes the present Wider Church Ministries of the UCC as having abandoned entirely, or augmented with unacceptable political activity. This latter activity comes under the umbrella of the <b>Missions Renewal Network</b>, which connects local congregations with missionaries and mission projects rooted in their common history and tradition. The MRN has networked over 100 missionaries with local churches since its creation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Witness_Fellowship_d394.html" title="Edit section: Organizations founded">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Organizations founded</span></h2>
<p>Biblical Witness Fellowship is also a founding member of the <b>Association For Church Renewal</b>, a coalition of the leadership of numerous renewal agitating for change within most "mainline" Protestant denominations; thus, the BWF has similar characteristics to "renewal" groups in other <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> denominations such as the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_Church_1bad.html" title="Episcopal Church">Episcopal Church</a> and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian_Church_%28USA%29_d5d0.html" title="Presbyterian Church (USA)">Presbyterian Church (USA)</a>. The Rev. Runnion-Bareford serves on the steering committee of the ACR.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Witness_Fellowship_d394.html" title="Edit section: Resolutions Presented">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Resolutions Presented</span></h2>
<p>The renewal movement has presented seven resolutions to recent General Synods four of which have been successfully passed in amended form. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Affirming the Cross Triumphant and the Lordship of Jesus Christ" (2005)</li>
<li>"Mutual Respect Within the Faith Community" (2001)</li>
<li>"Affirming and Strengthening Marriage" (1999)</li>
<li>"Standing in Solidarity with the Persecuted Church" (1999)</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted, however, that all of the four were altered, through committee deliberations, from their original texts as submitted to the floor of their respective Synods. This process largely rendered them non-controversial, and they have not assuaged BWF or other conservative leaders in their critique of the liberationist ethos governing the denomination generally.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Witness_Fellowship_d394.html" title="Edit section: Criticisms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms</span></h2>
<p>Leaders of the United Church of Christ have recently begun to issue criticism of the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Religion_and_Democracy_381b.html" title="Institute for Religion and Democracy">Institute for Religion and Democracy</a> and groups associated with it. In a speech <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a>, 2005, President John Thomas accused the IRD of becoming over-involved with conservatives within the UCC. He said, <i>"In the midst of all of this we are increasingly aware of the challenge of groups within and beyond the United Church of Christ that claim to represent the call to honor theological diversity in the United Church of Christ, that encourage the voice of more conservative sisters and brothers among us, but which are in fact intent on disrupting and destroying our life together."<sup id="_ref-News356_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-News356" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>At <a href="../../../g/e/t/Gettysburg_College_e855.html" title="Gettysburg College">Gettysburg College</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">March 6</a>, 2006, Thomas again warned against collusion with the IRD, calling called the IRD "a sophisticated 'inside the beltway' organization well funded by conservative foundations and closely aligned with a neo-conservative political agenda." Thomas criticized IRD's association with the Association of Church Renewal, with the <strong class="selflink">Biblical Witness Fellowship</strong>, with "Welcoming and Faithful Movement" [sic], and the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center_2b98.html" title="Simon Wiesenthal Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>. Further, Thomas described IRD's <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modus_operandi.html" title="Modus operandi">modus operandi</a> as follows: "The IRD pursues its political agenda in the churches through three strategies: campaigns of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinformation.html" title="Disinformation">disinformation</a> that seek to discredit church leadership, advocacy efforts at church assemblies seeking to influence church policy, and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grass_roots.html" title="Grass roots">grass roots</a> organizing which, in some cases, encourages <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schism_%28religion%29.html" title="Schism (religion)">schismatic</a> movements encouraging members and congregations either to redirect mission funding or even to leave their denominations. Indeed, the Mainline churches are facing <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardball.html" title="Hardball">hardball</a> tactics."<sup id="_ref-News483_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-News483" title="">[2]</a></sup> Following the speech, the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center_2b98.html" title="Simon Wiesenthal Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> denied any connection to the IRD and stated <i>"John Thomas made some conspiratorial charges about the Wiesenthal Center at a recent speech at Gettysburg College. These charges are completely inaccurate and are not based on fact and the irresponsible nature of these comments should make reasonable people wonder if the leadership of the UCC is being equally irresponsible with the facts about the Middle-East."</i><sup id="_ref-Truths200603_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Truths200603" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Numerous congregations formerly affiliated with the BWF have decided, since the 2005 Synod marriage resolution, to leave the UCC altogether. Thus, the actual number (and configuration) of supporting congregations has changed quite drastically in the past several years, probably undergoing significant decline, unlike the "renewal" movements within Presbyterianism and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Methodist_Church_6a72.html" title="United Methodist Church">United Methodist Church</a>, for instance.</p>
