<p>would be nice to see the following information added: hermeneutics and prophecy as well as a link to biblical hermeneutics examples of biblical prophecy with different opinions on each examples interpretations more information regarding dating specific books of the bible (for example, as well as for daniel, it is important for christians that the gospels be dated before the destruction of the second temple) information on the critics claim that the bible has been falsified addition of more diverse theological and rationalist views of prophecy which branches of christianity today believe that prophecy still occurs within the church and which branches believe that prophecy ended at the destruction of the temple? how do the churches practicing prophecy, organize and deal with their prophets and prophecy?</p>
<p>though I dont totally agree with the npov nomination, I think that adding information on the differences between judaic and christian interpretations of key verses would help...an example is, I believe, Psalms 22. Christians often say these verses are about the messiah, Judaism however does not believe this. Also when discussing specific verses, please discuss translation issues.</p>

<dd>After having just read this article for the first time I agreed with the tag placed in one section that it seemed to be presenting a certain perspective persuasively using non-NPOV language. It wasn't that it was poorly written, it's just in the wrong place for a appologetic article on 7th day adventism. It also lacked citations and sources and thus appeared to be original research on the part of the author. I removed the section but not to worry, it's still in the history if anyone would like to rework it to NPOV stance, using citations and appropriate neutrality.

<p>I could have added a lot more resources on the pro-Bible side.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>BIBLE PROPHETS VERSUS NON-BIBLE MEDIUMS/PSYCHICS</p>
<p>Brookside Church in Ohio states the following regarding the Bible's laws regarding prophets and the accuracy of modern day psychics as reported by a recent study:</p>
<p>"A true prophet is correct 100% of the time. A test of a prophet was whether they prophesied an event that did not come to pass. Prophets whose predictions failed to come to pass were stoned [It should be said that some prophecies were conditional. For example, if a certain people did not repent then they would suffer judgement.] Some prophecies w. People would think twice before revealing any kind of prophecy. Yet the Bible contains more prophecy about Jesus than any other book on any other founder of ancient religion.</p>
<p>Today there are people who claim to have psychic power. In 1975, The People's Almanac did a study of 25 of the best psychics. Out of 72 predictions, 66 (92%) were totally wrong. The remaining 8% could be explained away."</p>

MORE INFORMATION</p>
<p>it would be nice if someone included information from judaic ideas and words for prophecy (multiple words with different meanings), the christian church often uses the word "prophecy" in the sense of the future, where as biblical this is not always the case with the idea of prophecy DanteDanti</p>

<p>a link to the Wikipedia Book of Daniel article will reveal that not only Porphyry but many modern scholars believe that chapters 7-11 were all written after the desecration of the Temple in 168.BCE by Antiochus. - Indeed, a lot of scholars believe the whole book was written at this time, possibly incorporating earlier stories in chapters 1-6. And a link to the article on Apocalyptic literature tells us that The Book of Daniel is "a fully matured and classic example of this genre of literature." 82.38.88.156 23:17, 17 October 2005 (UTC)David Goss</p>
<dl>
<dd>A good point (and this really should have been edited by now). The late authorship of Daniel is now the mainstream scholarly view: Britannica, for instance, states this as fact. It is disingenuous to imply that this was just Porphyry's view. I have edited accordingly: "(a view now shared by many modern scholars)". I was tempted to say "most", but I expect someone might challenge me on the actual numbers. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 11:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) I am unsure of how I feel about the opening sentence to this article, but I want to think about that more, maybe some of you can think about it too. There is just something wrong with it and I cant put my finger on it. 2) I'm going to clean up some not so good word usage that is unnecessary or vague. and also do some grammatical checks. 3) In my opinion, the sentence on biblical heremeneutics is not accurate. I'm going to posts something on the biblical hermeneutics page also. I might reword that sentence later.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Talk%7EBible_prophecy_ee10.html" title="Edit section: Roman Empire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Roman Empire</span></h2>
<p>I get annoyed by people who say the Bible points to the European Union as the new Roman Empire but two points have just struck me and I was wondering if anyone can shed light on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The Roman Empire was alive and well when the New Testament was written, so how can the Bible foresee the re-creation of an empire <i>which had not yet fallen apart</i>? Did the Bible foresee the collapse of the Roman Empire in the first place? Is there a specific section of the Bible which <b>specifically mentions</b> the collapse of the Empire, then the re-creation of the Empire, or is it just the way a particular verse is interpreted? I've just googled the specific passages of Daniel mentioned in the article and they don't seem to have anything to do with this prediction. Also, wasn't Daniel written <i>before</i> the Roman Empire? How can it predict the re-formation of an empire which hadn't even been established for the first time, never mind a second time?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) Why do people say that the <i>European Union</i> is the reformed Roman Empire? Why do they not point to <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_French_Empire_8d79.html" title="First French Empire">Napoleon's Empire</a>, or the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Reich_a799.html" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a>, or the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, or the Empire of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, or the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> or any of the other large supra-national political entities which have been created in Europe between the end of the Roman Empire and the present day? Why is the finger pointed at the EU and none of these previous entities? It seems a strange choice, considering that the EU is mostly made up of countries which weren't in the Roman Empire in the first place. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 16:05, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>NPOV dispute: I don't see the point in removing the entire article under the subheading "Modern Perspectives by non evangelicals" due to the claim it was a POV article. The entire subsection has been removed with it now. To remove the entire sub section is to make the entire Wikpedia page a POV from the Evangelical perspective. The article conformed to the subheading and referenced a major non evangelical site as one example of the perspective in question. After all, the subheading is (was) seeking for a perspective from the non evangelical POV. It was for anybody to read and come to their own conclusion. Removing the entire sub section can be construed as a Wikpedian merely not approving of the perspective.</p>

<p>"Another example, would be that Arthur C. Custance (weblink) maintained that the Ezekiel Tyre prophecy (Ezek. 26: 1-11; 29:17-20) was very remarkable. On the other hand, scholar Gustave Holscher maintained that certain passages of the book of Ezekiel were not written by a pre-Exilic prophet of Israel but were later added in the Persian period."</p>
<p>This is rather misleading. It gives the impression that there IS an apparent "fulfilled prophecy" here, which (for a skeptic) would <i>require</i> an explanation such as "written later". But actually the <i>failure</i> of the Tyre prophecy seems readily apparent (Tyre does still exist, after all: contrary to the prophecy) and requires no such explanation. Indeed, I've seen it argued that Ezekiel must have been edited <i>because</i> the failure is so obvious (i.e. Ezekiel's enemies must have done it to discredit him). I haven't been able to find out whether this is Gustave Holscher's position. Otherwise, the evident failure is used by skeptics as evidence <i>against</i> the notion of after-the-event authorship, on the assumption that Ezekiel wouldn't have retrospectively written an already-failed prophecy.</p>
<p>BTW, What's going on with "External Links"?</p>
<p>"Prophecy in the news currently - Fulfillment of end time prophecy taking place now". The title of the linked article is "Prophecy in the news currently": the additional comment "fulfillment of end time prophecy taking place now" appears to be a POV. At best, the word "Alleged... should be inserted.</p>
<p>Ditto with "Fulfilled Prophecy - Unfolding events prophesied in the book of Revelation." The phrase "Unfolding events prophesied..." appears to be unjustifiable.</p>
<p>"Messianic Prophecy: Messianic prophecy - Compelling predictions". The title of the article DOES include the phrase "Compelling predictions", but if the phrase is to be included, why not include it in the title of the link? As it stands, it gives the <i>impression</i> of a Wikipedia endorsement.</p>
<p>Ditto for "...Revealing the future through Bible prophecy". It IS in the title, so why isn't it part of the link text?</p>
<p>There is also a shortage of external links <i>critical</i> of the notion of Biblical prophesy. Should there be "Pro" and "Con" sections? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 12:47, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: as nobody seems to be raising an objection, I've removed the POV comments on various external links as described above, and added Farrell Till's "Prophecies: Imaginary and Unfulfilled" and Curt van den Heuvel's "Revealing Daniel". --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 11:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

But the existence of Tyre is not a "point of view" as claimed: it is a fact that can easily be verified by consulting any atlas (in fact, modern Tyre is the fourth-largest city in Lebanon). Is the existence of Jerusalem "POV" too? This is ridiculous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is also silly to suggest that a citation is need for the claim that "many modern scholars" regard Daniel as written late. This is common knowledge, and there's a <i>Wikipedia page</i> on Daniel which dicusses this in detail! It appears that this editor wishes the original <i>misleading</i> wording to remain: the implication that only Porphyry held this view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for his previous edit: if he wants a citation for " In the last century this view has been accepted by many in Judaism, Catholic Christianity, in theologically liberal branches of Protestant Christianity, and in Unitarian Universalism. However, this view is totally rejected by Evangelical and Fundamentalist Christians", then surely a "citation needed" tag would have been more appropriate than outright deletion? I am reverting to the version prior to these changes. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 22:40, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Update: I have reverted another attempt to censor the existence of Tyre (including deletion of my link to the Tyre page), by user 136.183.146.158, with the comment "no exegesis done for claim". Tyre EXISTS: this is a fact, and "Biblical exegesis" won't change that fact. Nor will it change the fact that Ezekiel prophesied permanent destruction. I am well aware of apologetic <i>attempts</i> to get around this problem (e.g. Tyre was to be permanently destroyed in a "metaphorical sense"), and I know why such arguments fail. But Wikipedia is not the place for apologetics. The section is intended to point out the reason why <i>skeptics</i> consider the prophecy to have failed: regardless of whether you agree with it or not. And, in my experience, many of the more clueless apologists actually <i>don't know</i> that Tyre exists: I've seen claims that "the island sank" and that Tyre is "just a fishing village". This sort of very basic factual error needs correcting, and that IS within the remit of an encyclopaedia.</dd>

<p>The section on the "Tyre prophecy" is being continually reverted, most notably by user <a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">User:Kdbuffalo</a>, with no comment on this Talk page and the comment "no exegesis done" for the actual deletion. But the article cites a legitimate, citation-supported critical view of this Biblical prophecy: that many reject the notion of the "Tyre prophecy" <i>because it apparently failed</i>. <b>Even if</b> "Biblical exegesis" could somehow solve this problem (and I know from experience that it cannot), that wouldn't change the fact that this is a common reason <i>given by skeptics</i> for THEIR view regarding this issue.

<dd>...Then would you mind explaining why you have elsewhere posted material from J. P. Holding, a Christian apologist who has no relevant credentials whatsoever? Farrell Till is a notable authority, his work has passed scholarly peer-review, and he represents a legitimate and widely-held view. Hence, I will revert this (again). Besides, this view of the Tyre prophecy is common among <i>Christians</i> too (other than inerrantists, of course). Even if "they all got it wrong", it would <i>still</i> be a common and notable view. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 19:04, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Till has numerous articles in the Secular Web's "Modern Documents" library, which has a peer-review process on submissions<a href="http://www.infidels.org/infidels/submit.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/infidels/submit.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. In any case, exegesis doesn't require any specific qualifications: it's merely reading what the author actually wrote (in context) to determine what he meant, rather than imposing one's own views on the text. As a former Church-Of-Christ pastor and missionary, who attended two of their colleges and obtained his degrees there, Till is well aware of Christian <i>interpretations</i> of scripture, but his English degrees <i>are</i> relevant to his expertise in semantics and the structure of language, which helps to determine meaning. In the Till/Hogan discussion (<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/prophecy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/prophecy.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1996/5/5tyre96.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1996/5/5tyre96.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1996/5/5error96.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1996/5/5error96.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1997/1/1tyre97.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1997/1/1tyre97.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1997/1/1roman97.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1997/1/1roman97.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1997/2/2mail97.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1997/2/2mail97.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), his exegesis of the Tyre prophecy was a major factor in his victory.</dd>

<dd>It's worth comparing this with Holding's sloppy exegesis of the Tyre prophecy<a href="http://www.tektonics.org/uz/zeketyre.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tektonics.org/uz/zeketyre.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. In his interpretation of "many nations", Holding failed to notice that Ezekiel described Nebby as "King of kings" (i.e. an overking, a ruler of many nations) in Ezekiel 26:7. He also failed to notice that the separation of the prophecy into "Nebby's part" and "Alexander's part" doesn't really help, because Nebby's failure to breach the walls of Tyre and enter the city means that the part allocated specifically to HIM failed (Ezekiel 26:9-11). Holding was apparently unaware of the fact that the city of Tyre was on the island, even though Ezekiel himself apparently understood this, consistently referring to Tyre as "in the midst of the sea", likening attackers to waves of the sea, and playing with the "top of a rock" metaphor (referring to the great rock of the island fortress that gave the city its name). --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 11:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)
