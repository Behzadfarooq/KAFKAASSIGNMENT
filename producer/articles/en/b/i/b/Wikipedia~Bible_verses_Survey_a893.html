<ul>
<li>Include x 11 (28% of total, 30% of include/remove votes)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
<li>Remove x 25 (65% of total, 70% of include/remove votes)</li>
<li>Abstain x 3 (8% of total)</li>

<li>Too literal interpreation of the rules. While I dont agree with having every 3-line bible verse have its own Wikipedia article, I dont agree that using a rule technicality is the way to go about things. For example the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_literature_eb50.html" title="Anglo-Saxon literature">Cædmon's Hymn</a> is 9-lines long, it is the oldest surviving piece of written literature in the (Old) English Language. Should we exclude it from Wikipedia based on some technicality of a rule? Rediculous. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 9 July 2005 19:03 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This isn't about 3 line verses. This is about articles on the entire chapter (e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_1.html" title="Matthew 1">Matthew 1</a>) containing the entire chapter. Note that this also has NPOV issues about which version of the text do you use - if you use more than one, it becomes huge in proportion to the remainder of the text. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a>
<dl>
<dd>I see what your saying. I think the way it's structured, with seperate aritcles for every verse, you almost have to have a top-level article that shows things in context. It's a nice layout and would be exactly what you would want in an annotated book, which is probably where all this material really belongs, in part because as you say, POV issues. The more I look at this, the more Im leaning towards Transwiki to Wikibooks ("Annotated King James" or whatever), but would like to see what others have to say further. <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 20:17, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Judgement should be used. If the article is dominated by the quoted material, then there's no point. If the article is substantial enough that the quoted chapter is only a small portion, then the full text should be included. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamw_5671.html" title="User:Samw">Samw</a> 01:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think there's anything wrong with including it. Similar to the above comments, I think that good judgement is most important in such situations. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 20:05, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I read the Matthew articles and I was astonished by their depth. Therefore I vote <b>Include</b>. The explanation given in the articles needs the full text of the verses. And, in my opinion, it would even be advisable to include the vulgate latin text, so that one can compare the English text with the Latin text for a full understanding. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 20:32, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reasonable source inclusion, of which these articles are an example, seems appropriate. Not sure, however, what this is intended to accomplish. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 04:45, 2005 July 12 (UTC)</li>
<li>Include whatever text is necessary for the article to make sense. Trying to regulate the exact amount of text acceptable is just instruction creep. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:56, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Include</b> concurr with Uppland. The article should contain as much bible text as is needed. IMHO every bible verse is encyclopedic so this whole argument is moot. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, they can. Many times the entire chapter is useful, and when it is not, a proportion-of-article rule is too instruction creepy. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 04:36, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Source text belong to Wikisource; on here, they only bloat the article immensely, make it difficult to read, and present NPOV issues if you only present one particular translation. -- <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchneelocke_ee99.html" title="User:Schneelocke">Schnee</a> (<i><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchneelocke_54a1.html" title="User talk:Schneelocke">cheeks clone</a></i>) 20:21, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikisource.

<li>Wikisource. In terms of quotations, I don't see why the Bible should be any different from any other text.

<li>Once more, that's what Wikisource is for. The bible is a source text. And as a side point, it's really not comprehensive to create a separate article on each verse, as is sometimes done. It makes for better reading if they're put together. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 09:13, July 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Only <i>very</i> brief <i>pertinent</i> citations of a <i>few</i> verses (not more than from 3 to 6 or so) if needed should be allowed, but most certainly NOT entire chapters. Links to original Biblical sources both inside and outside of Wikipedia are enough. Why on Earth would anyone want to stick in an entire chapter in an article???

<li>I think there should be a policy one way or the other. Appealing to better judgement doesn't translate to the same outcome for other uses. If authors are allowed to quote in full, then inevitably all Chapters will be quoted in full. I disagree with some above in that I do think this is convenient. However, there is a minor NPOV question with reguard to inclusion. In fact differences between biblical versions should be discussed at times. I personally prefer more modern versions anyways. In my opinion, it would actually be better to provide a link to Wikisource, which should be developed as well as or even superior to BibleGateway, for instance allowing arbitrary links to consecutive verses. Davilla 16:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Remove</b>. Having examined the articles in question, I don't see what value is added by including the entire source text; in fact, in my opinion, links to the relevant portions of Wikisource would be <i>more</i> useful.

<li>I'm not for inclusion just for the sake of it. A number of current articles have text in them, which I think is very unneccessary - and particularly where multiple translations are included (as has been said, the texts are available elsewhere). However, I'm not in favour of a hard and fast rule. Some short passages may benefit from the text (particularly where the details are a matter of scholarly debate) - sometimes here even multiple translations could be useful. Unfortunately, the desire of some to put the whole texts in everywhere, is leading objectors to want a rule against it - and the rule may have undesirable consequences in other articles. Perhaps <b>no rule - but both sides moderate their editing practice</b>. Polls <i><b>are</b></i>, after all, evil --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:34, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, obviously <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_wept.html" title="Jesus wept">Jesus wept</a> not being allowed to contain the entire verse would be ridiculous, but we are discussing whole chapters here. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a></dd>

<li>I have to concur with <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a>. Having a rule isn't really the solution. You definitely run into problems when there is more than one accepted translation of a text (such as the Bible). But I think that if there is only one translation (or a translation viewed as the most authoritative), then putting in the text is okay. Again, it should be always in moderation. --<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonrad_West_6f02.html" title="User:Konrad West">K.</a> 03:45, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A discussion would have been useful before someone created 100+ articles for individual verses, many of them spurious, and 6+ articles about chapters, which all included the entire text of the verse/chapter. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 21:27, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What does this survey have to do with the <i>existence</i> of any article? What does this survey have to do about <i>any</i> article on a Bible verse?

<dd>If you read fully what I have written, you will note that the latter third of the sentence explains the relationship. I made no mention in that sentence of existance of articles, but of existence of the entire text of verse/chapter.

<li>If this is a policy proposal (as per the notice) then it does not look well worded. Should it not have a clearly worded proposed policy, and then an invitation to vote 'for' or ‘against’? Because of its lack of clarity, I suspect t this poll will be open to a variety of interpretations. Are those voting 'remove' wanting a rule that chapter text should <i>always</i> be removed? Are those voting 'include' wanting a rule that chapter text should <i>always</i> be included? (Both sound like instruction creep.) If this is a policy proposal let it be clearly worded and a fresh vote taken. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 14:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
