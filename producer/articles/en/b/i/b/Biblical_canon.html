	    <p>A <b>biblical canon</b> is a list published by a religious authority of those books of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> that are considered inspired by <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>. Biblical works excluded from a particular canon are considered <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">apocryphal</a>; however, many disputed works considered "apocryphal" by some Churches are considered <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">'deuterocanonical'</a>, or fully canonical, by others. There are differences between the Jewish and Christian canons, and between the canons of different <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christian_denominations_5e01.html" title="List of Christian denominations">Christian traditions</a>. The differing criteria and processes of canonization dictate what the communities regard as the inspired books.</p>
<p>At this time the canons listed below are usually considered <i>closed</i> (additional books cannot be added). By contrast, an <i>open</i> canon would allow additional books, should they meet the criteria. The closure of the canon reflects a belief that public <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> has ended and thus the inspired texts may be gathered into a complete and authoritative canon.</p>

<p>A <b>canonic text</b> is a single authoritative edition for a given work. The establishing of a canon text may involve an editorial selection from manuscript traditions with varying interdependence. Significant separate manuscript traditions in the canonic <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> are represented in the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic.html" title="Masoretic">Masoretic text</a>, and the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_scrolls_8d81.html" title="Dead Sea scrolls">Dead Sea scrolls</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> Greek and Latin texts presented enough significant differences that a manuscript tradition arose of presenting <i>diglot</i> texts, with Greek and Latin on facing pages. New Testament manuscript traditions include the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Vaticanus_f31d.html" title="Codex Vaticanus">Codex Vaticanus</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Sinaiticus_96ac.html" title="Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Bezae_d816.html" title="Codex Bezae">Codex Bezae</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textus_Receptus_8cfe.html" title="Textus Receptus">Textus Receptus</a>, <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, and others.</p>

</dl>
<p>The <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> recognize the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible as the Tanakh. Evidence suggests that the process of canonization of the Tanakh occurred between 200 BCE and 200 CE. The first suggestion of a Jewish canon comes in the 2nd century BCE. The book of <a href="../../../2/_/m/2_Maccabees_ed27.html" title="2 Maccabees">2 Maccabees</a>, itself not a part of the Jewish canon, describes <a href="../../../n/e/h/Nehemiah.html" title="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> (around 400 BCE) as having "founded a library and collected books about the kings and prophets, and the writings of David, and letters of kings about votive offerings" (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%202Macc&amp;verse=2:13-15&amp;src=NRSV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%202Macc&amp;verse=2:13-15&amp;src=NRSV" rel="nofollow">2Macc 2:13-15</a>). The <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Nehemiah_3437.html" title="Book of Nehemiah">Book of Nehemiah</a> suggests that <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra.html" title="Ezra">Ezra</a> brought the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> back from <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a> to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Temple_74d1.html" title="Second Temple">Second Temple</a> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Nehemiah&amp;verse=8&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Nehemiah&amp;verse=8&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">8</a>). Both I and II Maccabees suggest that <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Maccabeus_d8a0.html" title="Judas Maccabeus">Judas Maccabeus</a> likewise collected sacred books (such as <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%201Macc&amp;verse=3:42-50&amp;src=NRSV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%201Macc&amp;verse=3:42-50&amp;src=NRSV" rel="nofollow">1Macc 3:42-50</a>, <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%202Macc&amp;verse=15:6-9&amp;src=NRSV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%202Macc&amp;verse=15:6-9&amp;src=NRSV" rel="nofollow">2Macc 15:6-9</a>). They do not, however, suggest that the canon was at that time closed; moreover, it is not clear that these sacred books were identical to those that later became part of the canon.</p>
<p>Additional evidence of a collection of sacred scripture similar to portions of the Hebrew Bible comes from the book of <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirach.html" title="Sirach">Sirach</a> (dating from 180 BCE and also not included in the Jewish canon), which includes a list of names of great men (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Sirach&amp;verse=44-49&amp;src=NRSV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Sirach&amp;verse=44-49&amp;src=NRSV" rel="nofollow">44-49</a>) in the same order as is found in the Torah and the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevi%27im.html" title="Nevi'im">Nevi'im</a> (Prophets), and which includes the names of some men mentioned in the <a href="../../../k/e/t/Ketuvim.html" title="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a> (Writings). Based on this list of names, some scholars have conjectured<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> that the author, <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirach.html" title="Sirach">Yeshua ben Sira</a> (Joshua son of Sirach) had access to, and considered authoritative, the books of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Numbers_dd63.html" title="Book of Numbers">Numbers</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuteronomy.html" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Joshua_3669.html" title="Book of Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Judges_cf84.html" title="Book of Judges">Judges</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_Samuel_5b87.html" title="Books of Samuel">Samuel</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_Kings_a671.html" title="Books of Kings">Kings</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jeremiah_74cb.html" title="Book of Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, and the twelve <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_prophets.html" title="Minor prophets">minor prophets</a>. His list excludes names from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ruth_856a.html" title="Book of Ruth">Ruth</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_of_Songs_bf66.html" title="Song of Songs">Song of Songs</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Esther_ae93.html" title="Book of Esther">Esther</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Daniel_27ba.html" title="Book of Daniel">Daniel</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Job_cd51.html" title="Book of Job">Job</a>, suggesting that he either did not have access to these books, or did not consider them authoritative. In the prologue to the Greek translation of Ben Sira's work, his grandson, dated at 132 BCE, mentions both the Law (Torah) and the Prophets (Nevi'im), as well as a third group of books which is not yet named as Ketuvim (the prologue simply identifies "the rest of the books") <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV2&amp;byte=3978863" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV2&amp;byte=3978863" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Based on this evidence, some scholars have suggested that by the 2nd century BCE the books of the Torah and Nevi'im were considered canonical, but that the books of the Ketuvim were not.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> (LXX) translation of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew language</a> Bible into <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koine_Greek_17ca.html" title="Koine Greek">Koine Greek</a>, probably in the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_century_BC_8889.html" title="1st century BC">1st</a> and 2nd centuries BCE, provided a text for the Greek-speaking world and was used by the writers of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. In this text (actually <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scroll_%28parchment%29.html" title="Scroll (parchment)">scrolls</a> rather than a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex.html" title="Codex">book</a>) the Torah and Nevi'im are established as canonical, but again, Ketuvim have not yet been definitively canonized (some editions of the Septuagint include, for instance I-IV Maccabees or the 151st Psalm, while others do not include them, also there are the Septuagint additions to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Esther_ae93.html#Additions_to_Esther" title="Book of Esther">Esther</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jeremiah_74cb.html#Septuagint_version" title="Book of Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, and <a href="../../../a/d/d/Additions_to_Daniel_6ff6.html" title="Additions to Daniel">Daniel</a> and <a href="../../../1/_/e/1_Esdras_ecb9.html" title="1 Esdras">1 Esdras</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_scrolls_8d81.html" title="Dead Sea scrolls">Dead Sea scrolls</a> discovered at caves near <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qumran.html" title="Qumran">Qumran</a> refer to the Torah and Nevi'im and suggest that these portions of the Bible had already been canonized before 68 CE. A scroll that contains all or parts of 41 biblical psalms, although not in the same order as in the current <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Psalms_adda.html" title="Book of Psalms">Book of Psalms</a>, and which includes eight texts not found in the Book of Psalms, suggests that the Book of Psalms had not yet been canonized.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_century.html" title="First century">first century</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo.html" title="Philo">Philo</a> Judaeus of Alexandria discussed sacred books, but made no mention of a tripartite division of the Bible; however, in <i>De vita contemplativa</i><a href="http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book34.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book34.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, a disputed text,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> v.25, is stated: "studying ... the laws and the sacred oracles of God enunciated by the holy prophets, and hymns, and psalms, and all kinds of other things by reason of which knowledge and piety are increased and brought to perfection." Significantly, Philo quotes extensively from the Hebrew canon, including parts of the Ketuvim, but never from its <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">apocrypha</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> refers to sacred scriptures divided into three parts: the five books of the Torah; thirteen books of the Nevi'im, and four other books of hymns and wisdom.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The number of 22 books mentioned by Josephus does not correspond to the number of books in the current canon. Some scholars have suggested that he considered Ruth part of Judges, and <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamentations.html" title="Lamentations">Lamentations</a> part of Jeremiah. Other scholars suggest that at the time Josephus wrote, such books as Esther and <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastes.html" title="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> were not yet considered canonical.</p>
<p>Significantly, Josephus characterizes the 22 books as canonical because they were divinely inspired; he mentions other historical books that were not divinely inspired and that therefore do not belong in the canon.</p>
<p>The first reference to a 24-book Jewish canon is found in <a href="../../../2/_/e/2_Esdras_3513.html" title="2 Esdras">2 Esdras</a> <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%202Esdras&amp;verse=14:45-46&amp;src=NRSV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%202Esdras&amp;verse=14:45-46&amp;src=NRSV" rel="nofollow">14:45-46</a>, which was probably written in the first half of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_century.html" title="Second century">second century</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Make public the twenty-four books that you wrote first, and let the worthy and the unworthy read them; but keep the seventy that were written last, in order to give them to the wise among your people." <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Standard_Version_3dd6.html" title="Revised Standard Version">RSV</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The "seventy" might refer to the Septuagint, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">apocrypha</a>, or <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">mystical works</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> also debated the status of these extra-canonical books; in the 2nd century, <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi_Akiva_ebcd.html" title="Rabbi Akiva">Rabbi Akiva</a> declared that those who read them would not share in the afterlife (Sanhedrin 10:1).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>, compiled by the second century, describes some of the debate over the status of some books of <i>Ketuvim</i>, and in particular whether or not they render the hands "impure". Yadaim 3:5 calls attention to the debate over <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_of_Songs_bf66.html" title="Song of Songs">Song of Songs</a> and Ecclesiastes. The Megillat Ta'anit, in a discussion of days when fasting is prohibited but that are not noted in the Bible, mentions the holiday of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purim.html" title="Purim">Purim</a>. Based on these, and a few similar references, <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Graetz_5469.html" title="Heinrich Graetz">Heinrich Graetz</a> concluded in 1871 that there had been a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Jamnia_95b9.html" title="Council of Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a> (or <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavne.html" title="Yavne">Yavne</a> in Hebrew) which had decided Jewish canon sometime in the late 1st century (<i>c.</i> 70–90). This became the prevailing scholarly consensus for much of the 20th century. However, from the 1960s onwards, based on the work of J.P. Lewis, S.Z. Leiman, and others, this view increasingly came into question. In particular, later scholars noted that none of the sources actually mentioned books that had been withdrawn from a canon, and questioned the whole premise that the discussions were about canonicity at all, asserting that they were actually dealing with other concerns entirely.</p>
<p>Today, there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish canon was set.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> article on the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm" rel="nofollow">Canon of the New Testament</a>:</p>

<dd>"The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Trent_988c.html" title="Council of Trent">Tridentine Council</a>."</dd>
</dl>
<p>By the end of the 1st century, some <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_epistles.html" title="Pauline epistles">letters of Paul</a> were collected and circulated, and were known to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_I_9a32.html" title="Pope Clement I">Clement of Rome</a> (<i>c.</i> 96), <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Antioch_9e29.html" title="Ignatius of Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a> (died 117), and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polycarp_of_Smyrna_8afb.html" title="Polycarp of Smyrna">Polycarp of Smyrna</a> (<i>c.</i> 115) but they weren't usually called <i>scripture/graphe</i> as the Septuagint was and they weren't without critics. In the late 4th century <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphanius_of_Salamis_c0a7.html" title="Epiphanius of Salamis">Epiphanius of Salamis</a> (died 402) <i>Panarion</i> 29 says the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarenes.html" title="Nazarenes">Nazarenes</a> had rejected the Pauline epistles and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenaeus.html" title="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a> <i>Against Heresies</i> 26.2 says the <a href="../../../e/b/i/Ebionites.html" title="Ebionites">Ebionites</a> rejected him. Acts 21:21 records a rumor that Paul aimed to subvert the Old Testament (see Romans 3:8, 31). 2 Peter 3:16 says his letters have been abused by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heretics.html" title="Heretics">heretics</a> who twist them around "as they do with the other scriptures."

<p><a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Metzger_5d6a.html" title="Bruce Metzger">Bruce Metzger</a> in his <i>Canon of the New Testament</i>, 1987, draws the following conclusion about Clement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clement's Bible is the Old Testament, to which he refers repeatedly as Scripture (graphe), quoting it with more or less exactness. Clement also makes occasional reference to certain words of Jesus; though they are authoritative for him, he does not appear to enquire how their authenticity is ensured. In two of the three instances that he speaks of remembering 'the words' of Christ or of the Lord Jesus, it seems that he has a written record in mind, but he does not call it a 'gospel'. He knows several of Paul's epistles, and values them highly for their content; the same can be said of the Epistle to the Hebrews, with which he is well acquainted. Although these writings obviously possess for Clement considerable significance, he never refers to them as authoritative 'Scripture'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcion_of_Sinope_2900.html" title="Marcion of Sinope">Marcion of Sinope</a>: <i>c.</i> <a href="../../../1/5/0/150s.html" title="150s">150</a>, was the first of record to propose a definitive, exclusive, unique canon of Christian scriptures. (Though <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.ntcanon.org/Ignatius.shtml" rel="nofollow">Ignatius</a> did address Christian scripture, before Marcion, against the heresies of the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaizers.html" title="Judaizers">Judaizers</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docetism.html" title="Docetism">Dociests</a>, he did not publish a canon.) Marcion rejected the theology of the Old Testament, which he claimed was incompatible with the teaching of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> regarding God and morality. The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, which Marcion called simply the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Marcion_7979.html" title="Gospel of Marcion">Gospel of the Lord</a>, he edited to remove any passages that connected Jesus with the Old Testament. This was because he believed that the god of the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, <a href="../../../y/h/w/YHWH_e7ed.html" title="YHWH">YHWH</a>, who gave them the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Jewish Scriptures</a>, was an entirely different god than the Supreme God who sent Jesus and inspired the New Testament. He used ten letters of Paul as well (excluding <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Hebrews_232f.html" title="Epistle to the Hebrews">Hebrews</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral_epistles.html" title="Pastoral epistles">Pastoral epistles</a>) assuming his <i>Epistle to the Laodiceans</i> referred to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical.html" title="Canonical">canonical</a> <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephesians.html" title="Ephesians">Ephesians</a> and not the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocryphal.html" title="Apocryphal">apocryphal</a> <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Laodiceans_5503.html" title="Epistle to the Laodiceans">Epistle to the Laodiceans</a> or another text no longer extant. He also edited these in a similar way. To these, which he called the <i>Gospel and the Apostolicon</i>, he added his <i>Antithesis</i> which contrasted the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> view of God and morality with the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> view of God and morality. By editing he thought he was removing <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaize.html" title="Judaize">judaizing</a> corruptions and recovering the original inspired words of Jesus and Paul. Marcion harshly edited the ten epistles by Paul as well as the Gospel of Luke. However, he defends Luke as the only "worthy" gospel, while putting aside Matthew, Mark, and John.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Marcion's canon and theology were rejected as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_heresy.html" title="Christian heresy">heretical</a> by the early church; however, he forced other Christians to consider which texts were canonical and why. He spread his beliefs widely; they became known as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcionism.html" title="Marcionism">Marcionism</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wace_f727.html" title="Henry Wace">Henry Wace</a> in his introduction <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/info/marcion-wace.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/info/marcion-wace.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> of 1911 stated: "A modern divine. . .could not refuse to discuss the question raised by Marcion, whether there is such opposition between different parts of what he regards as the word of God, that all cannot come from the same author." The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> of 1913 stated: "they were perhaps the most dangerous foe Christianity has ever known." <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_von_Harnack_67d4.html" title="Adolf von Harnack">Adolf von Harnack</a> in <i>Origin of the New Testament</i> <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, 1914, argued that Marcion viewed the church at this time as largely an Old Testament church (one that "follows the Testament of the Creator-God") without a firmly established New Testament canon, and that it gradually formulated its New Testament canon in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.</p>

<p>The Apocalypse of John, also called Revelation, is counted as both <b>accepted</b> (Kirsopp Lake translation: "Recognized") and <b>disputed</b>, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the Church Fathers, we know that it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: "Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Hebrews_232f.html" title="Epistle to the Hebrews">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>, saying that it is disputed by the Church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul."

<p>Bruce Metzger's <i>Canon of the New Testament</i> says in 1596 Jacob Lucius published a Bible at Hamburg which labeled Luther's four as "Apocrypha"; David Wolder the pastor of Hamburg's Church of St. Peter published in the same year a triglot Bible which labeled them as "non canonical"; J. Vogt published a Bible at Goslar in 1614 similar to Lucius'; Gustavus Adolphus of Stockholm in 1618 published a Bible with them labeled as "Apocr(yphal) New Testament."</p>
<p>Luther removed the deuterocanonical books from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> of his translation of the Bible, placing them in the "<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, that are books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read".<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> He also argued unsuccessfully for the relocation of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Esther_ae93.html" title="Book of Esther">Esther</a> from the Canon to the Apocrypha, since without the deuterocanonical sections, it never mentions God. As a result Catholics and Protestants continue to use different canons, which differ in respect to the Old Testament.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Caldwell_Ryrie_7a0f.html" title="Charles Caldwell Ryrie">Charles Caldwell Ryrie</a>'s <i>Basic Theology</i> counters in 1986 the claim that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> rejected the Book of James as being canonical. Here's what Luther wrote in his preface to the New Testament in which he ascribes to the several books of the New Testament different degrees of doctrinal value: "St. John's Gospel and his first Epistle, St. Paul's Epistles, especially those to the Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, and St. Peter's Epistle-these are the books which show to thee Christ, and teach everything that is necessary and blessed for thee to know, even if you were never to see or hear any other book of doctrine. Therefore, St. James' Epistle is a perfect straw-epistle compared with them, for it has in it nothing of an evangelic kind." Thus Luther was comparing (in his opinion) doctrinal value, not canonical validity.</p>
<p>However, Ryrie's theory is countered by other Biblical scholars, including <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Barclay_f50a.html" title="William Barclay">William Barclay</a>, who note that Luther stated plainly, if not bluntly: "I think highly of the epistle of James, and regard it as valuable although it was rejected in early days. It does not expound human doctrines, but lays much emphasis on God’s law. ... I do not hold it to be of apostolic authorship."<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> If Luther regarded the book of James as not being of "apostolic authorship" then he could not at all have regarded it as authoritative or worthy of canonization.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<dl>
<dd>The most important example of dogmatic influence in Luther’s version is the famous interpolation of the word <i>alone</i> in Rom. 3:28 (allein durch den Glauben), by which he intended to emphasize his <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_fide.html" title="Sola fide">solifidian doctrine of justification</a>, on the plea that the German idiom required the insertion for the sake of clearness. But he thereby brought Paul into direct verbal conflict with James, who says (James 2:24), "by works a man is justified, and not only by faith" ("nicht durch den Glauben allein"). It is well known that Luther deemed it impossible to harmonize the two apostles in this article, and characterized the Epistle of James as an "epistle of straw," because it had no evangelical character ("keine evangelische Art").</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is some evidence that the first decision to omit these books entirely from the Bible was made by Protestant laity rather than clergy. Bibles dating from shortly after the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> have been found whose tables of contents included the entire Roman Catholic canon, but which did not actually contain the disputed books, leading some historians to think that the workers at the printing presses took it upon themselves to omit them. However, Anglican and Lutheran Bibles usually still contained these books until the 20th century, while Calvinist Bibles did not. Several reasons are proposed for the omission of these books from the canon. One is the support for Catholic doctrines such as <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purgatory.html" title="Purgatory">Purgatory</a> and prayer for the dead found in <a href="../../../2/_/m/2_Maccabees_ed27.html" title="2 Maccabees">2 Maccabees</a>.

Because of its placement, the list was not considered binding for the Catholic church, and in light of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s demands, the Catholic Church examined the question of the Canon again at the Council of Trent, which reaffirmed the Canon of the Council of Florence.

<p>Many <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> Christian groups do not accept the theory that the Christian Bible was not known until various local and <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecumenical_Councils_f9d0.html" title="Ecumenical Councils">Ecumenical Councils</a>, which they deem to be "Roman-dominated" and made their official declarations.</p>
<p>These groups believe that the New Testament supports that Paul (2 Timothy 4:11-13), Peter (2 Peter 3:15-16), and ultimately John (Revelation 22:18-19) finalized the canon of the New Testament. Some note that Peter, John, and Paul wrote 20 (or 21) of the 27 books of the NT and personally knew all the other NT writers. (Books not attributed to these three are: Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, James, and Jude. The authorship of Hebrews has long been disputed.)</p>
<p>Evangelicals tend not to accept the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> as the inspired Hebrew Bible, though many of them recognize its wide use by Greek-speaking Jews in the first century. They note that early Christians knew the Hebrew Bible since around <a href="../../../1/7/0/170s.html" title="170s">170</a> <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melito_of_Sardis_e561.html" title="Melito of Sardis">Melito of Sardis</a> listed all the books of the Old Testament that those in the Evangelical faiths now use (except, according to the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, the Book of Esther, and with the addition of the Book of Wisdom). Melito's canon is found in <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> EH4.26.13-14 <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250104.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250104.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accordingly when I went East and came to the place where these things were preached and done, I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament, and send them to thee as written below. Their names are as follows: <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic_Law_c43a.html" title="Mosaic Law">Of Moses</a>, five books: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy; <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Joshua_3669.html" title="Book of Joshua">Jesus Nave</a>, Judges, Ruth; of Kings, four books; of Chronicles, two; the Psalms of David, the Proverbs of Solomon, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Wisdom_b44d.html" title="Book of Wisdom">Wisdom</a> also, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job; of Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah; of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_prophet.html" title="Minor prophet">twelve prophets</a>, one book&#160;; Daniel, Ezekiel, <a href="../../../e/s/d/Esdras.html" title="Esdras">Esdras</a>. From which also I have made the extracts, dividing them into six books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Melito's account still does not determine that the <i>specific</i> documentary tradition used by the Jews necessarily was that which was eventually assembled into the Masoretic text, several centuries later.</p>
<p>Many modern Protestants point to four "Criteria for Canonicity" to justify the books that have been included in the Old and New Testament, which are judged to have satisfied the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apostolic Origin — attributed to and based on the preaching/teaching of the first-generation apostles (or their close companions).</li>
<li>Universal Acceptance — acknowledged by all major Christian communities in the ancient world (by the end of the fourth century).</li>
<li>Liturgical Use — read publicly when early Christian communities gathered for the Lord's Supper (their weekly worship services).</li>
<li>Consistent Message — containing a theological outlook similar or complementary to other accepted Christian writings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic factor for recognizing a book's canonicity for the New Testament was divine inspiration, and the chief test for this was apostolicity. The term <i>apostolic</i> as used for the test of canonicity does not necessarily mean apostolic authorship or derivation, but rather <i>apostolic authority</i>. <i>Apostolic authority</i> is never detached from the authority of the Lord. See <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_succession.html" title="Apostolic succession">Apostolic succession</a>.</p>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to apply these criteria to all books in the accepted canon, however, and some point to books that Protestants hold as apocryphal which would fulfill these requirements. In practice, Protestants hold to the Jewish canon for the Old Testament and the Catholic canon for the New Testament.</p>

Consequently, Siegfried's opinion ("Philo," p. 61, Jena, 1875) that Philo's canon was essentially the same as that of to-day, is probably correct (H. E.

This interval of time was little short of three thousand years; but as to the time from the death of Moses till the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down what was done in their times in thirteen books.
