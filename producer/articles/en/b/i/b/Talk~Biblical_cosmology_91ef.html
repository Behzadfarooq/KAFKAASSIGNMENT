	    <p>In the somewhat astrological book of Esther we find she is actualy E'stur, or "The Star" in Chaldean. This expands to E'ster and A'ster. As Venus was always spoken of in the definitive, we have to conclude she parodied the actions attributed to that Star/Planet. Mordechai, her uncle, comes from Marduk/c for Mars, whilst Haman was Mercury. Whilst this 'war in heaven' due to a conjunction of heavely bodies took place, the 'as-above, so-below' syndrome took effect with king Xerxes taking the role of the inert Moon. As in Joshua, the Moon had been commanded to remain still in the sky until the deed had been completed. Vasti, the queen deposed by Esther, is exactly the same as the Sanskrit Svasti, meaning "The Sign," which is the emergence of Venus augering change. The 'hidden name' of Esther is Hadassa, which transliterates as "Myrtle": which happens to be the sacred plant of Meni/y, more commonly known as Venus. This is just one of many astrological references in the bible, both Old and New Testaments offering greater insight through 'understanding,' which is the "Light" (Ur) issuing from the "Lamp"(Ner)that was to erradicate the "Veil" (Lot) of Darkness (Ignorance) upon faces of the gentiles.

<p>I have suggested a merge from <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_astronomy.html" title="Biblical astronomy">Biblical astronomy</a>, which is at least in part a fork of this page, and contains redundant information. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 20:37, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Oppose</b>: There is enough non-redundant information at this point that I think they should not be merged. The article would be too large. Biblical cosmology seems to have headed in the direction of including modern science, like big-bang theory. I recommend cutting the redundant info. from Biblical astronomy and making it into an article about the technical aspects, e.g., what stars and planets are named.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think that Biblical cosmology is apologetics verging on POV where it talks about modern cosmology.

<p>What is the section on spiritual cosmology doing? This article was about the bible's take on astronomy. One editor came and change the <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, and beefed up a section on "spritual cosmology," a term that doesn't even get 1000 google a hits. Based on the comment "This is the core of Biblical cosmology, unlike the previous garbage." it seems like this editor is intent on changing the article completely. My proposal to solve this problem is to create a spinout article on Christian spiritual cosmology, and leave this article to discuss the bible's take on astronomy/cosmology. What do other editor's think? Is there a good reason to remove the previous content and turn this article into something new?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 14:50, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The section was already there, but anemic and without references. I simply added some references according to the article's pre-existing format. I wouldn't call that a complete change. As for the garbage, nobody ever believed that, and the lack of references proves it. It was just some critic's slanderous spin on isolated scriptures. I don't see the need for a spinoff. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodSamaritan_fe3c.html" title="User:GoodSamaritan">GoodSamaritan</a> 22:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I seriously don't see what that section has to do with this article. This article is about the biblical POV in regards to astronomy/cosmic origins. That section, in addition to being just a list of quotes, seems completely off topic. I seriously propose removing that section, and if someone wants to write an article on Christian spiritual cosmology, so be it.

<p>Ten Commandments? How is this <i>in any sense</i> related to Biblical cosmology? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 11:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, "the garbage" was what the authors of the Bible believed: the fact that hardly anyone still believes this nowadays is irrelevant. The basic model of a flat Earth covered by a solid sky-dome, with the stars as little lamps attached to it, was common throughout the region. We shouldn't try to fit modern astronomical knowledge into a book written by those who had no conception of it: that would be <a href="../../../e/i/s/Eisegesis.html" title="Eisegesis">Eisegesis</a>. I think a major revert is in order here: back to how this article looked in late September, before the "Spiritual Cosmology" stuff. It wasn't perfect then either, but we could work on that. I'd like to see some more stuff about the historical context, i.e. references to Sumerian/Babylonian cosmology. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 15:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree, for you to say that the Bible authors intended a literal interpretation of those passages would be for you to be doing original research. The job of interpreting auhtor's intent is not ours as editors.

<dd>How would it be "original research" if this is the opinion of scholars in cited articles, not just mine? Furthermore, it should be possible to present this material without commenting on whether the authors intended a "literal interpretation" (indeed, as the whole of Revelation is considered to be an allegorical interpretation of events in the Roman Empire at the time, its allusions to the old cosmological model probably <i>weren't</i> intended to be taken literally). Plenty of Christians consider the Genesis creation story to be "not literal" too (including Augustine), yet it can still be <i>presented</i>. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 08:58, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Opinion of the scholars is what we are supposed to present so we are doing well whenever we are accurately summarizing and citing that material. Your POV and mine are pointless (except for when our POVs drive us to find better citation). Your POV and mine about which sections of the Bible are written by God, are intended to be understoof litterally by God and are intended by God for us to use as allegory is completely irrelevant to the way wiki is set up. Unless we are a notable citable source by wiki standards for interpreting the Words of the Allmighty our opinions and POV are best left here in the discussion while we dig up sources and appropriate citations for the article.&#160;:) Peace. --Homecomputer∴Peace 16:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Side note, whenever you start interpreting, like writing your own commentary or giving your own explination even with a pov header, that kind of stuff is POV Original Research, even if it's unoriginal, even if I agree with it.

<dd>Don't forget that the Bible itself is a citable source.

<p>I must confess I'm a little hesitant to even bring this up as I know it will stir the emotions of some of the editors involved in the creation of this page.. but I would like to point out that in nearly every section of this article is some editorial POV pushing it one way or the other. The most obvious examples can be found in the tagged section where the editor lets the reader know his opinion of creationists and in the introduction where the editor lets us know that he feels biblical content is derived from the limitations of human authorship. Now regardless what your feelings on the subject are, definitions, perspectives on the subject and theories all need to be notable and citable opinions of the experts on the matter otherwise they simply don't belong on Wikipedia. Also, I'm not pushing for additional opinion to be added. Rather, I am asking for personal opinion to be removed and for proffessional opinion to be cited. Please help me in that goal if you agree with the wiki standards.&#160;:) Peace. --Homecomputer∴Peace 17:28, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see this. Can you be more specific? What part of the now-tagged paragraph is in dispute? And as for the introduction: as the Bible doesn't include a dedicated "cosmology" chapter, what's wrong with saying that it offers "glimpses" into the author's views on cosmology, <i>regardless</i> of who you consider "the author" to be? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 11:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't say anything was wrong about your POV except that i simply was that. There are other POV's that are commonly held though and we don't want to make wiki sound POV'done way or the other, thats all.
<dl>
<dd>I still don't see why my edit of that paragraph is a "point of view", if that's what you are referring to (my replacement of "Bible truths" with "compatibility with the Bible").

<p>When you discuss a topic such as the Bible or Biblical Astronomy on wiki the facts are supposed to be presented. Ideally the facts are things that people on all sides can agree with. When certain POV's are prevelant, those POV's need to be included with documentation. What I see being done throughout this article is one particular sides POV being presented as fact without citation. It's as if the whole article was written to proove a point. This is unencylcopedic and violates nPOV.</p>
<p>One small example: "Association for Biblical Astronomy" attempts to alter scientific thought to be compatible with the Bible with special focus on astronomy" The POV of the editor is obvious here. The nuetral facts aren't even included and the POV is one sided and uncited. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 13:12, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>...Uh, nope, I'm still not seeing it. This looks like "facts that all sides can agree with". Who would disgree with this, and why? It is entirely neutral to recognize that the scientific community holds views that aren't compatible with a literal interpretation of the Bible (POV issues come in when you try to say who's right and who's wrong), and entirely neutral to note that various Christian organizations want to <i>change</i> those views (and those organizations are cited with links to their own websites). What would be a more neutral way of saying this? The tag should be used to identify a problem that needs to be solved: what is the problem, and what is the solution? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 13:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh? This isn't about MY take on Biblical astronomy! We're discussing the disagreement between the "Association for Biblical Astronomy" and "scientific thought" (i.e. the prevailing view of scientists on this issue), and THEIR desire to change "scientific thought". From their own website: <i>This site is devoted to the historical relationship between the Bible and astronomy. It assumes that whenever the two are at variance, it is always astronomy—that is, our "reading" of the "Book of Nature," not our reading of the Holy Bible—that is wrong. History bears consistent witness to the truth of that stance</i>. So they want to change "scientific thought". This is factual. Where's the POV?</dd>
</dl>
<p>The POV is where you apply specific negative connotation such as "attempts to alter scientific thought to be compatible with the Bible" You assume they are attempting to alter science. That is your view point. It presupposes that they disagree with science and that they then seek to alter the outcome. You've not demonstrated either of those claims. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 09:51, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>our "reading" of the "Book of Nature," not our reading of the Holy Bible—that is wrong</i> That sentence is as clear as day - if science does not agree with the bible, they will take the bible.

<p>Also, their website declares itself to be the "official GEOCENTRICITY website". They believe that the Sun orbits the Earth. Scientists believe that the Earth orbits the Sun (this is common knowledge, no citation needed). So, yes, they disagree with science: this has been demonstrated. So I can remove the NPOV tag now, yes?

<p>I am honestly surprised that you've never heard of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_geocentrism.html" title="Modern geocentrism">Modern geocentrism</a> before. But you seem to be intent on applying a double standard here: among <i>scientists</i>, Young-Earth Creationism is considered to be about as ridiculous as geocentrism is among YEC's (or, probably, flat-Earthism among geocentrists). There's a hirearchy of beliefs:</p>
<p>Theistic Evolution - ID - OEC - YEC - Geocentrism - Flat-Earthism</p>
<p>Each is a more extreme position than the next, and a smaller group (vanishingly small, for the Flat-Earthers).

<p><b>Please take notice:</b>Hey guys.. I know there is alot of innate bias. However, the truth will always stand up to falsehood, so all we really need to do is remove biased wording; people who are intent to learn well check on sources, so you don't have to fret about it. Anyway, the reason I was saying all this is I found some wording that kinda tweaks things a bit: it says, "The Catholic Church and many other mainline Christian denominations accept modern scientific cosmology as compatible with allegorical interpretations of the Bible. The Conservative and Reform traditions within Judaism also accept modern cosmology as compatible with their reading of scripture." The words "also accept ... as compatible with their reading of scripture" follow the former sentence about the Catholic Church and mainline denominations, and make it seem like they take an allegorical view that agrees with modern cosmology; "Do you agree that modern cosmology is compatible," is a differnet question then, "Do you agree with modern cosmology?" Thus, I propose we change the wording to, "The Catholic Church and many other mainline Christian denominations see modern scientific cosmology as compatible with an allegorical interpretation of the Bible, while the Conservative and Reform traditions within Judaism actually accept modern cosmology as being compatible with their reading of scripture." Is that o.k? 1:51, 16 December 2006</p>

<dd>I really do not see the difference between "accept modern scientific cosmology as compatible with ... the Bible" and "accept modern cosmology as compatible with the... scripture" I think you read the sentence wrong, or else I am very confused. Because the way the article is currently is almost exactly verbatim identical. Anyway, do you have a source that says these Jewish views are different from the Catholic and mainline Christian views?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 07:02, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, I am sorry Andrew; I got long winded. What I was implying was that since both sentences use the word "accept", and the latter sentence uses the word "also", when you read them together it seems like everyone has agreed upon an allegorical interpritation of genesis, and thus, modern cosmology. As for your question, I am pretty sure I could find some gigantic fundamentalist group that still believes that the first part of genesis should be read literally. Though, as far as I know, mainline speaking, in the U.S., most people dismiss genesis. Lol. 12:40 17 December 2006</p>

<p>And wherever did you get the notion that Flat-Earthers were "evolutionists"? The article states that Samuel Birley Rowbotham's views were "based on his literal interpretation of certain biblical passages". And then there's <i>Voliva was a pioneer in religious radio broadcasting. Listeners to his 100,000-watt (0.1 MW) radio station were treated to thundering denunciations of the evils of evolution and round earth astronomy.</i> So this was a ''<i>creationist</i> movement. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 15:06, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm guessing you don't understand satire or parody. I have myself supported flat-Earthism in an online debate: it was fun! But to suggest that <i>serious proponets</i> of flat-Earthism are "evolutionists" is ludicrous. And where did you get the notion that the majority of <i>proponents</i> (rather than <i>posters</i>) self-identify as evolutionists anyhow?

<dd>The article itself declares that the number of flat-Earthers is "vanishingly small", so <i>nobody</i> is arguing that flat-Earthism is a "modern Christian stance" of any significance.

<dd>As 139 people responded to that poll (including 16 alleged flat-Earthers), but there are only 9 genuine flat-Earthers on the forum (according to the other thread), I suspect many people are just fooling around. I doubt that this supports <i>any</i> conclusion. But, contrary to your claim, I don't see anyone in that thread admitting to being a "flat-Earth evolutionist": those vacillating over creation/evolution are either round-Earthers or unspecified. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 12:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I do not understand the two tagged sections. Could it please be spelled out to me the exact issues at hand? If the only issue with the "Modern movements in Biblical cosmology" is the line about "flat-earth", then we only need a verification tag, not a neutrality tag for the whole section. If there are more issues, please explain exactly what the problem is. Same thing for the original research section.

<dd>I share your confusion! Especially as Home Computer has singled out the sentence <i>"Association for Biblical Astronomy" attempts to alter scientific thought to be compatible with the Bible with special focus on astronomy"</i>, but apparently wants us to <i>guess</i> what the POV problem is here. I'm stumped!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Home Computer, you still haven't explained what it is, other than your demand that we "demonstrate" the views of the "Association for Biblical Astronomy", which has been done (they are displayed rather prominently on the Association's website). You may <i>disagree</i> with their views, and maybe you're embarrassed by them: but that doesn't mean that mentioning them is "POV". Plenty of Christians are embarrassed by the existence of inerrantists and Young-Earth Creationists, but they don't seem to be in the habit of branding all mention of their existence as "POV". If that's <i>not</i> your objection, then you really should try to explain yourself better: as example of what YOU would consider to be "neutral" wording would certainly help matters. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 16:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Association for Biblical Astronomy" attempts to alter scientific thought to be compatible with the Bible with special focus on astronomy. "Young Earth Creationists (YEC)" attempts to alter scientific thought to be compatible with the Bible with special focus on creationism (spiritual cosmology). These quotes violate nPOV in that they claim these organizations attempt to alter science. nPOV would state that they attempt to demonstrate through science. Whether or not they alter science to demonstrate that is a long contentions POV'd debate. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 16:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there should be a place somewhere for the old Hebrew/Sumerian/Ugaritic cosmology which forms the backdrop of the Bible (i.e. flat-Earth, solid-sky, stars as little lights attached to the sky). Obviously, this isn't the view of modern creationists: it's ancient history. More extra-Biblical citations are needed, so that it <i>doesn't</i> just look like an anti-Bible polemic created by a skeptic using a "Bible errors" site. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 10:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We could rename this page to "Hebrew Cosmology" (with a redirect here from "Biblical Cosmology"), which would provide better justification for the inclusion of material from books no longer considered "canonical" (e.g. Enoch and Baruch) and an exploration of the historical (extra-Biblical) origins of this cosmological model. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 09:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just save and copy and paste and flip 180 degrees, and you will see the earth suspended in the waters of heaven. Also, it is amazing how God's dwelling is seen as a place where the storehouses are erected, as water must evaporate and piece together again in the clouds before it becomes snow or rain. 1:20 17 December 2006</dd>
