<p>In <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> tradition the <b><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a></b>, also known as the <b>Three Wise Men</b>, <b>The Three Kings</b>, or <b>Kings from the east</b>, are <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medes.html" title="Medes">Median</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian</a> priests, who were also proficient in <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> from <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Persia_4b91.html" title="Ancient Persia">Ancient Persia</a>. The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> states that they came "from the east to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>" to worship the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>, "born <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_Jews_3ff2.html" title="King of the Jews">King of the Jews</a>". According to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_the_Evangelist_83d8.html" title="Matthew the Evangelist">Matthew</a>, they navigated by following a star which came to be known as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_of_Bethlehem_690c.html" title="Star of Bethlehem">Star of Bethlehem</a>. As they approached Jerusalem, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html" title="Herod the Great">Herod</a> tried to trick them into revealing where Jesus was, so that he might be put to death. Upon finding <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the Magi gave him an unspecified number of gifts, amongst which were three highly symbolic ones: <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankincense.html" title="Frankincense">frankincense</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">myrrh</a>. Because these three gifts were recorded, most believe there were three givers; however, Matthew does not specify how many wise men came from the east.</p>
<p>The Magi were then warned in dreams that revealed Herod's deadly intentions for the child and decided to return home by a different route, in order to thwart them. This prompted Herod to resort to killing all the young children in Bethlehem, an act called the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_the_Innocents_aac6.html" title="Massacre of the Innocents">Massacre of the Innocents</a>, in an attempt to eliminate a rival heir to his throne. Jesus and his family had, however, <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_into_Egypt_8705.html" title="Flight into Egypt">escaped to Egypt</a> beforehand. After these events, the magi return home and passed into obscurity.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The story of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity_of_Jesus_6a11.html" title="Nativity of Jesus">nativity</a> in Matthew glorifies Jesus, likens him to Moses, and shows his life as fulfilling prophecy. Some <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholar.html" title="Scholar">scholars</a> consider this nativity story to be an invention of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christian_69b2.html" title="Early Christian">early Christians</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, but <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox.html" title="Orthodox">orthodox</a> Christians maintain its <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accuracy.html" title="Accuracy">accuracy</a>.</p>

<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a></i></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Luke</a>, the writer of Matthew pays no attention to the actual birth of Jesus, focusing instead on what occurred before and after. Skipping the actual birth, Matthew introduces the Magi, who have come to pay their respects, while accidentally informing Herod of Jesus' existence. The word <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a></i> is a Latinization of the plural of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word <i>magos</i> (<i>μαγος</i> pl. <i>μαγοι</i>), which is a derivative from <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Persian_language_d1b7.html" title="Old Persian language">Old Persian</a> <i>Magupati</i>. The term is a specific occupational title referring to the priestly <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> of a branch of <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> known as <a href="../../../z/u/r/Zurvanism.html" title="Zurvanism">Zurvanism</a>. As part of their religion, these priests paid particular attention to the stars, and gained an international reputation for <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>.</p>
<p>At that time astrology was a highly regarded science, only later giving rise to aspects of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, as well as the modern practice of fortune-telling going by the same name. A indication of their astrological credentials is in the phrase translated in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_of_the_Bible_1536.html" title="King James Version of the Bible">King James Version of the Bible</a> as <i>inquired of them diligently</i>, which is actually a Greek technical word referring directly to astrological sciences of the time. The Biblical Greek passages states:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>legonteV pou estin o tecqeiV basileuV twn ioudaiwn eidomen gar autou ton astera en th anatolh kai hlqomen proskunhsai autw</p>
<p style="line-height:1em;text-align:left;padding-left:2em;"><small>—<cite style="font-style:normal;">Matthew Chapter 2 verse 7<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></cite></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The orginal Greek, translated vaguely into English, connotes a more scientific investigation. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Their religious practices and use of astrological sciences caused derivatives of the term <i>Magi</i> to be applied to the <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occult.html" title="Occult">occult</a> in general and led to the English term <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">magic</a></i>.</p>
<p>The KJV translation as <i>wise men</i> may be somewhat politically motivated: the same word is translated as <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magician_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magician (paranormal)">sorcerer</a></i> to condemn "<a href="../../../e/l/y/Elymas.html" title="Elymas">Elymas</a> the sorcerer" in <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts</a></i> 13, and is left untranslated to describe <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Magus_54f7.html" title="Simon Magus">Simon Magus</a> in Acts 8. Treating Simon Magus as being as wise as the Magi that visited Jesus could be viewed as heresy — Simon Magus was considered by many Christians as the founder of <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a>, a Christian group condemned as arch-heresy. It is unlikely that the New Testament would deliberately refer to Simon Magus in glowing terms; the name of the canonical crime of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simony.html" title="Simony">simony</a> derives from the name of Simon Magus.</p>
<p>The phrase <i>from the east</i> is the only information Matthew provides on where the Magi came from, apart from identifying that they come from <i>their own country</i> rather than Judea. Traditionally the view developed that the Magi were <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persian</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthia.html" title="Parthia">Parthian</a>, a view held for example by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, and Byzantine art generally depicted them in Persian dress. The main support for this is that the first Magi were from Persia and that land still had the largest number of them. Some believe they were from <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>, which was the centre of Zurvanism, and hence astrology, at the time. Brown comments that the author of Matthew probably didn't have a specific location in mind and the phrase <i>from the east</i> is for literary effect and added exoticism. Though the Bible does not number the Magi, traditionally there were always seen to be three, as three of the gifts were specifically named.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Magi_0a2e.html" title="Edit section: Names">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Names</span></h3>
<p>In the Eastern church a variety of different names are given for the three, but in the West the names have been settled since the <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_century.html" title="8th century">8th century</a> as <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casper_%28name%29.html" title="Casper (name)">Caspar</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchior.html" title="Melchior">Melchior</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balthasar.html" title="Balthasar">Balthasar</a>. The names of the Magi derive from an early <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a> Greek manuscript in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, translated into the Latin <i>Excerpta Latina Barbari.</i><sup id="_ref-Kehrer_1908_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kehrer_1908" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Latin text <i>Collectanea et Flores</i> continues the tradition of three kings and their names and gives additional details of their clothes, coming from Syria. This text is said to be from the 8th century, of Irish origin.

<p>None of these names is obviously Persian or is generally agreed to carry any ascertainable meaning, although Caspar is also sometimes given as Gaspar, a variant of the Persian <i>Jasper</i> — "Master of the Treasure" — from which the name of the mineral <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper.html" title="Jasper">jasper</a> is derived. There is a claim that his real name was <i>Rustaham-Gondofarr Suren-Pahlav</i> of the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suren-Pahlav_Clan_c9c7.html" title="Suren-Pahlav Clan">Suren-Pahlav Clan</a>, the ruler of the eastern-greater <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, who ruled from <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_BC_21e5.html" title="10 BC">10 BC</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/_/17.html" title="17">AD 17</a> the vast empire of the <a href="../../../s/a/k/Saka.html" title="Saka">Saka</a> at the time of the <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsacid_dynasty.html" title="Arsacid dynasty">Arsacid dynasty</a>. Another candidate for the origin of the name Caspar appears in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Thomas_8646.html" title="Acts of Thomas">Acts of Thomas</a> as <i><a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondophares.html" title="Gondophares">Gondophares</a></i> (<a href="../../../2/1/_/21.html" title="21">AD 21</a> – c.<a href="../../../4/7/_/47.html" title="47">AD 47</a>), i.e., Gudapharasa (from which 'Caspar' derives via the contrived corruption 'Gaspar'). This Gondophares was also a Suren, and declared independence from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthia.html" title="Parthia">Parthia</a> to become the first <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Parthian_b11b.html" title="Indo-Parthian">Indo-Parthian</a> king; he is thus likely to be a descendant of the Rustaham-Gondofarr, who was allegedly visited by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Apostle_eb90.html" title="Thomas the Apostle">Thomas the Apostle</a>. Christian legend may have chosen Gondofarr simply because he was an eastern king living in the right time period.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> Christians name the Magi <i><a href="../../../a/v/e/Avesta.html#Vendidad" title="Avesta">Larvandad</a></i>, <i>Gushnasaph</i>, and <i><a href="../../../a/h/u/Ahura_Mazda_99b8.html" title="Ahura Mazda">Hormisdas</a></i>. These names have a far greater likelihood of being originally Persian, though that does not, of course, guarantee their authenticity. The first name <i>Larvandad</i> is a combination of <i><a href="../../../l/a/r/Lar%2C_Iran_a22f.html" title="Lar, Iran">Lar</a></i>, which is a region near <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a>, and <i>vand</i> or <i>vandad</i> which is a common suffix in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Persian_b871.html" title="Middle Persian">Middle Persian</a> meaning "related to" or "located in". <i>Vand</i> is also present in the names of such <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iranian</a> locations as <i>Damavand</i>, <i>Nahavand</i>, <i>Alvand</i>, and such names and titles as <i>Varjavand</i> and <i><a href="../../../a/v/e/Avesta.html#Vendidad" title="Avesta">Vandidad</a></i>. Alternatively, it might be a combination of <i>Larvand</i> meaning "the region of Lar" and <i>Dad</i> meaning "given by". The latter suffix can also be seen in such Iranian names as "Tirdad", "Mehrdad", "Bamdad" or such previously Iranian locations as "Bagdad" ("God Given") presently called <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Thus the name simply means "born in", or "given by", <i>Lar</i>. The second name, <i>Hormisdas</i>, is a variation of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a> name <i>Hormoz</i> which was <i>Hormazd</i> and <i>Hormazda</i> in Middle Persian. The name referred to the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel.html" title="Angel">angel</a> of the first day of each month whose name had been given by the supreme God (of <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>) who, in <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Persian_243e.html" title="Old Persian">Old Persian</a>, was called "<a href="../../../a/h/u/Ahuramazda.html" title="Ahuramazda">Ahuramazda</a>" or "Ormazd". The third name, <i>Gushnasaph</i>, was a common name used in Old and Middle Persian. In Modern Persian, it is <i>Gushnasp</i> or <i>Gushtasp</i>. The name is a combination of <i>Gushn</i> meaning "full of manly qualities" or "full of desire or energy" for something and <i>Asp</i>, Modern Persian <i>Asb</i>, which means <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a>. Horses were of great importance for the Iranians and many Iranian names, including the presently used <i>Lohrasp</i>, <i>Jamasp</i>, <i>Garshasp</i>, and <i>Gushtasp</i>, contain the suffix. As a result, the second name might mean something like "as energetic and virile as a horse" or "full of desire for having horses". Alternatively, <i>Gushn</i> is also recorded to have meant "many". Thus the name might simply mean "the Owner of Many Horses".</p>

<p>Upon meeting Jesus, the Magi are described as handing over gifts and "falling down" in joyous praise. The use of the term "falling down" more properly means lying prostrate on the ground, which, together with the use of <a href="../../../k/n/e/Kneeling.html" title="Kneeling">kneeling</a> in Luke's birth narrative, had an important effect on Christian religious practice. Previously both Jewish and Roman tradition had viewed kneeling and prostration as undignified, reserved in Jewish tradition for <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany.html" title="Epiphany">epiphanies</a>; although for Persians it was a sign of great respect, often showed to the king. But inspired by these verses, kneeling and prostration were adopted in the early Church; while prostration is generally no longer featured, kneeling has remained an important element of Christian worship to this day.</p>
<p>Three of the gifts are explicitly identified in Matthew — <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankincense.html" title="Frankincense">frankincense</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh.html" title="Myrrh">myrrh</a> — and have become one of the best known items from Matthew; it is often assumed that these three are the only gifts the Magi are described as giving. (It has been suggested by scholars that the "gifts" were in fact <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicinal.html" title="Medicinal">medicinal</a> rather than precious material for <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribute.html" title="Tribute">tribute</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup>) They are often linked to chapter 60 of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Book of Isaiah</a> and to <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm.html" title="Psalm">Psalm</a> 72. Both of these reports gifts being given by kings, and this has played a central role in the inaccurate perception of the Magi as kings, rather than as astronomer-priests. In a hymn of the late 4th-century <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">hispanic</a> poet <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prudentius.html" title="Prudentius">Prudentius</a>, the three gifts have already gained their medieval interpretation as prophetic <a href="../../../e/m/b/Emblem.html" title="Emblem">emblems</a> of Jesus' identity, familiar in the carol "<a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Three_Kings_6f3d.html" title="We Three Kings">We Three Kings</a>" by John Henry Hopkins, Jr., 1857.</p>
<p>Many different theories of the meaning and symbolism of the gifts have been advanced, since while gold is fairly obviously explained, frankincense, and particularly myrrh, are much more obscure. They generally break down into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>That they are all ordinary gifts for a king — myrrh being commonly used as an anointing oil, frankincense as a perfume, and gold as a valuable.</li>
<li>That they are prophetic — gold as a symbol of kingship on earth, frankincense (an <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incense.html" title="Incense">incense</a>) as a symbol of priestship, and myrrh (an embalming oil) as a symbol of death. Sometimes this is described more weakly as gold symbolizing virtue, frankincense symbolizing <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayer</a>, and myrrh symbolizing suffering.</li>

<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> suggested that the gifts were fit to be given not just to a king but to God, and contrasted them with the Jews' traditional offerings of sheep and calves, and accordingly Chrysostom asserts that the Magi worshiped Jesus as God. This is, however, unlikely, since they were members of a <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrian.html" title="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a> priesthood. C.S. Mann has advanced the theory that the items were not actually brought as gifts, but were rather the tools of the Magi, who typically would be astrologer-priests. Mann thus sees the giving of these items to Jesus as showing that the Magi were abandoning their practices by relinquishing the necessary tools of their trade, though Brown disagrees with this theory since the portrayal of the Magi had been wholly positive up to this point, with no hint of condemnation. An alternative reading on the same lines is that the Magi gave the tools of their craft to Jesus to acknowledge him as one of them; Magi were near universally regarded at the time as being particularly wise, partly owing to their dedication to astrology, and the perception that Zoroastrians were always honest, owing to their religion: hence, by adding Magi endorsing Jesus as their equal, the author of Matthew was seeking to raise Jesus' own standing.</p>
<p>The gifts themselves have also been criticized as mostly useless to a poor carpenter as his family, and this is often the target of comic satire in television and other comedy. Clarke states that the deist <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Woolston_abda.html" title="Thomas Woolston">Thomas Woolston</a> once quipped that <i>if they had brought sugar, soap, and candles they would have acted like wise men</i>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup> What subsequently happened to these gifts is never mentioned in the scripture, but several traditions have developed.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[14]</a></sup> One story has the gold being stolen by the two thieves who were later crucified alongside Jesus. Another tale has it being entrusted to and then misappropriated by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Iscariot_cdd5.html" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas</a>. Another story is that the family quickly pawned or sold them and later used the money to finance their flight to Egypt; it seems probable that it would be the only way to pay for such a voyage.</p>
<p>In the Monastery of St. Paul of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Athos_214d.html" title="Mount Athos">Mount Athos</a> there is a <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a> golden case containing purportedly the Gift of the Magi. It was donated to the monastery in the 15th century by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maro.html" title="Maro">Maro</a>, daughter of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Serbia_38ff.html" title="King of Serbia">King of Serbia</a> George Vragovitch, wife to the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultan.html" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murat_II_c32d.html" title="Murat II">Murat II</a> and godmother to <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmet_II_bc79.html" title="Mehmet II">Mehmet II</a> the Conqueror (of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>). Apparently they were part of the relics of the Holy Palace of Constantinople and it is claimed they were displayed there since the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century_AD_de1d.html" title="4th century AD">4th century AD</a>. After the Athens earthquake of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> they were temporarily displayed in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> in order to strengthen faith and raise money for earthquake victims.</p>
<p>At this point the Magi leave the narrative by <i>returning another way</i> so as to avoid Herod, and do not reappear. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_the_Great_c26a.html" title="Gregory the Great">Gregory the Great</a> waxed lyrical on this theme, commenting that <i>having come to know Jesus we are forbidden to return by the way we came</i>.

<p>When the Magi first enquire about Jesus, Matthew says that they are overheard by "Herod the King", which is accepted as referring to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html" title="Herod the Great">Herod the Great</a> who died in <a href="../../../4/_/b/4_BC_45c3.html" title="4 BC">4 BC</a>. This is seemingly in contradiction with Luke's mention of a census and of <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quirinius.html" title="Quirinius">Quirinius</a> being governor of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, which both apply to some time after <a href="../../../6/_/_/6.html" title="6">AD 6</a>. The Magi claim to wish to <i>pay homage</i> (<i>proskunesai</i> in the Greek) to a <i><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_Jews_3ff2.html" title="King of the Jews">King of the Jews</a></i>. While <i>proskunesai</i> can mean honouring either a king or a God, <i>King of the Jews</i> is a clear and direct challenge to Herod's authority. Herod was renowned for his paranoia, killing several of his own sons who threatened him. As an <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edomite.html" title="Edomite">Edomite</a>, Herod would be especially threatened by a Davidic heir, who would automatically be more in favour with Jewish fundamentalists of the time, who had a particularly xenophobic attitude.</p>
<p>The "Herod" referred to may instead have been Herod the Great's son <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_Archelaus_4182.html" title="Herod Archelaus">Herod Archelaus</a>, also renowed for cruelty, whose visit to Rome may be the event referred to in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable_of_the_Talents_3d7a.html" title="Parable of the Talents">Parable of the Talents</a>.</p>
<p>Why all <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> should be troubled by an opponent to Herod is a more important question. Throughout this chapter Matthew shows the leaders of Jerusalem allied with Herod against Jesus, and so these passages have often been quoted in support of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_anti-Semitism_7b9b.html" title="Christian anti-Semitism">Christian anti-Semitism</a>. That all Jerusalem is agitated also seems to conflict with later passages in the same Gospel, where the people are quite oblivious to Jesus' existence. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_H._Gundry_3a65.html" title="Robert H. Gundry">Gundry</a> sees this passage as influenced by the politics of the time it was written, as a foreshadowing of the rejection of Jesus and his church by the leaders of Jerusalem. Brown notes that another option, supported even in ancient times by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, is that Matthew is trying to portray Jesus as a new <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>; in Exodus all Egypt is troubled by Moses, not just the Pharaoh. Levin believes in a third option which sees Matthew as presenting a class war throughout his Gospel, with Jesus on the side of the poor and nomadic, against powerful city dwellers.</p>
<p>Most scholars take the reference to <i>all the chief priests and scribes</i> as referring to the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, however, there is a difficulty in taking this literally as there was only one chief priest at the time, so <i>all the chief priests</i> can only literally refer to a single individual. Taking it less literally, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Brown_78be.html" title="Raymond E. Brown">Brown</a> notes that this phrase occurs in other contemporary documents, and refers to the leading priests and former chief priests, not only the current head of the priesthood. A more important difficulty with this passage is its historical implausibility, since records from the period show that Herod and the Sanhedrin were sharply divided, and their relations acrimonious. At the time the priests were largely <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadducees.html" title="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> while the scribes were mostly <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, thus both groups being present might be a deliberate attempt to tar both leading Jewish factions as being involved with Herod. Schweizer states that Herod consulting with the Sanhedrin is <i>historically almost inconceivable</i>, and he views their presence in the passage merely as a literary device to have someone able to subsequently quote an <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> prophecy.</p>
<p>After having consulted with these religious individuals, Herod is described as secretly meeting with the Magi, who subsequently sent the Magi to Bethlehem to discover where Jesus was so that he could worship him. Many scholars, such as Brown and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schweizer.html" title="Schweizer">Schweizer</a>, find it improbable for this passage to be factual; Bethlehem is only five miles from Jerusalem and it is thus odd that Herod would need to use foreign priests that he had only just met for such an important task, trusting them implicitly despite his usual paranoia, even though he could easily give the task to his soldiers or others he trusted more. <a href="../../../r/t/_/RT_France_b303.html" title="RT France">RT France</a> defends the historicity of this story, theorising that soldiers might alarm the villagers, making it difficult to find the infant, though searching a village only five miles away, even with deeply distrusting villagers, is not so difficult a task when you have an entire army at your disposal. France has also proposed that Herod chose the magi to carry the task out since they were more likely to be gullible, as foreigners, or at least have less qualms than Jewish soldiers would about killing someone supposedly fitting a Jewish prophecy.</p>

<p>This narrative of the visit of the Magi is the first point in Matthew that <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem.html" title="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a>, the place of Jesus' birth, is mentioned. That it is specified as being <i>in <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a></i> is ascribed by Albright and Mann to emphasise that it isn't the northern town also named Bethlehem (probably the modern town of Beit Lahna), though other scholars feel the main purpose of this mention is to assert that Jesus was born in the heart of Judaism and not in the unrespected backwater that was <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a>. According to the chronology in Luke, the family left Bethlehem soon after arriving, when Jesus was forty days old, but according to Matthew, the Magi visited Jesus in Bethlehem when he was at a <i><a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a></i>. This raises the question of how the family has its own home in the town when the Magi visit, having only been able to have a stable when Jesus was born. However, Matthew does not say the house belonged to Joseph and Mary.</p>
<p>Most modern scholars believe that the author of Matthew is fairly clear in this chapter that the family had lived for some time in the town, and was likely originally from Bethlehem, thus it is logical for them to have a house. This reading does contradict Luke's story of the emergency trip to the town, however, a view which those who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible naturally do not feel able to support. These inerrantists instead believe that either that the couple found a house very quickly, i.e. in less than forty days, while Mary had only just given birth, or that, contrary to the views of almost all scholars of linguistics, <i>house</i> should be translated instead as <i>village</i>. Those not willing to accept that one of the two Gospels is outright wrong, but still willing to accept that Matthew and Luke cannot be exactly synchronised, generally feel that the Magi visited several months after the birth of Jesus, and Luke has got wrong the length of time that the family stayed in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the Magi visited about two years after the birth of Jesus, explaining why Herod, thwarted in his plans, later ordered the death of children aged two years and younger. For many, especially believers in inerrancy, this settles the seeming contradiction.</p>

<p>The Magi are described as having followed a star to Bethlehem, which thus traditionally became known as the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_of_Bethlehem_690c.html" title="Star of Bethlehem">Star of Bethlehem</a>. Since at least <a href="../../../k/e/p/Kepler.html" title="Kepler">Kepler</a>'s time there have been many attempts to link it to an astronomical event, with the most commonly cited being a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in <a href="../../../7/_/b/7_BC_8da4.html" title="7 BC">7 BC</a>, fitting in with Matthew's chronology pointing to Jesus being born before <a href="../../../4/_/b/4_BC_45c3.html" title="4 BC">4 BC</a>, and unlike Luke's which points to <a href="../../../6/_/_/6.html" title="6">AD 6</a>. Although traditionally the Magi, coming from the east (<i>apo anatolón, απο ανατολων</i>), are described as having seen a star <i>in the east (en te anatole, εν τη ανατολη)</i>, the Greek word in question is <i>anatole</i>, which many scholars feel more accurately translates as a star <i>rising in the morning</i>, meaning a <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heliacal_rising.html" title="Heliacal rising">heliacal rising</a><sup id="_ref-Occhieppo_1997_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occhieppo_1997" title="">[15]</a></sup>. The star was just above the horizon but hidden by the brightness of the sun. According to Austrian Professor Konradin Ferrari d'Occhieppo — in many books between 1965<sup id="_ref-Occhieppo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occhieppo" title="">[16]</a></sup> and 2003 —, it was not only a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_conjunction.html" title="Triple conjunction">triple conjunction</a> of Jupiter and Saturn in <a href="../../../7/_/b/7_BC_8da4.html" title="7 BC">7 BC</a>. The astronomer had interpreted the words "stood over" as a term that refer the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retrogradation.html" title="Retrogradation">retrogradation</a> and stationing of the royal star Jupiter or Saturn in the <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisces_%28constellation%29.html" title="Pisces (constellation)">sign of Pisces</a> (=land in the west) in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">12 November</a> <a href="../../../7/_/b/7_BC_8da4.html" title="7 BC">7 BC</a> since 854 (!) years.<sup id="_ref-GV_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GV" title="">[17]</a></sup> In the astronomer’s opinion this rare event was certainly important for everyone. The term "<i>stood over</i>" is taken as detail — faithful eyewitness report by the magi, refers to the star already standing and not moving — an astronomical technical term . The term "<i>very large joy</i>" refers without doubt to the end of the journey: the Magi, described as having followed a star to Bethlehem, finding the place of birth and the king wanted for a long time.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> rejected the idea that the Star of Bethlehem was a normal star or similar heavenly body, because such a star could not have specified the exact cave and manger where Jesus was found, being too high in the sky to be that specific. Also, he notes that stars in the sky move from east to west, but that the Magi would have travelled from north to south to arrive in Palestine from Persia. Instead, Chrysostom suggested that the star was a more miraculous occurrence, comparable to the pillar of cloud mentioned in Exodus as leading the Israelites out of Egypt. In the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine.html" title="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> tradition, influenced by Chrysostom's writing and by palace etiquette, the star was interpreted as a palace official that led the foreign dignitaries to the king, and as such is depicted in <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_art.html" title="Byzantine art">Byzantine art</a>.</p>
<p>In Matthew 2:9 it states that the star <i>came and stood over</i> where Jesus was, seemingly stating that the star pointed out the specific house or village that Jesus was in. Quite how it did this is unspecified in the text, and artists have portrayed a wide array of means. Hill comments that the star <i>standing over</i> a fixed location is an undeniably miraculous action which defies all attempts to rationalize the star as a natural <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova.html" title="Nova">nova</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjunction.html" title="Conjunction">conjunction</a>. However, it is perfectly possible for a previously moving star or conjunction to appear to halt its location in the sky — the sun freezes in its annual north-south motion for three days twice a year, at the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solstice.html" title="Solstice">winter</a> and summer solstice (coincidentally due to <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession_of_the_equinoxes.html" title="Precession of the equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">25 December</a> was the winter solstice at the time).</p>
<p>Astronomer Michael R. Molnar and others have taken the view that Matthew's statements that the star "went before" and "stood over" are terms that refer respectively to the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retrogradation.html" title="Retrogradation">retrogradation</a> and stationing of the royal "<a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandering_star.html" title="Wandering star">wandering star</a>" <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter.html" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. If Molnar's research is correct, this would require the birth to have taken place on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">17 April</a> <a href="../../../6/_/b/6_BC_dcc5.html" title="6 BC">6 BC</a>, and the <i>standing over</i> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a>, and the Magi would have had to arrive at some point thereafter.</p>
<p>At the time the notion of new stars as beacons of major events were common, being reported for such figures as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithridates.html" title="Mithridates">Mithridates</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>. <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny</a> even takes time to rebut a theory that every person has a star that rises when they are born and fades when they die, evidence that this was believed by some. According to <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Brown_78be.html" title="Raymond E. Brown">Brown</a>, to many at the time it would have been unthinkable that a Messiah could have been born without some stellar portents beforehand.</p>
<p>According to John Mosley, the program supervisor for Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, the key question is whether the account refers to "stars" or to "planets", though the distinction is not likely to have been meaningful to astrologers like the Magi at that time. If it was a planet then there are a number of celestial events that would have attracted the interest and fascination of anyone, like the Magi, who followed the stars. Mosley argued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical records and modern-day computer simulations indicate that there was a rare series of planetary groupings, also known as conjunctions, during the years 3 BC and 2 BC.</li>
<li>On the morning of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a> in 3 BC Venus could be sighted very close to Saturn in the eastern sky.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">August 12</a> in 3 BC there was a spectacular pairing of Venus and Jupiter in the constellation of Leo, which ancient astrologers associated with the destiny of the Jews.</li>
<li>Between September in 3 BC and June in 2 BC, Jupiter's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prograde_and_retrograde_motion.html" title="Prograde and retrograde motion">retrograde</a> motion caused it to appear to deviate from its path and loop around Regulus, a star in Leo. Astrologers considered Jupiter the kingly planet and regarded Regulus as the <i>king star</i>. This ties in with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology_of_Jesus_5961.html#October" title="Chronology of Jesus">evidence of an October birthdate</a> for Jesus.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a> in 2 BC, Jupiter could be sighted so close to Venus that with a naked eye they appeared to have merged.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_28.html" title="December 28">December 28</a> in 3 BC, all the planets formed the shape of the Star of David.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mosley's claims have been disputed by several astronomers as contrived, and inaccurate: for example, his claim that a cross shaped arrangement of the planets was the star fails to appreciate that the cross became a Christian symbol only in the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a>. David Turner, professor of astronomy at St Mary's University, has argued extensively against Mosley's conclusions, and has stated that some of the claims are extremely <i>tenuous</i>. The <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_the_Great_8163.html#Date_of_Herod.27s_death" title="Herod the Great">date of Herod's death</a> is generally accepted to be <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html#Accuracy" title="Anno Domini">5–4 BC</a>, which would be before these astronomical events of 3–2 BC, but may have happened in [1 BC]. In other words, Jesus was born, the Magi visited Herod, and went to Jesus, Herod caused Jesus to flee, and only then did the stars begin an astronomical event that had highly symbolic significance; suggesting that if that was indeed an event indicating the Messiah's birth, then the Messiah was an unknown individual born 1–2 years after Jesus.</p>
<p>Some Christians have had difficulty with reference to the star, since elsewhere in the Bible astrology is condemned, a view shared by most fundamentalist Christians. Consequently, R.T. France has argued that the passage is not an endorsement of astrology, but rather an illustration of how God takes care in <i>meeting individuals where they are</i>. Other Christians interpret the star as a fulfilment of the "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Prophecy_81e6.html" title="Star Prophecy">Star Prophecy</a>" in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Numbers_dd63.html" title="Book of Numbers">Book of Numbers</a>, 24:17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Magi_0a2e.html" title="Edit section: The Bethlehem prophecy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Bethlehem prophecy</span></h3>
<p>The text describes the Magi explaining to Herod about the purpose of their visit by use of a quote from <i>the prophet</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times. ― Micah 5:1-3 (according to the Masoretic text)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quotation given in Matthew differs substantially from both the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic_text.html" title="Masoretic text">Masoretic texts</a> of the same passage. The Septuagint and Masoretic refer to Bethlehem as <i>Bethlehem <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephratah.html" title="Ephratah">Ephratah</a></i>, which Matthew alters to <i>Bethlehem, land of Judah</i>, apparently to further emphasise that Jesus was born in Judea not <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilee.html" title="Galilee">Galilee</a>, where he spent much of his ministry, an area that was viewed by most religious Jews as being <i>unclean</i> and lower than the <i>half-cast</i> people in the intermediate region. An even more important change is the almost total inversion of the meaning — Micah has <i>you <b>are</b> little among the thousands of Judah</i> whereas Matthew's <i>quote</i> of it has <i>you <b>are not</b> least among the princes of Judah</i>.</p>
<p>Matthew also replaces the word <i>ruler</i> with <i>shepherd</i>, apparently to present the argument that a Messiah would be a religious figure rather than a political one. The portion of Micah where this quote is found is clearly discussing a Messiah and states that like King <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a>, the Messiah would originate from Bethlehem. At the time it was not widely accepted that the Messiah would necessarily be born in Bethlehem, just that his ancestors would have been, and thus it was not considered essential for a Messiah to be someone born in that town, although it was considered a reasonable area for one to happen to originate from: certainly far more reasonable than the peripheral area of Galilee where Jesus grew up.</p>

<p>According to most forms of Christianity, the Magi were the first religious figures to worship Christ, and for this reason the story of the Magi is particularly respected and popular among many Christians. The visit of the Magi is commemorated by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholics</a> and other <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> churches (but not the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>) on the observance of <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feast%29.html" title="Epiphany (feast)">Epiphany</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>. The Eastern Orthodox celebrate it on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a> along with Christmas. This visit is frequently treated in Christian art and literature as <i>The Adoration of the Magi</i>.</p>
<p>Upon this kernel of information Christians embroidered many circumstantial details about the Magi. One of the most important changes was their rising from <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrologers.html" title="Astrologers">astrologers</a> to kings. The general view is that this is linked to Old Testament prophesies that have the Messiah being worshipped by kings in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 60:3, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Psalms_adda.html" title="Book of Psalms">Psalm</a> 72:10, and Psalm 68:29. Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the Magi to kings. Mark Allan Powell rejects this view. He argues that the idea of the Magi as kings arose considerably later in the time after <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_%28emperor%29_5860.html" title="Constantine I (emperor)">Constantine</a> and the change was made to endorse the role of Christian monarchs. By <a href="../../../5/0/0/500.html" title="500">AD 500</a> all commentators adopted the prevalent tradition of the three were kings, and this continued until the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>.</p>
<p>Though the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> omits Matthew's episode of the Magi, it was well known in Arabia. The Muslim encyclopaedist <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Tabari_d18d.html" title="Al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a>, writing in the <a href="../../../9/t/h/9th_century.html" title="9th century">9th century</a>, gives the familiar symbolism of the gifts of the Magi. Al-Tabari gave his source for the information to be the later 7th century writer Wahb ibn Munabbih.<sup id="_ref-Munabbih_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munabbih" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>This positive interpretation of the Magi is not unopposed. The <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a><sup id="_ref-Watchtower_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Watchtower" title="">[19]</a></sup> do not see the arrival of the Magi as something to be celebrated, but instead stress the Biblical condemnation of sorcery and astrology in such texts as <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuteronomy.html" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> 18:10–11, <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 19:26, and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Isaiah_06a3.html" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 47:13–14. They also point to the fact that the star seen by the Magi led them first to a hostile enemy of Jesus, Herod, and only then to the child's location — the argument being that if this was an event from God, it makes no sense for them to be led to a ruler with intentions to kill the child before taking them to Jesus.</p>

<ul>
<li>Holidays celebrating the arrival of the magi traditionally recognise a sharp distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus' birth. Matthew's introduction of the Magi gives the reader no reason to believe that they were present on the night of the birth, instead stating that they arrived at some point <i>after</i> Jesus had been born, and the Magi are described as leading Herod to assume that Jesus is up to 1 year old.</li>

In these <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>-speaking areas, the three kings (<i>Sp. "los Reyes Magos de Oriente"</i>, also "Los Tres Reyes Magos") receive wish letters from children and magically bring them gifts on the night before Epiphany. According to the tradition, the Magi come from the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orient.html" title="Orient">Orient</a> on their <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camel.html" title="Camel">camels</a> to visit the houses of all the children; much like the Northern European <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> with his reindeer, they visit everyone in one night. In some areas, children prepare a drink for each of the Magi, it is also traditional to prepare food and drink for the camels, because this is the only night of the year when they eat.</li>

<ul>
<li>Spanish cities organize <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalcade_of_Magi_222f.html" title="Cavalcade of Magi">cabalgatas</a> in the evening, in which the <i>kings</i> and their <i>servants</i> parade and throw sweets to the children (and parents) in attendance.

<p>The Magi most frequently appear in European art in the <i>Adoration of the Magi</i>; less often <i>The Journey of the Magi</i> has been a popular <i><a href="../../../t/o/p/Topos.html" title="Topos">topos</a></i>, and other scenes such as the <i>Magi before Herod</i> and the <i>Dream of the Magi</i> also appear in the Middle Ages. In Byzantine art they are depicted as Persians, wearing trousers and <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrygian_cap.html" title="Phrygian cap">phrygian caps</a>. Crown appear from the 10th century. Medieval artists also <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegory.html" title="Allegory">allegorised</a> the theme to represent the three <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_time_periods.html" title="List of time periods">ages</a> of man. Beginning in the 12th century, and very often by the 15th, the Kings also represent the three parts of the known (pre-Columban) world in Western art, especially in Northern Europe. Balthasar is thus represented as a young African or <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moors.html" title="Moors">Moor</a> and Caspar may be depicted with distinctive <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental.html" title="Oriental">Oriental</a> features.</p>
<p>An early Anglo-Saxon picture survives on the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franks_Casket_1488.html" title="Franks Casket">Franks Casket</a>, probably a non-Christian king’s hoard-box (early <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century.html" title="7th century">7th century</a>, whalebone carving); or rather the hoard-box survived Christian attacks on non-Christian art and sculpture because of that picture.<sup id="_ref-Casket_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Casket" title="">[20]</a></sup> In its composition it follows the oriental style, which renders a courtly scene, with the Virgin and Christ facing the spectator, while the Magi devoutly approach from the (left) side. Even amongst non-Christians who had heard of the Christian story of the Magi, the motif was quite popular, since the Magi had endured a long journey and were generous. Instead of an angel, the picture places a swan, interpretable as the hero's <a href="../../../f/y/l/Fylgja.html" title="Fylgja">fylgja</a> (a protecting spirit, and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifter.html" title="Shapeshifter">shapeshifter</a>).</p>
<p>More generally they appear in popular <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity_scene.html" title="Nativity scene">Nativity scenes</a> and other <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> decorations that have their origins in the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoli.html" title="Napoli">Neapolitan</a> variety of the Italian <i>presepio</i> or Nativity crèche; they are featured in <a href="../../../g/i/a/Gian_Carlo_Menotti_a72c.html" title="Gian Carlo Menotti">Menotti</a>'s opera <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amahl_and_the_Night_Visitors_e8a1.html" title="Amahl and the Night Visitors">Amahl and the Night Visitors</a></i>, and in several <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_carol.html" title="Christmas carol">Christmas carols</a>, of which the best-known English one is "We Three Kings". In the film <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donovan%27s_Reef_3228.html" title="Donovan's Reef">Donovan's Reef</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_pageant.html" title="Christmas pageant">Christmas play</a> is held in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Polynesia_9f56.html" title="French Polynesia">French Polynesia</a>. However, instead of the traditional correspondence of Magi to continents, the version <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inculturation.html" title="Inculturation">for Polynesian Catholics</a> features the <i>king of Polynesia</i>, the <i>king of America</i>, and the <i>king of China</i>. Further sentimental narrative detail was added in the novel and movie <i><a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben-Hur_%281959_film%29_39a3.html" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i>, where Balthasar appears as an old man, who goes back to Palestine to see the former child Jesus become an adult. According to Howard Clarke, in the United States, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_card.html" title="Christmas card">Christmas cards</a> featuring the Magi outsell those with shepherds. The Twentieth-century poet <a href="../../../t/2E/s/T.S.Eliot_831e.html" title="T.S.Eliot">T.S.Eliot</a> wrote a poem <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Journey_of_the_Magi_e8ee.html" title="The Journey of the Magi">The Journey of the Magi</a> (1927). In <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ende_5dfd.html" title="Michael Ende">Michael Ende</a>'s children books <i><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Button_and_Luke_the_Engine_Driver_b2ba.html" title="Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver">Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Button_and_the_Wild_13_2296.html" title="Jim Button and the Wild 13">Jim Button and the Wild 13</a></i>, one of the Three Kings plays a major role in one of the main character's background.</p>
