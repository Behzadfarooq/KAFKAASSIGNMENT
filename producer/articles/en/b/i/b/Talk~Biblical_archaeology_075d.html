<p>It has a link for a resource of religious bigotry in its purest form, Christian Answers. That is not a valid archaeological reference, they claim the world is as old as civilization ( 6000 years ) and although they aknowledge the age of the dead sea scrolls they consider radiocarbon dating not valid.</p>
<p>Stop being so close minded, there is archeaological evidence for both evolution and the bible. Have you ever heard of <a href="../../../e/n/k/Enki.html" title="Enki">Enki</a> or the Temple of Eridug? They actually existed. I like to try and prove that something is true and if I have a large statistical average between the said things, places, people, etc of elements of the main subject than I would then believe in that subject. We all need to study, I like to study, and if we don't study those subjects and if we have almost meaningless statistical thoughts like "but the odds are so high, that's what I think" without using observations of seeing the objects than we close our minds. I have great evidence that evolution and things, places, and people in the bible are both true. Evolution precedes history in the bible.--24.22.111.99 02:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)Kyle McKenzie Street, age 16</p>

<p>Gee, thanks Wetman, not only have you put back all the POV you have spammed the article with quotations and snide remarks.

<dd>Quotations from respected archaeologists working in the field and a list for further reading help bring this entry up to Wikipedia norms. A list of names said to be "confirmed" by non-Biblical sources, with no context, seems less than useful. What's it <i>for</i>? "POV" when looked at for a moment always seems to mean "not <i>my</i> POV."

<dd>Well the list had been started by someone else, I'm just adding to it. There is still a lot more names that can be added, taking time cos one has to check that it isn't an Oded Golan forgery that was used as confirmation. I think a lot of people would find the list interesting, but perhaps it should be moved to its own article and expanded with info on the confirming evidence.

<p>This sentence: "The purpose of this social science is to establish the historical accuracy of Biblical texts..." is contradictory. The way it is phrased suggests that biblical archaeologists are looking for evidence to validate the bible. If so, then drop "social science". Otherwise, I'd suggest changing "establish" to "examine". I'd suggest removing <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_science.html" title="Social science">social science</a>, as biblical archaeology is a bit fringe to mainstream anthropological archaeology (i.e., it is less concerned with human behaviour and more concerned with history, and thus closer to a humanity than science), but I'm happy to be contradicted. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattus_151d.html" title="User:Rattus">Rattus</a> 15:17 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There have been many cities found in Tell Sultan (ancient Jericho), and since 8500 BC most of these cities were fortified. The Jericho at the time of Israel's emergence in Canaan, however, was not fortified. The site is neither a confirmation or refutation of the Biblical story. The rubble of the walls could have been entirely removed or the walls may never have existed at that time. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 00:16, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I've seen studies claiming quite the opposite. This was about 6 years ago. The finding demonstrated a wall with an unusualcollapse pattern. One that would be consistant with the wall being knocked over from the inside pushing out. I was unable to verify this claim because whenI was in Israel it wasunder palestinian control and they wouldn't let foreigners in. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 13:31, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be pretty difficult as Kathleen Kenyon established pretty definitively that Garstang's "walls of Jericho" dated to the Middle Bronze Period, and that it was against Egyptian policy (until at least 1150 BCE) to allow walled cities in Canaan which could resist Egyptian policing actions. Walled cities only developed again once there was a centralised administration such as we find in the periods of the Monarchy (eg as at Lachish and Jerusalem under Hezekiah).<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_D._Croft_0acc.html" title="User:John D.

<p>One editor put up the "Disputed Neutrality" template, and commented that the article should be "reworked into non-religious POV", but declined to elaborate as the template states he will. Biblical archaeology exists as a separate subject from Near-Eastern archaeology <i>because</i> of its religious pov. The science involved is to put the Biblical records to (neutral, refereed) archaeological test. There are multiple views represented in the article, and I toned down the rhetoric in the opening paragraph and one of the quotes. The quoted commentary has been moved to a separate section, where it can be expanded/changed as needed without interupting the flow of the article. So I am removing the template. If you still think it should be there, please explain why on the talk page. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 04:32, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about that. I put up the NPOV notice and forgot about it. My impression of the article is that it is biased towards the proving of the Bible. Upon second inspection this isn't nearly as bad as I first thought. Still could use improvement of POV. I'm quite certain Jericho's walls did not exist in the time period of the Israelite invasion. And certainly if Canaanite cities whose remains support the Biblical narrative of Joshua are included, why not mention the city of Ai, whose remains seem to exclude the possibility of a destruction by Israelites in the Late Bronze Age? --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 11:47, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll look into the Ai article later when I have time, but your Jericho link refers to Wood's redating which has been disqualified.</dd>
<dd><i>"when Wood first published his claims, there was only one radiocarbon measurement available for City IV. It was from a piece of charcoal dated by the British Museum to 1410 plus or minus 40 years B.C. (Wood "Israelites" 53). Unfortunately, this date was later retracted by the British Museum, along with dates of several hundred other samples. The British Museum found that their radiocarbon measurement apparatus had gone out of calibration for a period of time, and thus had yielded incorrect dates during that period (Bowman 59-79). The corrected date for the charcoal sample from City IV turned out to be consistent with Kenyon's ca. 1550 B.C. date for the City IV destruction."</i></dd>

<dd>After a little digging it seems that we're both citing Young Earth Creationists, and I think that casts some doubt on their acceptability as scientific sources (not that YECs are necessarily wrong, but fall outside the mainstream of accepted science).

<dd>Wood is indeed a fundamentalist Christian but he is also a respected archaeologist, his Creationist views have nothing to do with his arguments for dating Jericho.

Since there is not enough data from local trees to calibrate raw C-14 dates, Wood refuses to accept the above findings for Jericho." but provided no link to the studies Wood cites. This is where him being a Young Earth Creationist really is a problem for me, because I cannot on faith trust his interpretation of scientific data, which on aother issue (the age of the earth) is so drastically at variance with the mainstream.

<p>To Kuratowski's Ghost- Why did you feel it necessary to delete archaeological facts about the Israelite settlement? The Israelite villages appear in the archaeological record shortly before 1200 BC. Jericho's walls fell, at the very latest, around 1300 BC, and probably at least a century earlier. But even if the latest date for the walls is accepted, they still predate the Israelite settlement by nearly a century. I do think these facts are relevant, and the article as it stands only reports findings that could be considered corroborations of the biblical record. Material that contradicts or is neutral to the biblical account should not be kept out of the article. If a discovery is both relevant and legit, there is no reason for its deletion from the article.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 00:06, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In fact, the entire article as it stands seems to be little snippets about certain events and structures mentioned in the Bible. Biblical archaeology is not limited to things mentioned in the Bible; much of the literature labeled as dealing with "biblical" archaeology focuses on the settlement patterns of the Israelites and their neighbors. I think we should include a section on the settlement patterns of the Israelites and neighboring cultures; good references to start with would be stuff by William Dever, Israel Finkelstein, Thomas Levy, and Amihai Mazar, among others. If I get enough time I'll try to make a section about this topic.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 00:19, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Kitchen is not a biblical archaeologist, he's an Egyptologist. He's a good Egyptologist. But he is not a biblical archaeologist, and quite obviously has a vested interest in proving the reliability of Genesis. IMHO, he's not a valid source for this topic, and including him here would not be balanced, as on this subject he is not a mainstream source. Amihai Mazar accepts the basic historicity of the Patriarchs, and both Mazar and Levy accept the Exodus, so that should be balanced enough. As for Finkelstein, I'll reference his 1988 work on the Israelite settlement(this was before he proposed his chronological revisions, so that won't be present), and while I do intend to mention his chronological revisions and his 2001 <i>The Bible Unearthed</i>, I will make sure to note that they are currently accepted only by a minority of archaeologists (I personally am on the fence with regard to Finkelstein's revisions, although I tend to lean toward the conventional chronology). I have no intention of using the Copenhagen drek, if that's what you're worried about.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 01:16, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That depends on your definition of "Biblical archaeology" I think. I, and more importantly people like Dever and Moorey, draw a distinction between the archaeology of the Levant/Syro-Palestine (call it what you will) and Biblical archaeology. The former is anything archaeological in the area, while the latter is applying these archaeological discoveries to the interpretation of the Biblical text. So, by that definition Kitchen (and the Assyriologist Alan Millard) is a Biblical archaeologist. So, I think we need to include both these POVs and also the POV of the Copenhagen idiots here (but I wouldn't want Kitchen or the Copenhagen school on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Levant_ef10.html" title="History of Levant">History of Levant</a> page). --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutter_c4c0.html" title="User:Grutter">G Rutter</a> 08:24, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Dating Joshua to the 15th century is based solely on biblical genaeologies. So far as I know, this date is common among conservative theologians. Moderate and liberal theologians have largely abandoned this dating in favor of the 13th-12th century dating based on archaeology and other biblical references- for example, Exodus 1 states that the Israelites built the city of Rameses (Pi-rammese), and this has led to the popular identification of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rameses_II_7a6d.html" title="Rameses II">Rameses II</a> (1279-1213 BC) as the pharaoh of the oppression. Granted, this is speculation, as we really don't have much evidence for an exodus in the first place. But my main point is that the 15th-century dating has been largely abandoned, and saying there "might have been" Israelite settlements before the late 13th century that we just haven't found yet is pure speculation without any archaeological basis. We can't omit archaeological evidence just because it might offend some people.</p>
<p>Perhaps a separate "Israelite Archaeology" or "Levantine Archaeology" article is in order that does not focus exclusively on the Bible as this page does, and can discuss the archaeology of Israel from a historical-anthropological point of view. The Bible would still be used as reference material, but secondarily to archaeology.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 19:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anyway, I reinserted the info about the walls predating the Israelite settlement in a form that I hope would be considered more neutral in tone, simply stating that this is the current majority opinion. It is important to leave this info in, as it is relevant to the subject in question.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 04:10, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is this really the majority opinion though? And is it not simply a case of the agreement being that the destruction predates earliest currently known confirmed Israelite site - not the same thing as saying that the majority opinion is that it predates the Israelites. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 21:49, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It is the majority opinion. Aside from Kenneth Kitchen, I have not read anything from an archaeologist that disagrees with the late 13th-12th century date for the Israelite settlement. Archaeologists don't like to invoke "ghost settlements" when they don't have to (occasionally they do have to, such as for the Byzantine period in Jerusalem, but this is very rare. The Israelite settlement does not appear to warrant invoking this).--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 23:21, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Where are you seeing them? The only place I've seen the 15th century date given is from old books (1970s and earlier), and from modern-day apologetics, which are not a valid source.</p>
<p>Does Kenneth Kitchen even give a 15th-century date? I was under the impression that he thought Rameses II was the pharaoh of the Exodus.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 23:33, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In his excellent book, <i>Israel in Egypt</i> (published in 1996 and dedicated to Ken Kitchen), James Hoffmeier (Professor of Biblical Studies and Archaeology at Wheaton College, Illinois) discusses the dating of the Exodus (p122-126). He notes that a literal reading of the 480 years given in 1 Kings 6:1 would give a date for the Exodus of 1445 BC (which, for example, is the date given in the timeline in the NIV Study Bible). He notes there are problems with trying to make this number symbolic, but concludes (p126):
<dl>
<dd>"It is clear that even after over a century of academic inquiry into the date of the exodus, we are no closer to a solution today. ... If there is a prevailing view among historians, biblical scholars, and archaeologists, an exodus in the Ramesside era (1279-1213 B.C.) is still favored. The Merneptah stela (ca. 1209/8 B.C.) serves as a <i>terminus ad quem</i> for arrival of Israelistes in Canaan. The question remains: How long had they been there prior to Meneptah's time?"</dd>

<p>I think the lengthy quote by Devers under "Professional Commentary" is highly biased and antagonistic against the Bible and Biblical archaeologists. It implicitly assumes certain motives on the part of the archaeologists and certain preconceptions about the historicity of the Bible. There should at least be opposing quotes by authorities who hold different points of view, or it should be removed.216.90.56.122 20:12, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The commentary is by a "professional" Biblical archaeologist. If Biblical archaeology is above criticism in its own field what is its value? If Biblical archaeology ever expects to be taken seriously it must stand peer review from its own new archaeologists. Revision is expected in science. If you can find quotes by other professional Biblical archaeologists that disagree with Deaver by all means add them.

<dd>The fact that an article is about practices in a particular field doesn't make it unique to that field or even particularly a "method" of that field. The fact that it is covered in a magazine whose remit is in one area doesn't make every comment it makes exclusive to that subject. Please calm down a bit and pause a bit here. I agree that this practice was and is reprehensible. However we must target the correct culprits. Yes "biblical" archaeologists were at fault, but so were archaeologists of many nations and persuasions. Highly valid criticisms, but the problems were deeper and more pervasive than you might grasp from the short section. Also technically speaking this is nothing about "method" in the archaeological sense, but you could perhaps say it is a flawed practice. Also as this criticism is not the "main2purpose of this article it is inappropriate to place this matter at the head of the article.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 12:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
