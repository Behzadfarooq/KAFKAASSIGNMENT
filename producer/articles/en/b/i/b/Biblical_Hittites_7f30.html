<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Hittites_7f30.html" title="Edit section: Identification hypotheses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Identification hypotheses</span></h2>
<p>Given the casual tone in which the Hittites are mentioned in most references, Biblical scholars before the age of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeology.html" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> traditionally regarded them as a smaller tribe, living in the hills of Canaan during the era of the Patriarchs. This picture was completely changed by the archaeological finds that placed the center of the Hatti/Hattusas civilization far to the north, in modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>Because of this perceived discrepancy and other reasons, some Biblical scholars reject Sayce's identification of the two peoples, and believe that the similarity in names is only a coincidence. In order to stress this distinction, <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._A._Speiser_9715.html" title="E. A. Speiser">E. A. Speiser</a> called the Biblical Hittites <i>Hethites</i> in his translation of the Book of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_%28Old_Testament%29_36fa.html" title="Genesis (Old Testament)">Genesis</a> for the <i><a href="../../../a/n/c/Anchor_Bible_Series_fe5f.html" title="Anchor Bible Series">Anchor Bible Series</a></i>.</p>
<p>The corpus of the Hebrew Bible was probably compiled in its near-final form between the 7th and 5th centuries BC, during or after the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_exile.html" title="Babylonian exile">Babylonian exile</a>, as related in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezra_c059.html" title="Book of Ezra">Book of Ezra</a>, with a further revision in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic.html" title="Masoretic">Masoretic</a> text occurring some time between ca. 200 BC and 100 AD, as inferred from <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_criticism.html" title="Higher criticism">textual analysis</a> of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, and other sources. The old Hittite Empire had thus collapsed well before the final redaction of the Hebrew Bible. There were, however, small post-Empire "<a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Hittite_78d1.html" title="Neo-Hittite">Neo-Hittite</a>" (actually <a href="../../../l/u/w/Luwian.html" title="Luwian">Luwian</a>) principalities in Syria in later times, and some schools of thought hold that these were the inspiration for the Biblical Hittites, thus implying that the earlier Hittite power would have been unknown to Ancient Israel. This view is particularly popular among 'minimalists' who endeavour to prove that Israel had no real history in the area before this time. Since some of these post-Empire petty Luwian kingdoms may have been allied with the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Israel_ab05.html" title="Kingdom of Israel">kingdom of Israel</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, it is therefore assumed that the Biblical Hittites summarily refer only to these "Neo-Hittite" states to the north.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the view that the Biblical Hittites are identical to the earlier Anatolian Hittites is popular. Apart from the similarity in names, the latter were a powerful political entity in the region before the collapse of their empire in the 14th-12th centuries BC, so one would expect them to be mentioned in the Bible, just in the way that the <i>HTY</i> post-Exodus are. A stone <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion.html" title="Lion">lion</a> relief found a Beth Shan, near the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Galilee_d678.html" title="Sea of Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> (now at the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Museum_bbc6.html" title="Israel Museum">Israel Museum</a>), dated to about 1700 BC, has been interpreted by professor Bill Humble as confirming this identification, since lions are often pictured in Hittite art. <a href="http://www.knls.org/English/trascripts/humble03.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.knls.org/English/trascripts/humble03.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Moreover, in the account of the conquest of Canaan, the Hittites are said to dwell "in the mountains" and "towards the north" of Canaan — a description that matches the general direction and geography of the original Hittite empire, who had been influential in the region prior to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kadesh_71e0.html" title="Battle of Kadesh">Battle of Kadesh</a>.</p>
<p>Modern academics propose, based on much <a href="../../../o/n/o/Onomastic.html" title="Onomastic">onomastic</a> and archaeological evidence, that Anatolian populations moved south into Canaan as part of the waves of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Peoples_7b84.html" title="Sea Peoples">Sea Peoples</a> who were migrating along the Mediterranean coastline at the time of the collapse of the Hittite Empire. Many kings of local city-states are shown to have had Hittite and <a href="../../../l/u/w/Luwian.html" title="Luwian">Luwian</a> names in the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Age_9719.html" title="Bronze Age">Late Bronze</a> to <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Age_6948.html" title="Iron Age">Early Iron Age</a> transition period. Indeed, even the name of Mount <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zion.html" title="Zion">Zion</a> may be Hittite in origin<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Some people have conjectured<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> that the Biblical Hittites could actually be <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurrians.html" title="Hurrians">Hurrian</a> tribes living in Canaan, and that the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> word for the Hurrians (<i>HRY</i> in consonant-only script) became the name of the Hittites (<i>HTY</i>) due to a scribal error.

<p>In this period, which is conjectured to start sometime after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_BC_0a8f.html" title="2000 BC">2000 BC</a> and end sometime before <a href="../../../1/2/0/1200_BC_8f1b.html" title="1200 BC">1200 BC</a>, the "sons of Heth" or "children of Heth" (בני-חת, <i>BNY-HT</i>) and the label "Hittite" (<i>HTY</i>) are mentioned multiple times, but referring to essentially only two events.</p>
<p>In Genesis:23:2, towards the end of Abraham's life, he was staying in Hebron, on lands belonging to the "children of Heth", and from them he obtained a plot of land with a cave to bury his wife <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah.html" title="Sarah">Sarah</a>. One of them (Ephron) is labeled "the Hittite", several times. This deal is mentioned three more times (with almost the same words), upon the deaths of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph.</p>
<p>Decades later, in Genesis:26:34, Abraham's grandson Esau is said to have taken two Hittite wives, and a Hivite one. This claim is repeated, with somewhat different names, in Genesis:36:2.

<p>This period is conjectured to start sometime after <a href="../../../1/8/0/1800_BC_222a.html" title="1800 BC">1800 BC</a> and end sometime before <a href="../../../1/0/0/1000_BC_0f1e.html" title="1000 BC">1000 BC</a>. In this period (in which can be included the promise made to Abraham, centuries earlier, and its recall by Nehemias half a millennium later), the Hittites are mentioned about a dozen times as part of an almost fixed formula that lists the "seven nations greater and mightier than [the Hebrews]" whose lands will be eventually conquered. Five other "major nations" are mentioned in almost all instances of the formula: <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaanites</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorites.html" title="Amorites">Amorites</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/v/Hivites.html" title="Hivites">Hivites</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/b/Jebusites.html" title="Jebusites">Jebusites</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perizzites.html" title="Perizzites">Perizzites</a>. The Girgashites are mentioned only five times. Abraham's covenant in Genesis:15:18 omits the <a href="../../../h/i/v/Hivites.html" title="Hivites">Hivites</a> but includes the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadmonites.html" title="Kadmonites">Kadmonites</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenites.html" title="Kenites">Kenites</a>, Kenizzites, and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Rephaim.html" title="Rephaim">Rephaim</a>.</p>
<p>Among the five references to the Hittites that cannot be classified as a variant of that formula, two (Numbers:13:29 and Joshua:11:3) declare that the Hittites "dwell in the mountains", together with the <a href="../../../j/e/b/Jebusites.html" title="Jebusites">Jebusites</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorites.html" title="Amorites">Amorites</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perizzites.html" title="Perizzites">Perizzites</a>, whereas the Canaanites live "on the east and on the west", on the coast of Jordan, and the Amalekhites live "in the south". In Joshua:1:4 the land of the Hittites is said to extend "from the wilderness and this Lebanon", from "the Euphrates unto the great sea". In Judges:1:18, the Bethel traitor who led the Hebrew into the city is said to have gone to live among the Hittites where he built a city called Luz. Finally in Judges:3:5 it is said that the Hebrew lived and intermarried with the Hittites as well as with the other five "major nations".</p>
