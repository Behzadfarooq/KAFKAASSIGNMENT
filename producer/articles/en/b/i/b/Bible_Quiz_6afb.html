<p><b>Bible Quiz,</b> also known as <b>Bible Bowl,</b> is a competition between teams representing individual churches. Various <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> denominations, plus a handful of independent groups, sponsor these competitions. All of them take the form of a quick-recall game, similar to those used in many American schools but instead using the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> as the subject of study and questions. Organizations which use the name "Bible Bowl" lean toward the format established by television's <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Bowl_725d.html" title="College Bowl">College Bowl</a></i> in the 1950s. All groups feature teams competing to be the first to "buzz in" using an electronic lockout device, much like those still used in TV game shows like <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i> today.</p>
<p>Most organizations have seasons which roughly correspond with the U.S. school year (September-June), holding local competitions on a monthly basis, with playoffs beginning in March or April that lead to a national championship tournament. Contestants are usually students in grades six through twelve, with some organizations also offering a separate division for younger children.</p>
<p>Most Bible Bowl/Quiz organizations use the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_International_Version_2847.html" title="New International Version">New International Version</a> as their source authority; others use the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a>. Some groups also feature a "quoting bee" as an additional part of their competition. Similar to a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelling_bee.html" title="Spelling bee">spelling bee</a>, a contestant is given a verse reference, and must quote the verse perfectly within a time limit (8-20 seconds, depending on the level of competition) or be eliminated.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Quiz_6afb.html" title="Edit section: National Bible Bowl">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">National Bible Bowl</span></h3>
<p><b>National Bible Bowl</b>, originally sponsored by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Christian_Convention_1002.html" title="North American Christian Convention">North American Christian Convention</a>, is now managed by National Bible Bowl, an independent organization since 2001. Most teams still come from churches affiliated with the NACC, but other churches are now allowed as well, even into the National Tournament. The game format is nearly a direct copy of <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Bowl_725d.html" title="College Bowl">College Bowl</a>, except that the matches are generally longer. Unlike many other quiz programs though, <b>National Bible Bowl</b> games have a time limit of 14 minutes with 15 questions for <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round-robin_tournament.html" title="Round-robin tournament">round robin</a> games or two 10 minute rounds with 20 questions for <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-elimination_tournament.html" title="Double-elimination tournament">double elimination</a> games. This tends to create a faster environment and more closely reflects College Bowl in that it is more entertaining for non-participants to watch. The official study text material covers both the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, but there is no set cycle used to determine the books of the Bible studied and new questions are created every year, even if the same material is covered again.</p>
<p>Games are played with two teams of 2 to 6 players each with no more than 4 participating per round. The quizmaster reads "toss-up" questions worth 10 points each no matter the difficulty. Toss-ups start with a statement called a "lead-in" which directs players toward the answer, and then the question is read. Toss-ups can be of various types including "keyword," in which a word used once or twice in the official study text is used in the lead-in, "general," which asks a question pertaining to a specific concept or idea in the text, and "specialty," in which players have the opportunity to give short answers to various specialty types such as rhyming words or alliterations. Each player has a hand held signal block in front of them with a button and a light on it to recognize which player "buzzed in." Players must begin their answers within 3 seconds of buzzing in, a much shorter response time than the <b>Assemblies of God</b> or <b>Nazarene</b> programs which both allow players 30 seconds to complete their answers. This is one of the main factors in the speed of the game. Players do not need to finish the question being read but must quote the answer or the verses where the answer is found. If a question is answered incorrectly, the other team has the opportunity to listen to the rest of the question and then answer. Points are never taken away in <b>National Bible Bowl</b> for any reason nor is a player ever removed from the game for answering too many questions correctly or incorrectly, but substitutions may be made at half-time. Once a toss-up is answered correctly, a bonus question is given to that player's team on which they may confer. Bonus questions consist of 4 to 8 segments and are worth 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 points.</p>
<p>The schedule coincides with the school year and round robins take place each month in local State competitions. Some States hold more than one round robin due to an abundance of teams in the area. In the summer, competitive teams will meet at some of the several invitational tournaments taking place at Christian Colleges, Universities, Bible Schools, and Seminaries around the country. At each competition a written test is administered ranging from 150 to 500 questions and certain competitions, including the National Tournament, hold "Quoting Bees" wherein a participant is given a verse location and must quote the entire verse from beginning to end verbatim. There are no official district or regional competitions that determine advancement and judges are only used in later rounds of double elimination tournaments. The season ends with a national championship tournament open to all teams, which concludes with a bracket-style playoff; the final games are staged in front of audiences sometimes numbering in the thousands.</p>
<p>A children's program, called <i>Beginner Bible Bowl</i>, is for children in third through fifth grades. This program has different rules to engage younger players, one of the main differences being official pre-written questions that the children must quote the answers to.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Quiz_6afb.html" title="Edit section: Wesleyan Bible Bowl">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wesleyan Bible Bowl</span></h3>
<p><b>Wesleyan Bible Bowl</b>, sponsored by the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_Church_3704.html" title="Wesleyan Church">Wesleyan Church</a>, is also similar to <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Bowl_725d.html" title="College Bowl">College Bowl</a>, but games begin with a written quiz.</p>
<p><a name="Assemblies_of_God_Bible_Quiz" id="Assemblies_of_God_Bible_Quiz"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Quiz_6afb.html" title="Edit section: Assemblies of God Bible Quiz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Assemblies of God Bible Quiz</span></h3>
<p><b>Assemblies of God Bible Quiz</b>, sponsored by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assemblies_of_God_c252.html" title="Assemblies of God">Assemblies of God</a>, is the largest Bible Bowl/Quiz ministry in terms of participants. <i>Teen Bible Quiz</i> games feature two teams of three quizzers each, plus up to three substitutes. Games are comprised of 20 questions, with point values of 10, 20, or 30 points depending on the difficulty. Quizzers who buzz in first (using hand-operated buzzers) and answer correctly within 30 seconds are awarded the point value; an incorrect response results in a deduction of half the point value. A quizzer who interrupts the quizmaster (moderator - the question reader) must first complete the essence of the question and then give the answer; a quizzer who fails to do both correctly is not only penalized with a deduction of half the point value, but allows the opposing team a shot at the same question. Individual quizzers with five correct answers in a game "quiz out" and receive a 20-point bonus, but must sit out the remainder of the game; this rule was created with the intent to prevent one individual from dominating the match. This also encourages team play by giving more questions to quizzers who aren't as knowledgeable of Scripture or as experienced at quizzing. Similarly, a quizzer with three incorrect answers is also disqualified, but without further point penalty; the purpose of this rule is to discourage quizzers from "buzzing in" and simply guessing, and also to speed up play.</p>
<p>Monthly matches begin in October. District-level playoffs in March, with top teams moving on to one of eight regional playoffs, and the top five teams from those advance to the National Finals, held in July. Teams study a specific portion of the New Testament each season (Romans and James in 2005-2006). Questions at the National Finals level can be extremely difficult, such as requiring a seven-verse passage to be quoted perfectly within 30 seconds, or the recollection of a list of twenty or more names or places. The 2006 "Final 40," as it is nicknamed, was held July 2-7 in <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington%2C_Kentucky_68e8.html" title="Lexington, Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, and won by Church at Briargate from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_Springs%2C_Colorado_d0e9.html" title="Colorado Springs, Colorado">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>. The victory was the third for the church since the turn of the century. The 2007 tournament will be held July 8-13 at the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort in <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucson%2C_Arizona_9259.html" title="Tucson, Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>.</p>
<p><i>Junior Bible Quiz</i> uses a similar format for children in grades one through six, with some differences: 1) a box of 576 questions and answers covering the entire Bible is used as the subject material; 2) four quizzers and up to four substitutes comprise a team; 3) six correct answers are needed for a "quiz out" and a 10-point bonus (this was also the rule in <i>Teen Bible Quiz</i> until the start of the 2005-2006 season).</p>
<p>Though this competition is sponsored by the Assemblies of God, teams from churches outside that fellowship may compete, with certain restrictions. At the Teen Quiz level, such teams may advance through the regional level of playoff competition, but not to the National Finals. In Junior Quiz, advancement through to National Finals is not restricted; JBQ teams from any church may compete. In 2006, a church from outside the Assemblies won the Junior National Championship for the first time in the competition's history; previously, a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_d37f.html" title="Southern Baptist">Southern Baptist</a> and a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> church had each finished in second place.</p>
<p>Between <i>Teen</i> and <i>Junior Quiz</i>, more than 3,000 teams compete in <b>Assemblies of God Bible Quiz</b> each year.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_Quiz_6afb.html" title="Edit section: Nazarene Bible Quizzing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nazarene Bible Quizzing</span></h3>
<p><b>Nazarene Bible Quizzing</b> is sponsored by the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Nazarene_2b91.html" title="Church of the Nazarene">Church of the Nazarene</a>. It is similar to <b>Assemblies of God</b> quizzing, with a few exceptions. Matches are 20 questions in length, and questions are worth 20 points each. Penalty points are deducted only when a quizzer "errors out" by answering three questions incorrectly, when a quizzer commits two fouls in a single round, each team error after the fourth, or any error after question number 16. Another important difference is that teams are comprised of four quizzers with one substitute, rather than three and three. The most obvious difference is the method of buzzing-in — a seated quizzer jumps up, which activates a pad on an electronic lock-out device (lacking such a device, a judge determines the first person to stand). In addition to the 1st place team from the district, a second "all-star" is formed from the remaining top scoring individual and will advance to the regional competition along with the 1st place church team. During the regional competitions, the local churches, and district "all-star" teams compete and then an "all-star" team is chosen of the best quizzers districts of that region as well, making up a regional "all-star" team (one region for each of the Nazarene colleges and now some teams from missionary families). There are two different national competitions in Nazarene Bible quizzing, one which includes district and regional competitions, and one which only involves the regional teams. These National competitions alternate back and forth from one year to the next. Nazarene Bible Quizzing has a long history in the Church of the Nazarene, and has been popular with many churches for generations.</p>

<p><b>Free Methodist Bible Quiz</b> is sponsored by the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Methodist_Church_9e4f.html" title="Free Methodist Church">Free Methodist Church</a>. It is similar in format to the <b>Nazarene Bible Quizzing</b> ministry.</p>
<p>The winner of the National Bible Quiz Finals in Free Methodist Quizzing receives the Alpha Omega trophy, which consists of a base on which the names of all previous winners are engraved. The back has 3 small stained glass windows, and there is a platform to sit a detachable trophy that looks like a Bible. The winning team keeps the Bible, and the rest travels to the team that won that year.</p>

<p><b>Alliance Bible Quizzing</b> is sponsored by the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_and_Missionary_Alliance_529a.html" title="Christian and Missionary Alliance">Christian and Missionary Alliance</a>. Quizzing is in game format, similar to <b>Nazarene</b> and <b>Free Methodist</b>. One round (with 3 teams) is 20 questions, and 20 points is added for each correct question. Ten points are deducted for a wrong answer (after Question 16). Teams sit on a pad (like the Nazarene quizzing) and jump off when they know an answer. They then have 30 seconds to give the full answer. A person can "quiz out" when they get four questions correctly. They will then sit out the round and receive bonus points for answering the questions. "Erring out" occurs when a person gets three answers wrong. Types of questions include quoting a Bible verse or finishing a sentence. A national tournament is held. Championship tournaments are also staged at international levels, with the 2006 final held in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota_b081.html" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a> at <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_College_%28Minnesota%29_c818.html" title="Crown College (Minnesota)">Crown College</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>World Bible Quiz Association</b> is an independent ministry that sponsors quizzing across denominational lines. Its game format is most similar to <b>Nazarene</b>, <b>Free Methodist</b> and <b>Alliance</b> quizzing, and most competing teams come from those three groups. The WBQA's eight-year cycle of New Testament books studied each season is followed by those groups plus <b>Assemblies of God</b> <i>Teen Bible Quiz</i> and <b>Wesleyan Bible Bowl</b>. The WBQA holds a limited number of monthly competitions as well as invitational tournaments through the year, plus regional and national playoffs that are independent of the denominational quiz playoffs. WBQA quizzing appears to be concentrated in a few geographic areas, primarily <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Michigan</a> and the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quad_Cities_f138.html" title="Quad Cities">Quad Cities</a>.</p>
