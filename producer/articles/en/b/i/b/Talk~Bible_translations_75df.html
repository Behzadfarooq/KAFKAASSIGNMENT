<dd>I think that's an excellent idea. Jn 3:16 would be an obvious choice, being such a widely known verse, and I'm sure it would fall within the permissions given within most Bibles (although it would be worth checking the introduction to each edition to be sure. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 12:55 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a table at the end of the English Christian Translations section and filled it in with the some of the versions mentioned in the text and the renderings of the verse that I could find in a quick online search.</p>
<p>Obviously there are gaps that need to be filled in - as well as completing this table, I would like to see it extended to cover all the verses mentioned in the previous text (and for translations to be worked into the text before being added to the table) as well as a similar tables added for the other sections of the page.</p>
<p>If it's felt that all the tables should be joined together, perhaps we need to spin off another page?</p>

<dd>That's certainly a good start, though I had in mind including the translations in different languages too (I can dig out the Welsh ones, and probably a few other languages as well). In that case it would probably be better to have the table at a different place - perhaps at the end of the article or even on a subpage. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnus_2ef9.html" title="User:Magnus">Magnus</a> 15:18 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought of having table at the end of the section for each language as that will keep them relatively small (although I can see 'English Christian' getting pretty large if someone decides to deal with it thoroughly!). How useful would it be to compare versions in different languages - especially bearing in mind that the more translations that are included in a single table, the harder it will be to compare between ones that are not next to each other?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I suppose the practical advantages of having shorter tables might well outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to directly compare different languages. For languages with only one or two versions, a table is probably not necessary at all and the verse could be included within the text of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect there may well be websites with comparisons of different translations/languages available. I've certainly seen a similar thing in some Gideons' Bibles (in fact, that's where I got the idea from).</dd>

<p>In the version of John 3:16 from the Geneva Bible, should 'u' be used in place of 'v' (eg.

<p>Um, did anyone notice that Jews don't accept the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, and that it is not in the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Hebrew (Jewish) Bible</a>? There is no way that any Jewish translations of a verse can be included here, because there is no Jewish translation of the New Testament; its not in their Bible! So all Jewish translations are excluded from the current table. We should expand this table to include a few quotes from the Hebrew Bible as well. After all, even in Christianity the Hebrew Bible is most of their Bible. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<p>Also, quoting just one sentence for comparison isn't nearly enough. For any given part of the Bible, I would suggest quoting at least two sentences. (And despire what any publisher claims inside the introduction to their Bible translation, such minimal quoting is <i>well within</i> fair-use doctrine. For our encyclopediac purposes, quoting full paragraphs is also within fair-use, even if a publisher claims otherwise.) I suggest quoting two consectuive sentences from Genesis, two consecutive sentences from one of the Prophetic works, as well as two consecutive sentences from the New Testament. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I can see us ending up with some pretty unwieldy tables - and if they're hard to use, how much use will they really be for any comparison. Maybe we should rely on external sites (found this one <a href="http://www.cob-net.org/compare_bibles.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cob-net.org/compare_bibles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cob-net.org/compare_bibles.htm</a> so far - only English Christian and very POV but quite comprehensive and with a well explained background)?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which sections of Genesis and the Prophets would you suggest? --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 15:17 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good points, RK and Basswulf. I'd suggest that for the NT ones we use Jn 3:16-17 since we're already halfway there with some of the translations, and v16 is probably one of the best-known verses. For Genesis, how about taking Gen 1:1-2. My favourite pair of verses from the prophets is probably Hab 3:17-18, but we could perhaps go for something a bit less obscure.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, it may be better to stick with a more limited set of tables (eg. just Jn 3:16 and Gen 1:1) here and link to external sites for more details. I think it's worth keeping something onsite. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnus_2ef9.html" title="User:Magnus">Magnus</a> 15:21 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with RK completely. As for verses to translate, Gen 1:1 is a good choice because it is virtually always mistranslated. Still, I'd nominate Leviticus 9:18 and Deuteronomy 6:5. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<p>I also think the two table should be labled "Hebrew Bible/Old Testament" and "New Testabent" and -- can you blame me? -- the "old" testament should come before the "new " one? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible, if you prefer) should come first. I only suggested Jn 3:16 as that was the verse used in the bible I mentioned earlier where I saw the list of languages used. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagnus_2ef9.html" title="User:Magnus">Magnus</a> 16:09 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I realize the article is currently organized by alphabetical order -- fair, but arbitrary and consequently, prone to some confusion. Thus, I think the Greek and Latin translations should come first, since many other translations refer to them (e.g. the vulgate or septuagint).</p>
<p>I know strict chronology would be a mess.</p>
<p>I would suggest three major divisions: translations prior to the Reformation; translations during the Reformation and COunter-Reformation, and Modern Translations. The first two sections can be organized chronologically, and the third section, alphabetically. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting but the Reformation is an arbitrary choice for the Jewish translations, isn't it? (Enlightenment, maybe?) <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 17:39 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, the Enlightenment is a better marker for Jewish translations, but in my opinion only marginally in this instance; the fact is that the Reformation is <i>appropriate</i> -- you know, it was a European upheaval that affected a lot of Jews. More importantly, it established a trend towards tranlations into the vernacular -- a trend that affected Jews too. Also, some of the first Jewish translations in the vernacular, in German, were responding to Luther's translation. So I think it is a reasonabvle NPOV marker (but if RK or others strenuously object, I defer -- my main point is that there is a history here, not only to specific translations but to why people would want to translate the Bible, and why translations would have status. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not keen on chronological organisation. You could go by date of first issue... but becomes a mess because some translations have a much longer span of influence than others, eg. the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a>, which is still going strong for many readers ("If English was good enough for St Paul, it's good enough for me!"&#160;;-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm in favour of keeping the existing organisational schema. Relationships between editions can be discussed in the blocks of text but I see the lists as an easy way for someone to track down a link to a specific translation. Once we've broken the page into sections for each distinct language, I don't see what we gain by attempting to use chronological order. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 09:25 Apr 28, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Uh, I am not sure you understand me. I am not saying to "use chronological order" <i>after</i> breaking the page into sections for each distinct language; I said to do it <i>before</i>. I am also not talking about different "editions," but <i>translations</i>. In fact, you seem to support my point, as you point out that the King James version is still going strong. It has had a wide influcence. That is why it should come first. But the people who made the KJ translation consulted the Latin and Greek translations, so don't you see why those should go before King James? Similarly, Everett Fox conjsulted Buber and Rosenzweig's German translation, so shouldn't their German translation go before his English translation?</p>
<p>Finally, as I said, the point is not just to catalogue different translations but to see emerging issues in theories of translation. It isn't just that specific translations of the Bible have histories; the idea of translation has a history. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it makes sense to discuss the translations in this sort of history. For people who want or need only a quick link to a particular translation, I think we should keep the Genesis and John comparisons in alphabetical order... would that satisfy both needs? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree that as far as the tables of translations, alphabetical order makes the most sense. My suggestions really had to do only with the narrative structure of the article, not the tables. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I can see your point but are you suggesting breaking the language based divisions? The introductory section of the page could certainly be used to pick out key points in the history of translations but I still favour 'language' as the major method for subdividing the page. Note also the distinction between 'translations' and 'versions' on the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> page. If you like, this is a subpage created because that was getting to large and I think we need to write with it's contents in mind. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 22:08 Apr 30, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The site needs to be broken into subpages. When Bible is translated into a new language, it is a big news to those christians who speak that language. We can foresee that the site will keep on going.</p>

<p>At the moment there are 2 tables of English translations on different pages. For all sorts of reasons, mainly keeping the two in sync, I think we should just have one. Maybe then we should just have one chatty paragraph about all the different versions explaining the progression through major versions like KJV -&gt; GNT -&gt; NIV with a link to a full reference table giving for each translation: - abbreviation (e.g. NIV) - name (e.g. New International Version) - date of publication (e.g. 1976) - type of translation (literal, dynamic-equiv, paraphrase) - number of copies sold (incl. date of info) =&gt; helps people see which are the major translations without being too subjective</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/b/Talk%7EBible_translations_75df.html" title="Edit section: Western-Christianity Bias?  Need for a separate article on the controversies of vernacular translations?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Western-Christianity Bias? Need for a separate article on the controversies of vernacular translations?</span></h2>
<p>This article seems to me to touch rather too lightly on the immense controversy occasioned by various attempts at vernacular translations of the Bible in the west, and, inasmuch as it touches on it at all, reveals a western bias. The statement "During the Middle Ages, translation particularly of the Old Testament was discouraged" for instance applies only to the parts of Western and Central Europe that were part of Roman Christendom, while in the eastern churches the idea of vernacular translations of the bible appears not to have been controversial at all in the same period.</p>
<p>The article does skirt briefly upon the existence of early vernacular translations in the East (Armenian, Coptic, Georgian, Syriac, etc.), but then never mentions them again. Nor does it tie in the Slavonic translations of the Bible with what might be called a general eastern bias *towards* the local vernacular.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that the article gives a misleading impression of a more or less homogeneous attitude towards translations at any given time in history, suggesting that across Christendom in general, vernaculars were allowed in antiquity, then merely "discouraged" (as opposed to being considered gravely heretical?) in the middle ages, and then more violently condemned only later on due to Catharism and then Protestantism.</p>
<p>Might an alternative approach be more appropriate? -- i.e. one that makes explicit that the attitudes towards vernacular translations were, from an early date, different in different regions; that in particular, the Roman churches might even be reasonably considered the "odd men out" relative to Christianity as a whole in their adherence exclusively to the vulgate in the Bible and Latin in church services even in areas where Romance languages were not spoken; that the kind of controversies occasioned by Tyndale's or Luther's translations were alien to the culture of the Eastern Churches; and that the Slavonic translations were part of a norm in the east dating back to the Armenian, Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, and Greek churches. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by JJMG (<a href="../../../j/j/m/User_talk%7EJJMG_09fa.html" title="User talk:JJMG">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JJMG_2552.html" title="Special:Contributions/JJMG">contribs</a>) 17:56, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</small> JJMG 17:57, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I recently expanded the introduction to mention translations performed for theological as well as linguistic reasons, I provided two examples: classical (KJV) and modern (messianic). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>, in part of a continuing effort to minimize any mention of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_Judaism_97b5.html" title="Messianic Judaism">Messianic Judaism</a> in WP, removed the latter, citing <a href="../../../w/e/i/WP%7EWEIGHT_a59c.html" title="WP:WEIGHT">WP:WEIGHT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Regarding the former, this is a perfectly valid example of a bible translation made for theological concerns. The modernity of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messianic_bible_translations.html" title="Messianic bible translations">messianic bible translations</a> provide a nice balance to the more historical KJV reference, informing the reader that these issues are relevant yet today. Regarding the latter, what original research is being done? The theological (vs linguistic) goal of messianic translations is self-evident—it's related to a messianic theology, not an XYZ language.

<p>let's see, maybe we can do the gross cleanup work first, such as {{<a href="../../../s/p/l/Template%7ESplit_40bf.html" title="Template:Split">split</a>}} the insane list of translations to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bible_translations_bb55.html" title="List of Bible translations">list of Bible translations</a> or something, and we'll see much clearer where we'll have room for a "theological translations" section. It doesn't <i>have</i> to be in the intro. But even within the topic of "modern theological Bible translations", I am afraid that messianic Judaism ones will play a comparatively minor role. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 22:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's absurd to include a few minor translations for a tiny movement as a primary example of translations made for theological reasons. In addition, the claim that the MJ translations were done for theological reasons is hardly "self-evident"; find reliable sources which say they were.

<dd>Jayjg, the article has a cleanup tag. It is not 'ridiculous' to add material. Instead of removing, you should try to accommodate in the article body, in relation to notability.

<dd>it is true that there is a recent fad for creating a Bible translation taylored to your specific theological or philosophical outlook.

<p>Because this is ill-conceived and incorrect: the KJV was a response to complaints in existing bibles, and commissioned since the King didn't want marginal notes since some of those in the Geneva questioned his authority--it wasn't because the Geneva was critical of Roman Catholicism. The Anglican Church did, however, complain that the Geneva didn't used traditional terms (though it was technically more correct and clear, (ex: "baptism" which is taken from Greek means "immersion"), and so in order to appease the various movements within England, as well as the Church of England, the traditional terms (found in the Bishops Bible)were to be retained, though ironically the KJV is more than 80% the Geneva, so it's technically a revision and less a translation. <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinitelink_6866.html" title="User:Infinitelink">Infinitelink</a> 20:56, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article said that the translation by Jacques Lefavre was Catholic but he was condemned for his works, and he was led Reformed Churches, leaned toward the Calvinists, and was persecuted by Rome: his works were never endorsed by the Catholic Church and they were called heretical. His views also sharply diverged from Catholicism and wrote blunt denials of some of the teachinigs. The original sentence read like a tit for tat "this <i>Catholic</i> translation appeared before the Protestant translation"...tit-for-tat, not informative, but rather like an attack.
