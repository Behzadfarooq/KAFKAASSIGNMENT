<p>needs work; in particular, it needs to distinguish more carefully between the fact that certain books, held by some sects to be divinely inspired, were rejected when the canon was compiled, and the allegation that these books were suppressed out of sexism or fear rather than an honest belief in their falsehood. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:05, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mustafaa, I am in total agreement with you that most people in the middle-east do not believe any such thing. I never imagined that the present text of the article would lead to such an impression. As such, I am certainly open to you and others reworing and rewriting the material in here, even moving some material to another article. I just don't want the context summarilly deleted. However, my goal is to expand this article to include all sorts of Bible conspiracy theories, especially those that deal with Jesus and his supposed wife, Jesus and his supposed childrem, Freemasons, etc. There are many such Bible conspiracy theories! <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 17:48, Jul 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>RK, before you massively reverted, please read the changes that were. Lots of the material *did* in fact go to another article, see <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_history_denial_a513.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian history denial">Israeli-Palestinian history denial</a>, which was referenced. Doesn't make sense to put it back. Much of the NPOVing that was done was also valid. I've reverted it back to the latest improved state. It can only be expected that many of these theories will have their own articles. This article in this case should link to these articles; the context should be clear enough. Or create a category if you are worried about losing context. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartijn_faassen_e460.html" title="User:Martijn faassen">Martijn faassen</a> 23:02, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added my own two cents to the article, I wanted to clear up any confusion regarding the difference between the ancient groups alleging Bible conspiracy and corruption, like the Essene Nazoreans and Gnosticism (which although i do not adhere to those groups, I do find a strong reason to take their accusation seriously) versus the more modern pseudo-Christian groups that make the same claims, yet without any historical record of their own to validate them. The Mormon, Muslim, Jehovah Witness, and Jesus Only groups have made strong claims, and I found that their claims do not show any historical claim, and in fact they confuse people searching FOR biblical changes in the early periods.</p>

<dd>Bible conspiracy theories form the cornerstone of some relatively modern Christian religious movements.

These groups have published their own Bibles that differ from Bibles used by other Christian groups. In addition these groups publish new books, which they hold are divinely inspired <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelations</a>, to support their translations.</dd>

<p>This article doesn't seem to mention the common conspiracy theories of the Roman emperor Constantine supposedly imposing changes in the Bible onto the early 4th-century A.D. Church. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 08:18, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's because that is not a common conspiracy theory. Constantine had nothing to do with compiling the canonical scripture in the Bible as we know it today. That notion was first and only proposed by Dan Brown in his book The Da Vinci Code, in which it was a plot device he used to explain certain historical inconsistencies. The theory itself can be disproven by any 1st century historian who does not have his head stuck in his own rear end. ManofRenown87 08:55, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are sooooo incorrect ManofRenown87, try some researching. Conspiracies didn't start with Dan Brown. He just popularised them.--71.242.127.31 15:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I would like someone to reseach most of the stuff in this article... there is a distinct lack of citation. If Dan Brown didn't come up with the Constantine stuff, then who did? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 16:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In fact, it was not Bernard who founded the cistercian order, as the article says. He was one of the most important thinkers of it, he was from one of the early generations of cistercian monks, but he wasn't the founder - the founder was Robert of Molesme.</p>

<p>I separated the text in the section entitled "The Bible As A Lie: The New Testament" so that the David Icke text and the Joseph Atwill text are not mixed up together. As it stood, it was not representative of Atwill's writing in Caesar's Messiah. I left Icke's text alone, as I cannot comment on what is written about him. --<a href="../../../s/f/d/User%7ESfdan_f912.html" title="User:Sfdan">SFDan</a> 19:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has a serious issue with the lack of sources. It does not surprise me that someone somewhere has come up with each of these theories, but none of them are cited. The only source listed in the references section is the bible (and that only indirectly)... the rest is more along the lines of "footnoted commentary". Please, locate reliable sources to back up the information in this article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the intro this article states:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A Bible conspiracy theory is any conspiracy theory that posits that much of what is known about the Bible is a deception created to suppress some secret, ancient truth. Some of these theories claim that Jesus really had a wife and children, or that the Knights Templar had secret information about the true descendants of Jesus; some claim that there was a secret movement to censor books that truly belonged in the Bible, etc.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I notice, however, that the section on the Knights Templar does not actually discuss them having any "secret information about the true descendants of Jesus". In fact, the section does not really contain <i>anything</i> about a Bible conspiracy as the article defines it. This information should either be added (<i>with</i> citations to who came up with the theory) or the section should be removed (along with the mention in the intro.)

<dd>Well, since no one has responded, I will delete the material. Feel free to add it back with citations. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 23:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well... given the problems with citations mentioned above... perhaps the only way to get some work done on this article is the threat of deletion. I am more than willing to withdraw the nom if it looks as if some citation work is being done. Please review <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and get to work. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok... the AfD debate resulted in a 'Keep'. People feel this topic is notable, and even though virtually none of the material is backed by any source they want an article on this. That is a typical result for just about any page with the words "conspiracy theory" in it... and about what I was expecting. This is actually fine with me... I nominated it for deletion more to highlight the problem with lack of citations than to actually get rid of the article. I find that often the threat of deletion inspires people to work on the article. Unfortunately, I don't think my plan worked. The problem still exists. There continues to be a distinct lack of citations here. Looking forward.... I have added a bunch of citation request tags where I see a crying need for sources. Hopefully someone will add them. I will wait about a month, and see if anyone actually does so. If it looks as if someone is working on finding citations, great... if not, I will start removing unsourced statements and sections per Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
