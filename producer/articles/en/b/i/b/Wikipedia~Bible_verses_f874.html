This is a <b>survey</b> to aid in determining policy. It is <i>not</i> itself intended as a <i>proposed policy</i>. There is a related discussion underway at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_Bible_verses_33ff.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge/Bible verses">Wikipedia:Merge/Bible verses</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This concerns an issue that has been under consideration for the last month, with the general problem of failing to achieve consensus for any result (it is roughly 50:50 on each side of the argument, with the last VFD declared "keep" although the delete votes had a slight majority, of 2)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The debate is what to do about Bible verses. Should articles exist for every single bible verse in the bible, or just for some specially notable verses, or somewhere in-between. The result may affect articles on verses of other religious literature, such as the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabharata.html" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> (over 100,000 verses, and the second longest poem known to exist in the world). It will also affect the articles listed <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia%7EBible_verses_existing_a954.html" title="Wikipedia:Bible verses/existing">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>

<p><b>This survey does not discuss what to do with articles IF they should not exist individually. Whether, in this circumstance, they should be moved, transwikied, or deleted is a matter for discussion elsewhere</b></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Since some religious sects, groups, and faiths, attach extreme importance to their opinion on the matter, this question is possibly liable to sockpuppet abuse on one or more sides of the argument. Consequently editors with under 200 edits as of 22nd June 2005 (one month ago, roughly when the matter was first raised), may be discounted, to avoid any potential <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> abuse. Discounted votes will remain on the page but a comment will be added if the number of edits is small or user account is new.</li>

<li>This is closest to what I support. I don't believe that that any and all Bible verses are automatically worthy of an article, don't get me wrong, but when an article is well-written, thourough, and encyclopedic, I'd rather not rely on somebody's defination of "notable bible verse", because that tends to be subjective. <b>Support</b>. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a> 20:41, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>

<li>Plenty of verses have made their way into literature, general western culture, but the vast majority have not. I strongly support (and I am a bible reading christian) a move which restricts single verse entries. It would be rare to publish a bible commentary on a single verse, which I think says something. As to which bible? I doubt that is a problem. In practice there is little argument about which books are in the bible, or might be in someone else's bible, which is all that matteres. Now verse by verse entries on the Mahabharata would of course be excellent 8-). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 16:02, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think a reasonable gauge for notability would be the extent that a particular verse has made its way into literature or culture in general, which at least has some chance of being objectively verified at some level. Mustn't confuse "notable" with "important" because <i>every</i> verse is very important to someone, and has been commented on and preached on. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 20:32, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Support, but at creation time, the entries should already assert the verse notability. Otherwise it's inclusionist paradise: stick all single verses of the bible, then wait until someone proves they're notable. That's why I think notability assertion at creation time is a must. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini</a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini">☎</a> 01:22, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support. The articles should <b><sup>1</sup></b>not merely quote the verse, but actually say something about it, it should <sup><b>2</b></sup>assert notability from the start (as per <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini">drini</a>), and should <sup><b>3</b></sup>be provided with references to reputable academic secondary sources. It is also preferable that topics are covered from top to bottom: first book, then chapter and finally verses or other shorter passages. However, <i>notability should not only be judged from a narrow Western Christian (or rather secularized "post-christian") perspective or from presence in general Western culture or political discourse</i>; that is not how we judge notability for <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_crater.html" title="Lunar crater">lunar craters</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a> or beetle <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a>, most of which are only notable to specialists. It is up to the author to make a case for notability, but any verse asserted by the author to be notable for any reason, because of a debate over its meaning in academic biblical scholarship or because of its significance in Christian or Jewish traditions of interpretation obscure to the average wikipedian, should be individually discussed and judged on its own merits. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 07:54, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>(Warning: My opinion "may be discounted" since I have less than 200 edits and am relatively new to the Wiki. But I'm not a sockpuppet, and you can contact me easily inside or out of the Wikipedia.)</i><br />
I believe <b>anything</b> notable in its own right may have an article of its own, if there is someone to write it according to the usual rules (know what you talk about, NPOV, encyclopaedic, not your own original research, etc.). Certainly <u>some</u> Bible verses (and <u>some</u> verses in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and in the <a href="../../../t/a/o/Tao_Te_Ching_3ea2.html" title="Tao Te Ching">Daodejing</a> and...) are notable. Maybe many of them. I don't think each and every <u>single</u> Bible verse is notable <u>in its own right</u> even if it may be included as part of an article on a group of verses (possibly duplicated: e.g., the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> or the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> each merit a single article though they each appear in two places in the Bible), a famous poem (<a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah.html" title="Deborah">Deborah</a>'s Song), a famous chapter (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_1.html" title="John 1">John 1</a>), a topical article (Begats), a book (and IMHO most Bible books merit individual articles, though in some cases it could be argued that some particular groups of books would best be treated together: maybe the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_prophet.html" title="Minor prophet">Twelve Minor Prophets</a>, or <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_Kings_a671.html" title="Books of Kings">Kings I and II</a> or...). -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonymec_3d69.html" title="User:Tonymec">Tonymec</a> 00:00, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This section is for votes supporting the principle that only verses notable in their own right, rather than because they are part of the bible, or part of a part of the bible, should get their own articles. However, this section is for votes where this principle covers most verses, which are believed by the signatories to be notable in their own right. This position allows articles such as <a href="../../../1/6/_/John_3%7E16.html" title="John 3:16">John 3:16</a> <b>and <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_5%7E5.html" title="Matthew 5:5">Matthew 5:5</a></b>, but is unlikely to include articles such as 1 Chronicles 1:2.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Yes</b>. See my comments further below; surely there are more notable Bible verses than there are <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_series_5da9.html" title="Category:Television series">Category:Television series</a>, which I beleive currently numbers in the thousands on WP. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:49, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>This vote is irrelevant, because people who think so should (and have) vote for <i>"All bible verses should have individual articles"</i> rather than <i>"All verses notable in their own right should have individual articles"</i>. This vote here seeks to blur the distinction between two clear-cut groups. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 07:40, August 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd say just the opposite (though I agree with you that this option shouldn't have been added). Those who believe both that most or all verses deserve an article because they are notable in their own right should vote for the option that "all verses notable in their own right should have individual articles," because it most accurately reflects the principle upon which they are voting. In this poll, unfortunately, this cannot be done without drawing fire; see SimonP's vote above. -Ril- has clouded the issue by combining these points of principle with issues of fact, regarding the notability of specific articles. One of the first rules of survey design is to ask one question at a time; asking two, as this poll does, means that it is far more difficult for voters to express their intent accurately. In this instance, the notability of specific articles like <a href="../../../9/_/_/Matthew_1%7E9.html" title="Matthew 1:9">Matthew 1:9</a> or <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_5%7E5.html" title="Matthew 5:5">Matthew 5:5</a> should be decided on VFD or on the relevant talk pages, not in a poll leading toward policy. The inclusion of these questions of fact point to the ill-considered and rushed nature of this poll. My vote, at least, should be interpreted as a vote for the principle only, and based on the comments, it seems that numerous others feel the same. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 06:17, 2005 August 9 (UTC)</li>

<li>We are already spreading our efforts too thinly by trying to create sister projects all over the place, and since this one will be seperated from Wikipedia and will likely be worked on by people with certain religious agendas, there are significant problems when it comes to NPOV and the Wikimedia Foundation becoming a vehicle for evangelism. Why can't we concentrate on encyclopedic content? This doesn't mean having an article on every verse. Look at the article on the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Hosea_02fe.html" title="Book of Hosea">Book of Hosea</a>, for example. It's short and still has a notice saying that it's essentially modified public domain text. Can't those who wish to document the Bible start by improving articles on books, then when they get long and comprehensive breaking out into spin-off articles for notable passages in those books? I want Wikipedia to be a good source of information about the Bible. We're much too far short of that goal to start creating sister projects to contain articles for every verse. Come back and ask for WikiBible when Wikipedia is bursting at the seams with good coverage of Biblical topics. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 05:34, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yes</b>. Lets put this into perspective. There are hundreds of articles in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Category%7EPokemon_cbe1.html" title="Category:Pokemon">Category:Pokemon</a>, does everyone honestly believe that there are fewer notable verses of the Bible than there are Pokemon?

If you watch TV all day, then no. If you are doing mathematical research, then yes. There are already many thousands of articles on math and physics, and yet WP is not yet "encyclopaedic" in these areas (as compared to the "real" encyclopaedias in these areas, e.g. Cambridge texts, etc. or even <a href="http://www.mathworld.com" class="external text" title="http://www.mathworld.com" rel="nofollow">Mathworld</a>).

<li><b>Support</b> What establishes notability? Well, there's your obvious: art/pop culture. Covers stuff like John 3:16, right? Next, there's your even more obvious: major theological skirmishes. Covers stuff like Sirach 15:16 (Catholics vs. Calvinists over predestination) or James... eh... #:##. You know, "Faith without works is dead." (Catholics vs. Lutherans over faith alone vs. faith and action). Then there's the "just about everybody knows it", which would be "Be there light!" (Genesis 1:2, I think?). Then there's the obvious "It's been entwined in political issues in some country." And as we all know, the English-speaking country and verse where this is most likely to apply is... Canada and Revelations 6:7. &#160;;) Anyway, I think once the criteria of notability get established, it'll turn out only hundreds of the verses meet it. For instance, Rev. 6:7 isn't actually notable, except in conjunction with the rest of Rev. 6:1 through Rev. 6:8, and while the 8 verses quite rightly go into <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse_3bb4.html" title="Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse">Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a>, none of the 8 should get its own article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 23:41, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Tricky, not having read them all". This (a few hundred) is my impression of how many verses would merit an <b>individual</b> article. Certainly more are notable as part of a larger group. Anyway, I would gladly be disproved by seeing scholarly NPOV encyclopaedical articles on more verses than that; but please don't create stubs for every Biblical verse.

<dd>That quite bizzare reasoning - couple of billion Christians might outstrip Bevis fans somewhat - and then there are Jews (since we are talking about Hebrew Bible too) and, quite a few interested agnostics and others. And if 'religious projects' should be chased elsewhere, what about mathematics projects or biology, or schools for that matter. (We now have articles on individual cricket matches BTW). The question is whether individual verse articles are a good way to organise verifiable NPOV Biblical info, not whether that info is notable. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 01:04, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm voting here, although my feeling at the moment is that a good number is probably a little more than a "<i>vast minority</i>", but still less than a "<i>small minority</i>" (i.e. 50-80). I would be willing to change to a "<i>small minority</i>" if someone will come up with a conservative selection of say 120 verses that they think are notable on their own. I would suggest a good dictionary of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allusion.html" title="Allusion">allusions</a> would be a very good place to start. Then add some of the verses that have been regular inspirations for painters and for classical musicians. On the other hand, any analysis of a large number of Bible verses should be in WikiBible or other Sister project. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 12:48, 30 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Being a biased Christian, I see most, if not all, the verses notable in one way or another. However, I understand that this is simply too much and would create too big of a precedent for other works. There are many other resources online that examine chapters and verses individually and I think it would be worth it to set up a large repository of links to those within a few articles, but back on topic: I do not think anyone should bot there way through the entire Bible, however, if someone has a particular interest in a certain chapter or set of verses, and is willing to devote the time and energy to gather resources to present researched work, then this should be allowed. The argument of notability for a subject like this is too debatable if you ask me, but I am just one voice in the abstain section. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansamurai_7d36.html" title="User:Hansamurai">Hansamurai</a> 15:30, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is a <b>stupid poll</b> - would it help us if we decided what proportion of bands, or websites were notable? If we agree that verses can be included if notable, then there is no way of getting round considering each article created on a verse on its merits - and looking to see whether a case can be made. I prefer articles on books of the Bible, split if they grow too long, but many verses have a significance beyond their cannonical context. How many? I don't know until someone presents the significance of a verse. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 22:24, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Basically, the purpose of this section of the poll is to determine whether SimonP's claim that everyone voting "only notable verses deserve articles" still includes the vast majority of verses, or whether this was an inaccurate claim. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 07:09, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK, but how does it help to settle this dispute? Supposing we agreed that 746 Bible verses were 'notable', would that tell us whether <a href="../../../9/_/_/Matthew_1%7E9.html" title="Matthew 1:9">Matthew 1:9</a> was one of the 746? No. We'd still have to look at the individual article and judge its case on the merits. So, if you and SimonP diagree, fine, but do you need a poll to settle an individual arguement, which in the end will be fairly irrelevant to the operation of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:07, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What should happen to them? Exactly the same thing that happens to anything else. Deleted if there is a consensus on VfD (but I suspect there is not). If short, or overlapping content, then someone go ahead and merge (I'd certainly support chapter merges in most cases)- if they have sufficient NPOV verifiable content, then keep. They should be treated like any other article (the only reason the list <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia%7EBible_verses_existing_a954.html" title="Wikipedia:Bible verses/existing">Wikipedia:Bible verses/existing</a> exists is because you created it).

If a well-written, NPoV, factual, and encyclopedic article can be written about a bible verse, passage, chapter, or book, then I am in favor of letting that article remain.

<p>This 'voting' is going nowhere - and reaching little but the most obvious consensus (i.e. only notable verses are notable). We have had a pseudo-policy attempt through VfD, and now a poll, without a proper idea of what it is about - or whether we need an agreement at all (see further <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a>'s comments at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia_talk%7EBible_verses_34a7.html#Problem_with_this_whole_approach" title="Wikipedia talk:Bible verses">Wikipedia talk:Bible verses#Problem with this whole approach</a>). I move that this poll be closed and archived forthwith, that a proper open discussion may happen, perhaps beginning with 'is there a problem with the current situation' then 'if so, what should be done' - and some attempt at consensus. Btw Polls are evil.</p>

<p>This <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of -Ril-'s is a breach of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. However, I'm happy to withdraw the motion if there is not obvious support in 48 hrs (which I concede looks unlikely} --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 23:54, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine. Withdraw and close. This is preposterous. I'm beginning to think the entire thing should be cancelled as a bad-faith disruptive move on -Ril-'s part. If this nonsense doesn't end soon, it may be necessary to move to some sort of dispute resolution with this. The same pattern shows up in -Ril-'s ongoing inability to work constructively with other wrt the whole Authentic Matthew fiasco. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 03:36, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While -Ril-'s parody of his own vote-vote-vote attitude is indeed absurd, it doesn't seem truly disruptive in any way as it requires no cleanup, so I'd hesitate to label it a violation of that guideline. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 03:38, 2005 August 1 (UTC)</dd>
