<p>I think adding to many points I raised regarding BSF may be difficult to research as the skeptic community appears to have not commented on many of the points I used. I was somewhat amazed MickWest found that Seventh Day Adventist article on the Macht study. I did think of the Seventh Day Adventist as a source but I thought it would be hard to do and would require a considerable drive away from my house. But if anyone wants to roll up their sleeves like MickWest did and somehow find more material I wouldn't mind at all. Now if anyone want to discuss Egyptian medicine a little more they can but I realize this would require more research and people have busy lives but eventually it could be done if someone wants to do the research. Right now I cannot do anymore research either pro BSF or anti BSF as it is time intensive although as I explained to MickWest I think I may look into OT/rats/mice/health issues in the future but it may be a long time although perhaps not.</p>
<p>With that being said, Wikipedia is clear. Minority viewpoints can go into great detail in a minority view article. I went into a small amount of detail regarding Egyptian medicine so people could have some knowledge on the subject in regards to deleterious and ineffective practice to give historical context <b>but I gave some good points too.</b> <b>MickWest gave positive points too about Egyptian medicine.</b> Also, some may think bits of flies and dung are emotional. Yet they appear to have some bad implications according to the medicial literature (I gave two studies in regards to dung use and tetanus). I am not going to argue over and over ad nauseaum my right to go into some detail regarding Egyptian medicine nor defend my factual material. I don't have to. Wikipedia policy prevents me from being censored in a minority view article as long as I do not make unfactual claims. Also, I am merely giving historical context which is absolutely necessary in a foresight article. Case closed. There is no cafeteria approach to Wikipedia policy. I feel if I keep on talking about this I will merely keep saying the same things over and over and more importantly I know Wikiopedia is very clear. Please do not ask me to remove the bad points about Egyptian medicine material again. It is getting old and again Wikipedia policy is clear. I feel this is being discourteous to repeatedly ask me to remove material that I have every right to keep so please do not ever do it again.</p>

<dd>The issue is the contribution the material makes to the article, not the material in itself. Is it relevent? Is it in context? Is the balance of information represented? What is the historical context? What are the underlying issues?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I found the Macht response online, just go here <a href="http://ministrymagazine.org/article.php?id=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://ministrymagazine.org/article.php?id=4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and type in Macht. I thhough the fact that Macht published his article in a religious magazine, and then was soundly discredited in the same magazine was an important part of the the story - giving historical scientific contex: Macht published and was dismissed as unscientific, and nothing more on the subect was heard for fifty years until the original study is dredged up to to support BSF.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the majority of claims here need no such research - the true story of egyptian medicine and cleanliness is available via the links in the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Smith_papyrus_74d9.html" title="Edwin Smith papyrus">Edwin Smith papyrus</a> and other articles like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_medicine.html" title="History of medicine">History of medicine</a> (and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egyptian_medicine_5bcd.html" title="Ancient Egyptian medicine">Ancient Egyptian medicine</a> when I get to it). The claims of vegetarian lion, strangling lions, hearing snakes, nuclear fusion etc are apparent in their speciousness to most observers. I only research the intricacies of "Little Tyke" et al out of habit - the arguments are baseless on much more obvious grounds than the fragility of their evidence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would simply like this article to be a clear description of the title subject, somewhat along the lines of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">Wikipedia:How_to_write_a_great_article</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 04:42, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ken, it is not discourteous to discuss removal of the material. You have every right to keep it in order to provide "great detail" about this perspective. But those who disagree with you about its appropriateness also have every right to remove it in order to improve the article. You simply must get this into your head, sir. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> \</dd>

<dd>Nobody has made the mistake of saying that they want to reduce the amount of detail devoted to minority views. You continue to repeat this argument, but it is quite irrelevant to the issues raised. The question concerns the logical relevance of the material to the thesis (MickWest's recent objection), and whether the material actually conforms to the narrow purpose of this article. It is a reasonable (!) rejoinder to MickWest that illogic does not disqualify the material from inclusion in the article. But his main objection still stands, that it is a discursus on a topic not immediately relevant, which seems to have an argumentative purpose, a persuasive purpose ("describe controversies rather than engage in them"). I agree with him in principle; that to answer this off-topic argument, to examine its assumptions, would engage the reader in a distracting side-argument. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> \</dd>

<dd>Compare, for an unrelated example, the argumentative material concerning the "anthropological" and psychological interpretations of the dietary laws. That section is subject to exactly the same criticism from the opposite standpoint. It is informative, but it is in danger of being distracting. Its function in that context is to point out that not everyone sees the dietary laws as BSF people do. But does it have too much detail in this context? Would the article be better served by redirecting to a fuller description of the various interpretations? — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> \</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not arguing either, for or against the Egyptian material per se. I am arguing on behalf of the community and the project, urging you not camp on the article demanding your rights to push a point of view. You may win the fight, but in the long run you will lose. That would be a great loss; because you obviously will become a valued Wikipedian, if you can just adjust to the culture, here. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 05:31, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Needing NPOV improvements</span></h2>
<p>Given the above discussion on NPOV, I was looking at this current part of the "Special Knowledge" paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Also, some suppporters of BSF do not think a comparison of ancient medicine with the Mosaic code is a good comparison given ancient pharmocological practices, wound treating procedures, and other errant procedures of the Egyptians who were said to be medically advanced for their time. Also, the surgical procedures given the Egyptian Edwin Smith papyrus were quite rational given the time period, but it is also true the Edwin Smith papyrus also had a magical incantations against pestilence and a prescription for a wrinkle remover which claimed to transform an old man into a youth according to the New York Academy of Medicine</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this requires some serious changes, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The comparison with Egyptian medicine is already made in the "Historical Context" sections.</li>
<li>The wound treating procedures in the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Smith_papyrus_74d9.html" title="Edwin Smith papyrus">Edwin Smith papyrus</a> are NOT errant.</li>
<li>The Edwin Smith Papyrus is primarily a copy of an older work listing rational surgical treatments for wounds, fractures and internal injuries (known as the "Book of Wounds"). This book is on the front of the papyrus. The back of the papyrus was later re-used to copy some other remedies. Characterising the Edwin Smith Papyrus by the fact that there are some incantations on the reverse is misleading.</li>
<li>The claim to "transform an old man into a youth" is similar to modern "reduce the signs of aging" claims for wrinkle removing creams, some of which use the same ingredients as the Egyptians (aloe, urea, and other ingredients).</li>
<li>The Bible also contains many "magical" medical procedures (Leviticus 14 is nearly all irrational magic ritual). If the Bible contains magic, what's wrong the Egyptians using magic?</li>
<li>Magic was part of life for the Ancient Egyptians, it would be almost impossible for a doctor to perform his job without appearing to use magic, since the patient would not trust a doctor who did not use magic. This is a historical/cultural context that is important for the understanding of both the Biblical and Egyptian medicine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given this, I'd like to make a few snips and changes to the article, pending comments here. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 16:32, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know that Wikipedia protects minority views and allows great detail. Second, I was quite conservative in my remarks about Coptic/Egyptian medicine. I am going to do more research but I believe, <b>I will cite a book published by British Museum Press which shows how conservative I was being. The book published the British Museum Press is not very flattering to the overall practice of Coptic medicine.</b></p>
<p>Lastly, I personally find the favorite tool of those who wish to suppress evidence for the Bible is the exclusion fallacy. <a href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/exclus.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/exclus.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I see no reason for the exclusion fallacy to be used. <b>For example, I found MickWest's attempted removal of the Little Tyke info as it could have been made up despite the reported pictures and filming and book to be laughable and shows the desperateness of those who wish to remove material that is BSF oriented.</b> Instead of trying to gut/remove the info I brought out (medical historian, science studies) I would suggest that the anti-BSF people roll up their sleeves and try to find info which support their views effectively. I believe that removing my material is unjust (even Mark said I did a lot of research via medical historians, etc) but is the lazy man's way out. Please do more research. Stop trying to take the lazy man's way out. Perhaps, the anti-BSF view cannot be further supported in terms of its effectiveness. I suggest that trying is infinitely better than whining and taking the lazy man's way out by removing my material.</p>

<dd>I look forward to your research results, the subject is fascinating. Which book are you reading? I'd highly recommend John Nunn's book "Ancient Egyptian Medicine"</dd>
<dd>I wonder if you could address any of my numbered points above? If I don't get any comments on them I'll have to proceed based on what I wrote, and I don't want to step on any toes unwarned.</dd>

<dd>I take issue with your statement, <a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">Ken</a>, which read, <i>"...I would suggest that the anti-BSF people roll up their sleeves and try to find info which support their views effectively."</i> The point is that BSF is a fringe view (at best) <i>within Christendom</i>, and not even that in science. What supports the view of those who deny BSF? Well, 2000 years of Church history, to begin with. Raw scientific data for another.</dd>
<dd>BSF is not a <i>science</i> issue...it is a <i>faith</i> issue. You have chosen to believe it, and that's fine. But that doesn't mean it has any more credibility in mainstream science or in the Church. Please don't pretend otherwise, just because you are a believer in BSF.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> is a believer, for example, in the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> doctrine known as <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_atonement.html" title="Limited atonement">Limited atonement</a>. Now, that's a minority view in Christendom, denied by Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Methodists, and many others. But Mark is still entitled to believe it...as long as he doesn't misrepresent it on Wikipedia as <i>the standard</i> for Christendom (which, to my knowledge, he has not). It's a minority view with <i>lots</i> of critics, and we need to view it as such (which doesn't mean it isn't important to Mark). Not to single out my Calvinist comrade, <b>I</b> happen to believe in a particular theory of the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement.html" title="Atonement">atonement</a> called the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement_%28Governmental_view%29_4af4.html" title="Atonement (Governmental view)">governmental view</a>. I recognize that, while I am <i>convinced</i> of its veracity and solid Scriptural basis, it is a minority view. Now, if I try and make it more than it is on Wikipedia, Mark (et al) will <strike>go for the jugular</strike> correct me in a civil fashion. That's the nature of Wikipedia, for good or ill.</dd>
<dd>Now, <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">Mick</a> has <i>every right</i> to edit this or any other page as he sees appropriate, provided he details what he is doing and why and is, of course, respectful throughout. There's nothing unjust about that; it's just what we do here on Wikipedia. You wrote, <i>"Perhaps, the anti-BSF view cannot be further supported in terms of its effectiveness. I suggest that trying is infinitely better than whining and taking the lazy man's way out by removing my material."</i> That's simply not acceptable. The "anti-BSF" view is supported by <i>dozens</i> of articles right here on Wikipedia having to do with both science and faith; the fact that BSF is not mentioned directly is simply because every article can't mention <i>every</i> fringe perspective...whether it's BSF or Scientology or anything else. Editing out material that one thinks is incorrect or inappropriate is <i>not in any way</i> "lazy", as you suggest; it may be the right thing to do.</dd>
<dd>Your tone with Mick (and at times with Mark) has bordered on being disrespectful and unfriendly, and my <i>sincere hope</i> is that you not only alter your tone, but also recongize that this article (and many others) will be cut, added to, edited, and rearranged by many others. This has been the case with many articles I have started (you ought to <i>read</i> what Mark and his Calvinist stalwarts have done to my beautiful pages regarding Wesleyan theology!). Cooperative editing is the Wikipedia way; please accept that, and accept that your articles will not be precisely what <i>you</i> may want them to be.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">expert opinion</span></h2>
<p>Dr. Lise Manniche, author and Assistant Professor of Egyptology at the University of Copenhagen states in her book <i>Ancient Egyptian Herbal</i> (London: British Museum Press, 1989), the following, "In general Coptic medicine is not held in very high esteem." <a href="http://barnettinfo.com/fmsm.barnettinfo.com/next_page.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://barnettinfo.com/fmsm.barnettinfo.com/next_page.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.elin.suite.dk/lise/en/lise_manniche.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elin.suite.dk/lise/en/lise_manniche.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> At the same time, Dr. Manniche apparently does not believe Ancient Egyptian medicine is totally without effectiveness as she writes regarding her book <i>Ancient Egyptian Herbal</i> , "Some recipes may be tried out at home, although some ingredients remain unidentified or are not easily available." <a href="http://www.elin.suite.dk/lise/en/boeger_en_04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elin.suite.dk/lise/en/boeger_en_04.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<dd>Since you yourself say that Egyptian medicine was esteemed in its time, and Manniche's book description reads "<i>The ancient Egyptians were skilled in the use of herbs and spices for medicines, cooking, cosmetics, perfumes, and many other purposes</i>", I'm a little suspicious of this. <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coptic.html" title="Coptic">Coptic</a> usually refers to more recent Egypt, post 200BC, and often Coptic Christians.

<dd>I see the source of this particular misrepresentation is <i>"The Signature of God", by Grant R. Jeffrey, 1998.</i> pp 167, where he also states "<i>almost any serious illness or injury treated by the medical system of pagan Egypt would result in a painful and virtually certain death</i>".

<p><b>to: mickwest, regarding the general low esteem I have of your suspicions</b></p>
<p>You said were suspicious of Little Tyke and said the story could be made up and should be left out despite the reported pictures and filming and a book being written. You don't have very high credibility with me regarding your suspicions.</p>
<p>Second, the quote was in her book about <i>Ancient Egyptian Medicine</i> which discusses among other things the fairly popular use of "fly dung" according to Jeffrey who cites her book. <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_foreknowledge" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Scientific_foreknowledge" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>

This was then deleted. I left that alone for now, since it is so weak it is unlikely to confuse anyone, and I wanted to focus on medicine.</dd>

<dd>I'm sure that Little Tyke existed, there are photos of her. What I question is the veracity of the story (which I have read). It has a prosthletizing tone and attributes many unlikely and almost magical qualities to Little Tyke (such precisely following complex verbal directions during filming). All the other sources are simply quoting or re-phrasing the book, often inaccurately. I think using the primary source is more accurate. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 20:12, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The anti-BSF camp reminds me of the guy who rips down all the buildings in town in order to have the tallest building. Is the anti-BSF position so weak that BSF info is being deleted? I thought Wikipedia clearly states in a minority view piece the minority view can go into "great detail". Perhaps they do not believe that doing more research to substantiate the anti-BSF will be effective or is laziness the problem? Perhaps it is a lack of tolerance? For some reason scientific studies and medical historian info was being deleted. There is a problem here.</p>

<p>TO: Mickwest, Wikipedia policy is clear plus you have an error</p>
<p>You say Little Tyke developed an aversion to meat as a cub? Who said that? Was it developed or was it there from the start? I think you should merely be a reporter and not speculate. The accounts clearly say she never ate meat even once.</p>
<p>Second, here is what Wikipedia states on its opening webpage info in response to common objections about Wikipedia:</p>
<p>....<b>There is a problem with the concept of peer review in general.</b> Many great advances in the social and natural sciences have come by challenging the status quo and, because of that, their contributions were ignored or belittled by their peers. For example, George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics in 2001, had his classic paper (for which he won the Nobel Prize) entitled "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism" rejected by the American Economic Review for being trivial and by the Journal of Political Economy because it conflicted with economic theory. Only after submitting it to a third journal, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, did the breakthrough article become published. <b>Wikipedia allows for discourse where other venues would not.</b></p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive <b>as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia.</b> But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in <b>great detail</b>, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth.</p>
<p>I ask that if you want to make changes it is in accordance with Wikipedia rules. Right now you are in violation of Wikipedia rules.</p>
<p>I insist on all of this information being included.</p>

<p><a name="Questions" id="Questions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Questions</span></h2>
<p>1) Just a few points to ponder: In the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, (a) is it not typically necessary to have more than a single specimen (statistical sample) of whatever is being studied in order to draw conclusions? (b) Do the comments of a single expert validate a conclusion or do not <i>multiple</i>, <i>replicable</i> assessments have to be made?</p>
<p>2) MickWest, Ken is not "quoting the entire book", but merely providing a fair amount of detail...it's very probable that this broader range of detail is necessary because the proposition is one which many would find implausible, therefore to present a more mature statement of the situation, the detail is probably justifiable. In terms of the general debate, it should also be emphasized that what Ken is saying <i>does</i> adhere to Wiki policy that minority views are permitted as in-depth a presentation as possible--perhaps because of implausibility issues (as mentioned above) and the right to establish the a sufficiently comprehensive case.</p>
<p>3) Does anyone else feel the gender of the lion need not be emphasized to the degree that it is? "Lioness"--we'll have to look into it--may be a redudant term. That is, in modern science, do we need to use this word, or is not "lion" sufficient? Likewise for the female pronoun...do we really need to refer to an animal as anything other than "it"? What are Wiki conventions for this? What are science conventions? Let's identify them and stick to them. I do believe that animals have rights and much intrinsic value--but they are not humans. In many instances, possibly this one, to use human pronouns and other rhetorical techniques may create an unjustified anthropomorphization, capable of fallaciously swaying people's views. --<a href="../../../d/p/r/User%7EDpr_d663.html" title="User:Dpr">Dpr</a> 02:10, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) I'd certainly agree that multiple data points are preferable. It's very difficult to deduce anything from a single sample.</dd>
<dd>2) My problem here were more with the quoting of <b>many</b> sources that were simply paraphrasing the book. They were referenced as if they were independent sources of the story of Little Tyke, when they were just repeating the story directly from the book. I have no problem with a high degree of detail - but since it is all from the same source, I ask again - should we just quote the whole book? Rember this is one source from 50 years ago, written in the style of a children's book. Is this a reasonable source?</dd>
<dd>3) The gender of the lion is irrelevent.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 09:29, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've now addressed point 2 above by keeping all the detail in the article, but replacing secondary accounts with the primary source, the Little Tyke book. There's a link to it. Quotes and pharaphrases have been replaced with quotes from the book. I've left in links to the AiG, 101 and FuitNut sites. Since I've not removed any points, I hope this will be acceptable to all parties. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 18:44, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your calm and sympathetic questions, Dpr. I think that your involvement will go far in setting a good example of how to argue these points, and hopefully will help to calm things down. I hope that those interested will answer your questions In the interest of helping with the present dispute, it might be helpful here if the BSF argument is clarified, and for that I need help.</p>
<p>If the answer to this question is so obvious that I'm embarassing myself, I hope you'll forgive me by simply ignoring it.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be demonstrated that the Bible describes an idea that was contradicted, unpopular, regarded as foolish, or was otherwise unheard of to a (practically) universal degree, except by believers in the Bible, who at the time of the earliest conjectured appearing of this knowledge were (practically) alone in the possession of it ...</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Am I missing something?</span></h3>
<p>Have I really missed the point so completely? Did I boil things down so far that I'm left looking like a sap? At risk of making more of a fool of myself, let me explain why I think this question would help.</p>
<p>Above, I tried to boil down the BSF position, so that it only contained two things to be proven: that believers in the Bible possessed knowledge by their belief, that compared to their neighbors at the time should be considered ahead of its time.</p>
<p>Compare this to the opening statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bible scientific foresight is the belief that the Bible contains scientific knowledge that shows an understanding of science beyond that presumed to exist at the time the Bible was written. Advocates of this belief claim this as evidence that the Bible is inspired of God and hence evidence of Biblical inerrancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you see how many things need to be proven? In fact, I'm in a hurry and can't even be complete here, but look at this short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know when the bible was written.</li>
<li>The Bible contains knowledge</li>

<li>the presence of this knowledge in the Bible is indicative that the writer understood what they were writing (as scientific knowledge)</li>
<li>this knowledge is contrary to the understandings relevant to the same issues, presumed to exist at the time that the Bible was written

<p>Does this clarify how important it is, to get a better understanding of the BSF argument? In my opinion, an article written on my boiled-down description provides a structure and a goal, according to which material may be judged relevant or not. Whereas, version of the argument described in the introductory paragraph is practically impossible to write neutrally. In my opinion, this partially accounts for the contradictory perceptions.

<p>The preceding sentence was just removed from the article with the justification, "This is false, Medittereanean cultures generally had a surfeit of labour, that is why they had resources to do things like build pyramids." Something has to be clarified--is the debate over the numerical availability of labor, or the fragility of the labor potential of the individual laborer? Which does the Sabbath protect? The former is a result of population trends and economics (e.g. employment availability). The latter is quite relevant to health; in ancient times...and all the way into the 21st century in less-developed regions...surely the health of the individual was fragile and thus his/her labor potential lacked security. Perhaps the Mosaic achievement was to safeguard this. Thus should some part of the above sentence be returned to the article? --<a href="../../../d/p/r/User%7EDpr_d663.html" title="User:Dpr">Dpr</a> 06:27, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I also have a friend who owns a Christian site that has a lot of web traffic. Perhaps they will list some more BSF material on their sites. Perhaps this will increase the traffic to this article at Wikipedia but I have noticed an uptick in traffic to this article although it is not a large one.

<p>I read this quote at a website regarding the Egyptians:</p>
<p>There was also personal hygiene (Reeves, 18) and disposal of impurities by burying, washing, or burning (Wright 1987, 258-259).</p>

I believe some of the material at that site may be correct. However, I don't think the site gave the whole story in some parts for reasons I don't know and I do believe in fact checking.</p>
<p>Now that site doesn't have a bibliography so it is hard to find the Reeves and Wright citations. Did anyone find those citations or anyone interested in finding those citations?</p>

<dd>Probably <i>Egyptian Medicine</i>, Carole Reeves, 1989, Shire Publications.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure about the other reference, but on a related note you might want to check out "<i>The History of Medicine</i>, by Lois N. Magner, 1992, which reads (page 30):
<dl>
<dd><i>Cleanliness of body was even more valued by the Egyptians than by the Greeks. Rules for the disinfection of dwellings and proper burial of the dead sprang from a combination of hygienic and religious motives. Fear of exacerbating intestinal putrefaction by the ingestion of impure foods and drink encouraged protective food inspection and dietary restrictions.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is interesting because it shows the Mosaic cleanliness and and dietary codes could quite easily have evolved from these Egyptian rules and dietary restrictions.</dd>

<p>MickWest once again altered the historical context and moved the deleterious and ineffective practices of Egyptian medicine near the end of the page.

If revisionism takes place the reader will be prejudiced with a false historical context while reading the most of the material.

<dd>I made several changes, but the one refered to here is the moving of the paragraphs on "the deleterious and ineffective practices of Egyptian medicine" from the <i>historical context</i> to <i>Special knowledge</i>. The <i>historical context</i> is a broad (and concise!) overview of the amount science and technology available pre-Bible. The moved paragrpahs only relate to a very specific point about Egyptians using dung, and some modern studies showing modern dung usage is worse than using modern antibiotics. This was closely related to the other material in the "Health and medicine in the Bible/Special knowledge", so I moved it there. I'd be happy to condense this section into the pertinent arguments (there's a bit of duplication now), but I'll await input from interested parties.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 15:48, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I was working on the BSF article in a out of way area in my personal space at <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a>. It was not ready to be put in view of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a> readers. I am not super active at <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a> so I thought nobody would ever see it. However, an admin at <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a> liked what I was in the midst of creating and he made an article of it without asking me. When I realized there was no attribution as per Wikipedia I put a attribution to Wikipedia. However, later I gutted out MickWest material and other writers and got rid of sources I thought were errant. It was then my work. I then removed the Wikipedia link. However, some of the material was put back and I sent a note to the admin telling him I wanted to remove the Wikipedia content.</p>

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

<p>Yep. Legalese. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 19:38, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Excessive_attribution_requirements" id="Excessive_attribution_requirements"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Excessive attribution requirements</span></h2>
<p>I seems like the amount of "Attribution" required by the BSF folk is a little excessive. Many sentences have been removed because they "lack attibution". Then to justify the rest of the material an excessive amount of inline external links are added (53 at last count). These frequently go to non-authoratative sources such as <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answers_in_Genesis_dfcc.html" title="Answers in Genesis">Answers in Genesis</a>, or sites such as christianwebsite.com. In addition a large number of scientific studies are cited as incidental validation of obscure and often irrelevant points.</p>
<p>As someone else pointed out, there are thousands of scientific articles that could be used as anti-BSF tools. On lions eating straw alone there are probably over 5000 articles available related to the digestivie sytems of carnivores and herbivores. Yet I get challenged because I add a sentence saying "lions cannot digest cellulose" without attribution. Does it need attibution? Suppose I said "lions cannot write" - would I need to support that?</p>
<p>Most recently, several sections from the introduction were removed, including "<i>Critics contend the evidence presented lacks veracity and often involves subjective interpretations of Bible verse.</i>", because there was no attribution. I feel attribution would only be required if a point is disputed. The content here is clear and obvious - this IS what critics contend, nobody disputes it, so why on earth should we need to add some external links to "attribute" it. There are already tens of links in the reference section that cover this and other material. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 19:08, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>to: mickwest</b></p>
<p>I meant to tell you earlier that I have no objection to the lion/cellulose issue anymore.</p>
<p>However, I don't think you say critics say BSF superstitious or doesn't use the scientific method, etc etc etc without attributing. I don't think you should be able to go on a rant especially when you disallow my forensic science comment.</p>
<p>Lastly, you said a United Methodist scholar said BSF has not gained wide acceptance in Christendom but no page number is given. Can you give a page number?. I think that would be like me saying the Bible says this or that but not citing a verse. Also, I do think it is at least fair to ask in the talk pages how the Methodist gentleman arrived at this conclusion.</p>

<dd>I added the sentence about BSF not having much acceptance among Christians...I will get the page number tonight (after a meeting). As for how Thomas Oden arrived at this conclusion, the book is a survey of ecumenical theology from one of the top 2 or 3 most highly respected evangelical theologians on the planet today, and he makes the claim based on consensual classical Christian teaching. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 20:24, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was actually referring to lions and lionesses (since usually the lioness kills for the lion). I looked it up and the original hebrew is indeed 'Ariydatha' (lion) and 'Labiy`' (lioness) so the NASB guys got this one right. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 03:33, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timothy Problem</span></h2>
<p>I added a paragraph on the "legalistic" problems associated with Christians promoting the Levitical Diet in light of 1 Timothy 4:1-5. I though this provided useful context to the nature of the arugment. Ken, (as 128.205.191.85) removed this - although I twice complied with his requests to add an attribution (which I did), and to not say that Macht said the food was bad for you, or even toxic (which I did, but I really though that was the whole point of the Macht thing, but anyway...).</p>
<p>I find it odd that Ken objects to this paragraph when he actually agrees with it, and has written about it over at nwcreation.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mold</span></h2>
<p>I think the Levitical description of toxic mold mitigation is one of the stronger claims of BSF, so I attempted to clean up the paragraph to make it more readable. I appreciate now that the point was being tried to be made that only recently (in the 70s) was toxic mold considered a major health concern, and I can see leaving that information in there - but why do we need four external links - when one wiki link to <a href="../../../t/o/x/Toxic_mold.html" title="Toxic mold">toxic mold</a> has all the information in a much more readable format?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Early claims" problems?</span></h2>
<p>I added a section on the origins of BSF (renamed to "early claims of BSF"). This was deleted with the comment: <i>128.205.191.50 (original research. who said this was an early BSF claim. who said the geocentric model ending started the scientific revolution)?</i> I've restored the material, as I feel it provides useful background and context to both the origins and the claims of BSF.</p>

<li>By "this", do you mean the Morris material? It seems self-apparent that this was an early claim.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_revolution.html" title="Scientific revolution">scientific revolution</a> is somewhat amorphous, several authorities vary, some date it back to the copernican revolution, some later - I'd be happy to change the wording of the paragraph, perhaps you have some suggestions?</li>

<p>The core of the introduction is the simple statement, that the issue of BSF only surfaced, after the division of science and theology, which is a well documented historical phenomenon. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 20:01, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Did BSF only suface then?</b></dd>
<dd>I make no claims as to when BSF surfaced. I'm giving background, and an early dated example.</dd>
<dd><b>Is the division of theology and science a well documented phenomenon?</b></dd>
<dd>Yes</dd>
<dd><b>Did the scientific revolution happen after geocentralism was largely abandoned?</b></dd>
<dd>Yes, although see <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_revolution.html" title="Scientific revolution">scientific revolution</a> for more details.</dd>
<dd><b>Was geocentrism a dogma of the church or the Roman Catholic Church?</b></dd>
<dd>I'd imagine it was of both, since it was around the time of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a></dd>
<dd><b>Where are the attributions?</b></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia does no seem to do attributions to generally acceppted facts. See <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> for example, no "attributions" of any of the claims there, should we delete it all of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>?</dd>
<dd><b>Also, please make it less POV.</b></dd>
<dd>How is it POV? It simply describes the historical context and early examples (Morris) of BSF.</dd>

<p>I revised earlier comments.</p>
<p>Now it reads:</p>
<p>MickWest wrote:</p>
<p>"The source of many of the modern idea in BSF is the book "Science and the Bible", 1951, Henry Madison Morris."</p>
<p>My reply:</p>
<p>Is this true? Where is the attribution as per Wikipedia policy? I would like an attribition as per Wikipedia policy or see many Morris BSF examples copied from his book and then show many footnotes/citations to Morris's book which got their BSF ideas from Morris's book.</p>

<dd>Is this true? Yes, do you dispute it? Have you read the book? Let me give you the contents of chapter 1:</dd>
<dd><i>1. Science and the Bible: Astronomy. Geophysics. Hydrology. Biology. The basic laws of science. Matter and energy. The tri-universe. The question of miracles. Jonah's Whale. The long Day. Conclusion.</i></dd>
<dd>Does that sound familiar?</dd>
<dd>My point is: Book published 1951, book contains many BSF claims, book is early example of BSF.</dd>
<dd>How should I phrase this?</dd>
<dd>Regarding attribution - unless a specific point is contentious, then it does not need attribution - see just about any other article for examples.</dd>

<li>I get on the internet for 5 minutes, and break my wiki-break- why, oh, why did I come here? Stupidity, I suppose. The underlying problem to me, <a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">ken</a>, has less to do with <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> and more to do with your refusal to relinquish ownership of this article. Every little edit- is it attributed? is it giving respect to a minority view? do I agree with it? is it the right colour? Start learning to let little things go and work toward compromise- and for future reference, compromise is not defined as "the version the ken likes".--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/User_talk%7EScimitar_c843.html" title="User talk:Scimitar"><sup>parley</sup></a> 22:31, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with the "let it go" comment is that it is a double edged sword. The anti-BSF people should just "let go" and let any BSF person break Wikipedia rules. Does that sound reasonable? I don't think it is reasonable. I see the "Let it go" comment as a "red herring". Now if MickWest wants to support his claim the church's dogma was ever geocentrism he can certainly try. I don't even think he can do it for the Roman Catholic Church. Why the silence from MickWest in this matter? Is it because he winged it?</p>

<dd>Ken, I've a suggestion: I'm willing to compromise, given the sentence:

<p>I see no problem with that statement as long as you attribute it as per Wikipedia rules. You haven't even shown that one of the widely held ideas of BSF comes from Morris yet via a atrribute or footnotes/citations to Morris's book from many sources. First sox, then shoes.

<p>I think it's fair to say you can find each of the actual claims in many of your pro-BSF references. Shall we just quote them all in one long paragraph?</p>
<p>I'd be very interested to find the original source of these or any other BSF ideas. This is the earliest list I can find, but perhaps some ideas are based on earlier work. Also there are many newer ideas - where did they come from? I image Morris himself added several, as he's been active since then. Do you have any references that might help track down the origins of these ideas? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 23:58, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Harvey_b040.html" title="William Harvey">William Harvey</a> was an early proponent of BSF, and the source of one of Morris's ideas. Harvey discovered the circulation of blood, publishing <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exercitatio_Anatomica_de_Motu_Cordis_et_Sanguinis_in_Animalibus_3072.html" title="Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus">De mortu cordis</a> in 1628. "He supported this claim in <i>On Generation</i> by stating "the life, therefore, resides in the blood (as we are informed in our sacred writing)," referring to an Old Testement passage (Leviticus 17:11 and 14)" - (source: <i>The History of Science and Religion in the Western Tradition</i>, Gary B. Ferngren, page 470). That's a definite source of that particular BSF idea - the guy who discovered it. I wonder how many other scientists also quickly reconciled their discoveries with Bible verse. That could be the source of a large number of the ideas that found their way to Morris.. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 01:06, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The interpretation of passages of Job as showing Copernican motion was first posited by Spanish Thelogain Diego de Zuñiga (1536-97) (ibid, p337) <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 01:12, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The primary origins of BSF is something that may require a lot of hard work to accomplish and ultimately it may be original research now that I think about Wikipedia policy more. Wikipedia is meant to be a tertiary source and so even if your original research was valid it cannot be in Wikipedia given its present rules.</p>

The underlying problem is, that somebody is very confused about the attribution policy. The need for attribution stops for simple facts which are the consensus of the field. Nobody has to find attributions for 2+2=4 in mathematics article nor is he required to proof it in the article (more to the contrary). I must assume, that these question for attributions are just tactical to obstruct making the article NPOV. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 09:03, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. Much of the article could be subjected to arbitary requirements for attribution. For example, Ken, I think I'm going to have to delete the sections on Little Tyke, Indoor Air Pollution and all the sections on health, because there are no citations to show that anyone considered them to be BSF, hence they are original research, so when the article is de-protected, we should delete them. Also the section "Objection to the common knowledge argument" cites a lot of studies, but none of them actually claim to be anything to do with BSF, and none of them mention the "common knowledge argument", so unless you can provide some attributed claim showing they are related to BSF, then I'm afraid we are going to have to delete them when the article is de-protected. All this original research cannot be alowed to continue!</dd>
<dd>Perhaps we need to look at other Wikipedia articles, and see what the general level of attribution and pure tertiary nature actually is in Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>I believe you want to say how and through whom BSF <b>primarily</b> developed but the problem is no scholars appear to have written about this matter. Thus, anything you probably write about it will be original research/unverifiable or could be speculation unless you do the research on this matter. I think you will have to resign yourself to this matter but I could be wrong. If you want to use library resources and/or do many internet searches in order to effectively attribute, I have no problem with this. Perhaps, you will find something. But in the meantime your hands are tied from writing about this particular matter unless Wikipedia changes their rules.</p>
<p>Now if other Wikipedia articles have broken Wikipedia rules that is very regrettable and I am sad to hear about this matter. However, that doesn't mean you can do it in this article. Now if you can find Wikipedia saying rule breaking in one or more Wikipedia articles abrogates you of your responsibility to follow the rules in this article, then fine. But I don't believe you can. In short, it appears your hands are still tied regarding what you want to write but cannot due to Wikipedia rules.</p>
<p>Here is what Wikipedia states:</p>
<p>For an encyclopedia, sources should be unimpeachable. An encyclopedia is not primary source material. Its authors do not conduct interviews nor perform original research.</p>

<p>I have Lancet, Dr. Macht, Biblical Archaeological Review, medical historians, other medical journals, science studies, etc. etc. to support BSF.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand, to support the anti-BSF position primarily have Mr. Till, a ex Church of God fundamentalist preacher with a Masters in English; IBSS who only provides a bibliography for one of their articles; Skeptics Annotated Bible which if I am not mistaken is not too often, if ever, cited by academia; Mary Douglass; and Dennis McKinsey, a man I could find not easily find a bio on.</p>

I think it is better than this article when it comes to attribution. It even footnotes the most scholarly opposition to BSF which is Mary Douglass with a Harvard link. It is also very neat and tidy. It also goes more in depth. Perhaps we should cut and paste it and put it at Wikipedia and then add KMH03's source until adequate other sources are found to support the anti-BSF position (I doubt this will happen, but I am not adverse to it being attempted).</p>

<p>I found some interesting material that partially clarifies the Egyptian origin of Hebrew medical knowledge, which is very important in establishing if it's BSF or not.</p>
<p>from Medicine in the days of the pharaohs, pp185-186, Bruno Halioua, Bernard Ziskind (2002) (translated by M.B. DeBevoise 2005) .</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The prolonged stay of the Hebrews in Egypt during the late second millennium B.C. left its mark not only on their daily way of life and their vocabulary but also on their medicine. There are many points of similarity between the five Mosaic books of the Pentateuch and the pharaonic medical papyri, particularly with regard to obstetric techniques, circumcision, and the prevention of epidemics. Thus, for example, Exodus 1:15-16 mentions Egyptian women giving birth in a squatting position with the feet placed on two bricks: "Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives ... 'when you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birthstool.'"</i></dd>
<dd><i>The Pentateuch is generally thought to have been written in the eighth and ninth centuries B.C., but its origins may in fact go back to the period of Hebrew captivity in Egypt. It is at least arguable that the Hebrews had a comprehensive knowledge of Egyptian medical practice, even if Egypt was not one of the principal sources—some scholars have claimed the principal source—of the books of wisdom of Israel. Certainly remarkable coincidences can be observed in the domain of medicine, not least with regard to circumcision and mortuary customs. Thus it is said in the Bible that Zipporah, the wife of Moses, "cut off her son's foreskin" (Exodus 4:25). Jacob himself was embalmed (Genesis 50:2-3), and the mourning lasted for seventy days, which is to say thirty days longer than the time required for the natron to dry out the body ("forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming").</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>How should we best incorporate it?</p>

<p>A Christian website which got 90,000 visitors a month and nearly a million hits a month in 2004 is putting the <a href="../../../c/r/e/CreationWiki_fb88.html" title="CreationWiki">CreationWiki</a> BSF article at <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Bible_scientific_foreknowledge" class="external free" title="http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Bible_scientific_foreknowledge" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwcreation.net/wiki/index.php?title=Bible_scientific_foreknowledge</a> at 4 locations on their website and probably doing it today.</p>

<p>You, on the other hand, to support the anti-BSF position primarily have Mr. Till, a ex Church of God fundamentalist preacher with a Masters in English; IBSS who only provides a bibliography for one of their articles; Skeptics Annotated Bible which if I am not mistaken is not too often, if ever, cited by academia; Mary Douglass; and Dennis McKinsey, a man I could find not easily find a bio on.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../k/d/b/User%7EKdbuffalo_898d.html" title="User:Kdbuffalo">Ken</a> -- I think that a key problem may stem from a misunderstanding on your part as to how Wikipedia functions.</dd>
<dd>First, you do a great deal of research, and that's good. But not everything in an article needs to be "sourced", particularly if it's a commonly accepted "mainstream" idea (i.e., the Law of Gravity...one wouldn't need to reference Newton when mentioning this Law). I think your demands are a bit high, running counter to Wikipedia practice.</dd>
<dd>Second, <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">Mick</a> (et al) have as much right as you to edit this (or any article) as he or they see fit. If he doesn't source everything, that's not necessarily wrong or bad. Every time you remove his edits for being unsourced, you violate the "spirit" of Wikipedia, which is cooperation above almost everything else. Remember, the bottom of every edit page contains the following: <i>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</i> When you create or edit a page, others <i>will</i> make edits you don't like. Wikipedians believe that this cooperative spirit will result in generally excellent articles. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Duncharris</a> was correct in asking you to achieve and abide by consensus. You have chosen to write about a topic that has very little support in both science and Christendom...you need to expect the changes. Remember that what you call the "anti-BSF position" could also be called "mainstream science" or "most Christians" or "the bulk of the Christian theological consensus". That <i>will</i> affect editing (as it should).</dd>
<dd>Finally, please examine some of the articles <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">Mick</a> listed earlier. They are fine articles. They are sourced, but not overly so. They also attempt to be concise, and not exhaust the subject. In particular, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presuppositional_apologetics.html" title="Presuppositional apologetics">Presuppositional apologetics</a> was written largely by a colleague (<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a>) with whom I have had disagreements (he is a <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinist.html" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a>; I <strike>believe in Jesus Christ</strike> am an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arminian.html" title="Arminian">Arminian</a>), and, while I don't agree with much of the topic, it's a well written piece. Likewise <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Standard_Version_3dd6.html" title="Revised Standard Version">Revised Standard Version</a> (which I also commend to you as one of the best 2 or 3 English translations of the Bible...but that's another story).</dd>
<dd>I say all this to you because I believe that if an arbiter is called in, <b>you</b> may be the one who "gets in trouble" and is found in violation. Please prayerfully review these suggestions. Peace...<a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 21:55, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You wrote:</p>
<p>"You have chosen to write about a topic that has very little support in both science and Christendom...you need to expect the changes."</p>
<p>I don't really believe you read the articles enough to comment on it. You restored my material so it appeared two times in the essay and you said it was from authoritative sources so it would help make the article more NPOV. Well those were BSF sources and it supported the BSF position. Obviously, I didn't want to delete them.</p>
<p>Secondly, I do understand Wikipedia. The rules are posted to show how articles should be done.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Wikipedia says minority view articles give the right of the minority view to go into great detail and there is no limit to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I have no problem with cooperation <b>within</b> the rules.</p>

<dd>Ken, how can we believe you will abide by Wikipedia policy when you compare the very best wikipedia articles to the <b>National Enquirer</b>, calling them articles "<b>where unscholarly irrational exhuberance runs amok with non-attribution gay abandon</b>". Clearly you have no regard for Wikipedia, and so your insistance on your own interpretation of a rule cannot be given any weight.</dd>
<dd>I would like to assume good faith on your part, but to do this I must see some evidence of compromise. Some constructive suggestion somewhere, not a meaningless appeal to authority, but something regarding some specific material. Perhaps you could start by proposing a paragraph on early evidence of BSF beliefs to replace the section you deleted? <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Harvey_b040.html" title="William Harvey">William Harvey</a> is a good starting place. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickWest_cad0.html" title="User:MickWest">MickWest</a> 01:13, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found your last post rather inaccurate.</p>
<p>Here is what I exactly said:</p>
<p>"I am not interested in viewing <b>your</b> "best Wikipedia articles" where unscholarly irrational exhuberance runs amok with non-attribution gay abandon. If I want to read such material, I can go to the super market and read the National Enquirer."</p>
<p>In short, <b>your</b> best Wikipedia articles are not necessarily the true best Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>And again, sticking to Wikipedia rules will produce an exemplary Wikipedia BSF article. So far nobody has stated why this is not so and I believe they never will. I think Wikipedia knows how good Wikipedia articles are written!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">General remark on NPOV, attribution policy and how to proceed</span></h2>
<p><b>Regarding NPOV</b>: Our <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy doesn't mean, that the article should look like a battle between different POVs. The primary ideal of NPOV, is that the article distances itself from the subject and describes it in a neutral way. Put it under the microscope so to say. This won't work unfortunately for very disputed areas, but should still be our guideline. The worst options is always to have two entirely unrelated parts in the article, each exposing one POV.</p>
<p><b>Regarding attribution</b>: Mostly all is said above. Please don't try to use attribution policy to effectively claim ownership of an article.</p>
<p><b>Regarding level of detail</b>: It is in fact contrary to the principle of an encyclopedia to add more and more areas and expose all arguments pro and contra regarding them. Besides one or two of claims, obviously those which got the most attention, the other claims should be just a list without going into details.</p>
