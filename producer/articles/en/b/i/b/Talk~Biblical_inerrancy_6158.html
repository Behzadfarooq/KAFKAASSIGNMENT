<p>Several paragraphs of Dei Verbum were included to get the point across as to the PRECISE position of the Catholic Church on the Bible. Your edit makes it appear that the Church holds a position other than the precise position. Maybe it can be paraphrased several years from now, but until then, it should be left there until Catholics understand the official position of the Church so they do not contribute to Biblical inerrant nonsense. If you object to its relevance at this time, please note that about one in six people in the world are Catholic. I do not mean to justify unnecessary additions (the complete document is on the Vatican's website, and I understand your concern about primary sources), but I think you get the point. <a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJBogdan_c268.html" title="User:JBogdan">JBogdan</a> 01:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but quoting that much from a primary source IS against wikipedia policy. There is no argument there. I understand your concern about giving due weight to the majority Christian view (the Catholic POV), and that is a valid concern. However, the reason you stated for including it, to education Catholics about official policy, and calling Biblical inerrancy nonsense is clearly POV. Wikipedia's job is not to take sides and judge POV, and wikipedia's job is not to inform Catholics on Catholic doctrine. You may want to review some key policy points including <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Please, either select a more concise selection of your quote, cut it down by using ellipses to eliminating less important sentences, or better yet, paraphrase and summarize the content in an encyclopedic manner. Do you honestly think a huge quote from a primary souce is better for an encyclopedia than simply describing the position? Please consider <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_article_2aff.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect article">Wikipedia:The perfect article</a> and note that none of them suggestion quoting primary sources to this extent. I have removed the quote again. The full text is already included this talk page, above.

________________________</p>
<p>Again ... the discussion seems to be misplaced! Does Biblical Literalism sufficiently overlap with what is known as Literal Inerrancy to warrant merger into the same discussion. Of couse they do! Again, to assist, nobody has to resolve whether or not literal inerrancy is objective truth, nor does anyone have to accurately and with anguish of perfection, upon pains of torture and death by dissolving eyeballs and skin sloughed off, detail every single 'perspective' on this question. That can and should be done, with brevity and clarity in mind, IN THE MERGED SECTION ITSELF.</p>
<p>Now ... for a great exmaple if one looks at the passages of Isaiah that pertain to the prophecies of the Moshiach (Messiah) one runs into (at least by all appearances anyway) immediate problems with LITERAL inerrancy, for YESHUA did not embrace the ascetical life of honey and curds (so as to tell good from bad) but was to some (not I) a glutton and a drunkard, as discussed in the later and subsequent gospel accounts. And this no doubt called upon many to deeply ponder what Isaiah meant--for John the Baptist himself, after declaring "behold the lamb of God ...," sent word to Messiah, asking, "are you the one or are we to expect another"? He--John the Baptizer--expected one thing from the prophecies but was seeing something of a twist to those prophecies before his very eyes and, in turn, this led to his own crisis of faith while in prison. This is important for even the Jewish people today as yesterday deny and reject Yeshua as Moshiach because of what they believe to be an incomplete or (depending on scholar or writer or partisan)even total failure to meet Isaiah's prophecies. Thus ... literal inerrancy, for most of Judaica, precludes Messiah's having yet arrived! God Himself will absolutely resolve those questions for all minds, He has already done so for many hearts. We do not have to resolve who is right. God does that.</p>
<p>My point, then, is we can split infinitives until gnats become invisible specks to strained eyes, and for all wisdom and truth we all should, I suppose, but DOING SO is not relevant to whether or not the topics are PROPERLY MERGED. That's the question--not what do Catholics believe or what do Protestant's believe or what do atheists believe?</p>
<p>If and when anyone speaks of Biblical Literalism they necessarily speak of what many know as Literal Inerrancy or its progeny. MERGE THEM and stay on task at defining these things carefully. Why put six packs of beer with toothpaste? __________________________________</p>

<p>While the paragraph may need work, deleting it is not the way to do this.

<p>"In its most stringent form, biblical inerrancy holds that the Bible is literally true in every word" Who invented this? Biblcial inerrency in it's purest form doesn't deal at all with the application of scriptures.. only to say that it's pure untainted word of God originally with no error. There's still room for analogies and parables (fireballs coming out of God's nostrals) (David and bathseeba being described as a Rich man stealing sheep). No ones's gonna argue that Nathan thought bathsheeba was a sheep.

<dd>I agree those concepts are theologically important, and I'm glad to see them in the article.

<p>Ok ya'll.. I'm not sure what we're going to do with this section. First things first. This article IS NOT titled "the BIBLE" so I suggest we start slimming down the paragraphs to start including ONLY materials related to the topic of inerrency. Also, why do we need two Catholic positions? OK, so don't get offended if your religion's section gets slimmed down to remove all the doctrine and what not that's cited better in that religious own article. Let's keep on topic yes?

<p>The section on the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy contains this sentence: "Of course, knowing the intent of the original authors is impossible." Is this part of the Chicago Statement, or is this a POV sentence in response to the Statement? Does this sentence really belong in a paragraph that just purports to describe the Chicago Statement? Sentences that begin "Of course" always throw up a red flag for me. 209.203.91.195Glenn R. Wichman</p>

<p>From the article</p>
<p>"Among those who subscribe to infallibility is the belief that though the minute details may contain errors, but maintain what the scriptures say regarding spiritual issues is ultimately useful and true. Inerrancy goes one step further and includes that the scientific, geographic, and historic details and of the original text is ultimately true and real."</p>
<p>Ok... so read the "Basis of Belief" and "How Inerrancy is Established" and tell me with a straight face that the article isn't horribly biased. Basically, what's been done is someone has posted the religious equivalent of a "the moon landing was faked"-type conspiracy theory, written supporting arguments and not bothered to mention the GLARING flaws in such a theory.</p>
<p>Merely stating that some Christians don't believe in inerrancy isn't enough. Biblical Inerrancy isn't a religious or moral proposition; it's a perfectly testable, objective assertion. If we accept the definition of Biblical Inerrancy (as distinct from Biblical Infallibility) as the belief that all scientific, histocial details in the Bible are factually true, then we must mention where the Bible diverges from history and blatantly contradicts both itself and the natural world.

<dd>I agree that something needs to be done with "How Biblical Inerrancy is Established": because, of course, it <i>isn't</i> "established" in this fashion! It's an entirely faith-based position, the belief that the Bible <i>should</i> be inerrant. It isn't a conclusion reached from studying the evidence, nor is it a belief that can be <i>confirmed</i> by studying the evidence. But inerrantists claim otherwise, and I suppose we need to note this somehow.</dd>

<dd>Horribly POV? This isn't a debate forum. This is the section where the Christian doctrine of biblical inerrency is defined. The section on establishment discusses how the theologians establish it. It's not about OUR pov. It's about the POV of those notable, citeable experts on the subject.
<dl>
<dd>But this <i>isn't</i> how they establish it! It's a faith-based and entirely unscholarly position (that <i>denies</i> actual scholarship), and I don't see that we have a duty to <i>pretend</i> otherwise (as the apologists themselves often do). We need some caveats in here. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 14:54, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I challenge you to ignore your feelings at the moment and examine the sources. Like it or not, inerrecy is what is currently taught at conservative institutions and seminaries. This article is NOT arguing that they are right. This article's purpose is only to document (accurately) what the teaching is and whois teaching it.

<dd>I disagree, it's very clear. We are NOT to try to push our own POV. We are not to try to present all sorts of arguments to demonstrate our pro or con arguments. We present the reliable notable citableinfor,mation on the subject. If the subject is a Christian doctrine we don't need to include if any of us agree or disagree. Like saying Hitler is evil or bannanas taste good.. it doesn't belong here. The theology is currently accurately presented. If you don't agree with the theology, that's fine.. from reading this article you will have a better reason to not believe. And if you do believeyou'll havea better understanding of where the belief came from. NPOV article are good like that. You can read it, it presents the view accurately and you can still see clearly why you would not (or would) agree with the view.

<dd>Uhm No dude. Did you even read the section? If you read the section perhaps you will not be so upset. The doctrine of inerrency is established. The doctrine exists. The doctrin has existed for a long time and the doctrine will continue to exist. How can that be construed as POV. The sectiondoes not say this doctrine is true and if you don't believe it you're stupid. it says, this is how it was established.. this is how they justify it.

<dd>The heading refers to "Biblical inerrancy", not the "doctrine" of Biblical inerrancy. The POV implication is that the Bible IS inerrant. The paragraph then goes on to list tests which, <i>if true</i>, might have established that the Bible WAS inerrant: it doesn't mention that the Bible fails the tests listed (according to actual scholars). But the doctrine <i>originates</i> in a belief not mentioned in this paragraph (though mentioned elsewhere in the article): <b>"The theological basis of the belief, in its simplest form, is that as God is perfect, the Bible, as the Word of God, must also be perfect, thus, free from error"</b> (i.e. a faith-based position). THIS is how the doctrine was "established". It has nothing to do with "historical accuracy" or "fulfilled prophecies" or whatever. The rest is <i>apologetics</i> (i.e. inventing excuses for the Bible's errors, which are rejected by non-inerrantists): which did not "establish" the doctrine in any meaningful sense. So why does this paragraph claim otherwise? At best, this refers to strategies for <i>defending</i> the doctrine: not for "establishing" it. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 16:38, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've edited the definition using proper citattion to adress your issues. We are now discussion the doctrine of "Biblical Inerrency" as taught by conservatice universities. So now we don't need to worry about why people believe things, lets stick to what the theory is and keep all discussion related to what is and what isn't Biblical inerrency as defined by reputable citable experts on the matter. Furthermore, Lets agree not even discuss IF the Bible is or isn't inerrent. The discussion isn't the Bible, it's the doctrine of inerrency. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 18:18, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BTW, this is from the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">NPOV policy</a> page:</p>
<p>"<b>Attributing and substantiating biased statements</b> Sometimes, a potentially biased statement can be reframed into an NPOV statement by <i>attributing</i> or <i>substantiating</i> it.</p>
<p>For instance, "John Doe is the best baseball player" is, by itself, merely an expression of opinion. One way to make it suitable for Wikipedia is to change it into a statement about someone whose opinion it is: "John Doe's baseball skills have been praised by baseball insiders such as Al Kaline and Joe Torre," as long as those statements are correct and can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a>. The goal here is to <i>attribute</i> the opinion to some subject-matter expert, rather than to merely state it as true.</p>
<p>A different approach is to <i>substantiate</i> the statement, by giving factual details that back it up: "John Doe had the highest batting average in the major leagues from 2003 through 2006." Instead of using the vague word "best," this statement spells out a particular way in which Doe excels.</p>
<p>There is a temptation to rephrase biased or opinion statements with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>: "Many people think John Doe is the best baseball player." But statements of this form are subject to obvious attacks: "Yes, many people think so, but only ignorant people"; and "Just how many is 'many'? I think it's only 'a few' who think that!" By <i>attributing</i> the claim to a known authority, or <i>substantiating</i> the facts behind it, you can avoid these problems."</p>
<p>So, this appears to be suggesting that a POV that is factually incorrect CAN be addressed by substantiating the factual claims against it: this would not violate the NPOV policy. But do we really want to go there? I think we can all see what would happen... --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 15:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, adding your opinion (that commonly taught proofs are simply strategies for promulgation) would not be appropriate. The fact that the teachings which were cited are established teachings on the matter is not in dispute if you examine the source.

<dd>There are no commonly-taught "proofs", because it is only a matter of opinion that these are "proofs" of anything: the word "proof" has a very specific meaning, and apologetics don't qualify. My point is that the doctrine is "established" only in the minds of those who have chosen to believe it: in that sense, it's no more "esatablished" than geocentrism or flat-Earthism. It is very misleading to use the word "established" in this fashion. I could just as easily write an article entitled "How Flat-Earthism is Established" and claim that advocates of this doctrine base their claim on "astrophysics", "observations from space" and so forth. Do you see why this claim would be problematic, even if there is evidence that flat-Earthers <i>believe</i> that such evidence supports their position? More detachment is required.
<dl>
<dd>'m not sure why you're picking at this point too but "Established" in this instance means on which grounds it's founded. To establish a point = to come to a conclusion regarding that point. If the conservatives came to that point why do you care so much which point they've established among themselves? --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 21:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I have no doubt that "prominent conservative Bible seminaries do in fact teach inerrancy" within the "Bible Belt" of the southern states of the USA. And I have no objection to this being stated. But it's still a minority position even among Christians, and rejected almost unanimously by <i>scholars</i> all over the world (not just <i>Biblical</i> scholars, as experts in many areas of science and history reject those parts of the Bible which contradict what they know in their fields of expertise). Which again makes the use of the word "established" problematic: it is undoubtedly the <i>established</i> scholarly consensus that the Bible is errant, even if some disagree. And Dallas Theological Seminary is hardly an example of a "scholarly" source, for the very reason that your link demonstrates: true scholarship involves drawing conclusions from evidence, it doesn't involve "doctrinal statements" of beliefs imposed by fiat. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 19:38, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Based upon this conversation, I reviewed the article and made a few edits. The article seems disjointed to me. The statements of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestants, Evangelicals (which is Protestant and should be one section), etc. has little applicability to the topic. These sections need to be more clearly tied to the topic; do they believe in Biblical inerrancy or not. From what is written, I can't tell. Further, throughout the article text are short, opposing statements. I think that there needs to be definite case made for why some disagree with this topic within Christianity at large and from the secular arena as well. As a LDS I have grown comfortable with the concept that you must have the "con" side in an article to be NPOV. For example, one can't simply say LDS are Christians without giving the full litany of churches and individuals who argue against such a statement. It may be tiresome, but it is part of having a balanced article. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:54, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey man, keep your POV off the article. If you disagree with what current scholars at Christian conservative universtities and seminaries teach that's fine. Don't go messing up the page that accurately descibes what their position is thought. If they teach a doctrine, and the doctrine is accurately quoted.

<dd>Home Computer, qualifiers are necessary in this article because it attempts to state "truths", which WIKI can not appear to support or deny. We just report with statements that demonstrate they are attributed to supporters of this position. Robert, I think using allegedly, claims, etc provide a negative connotation and tone that is not appropriate. Qualifiers are necessary, but we should choose words that do not taint the tone; seek objectivity.

<p>[edit conflict]:As a number of users have stated above, the use of the word "established" is controversial. I do not believe there is any consensus to keep the word "established", so we all should work together to find a more apt title that we can all agree upon. I also agree that the NPOV policy is being stretched here. I think the most relevent section of the policy is "<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Attributing_and_substantiating_biased_statements" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Attributing and substantiating biased statements</a>". It is POV to say "The bible is historically accurate". We need to attribute that claim, and specifically say that it is a claim/belief/position, and not a fact. I've worked on this issue here in this article in the past because it used to be worse, but I still think these are things we need to look out for. And as I have mentioned before, there needs to be a criticism section added, or else we may face having to insert the mainstream POV to counter the inerrancy POV in each section. The point of the NPOV policy is not "write an article favorable to the POV being discussed" but instead to include all relevent POVs (without giving undue weight to minority views) in regards to the topic in question. That means that the view of mainstream scholarship needs to be included, even if it IS critical of the inerrancy POV. As discussed in the past, perhaps the best place for this sort of thing is in its own criticism section, however, I personally have not had the motivation, resources, nor time to do that myself. Anyway, I'm glad there seems to be more interest in this article.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 22:08, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't this is the appropriate place for a discussion on whether or not the Bible is truthful, which is a likely result of us including information on why people might disagree with the topic of inerrency so there would have to be somethng in place to direct the editing.. like proper categorization that we all agreed on.</dd>
</dl>
<p>First and foremost, for this to be a good article, the article must accurately present what the concept is (biblical inerrency). Included in that I've attempted to demonstrate who believes it and why with whatever they use for it. I've not given my own opinion and I've not offended anyone. If they want to take offense to what is taught in conservative Christian circles.. I can't help that, not my fault.&#160;:) But I've been true to what is taught without flavor or persuasiveness. Now if we can move forward maintaining that, awesome. If we can't the most important thing on my agenda as far as trying to keep a clean article is concerned is accurately presenting what the doctrine is. Like as what's stated before, you don't need to go on the Hitler article and start arguing that Hitler was evil. Just present the facts, let them speak for themselve. You don't say Hitler taught that the Jew were alledgedly evil. WE ALL KNOW that Hitler taught that. Most of us know that Hitler was evil. We don't need to make sure our opinion is heard, the fact speak for themselves. So lets all agreee to present the fact, quoted, intact, verifiable, etc. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 22:21, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...And I have already pointed out that I <i>have no problem</i> in conveying to the reader that this is what inerrantist sources claim. Indeed, I don't have a problem in pointing out that this is what Giesler and Nix claim. But that doesn't mean that inerrancy has been "established". And we must avoid any implication that the Bible IS "historically accurate", that it DOES contain "fulfilled prophecies", and so forth: we must make it clear that these are inerrantist <i>claims</i>. Qualifiers of some sort, or a very clear limiting of the context of such controversial statements, is needed.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As I'm obviously not the only one who objects to "established", I'll revert that. And I'm open to suggestions regarding "neutral-tone" qualifiers. I'll replace "teach" with "claim", because "claim" is more neutral and "teach" implies the imparting of facts: but I'll avoid "alleged", and a single qualifier relating to everything claimed by Giesler and Nix may be sufficient. And claiming that Giesler and Nix is "the" text on the subject is a little overblown. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 23:37, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for making another section, but I want everyone to read this:</p>
<p><br />
Wikipedia is not a place to post someone's unchallenged beliefs if those beliefs are provably wrong (or at least extremely questionable), even if those beliefs are widely held. As an analogy, look at the page on the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations_8812.html" title="Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations">Apollo Moon Landing hoax accusations</a>--there is a point by point refutation of each of the claims made by Hoax proponents. What we're asking for here is even more concrete and irrefutable than the counterpoints outlined in that article--the KJV Bible (and most other versions) contradicts itself, and the fact that some people believe that it doesn't contradict itself does not change the fact that it very clearly does (especially between the New Testement gospels--in several cases, descriptions of the same event are CLEARLY incompatible.) As another example, you could also look at the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Cold_3fb1.html" title="Common Cold">Common Cold</a>--do we simply state that "many people believe that cold weather directly causes the common cold" and leave it at that? No, this is a scientifically debunked assertion so we explain why this belief is, for the most part, completely unfounded. Likewise, there is HUGE precedent here to include objections to inerrancy--just look at the absolutely MASSIVE number of articles that have sections like "objects to" or "criticism of" or "controversy." Every single debatable concept I've seen on wikipedia has included facts and points of view of both pros and antis. <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">Abortion</a> mentions both negative and positive effects. <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> includes a "Criticism of" section.</p>
<p>The Earth isn't flat, and this is reflected in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_Healing_f064.html" title="Faith Healing">Faith Healing</a> doesn't work (at least not alone vs. physiological diseases), and we're thus under no obligation to pretend that it does (and this is reflected in the "Criticism" section.) And the Bible isn't literally inerrant--it contradicts itself, known history, and the natural world in thousands of ways. I'm sorry if this conflicts with your beliefs, but NPOV doesn't mean only mentioning those beliefs that support Biblical Inerrancy any more than <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Clause_6c0f.html" title="Santa Clause">Santa Clause</a> should only contain sentiments supporting his existence.</p>
<p>There is SOLID precedence for including at the very least a brief refutation of Biblical Inerrancy, and no precedent I can think of for including only the patiently absurd pro- arguments and omitting any anti- arguments.</p>
<p>--Lode Runner</p>
<dl>
<dd>Lode, I see no contradiction in what you are stating and the direction we are moving and the statments being made. I agree with you to a point. The article should initally state what is Biblical inerrancy, who believes it, and why. Then it should have those churches that don't use the doctrine and why, finally it should provide a secular position. It might also be interesting to identify what other religion have a similar concept i.e Islam in this case regarding the Quran.
<dl>
<dd>If we truly are moving in that direction then great, but Home Computer said that he didn't see any need to change anything, and that our "opinions" (e.g., any factual observation that disagrees with BI) weren't relevant. At least two uncredited responses agreed with him. I am arguing that HC's philosophy is misguided and not supported by precedent--predecent dictates that this article is not just about those who believe in, support, and teach Biblical Inerrancy, but also about the commonly perceived flaws in the concept (just like the commonly perceived flaws in the belief in a Flat Earth are mentioned in the appropriate articles.) Just to be clear, I'm not arguing that we remove any section or even necessarily change any of the wording, just that an addition MUST be made to address the simple, profound logical problems that arise with the current definition of Biblical Inerrancy.Lode Runner
<dl>
<dd>Lode, I'm pretty sure that would be considered both POV and Original Research. What's presented so far is not that the Bible is inerrent, but that a doctrine of inerrency exists and a brief summary of what that belief entails. The fact that people who don't believe the Bible will have a different view is redundant. Like the guidelines say, you don't need to have a "why Hitler is evil" argument on the Hitler page. You just cite the facts of the matter as presented by the noteable experts on the subject. We don't even get to put 2 and 2 together, we don't even get to put up 2. We only get to quote that notable exert so and so says 2, and then cite it. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 00:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not speaking in an absolute outline, but using broad brushstrokes to descibe what I think is needed. Home Computer's position, I think, is that the article first needs to clearly and unequivically state what BI is and who believes it without an immediate refutation of such doctrine.

<dd>Storm, so long as no one is making thier own claims or obervations eitherway. The OR and POV guidelines make it so that what we have is a clearly documented scholarly article, and not a bunch of people voicing our opinions. There are many notable authorities on inerrency. Liberal Christianity, Athiesm and other groups are all represented by intelligent scholarly discussion on the matter which could be appropriatly included in a tasteful manner.. so long as it does not dissipate the article into an edit war of conflicting opinions and what not.&#160;:) In my POV if you it concise and appropriately managed (categorised appropriatly, cited appropriately from notable reputable experts). What we are trying to avoid is the rebuttal, people desperately disagreeing with the content the experts have probided so they want to come up with something to demonstrate the experts as being wrong on every point.

<p>"At least two uncredited responses agreed with him": as far as I can tell from the edit history, this is not the case. What seems to be happening is that when one person posts a paragraph or two and ends it with a signature tag, and another person breaks the first posting to interject something, the top half of the first post is left apparently "anonymous". But leaving all comments to the end of the post makes the context of subsequent remarks hard to follow. Maybe we should get into the habit of cutting-and-pasting the signature tags of others where appropriate. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Stevens_04d2.html" title="User:Robert Stevens">Robert Stevens</a> 12:18, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I realise my spelling and grammer are often horrid.&#160;:) With that disclaimer I think that the nouns and pronouns used to describe God or His Word are supposed to be capitolised as proper names usually are.

<p>What is meant by "Transcendent ideas in the Platonic sense also begin with a capital letter: Good and Truth."? Proper titles are also capitolised..such as "the former President Nixon" or the "infallible Word of God".

<dd>"Word of God" is probably a proper noun and the whole phrase would be capitalized, but we can all agree that the phrase is POV, and unless quoted, there are much better words that we could use. I agree that flexibility in the rules can be a good thing, but I feel strongly that we shouldn't capitalize pronouns just because some sources do it. I also feel strongly about an informal name for the Bible being capitalized, thus my edits. Blainster's edits I cannot defend as well, so I will leave that up for them to do. Is there something specifically you think needs to be capitalized that isn't?

<p>The "Basis of belief" section of this article refers to "the Bible's claims on its own inerrancy," but does not offer a citation. I just searched for "inerrant" and "inerrancy" at BibleGateway.com, which includes at least a dozen English translations. Number of passages found: zero. This has left me wondering whether the Bible does indeed claim to be inerrant. If so, it would be good to include a citation. If not, I wonder if the bullet point about "the Bible's claims" needs to be altered or deleted.</p>
<p>Me again. I changed "claims on" to "claims of."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please let me clarify. That entire section displays what the inerrentists teach. The entire section is taken from the well established text on the subject by Geisler and Nix. It is not original research. If we (you or I) make a claim about what we percieve the Bible to say and back it up with quotes and an exigesis that would be original research. At wiki, we stay away from that, its not the place to publish our findings but rather to refference the findings of the notable experts on the subject.</dd>

<p>That being said Geisler offers several different texts on the subject of what the Bible claims for itself from the Old testament and the new.

Even the arguments listed are not listed for qualitative stuy but to see how many times the bible can easily be interpreted to contradict itself. The site doesn't even pretend to be about scholarly refutation of inerrency.. calling itself a refutation of a single "pop-appologist" " concentrates on the popular apologetics of a single representative Inerrantist". I don't think a non-nontable ebook, written to refute the position of a nonnotable book written to refute the position of a non-notable website qualifies as a "good external link".

If we are going to be strict about these links, I suggest we also apply the same harsh criteria to all links. I have removed a number of other links, and tried to explain why. There was a link to a commercial site. There were 2 links from non-notable people that didn't cite sources, and had low hit ratings.

<p>I have attempted a revision of the section entitled "recovering the autograph." I describe my reasoning here, as I suspect my revision may soon be reverted.</p>
<p>First, I have changed the title of this section. Textual scholars, for a number of reasons which I will be happy to explain at length, would disagree that the project of "recovering the autograph" even makes any sense. Some would disagree that there is even necessarily an autograph to recover. Instead, this section is about the textual tradition of the New Testament, and I have called it that.</p>
<p>I have deleted this passage entirely: <i>"However, because the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_fathers.html" title="Church fathers">church fathers</a> cited the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> abundantly, it is possible to reconstruct most of the New Testament without reference to the manuscripts. While this may be true for minor errors, such as misspellings, deletions, and word order errors; other differences are more difficult to account for or notice."</i></p>
<p>There are a number of problems with these statements. First of all, the writings of the church fathers, together with their biblical citations, are themselves transmitted to us only by manuscripts. So there is no way to reconstruct the text of the New Testament without looking at manuscripts. Secondly, the church fathers themselves used manuscripts to read the texts of the New Testament. We know very little about these manuscripts, though much ink has been devoted to analyzing early scriptural quotations and trying to understand their relationship to surviving New Testament manuscripts, to quotations in author others, to later manuscripts, and so on. Thirdly, the writings of the church fathers are generally transmitted to us by fewer manuscripts, and by later manuscripts, than the texts of the New Testament, for a variety of reasons. All of this means that no textual scholar would ever endorse the notion that the texts of the New Testament, which are abundantly witnessed by good and early manuscripts, could ever be reliably reconstructed solely on the basis of indirect tradition.</p>
<p>I also eliminated the claim that textual criticism is "another technique" for "evaluat[ing] ancient texts such as the books of the Bible." The article does not mention whatever the first technique is supposed to be. In fact the collection of methodologies known as "textual criticism" are the only methods we have for reconstructing lost archetypes from extant manuscripts.</p>
<p>These edits are not the end of the matter. The section could still benefit from significant expansion and many references. But I do think they improve matters somewhat. <a href="../../../e/c/k/User%7EECKnibbs_9a8e.html" title="User:ECKnibbs">ECKnibbs</a> 12:04, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is important in this article is the opinion of the experts. Your opinion and mine on the subject is unwelcome in the article. Statements such as "..are the only methods we have for reconstructing lost archetypes from extant manuscripts" are extremely POV. And while personal belief are a good tool to motivate us, if you attempt to reform an article to comform to your limited perceptions (as any one persons are) then the article will suffer. --69.244.153.46 14:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
