<p>Hello all. I think the inspiration article looks very good. It inspired me to tryto cleanup the inerrency article.. which I started with clear definitions of the above terms. If youhave it in you, please drop by and help me clean it up.

<p>I don't think that "inerrancy" is the <i>traditional</i> position re: inspiration...it <i>is</i> the conservative opinion. When was the word inerrancy first used regarding Scriptural inspiration? What groups or theologians affirmed it (a majority, presumably, if we're calling it traditional)? I'm thinking to edit this stuff, but thought I'd consult the community first. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 21:27, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a reinterpretation of the traditional Protestant idea of <i>sola scriptura</i>, in the vernacular of the concepts and terminology of Enlightenment epistemology. This interpretation summarizes Mark Noll's conclusion (I think), in <i>Between Faith and Criticism</i>, and for Evangelicals at least, it seems to be the prevailing way of looking at it (contra both, Woodbridge, and before him, the Barthians Rogers and McKim). George M. Marsden speaks for most, I think, in looking to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_theology.html" title="Princeton theology">Princeton theology</a> as the most easily identifiable first proponents of this speaking about the Bible's truthfulness in terms of Scottish Common Sense Realism <b><i><small><sup>link correction requested</sup></small></i></b> ; but he wasn't saying that it was their invention. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> \</dd>

<dd>Roman Catholicism does not have the idea of inerrancy at all by their own account; and in fact, teaches that it is theologically impossible to reconcile with Biblical anthropology. "Infallibility" much more nearly expresses their view of Biblical authority; and can be applied with similar effect to both, Tradition (including the statements made by popes and councils) and Scripture. However, the word "error" is a problem here: Luther was excommunicated for teaching, among other things, that the councils contradict one another, and "err". Eastern Orthodoxy, being less oriented toward engagement with Enlightenment categories, is harder to figure out, since they seem to avoid the issues of "authority" and epistemology in their typical efforts to evade the Western morass. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 23:56, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So inerrancy is <i>not</i> "the most" traditional way of approaching Scripture, particularly if its rooted in the Reformation and the Enlightenment. I'm not suggesting doing away with the section which talks about inerrancy; I'm suggesting it shouldn't be listed as <i>the</i> traditional way of talking about Biblical inspiration...it's only <i>one</i> traditional way. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 00:05, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At least, it's certainly not the most traditional way of <i>speaking about</i> the traditional way of approaching Scripture. I suppose that it's a matter to be debated, whether it is the most <i>correct</i> way of speaking about it. Until the recent eruption of post-modernism in its evangelical manifestation, I think that it was the evangelical consensus that it <i>is</i> the correct way: in fact, it might have been the ONLY evangelical consensus, the single most defining article of evangelical faith. What evangelicalism is, now that this consensus has fallen away, is anybody's guess. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 00:12, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, evangelical Wesleyans have really never used it. It's associated primarily with fundamentalists and Calvinists (and there <i>are</i> fundamentalist Wesleyans, but they aren't really "mainstream"). Of course, this is the tradition I know best...but it's a misunderstanding that inerrancy is something all evangelicals share. AUTHORITY...yes...even infallibility regarding doctrine and practice matters. But not inerrancy. That's my problem with it as used in this article. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 00:20, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My off-topic point there, is that evangelicalism is, to a certain extent, a constructed identity that had inerrancy as the <i>watershed</i> (Harold Lindsell's famous term in <i>The Battle for the Bible</i>). There is no distinctive "creed" for the old alignment of evangelicalism, if this is not the creed. There is no Church of Evangelicalism. Although, there is a kind of intuition, a <i>gestalt</i> sense of belonging to and with one another that evangelicals persist in trying to define, with increasingly less definiteness. As this has happened, more mainstream types have felt the tug to pile into the "evangelicalism" ark (for, Evangelicals have done the tugging), so that gradually the idea of the Bible that they share is developing the same tensions that brought about the Fundamentalist-Modernist split in the first place: although this time, the alignments are very different and, sometimes, a little ironic. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 00:35, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've always thought Lindsell's thesis to be flawed. I prefer Oden's definition(s) of evangelicalism, delineated beuatifully in his <i>Systematic Theology</i> trilogy. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 02:47, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mark, can you elaborate or rephrase this sentence for me: "other traditionalists have sought to guard against the inference that the Bible is comparable to a modern scientific way of knowing or describing thing."

<dd>I think that Keith might be the better one to refer to here, because the "Paleo-orthodox" approach is one example of what I have in mind, there. Contrast it with Hodge's approach to the Bible, as providing the brute data of a scientific systematization. The idea of inspiration that might underlie this particular view might be expressed as saying that, every particular statement of the Bible is a "fact", and theology is the systematization of those facts.</dd>
<dd>A contrasting view might be that the Bible was given in a context, not of words (alone), but of God's faithfulness and covenant, and his peoples belief and unbelief, faithfulness and unfaithfulness, courage and cowardice, trust and rebellion, and so on. These are the terms in which the Bible is better thought <i>inerrant</i> - thus the different word, <i>infallible</i>, which is less loaded perhaps, with the notion of "data". — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 01:20, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with the current edits...I just have a problem (as a Methodist, a paleo guy, a narrative guy) with "inerrancy" being determinative for evanegelicals. That is, in my view, a relatively new innovation. I commend Oden's work to you - <i>solidly</i> evangelical, and his systematic theology trilogy is the absolute best ecumenical evangelical in print (maybe <i>ever</i>). Definitely worth a look and something you both would very much enjoy. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 13:52, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What does the Catholic view say about the manuscript traditions? Is the Bible inspired only in its original autographa (as per the Evangelical view), or is the transmission of that document also assured in Catholic doctrine? If the latter, is it only inspired in the manuscripts incorporated into the Vulgate? This sort of thing should be dealt with briefly in the Catholic section.

<p>Thank you for this article. Is there a precedent to consider the Commandments of God and the words of Jesus (as recorded by others) to be (obviously) divinely inspired scripture, but to view "The Bible" as a collection of writings which was later approved by the early Catholic Church? Is there a term for this view (other than perhaps the politically charged term "Red Letter Christian")? I am not trying to sell anything here, just asking if there is another theory of Biblical Inspiration. Repentance 16:29, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
