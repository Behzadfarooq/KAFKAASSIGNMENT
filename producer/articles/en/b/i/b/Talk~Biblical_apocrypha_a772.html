<p>I think that this split shows a lot of promise. But I am not happy to see comments about the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> showing up in odd places in the article <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html" title="Biblical apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a>. E.g., the comment about the Eastern Orthodox canon in <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_apocrypha.html#Modern_editions" title="Biblical apocrypha">Modern Editions</a> seems off topic. It seems to me that the tendency to insert opinions about the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> is inevitably controversial, invites long off-topic threads as prots and caths continue to attempt to have the last word, and pulls attention away from the topic at hand, which is the Apocrypha. There is already an article for this: <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a>. Do we really need another article for the exact same topic? <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 13:29, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Vulgate section needs work. Only those books labelled apocrypha by <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_VIII_bbf1.html" title="Clement VIII">Clement VIII</a> are discussed; this is anachonistic since Jerome preceeded Clement by centuries. Manuscripts of the Vulgate did not have an Apocrypha section; the Apocrypha section is, for the most part, a Reformation-era innovation. I suggest omitting this section and limiting our discussion to printed editions of Bibles. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 14:28, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that there was no section labelled "Apocrypha" in the Vulgate, but I don't understand your objection; there were small-a apocrypha included in the Vulgate by Jerome, as discussed in that section. I'm not sure why you moved the Vulgate out of the section on "editions of the Bible", since it's an edition of the Bible. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 18:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Vulgate is a <i>Version</i>; there are multiple printed <i>Editions</i> of it, as well as many manuscripts. Manuscripts are referred to as editions only in very special cases, if ever.</p>
<p>Jerome's definition of <i>Apocrypha</i> included all those books in his Old Testament which were not extant in the Hebrew. His definition differed from Clement's. It was more like Luther's, but perhaps not identical. Therefore, your discussion of the Clementine Apocrypha is anachronistic when discussing Jerome's version.</p>
<p>I have reconsidered my earlier suggestion that the Vulgate section be removed. I think that it might provide a good place to report Jerome's definition of the word <i>Apocrypha</i>, which did have an influence on Bible publishers 11 centuries later. Sort of a prologue to the issue of Apocrypha sections in printed Bibles. It still needs some work, though. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 13:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't yet revised the Vulgate section; I need to get my hands on a St. Jerome's prologues to make sure I get the details of his opinions on the canon. There's always tomorrow. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 21:14, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can anyone confirm that the Luther Bible omitted the Prayer of Manasseh? I Believe it contained this work. I'll try to find a reference. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 14:28, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm certainly prepared to believe that, but it might be tricky to track down: a lot of people use the term "Luther Bible" to refer to a wide range of different published editions, and according to the sources I've read, the Apocrypha section was removed from the Luther Bible within Luther's lifetime. Good hunting; this issue is a morass of POV websites.&#160;:P /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahedo_918c.html" title="User:Blahedo">blahedo</a> (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlahedo_0498.html" title="User talk:Blahedo">t</a>) 18:35, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen a scan of a complete edition of the Luther Bible from his lifetime; it contained the Apocrypha, but definitely not 2 Esdras. I can't find it now; when I google "Luther Bible" I get a zillion hits on the same useless e-text without Apocrypha (or any pedigree, for that matter). <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 13:54, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't found the Website, but the preface to my RSV:CB apocrypha mentions that the LB excludes 1 and 2 Esdras. Since it doesn't mention PoM, I think we can assume it has it.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that volumes of the Luther Bible minus Apocrypha did not become common until the bible societies started giving away their free bibles in the aftermath of WWI. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 14:18, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches have accepted the Septuagint's list of books since the Council of Carthage, which met from 345-419 A.D.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above statement is inaccurate and misleading. It is inaccurate in that Carthage did not follow the Septuagint's list; it omitted <a href="../../../1/_/e/1_Esdras_ecb9.html" title="1 Esdras">1 Esdras</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm_151.html" title="Psalm 151">Psalm 151</a>, Odes, and 3 and 4 Maccabees. It is misleading in that it implies (though it does not state) that this canon of a regional council was definitive for the whole church; it was not. Trent was definitive for the whole Catholic church, and it is true that the definitive canon wound up being identical to Carthage's, but this did not become apparent until the 16th century. I will remove the statement. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 16:06, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does it strike anyone as odd that the only references listed for the article are from the <i>19th century</i>? Not that there might <i>not</i> be some significant works written then, but do other editors think there has been nothing important written about the apocrypha in the last century?? --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 16:57, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose replacing the <b>Biblical Canon</b> section of this article with a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Canon_d086.html" title="Biblical Canon">Biblical Canon</a>. My reasons for this are</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a.</b> The whole section is redundant to information found <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">elsewhere</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">elsewhere</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">elsewhere</a>. Not to mention <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">elsewhere</a>.</li>
<li><b>b.</b> The information is off-topic. This article is about what the contents of various editions of the Bible <i>are</i>, not what they <i>should be</i>.</li>
<li><b>c.</b> This section, like the articles linked to above, is a magnet for "canonistas" who insert POV comments. It is difficult enough to keep the above articles clean and NPOV. Keeping this section here only adds to that workload.</li>
