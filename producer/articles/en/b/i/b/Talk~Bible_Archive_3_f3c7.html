<p>This monstrosity of a page (monstrous in terms of size) was just trimmed by me. I removed most of the external links to text editions (already found at the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_translations.html" title="Bible translations">Bible translations</a> article, which is linked here) and reduced the "See also" to "just the essentials". Heck, we can't list EVERYTHING and still be concise, clear, and NPOV.

<dd>DOM may be highly disputed eccesiastical sovereignty, but how is an online translation of the bible POV? That would mean that every other online translation of the bible is also POV.

<dd>This online translation is non-notable in addition to being POV, and yes, it is very easy to produce a POV version of the Bible. Anyone can "translate" a Bible to say whatever they want. The fact that YOU call it a "Bible translation" does not make it so, and certainly does not make it notable, especially to the Bible article. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 23:13, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And the translations linked (KJV, RSV, NIV, etc.) are well known and generally accepted (to varying degrees) by the academic community and the Christian community. If we list the Melchizedek "translation", we'll have to list possibly <i>hundreds</i> of..."unique" works. Yes, every translation is POV to a certain extent, but not quite to the degree of the Melchizedek version. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 23:20, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition, the "Melchizadek Bible" appears to consist of only four books: Genesis, Exodus, Matthew, and Revelation. Its preface begins, "The Melchizedek Bible combines an interpretation of metaphor with the King James Version, guiding students to the hidden treasures of Holy Writ. While not all the books of the Bible are included in this work, the ones that are can serve as a guide to the interpretation of metaphor in the others." It does not even pretend to be a complete Bible, nor a translation, nor a paraphrase. Instead it is a sort of interpretive work combined with a known Bible text, covering a very small portion of what most would call the Bible. It has no place here. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 01:36, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>KHMO3 just beat me to it, I was about to revert the Melchizadek Bible link myself. It is not the Bible, it is not a translation of the Bible, it is one small group of people/religion's appropriation and interpretation of the Bible. I am not saying we should ban the link from Wikipedia, but put it on a page about the Church of Christ, Scientist, or The Melchizadeks, or whatever is appropriate. The link illustrates a particular religion, it does not in any way illustrate an article on "the Bible." <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 20:40, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Don't revert to your own version, worst of all. Wikipedia is a public space, and <i>everyone</i> gets a say in the community.

<dd>It isn't acceptable to delete the links and then call a moratorium on restoring what has been removed.

Ahem. You all seem to be looking at the .com and assuming it is a "for profit" venture. It is not. This is a quote from biblegateway.com. "Gospel Communications is the Christian, non-profit organization behind BibleGateway.com. We exist to spread the Gospel and empower the Body of Christ through the use of the internet and other media." It is POV, but so is anything that isn't a perfect wikipedia article. (I also tried to fix up the "gender neutral" section, but it still needs some wikifying by a better editor. <a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHopquick_fff0.html" title="User:Hopquick">Hopquick</a> 04:22, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of the 107 unique translations offered, cursory inspection shows 42 that are available on the noncommercial sites. There are 26 more that I <i>think</i> are duplicates, but I'll be cautious. Thus thirty-nine (or maybe sixty-five) links are only on these pages.

<dd>It should not be a concern that the sites are commercial. The primary considerations should be completeness, reliability of the link, and the description we use for the resource.

<dd>Sorry, a bit cryptic there, eh? It's: gt - BibleGateway, st - BibleStudyTools, u - unbound, s - sacred. If a translation was in two locations there was no preferance given to which made the list.

<p>I believe that regardless of the conclusion Bible Gateway should be linked, as it is the most well-known Bible text site on the web and has been for a number of years. I <i>definitely</i> do not have an agenda; in fact, I run a minor Bible text site myself which I would love to see more popular. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> <a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">(talk)</a> 13:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry to be dense, Aaron, but for example, where is the New International Version "duplicated"? I see a link to the "Today's NIV", not the NIV (the link is wrong).</dd>
<dd>Regardless, even if it were in the list, and correct, it is not duplication of what BibleGateway provides. BibleGateway is not a link list. It is a single place at which the Bible can be searched in English and "your own language", from one interface. The UnboundBible duplicates BibleGateway's service. If it were complete, it could replace it; although as Jdavidb, the Gateway is the best known online Bible on the net. It implies an extremely strong bias against linking to commercial sites, that would result in excluding it from a list of websites in the Bible article. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 15:46, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's fine with me if it's submitted for comments. I still am puzzled by what the cause of the bias is. No one is being charged for access, and its service is not being duplicated. They do not sell the Bibles they make available for search - and <i>this is not true of many of some of the sites that are linked in the off-site list</i>. What could be more commercial than linking directly to a publisher's site? The UnboundBible duplicates services, but not versions.</dd>
<dd>I wish that you would explain more clearly what the conflict of interest is, that accounts for your sense of ethical urgency. Your reasoning if agreed to could go into an explanation banner, explaining to future editors why the best known free resource for searchable on-line Bibles in multiple languages is not linked from here. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 23:45, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><small>Reset indent to zero.</small>Umm, "ethical urgency"? One issue with your statement: what are you basing "best known" on? Regardless, "BibleStudyTools.net" is a highly commercial site which, while it may be useful to someone who wants to conduct some manner of bible research, does not merit inclusion in this article. This is an encyclopedia entry on the bible, not a portal for bible study. "BibleGateway.com" is less egregious, but is still a commercial site that has content that is mostly duplicated by a noncommercial iste and, more to the point, is found on the links page of one of the non-commercial sites. I re-iterate: I'd be happy with replacing these two links (ignoring for the moment the others that have cropped up) with the "sacredbible" links page. That's <b>one extra click</b> required to access the resource.<br />

<dd>I mean that you seem to think that this is <i>important</i> (urgency) - I assume that this is because you believe that it would be <i>wrong</i> (unethical) to link to the commercial site. Anyway, I don't care about "BibleStudyTools" - it's a junky site with not much to offer except advertisements and enticements.</dd>
<dd>My questions and comments all concern BibleGateway. There are measures for "best known", even if they are not perfect. BibleGateway, for example, is Alexa-rated at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.biblegateway.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.biblegateway.com" rel="nofollow">2,496</a>, compared to SacredBible's <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.sacredbible.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.sacredbible.org" rel="nofollow">4,733,692</a>. All traffic for Biola University (including UnboundBible) is a <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.unboundbible.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.unboundbible.org" rel="nofollow">40,465</a>. Interestingly, SacredBible and UnboundBible rank far below Bible.com, which is a site of greatly inferior quality: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.bible.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.bible.com" rel="nofollow">16,113</a>. I'm sure that there are others to compare to. BibleGateway has been around for a very long time. I would be very surprised to find any service of comparable quality and completeness. It would be amazed if you can find something that is better known. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 22:50, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually prefer "BibleStudyTools", which has the NRSV and others, but I can see I'm all alone on this one. &#160;:(</dd>
<dd>I still think we should keep "BibleGateway", which is probably the best known and most utilized Bible site on the net. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 23:22, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I overstated myself when I said that it has nothing to offer. I'm not opposed to BibleStudyTools; it's only that it's never caught my attention. I think it should be kept. If "best known" matters, crosswalk Bible Study Tools ranks well according to Alexa: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=bible.crosswalk.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=bible.crosswalk.com" rel="nofollow">4,282</a>. And, it offers free online access to more commentaries, concordances, lexicons and cross-ref tools than are available on BibleGateway. I wish that the site wasn't so cluttered, though. — <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mark</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a>)</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mkmcconn_3c44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mkmcconn">**</a> 00:04, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">deleted paragraph from "four sources" section</span></h2>
<p>I deleted this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alternatives to the standard documentary hypothesis include the view that Moses wrote the whole Torah, though most conservative scholars do not hold that Moses wrote the account of his own death, and there is room within the conservative viewpoint for an editor later than Moses putting together materials that largely came from Moses. <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Wenham_ac1b.html" title="Gordon Wenham">Gordon Wenham</a>, in particular, has argued that the materials of Genesis 1-11 date back to a time near the time they seem to be about. Conservative scholars have increasingly been attracted to the thesis that Moses compiled already-existing materials into the book of Genesis and wrote down and compiled many of the materials, but a later editor put it all into its final form. Christians have pointed to Jesus' reference to the Torah as the books of Moses, but that could simply mean the books associated with Moses or the books that Moses had a large hand in compiling.</dd>
</dl>
<p>...for two reasons. First, it is argumentative, arguing against the documentary hypotheses. But this argument is unnecessary and inappropriate. The previous section makes it clear that many Jews did not and do not accept the documentary hypothesis, and believe that Moses wrote the Torah. If someone believes this is not clear, then by all means, make it clearer -- but make it clearer by going to the section that lays out the older claim that Moses wrote the Torah and make it clearer, rather than add this to a section that is about a different point of view. The last sentence about Jesus adds nothing to the article and is in any event speculative. The claim that Conservative scholars are moving to the view that Moses compiled Genesis IS a new claim but frankly I question its veracity. What is the evidence for this? Who has argued this? If the contributor responsible for this paragraph can provide verifiable sources and clarify this, I would absolutely support its inclusion ... in Wikipedia. I am not sure that it belongs in this article, which does not go into detail about any of these debates (note, there is a link to the Documentary hypothesis article, but the paragraph provides <i>no</i> arguments <i>for</i> the documentary hypothesis. I propose that all details for and against the documentary hypothesis be put in that linked article, not here. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 15:06, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 1911 text is in the public domain but you are not allowed to copy and paste the work from the internet. That would be infringing on someone else's work. Did you type the entry directly from the encyclopedia? If so, then that would be appropriate. Otherwise what you pasted should be removed for a technical copyright violation. Many have been sued for doing this presuming that it's public domain so it can be freely copied and pasted.</p>

<p>"By the Hellenistic period of Jewish history, Jews were divided over the nature of the Torah. Some (for example, the Sadducees) believed that the Chumash contained the entire Torah, that is, the entire contents of what God revealed to Moses at Sinai and in the desert."</p>
<p>What is the Chumash?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Go to the section called "The Hebrew Bible." Almost immediately below is a subsection called "The Torah." read the first sentence of that subsection. Since the point of the section in question is that there are two Torahs, written and oral, it would be confusing to use the word Torah to mean "just the written Torah." Instead, we use "chumash" because that word refers to five specific written books, to refer to the written Torah. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 22:00, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see no merit to the page. It doesn'e explain <i>why</i> some people do not like the Bible. It merely provides chapter and verse citations for passages we would reject today as morally repugnant or difficult. So what? Anyone who owns a Bible can find these easily; anyone who has read the Bible has read them. The issue - for an encyclopedia - is (1) why do these passages appear in the Bible and (2) why do Bible-readers no longer obey or ascribe to them, or (3) how do contemporary Bible-readers make sense of these passages. These are all important topics worth exploring in our article. The website in question ignores them all. It is simple anti-intellectual (and thus unencyclopedic) blather. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--Just now visited Evil Bible dot com. i think it is right and just that that link was pulled. according to domainsbyproxy legal agreement, the person who linked that page to this wiki was not abiding to its agreement. also it is clearly anti semetic and and anti christian in mood and in thought. there are no critiques of any kind for any other religion or belief system, as everything is slanted solely against the bible and to the intelligence of those who believe in the scriptures. that Evil Bible dot com more fittingly belongs on a wiki dedicated to atheism, agnostics, and as such has no bearing what so ever here. more disappointly, they were too afraid to register their real names, nor provide a way to email them directly. this leaves me dubious as to their real intent.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why is Emperor Constantine I left out of the article?</span></h2>
<p>As it seems to me, in a several page long article on the bible, constantine deserves a little mention, as historians agree that Constantine was, if not the compiler of the bible, the manager of the compilers of the bible. Specifically Constantine charged a bishop by the name of "Eusebius" to supply the blossoming new church of Rome with a collection of scriptures. There is some dispute over the matter but almost all historians agree that Constantine was somewhat influential in compiling the bible.</p>
<p>For reference here's <a href="http://www.bidstrup.com/bible.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.bidstrup.com/bible.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bidstrup.com/bible.htm</a> specifically Creation Of The Bible As We Know It and Yet Another Revision section.</p>
<p>Even if there is dispute over constantine's influence over the modern bible, he still deserves some mention, No?</p>

<ul>
<li>No. Historians do not recognize Constantine with the compiler of the Bible. See secular historians Elaine Pagels, Paula Frederiksen, and Bart Ehrman, to name a few. This is a myth that has been spread in modern times and can be seen explicitly in "The Da Vinci Code". Historian Bart Ehrman refutes Constantine's involvement in the development of the canon in his book, "Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code". <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstralisLux_8a2e.html" title="User:AstralisLux">AstralisLux</a></li>

Both Hebrew Scripture and the Christian Bible have been translated more times and into more languages —" Use of the word "fictional" doesn't properly describe the text.

<p>Greetings! My name is Thomas Beard, and I am a Bible/Ministry major at Oklahoma Christian University.

I would like to offer my assistance in getting this project into an accurate, user-friendly form, though I have to admit that this is my first wikiproject, so I'm a little fuzzy on wiki protocol.</p>
<p>OK Someone Fix this. The end of the first paragraph states that "The Bible is the revealed word of God, and an authoritative record of the relationship between God, the world and mankind." That statement cannot be proven. It should start "Some people believe the bible is the revealed..." You cannot prove that the Bible is the revealed word of God.</p>

<p>This is definitely a point of concern. I'm also seeing throughout the article reference to "Hebrew Scriptures" as not containing the deuterocanonicals. This would mean that the authors determined that only one line of Jews are truly Jewish. Other Jews around the world still accept the deuterocanonicals as part of Scripture, as do the Eastern and Western Catholic Church. It's evident, also, that the deuterocanonicals were included in Scripture in the Greek Septuagint yet there is no warning in history not to use them until 90 C.E. at the Council of Jamnia when Palestinian Jews rejected them and also rejected books of the New Testamnent as non-canonical. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstralisLux_8a2e.html" title="User:AstralisLux">AstralisLux</a></p>

<dd>No Jewish group today has Apocrypha and similar books as part of its canon. They are not part of the "Hebrew Scriptures," though they are of course very important to other religious groups. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 18:20, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dovi, you are wrong. Many African Jews, including Egyptian and Ethiopian Jews include the Deuterocanonicals in their Scripture. "The Palestinian canon of the Old Testament (followed by modern Protestants) which was fixed and decided by the Pharisees at the end of the first century in the Council of Janveh, was in part to suppress the growing heresy called Christianity. With the virtual disappearance of the priestly class with the destruction of the Temple in AD 70, the PHARISEES became champions of Judaism. In order to combat the spreading Christian cult, the Pharisee rabbis met at the city of Jamnia or Javneh in A.D. 90 to determine which books were truly the Word of God. They pronounced many books, including the Gospels and the New Testament Letters, to be heretical. Thus, the Palestinian Jews have 39 books in the Old Testament, while the Alexandrian Jews and the Jews of Dispersion hold that 46 books are inspired, following the canon stated in the Greek Septuagint."

<dd>Actually, you are right about the Ethiopian Jews, I didn't think of that. Nevertheless, no Jewish group that uses the Bible in <i>Hebrew</i> (the Ethiopian's don't) includes this books. I have no idea what you mean by Egyptian Jews, unless it refers to the article you cite and means ancient Egyptian Jews, but Egyptian Jewish communities since at least the middle ages have used the same masoretic text as the rest of the Jewish people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the article you cite, the opinions expressed in it are way out-of -date. (What's the source?) The idea that a committee of sages at Yavneh went ahead and deliniated a brand new cannon for ideological (or especially anti-Christological) reasons is 19th century stock-scholarship. For a more modern alternative view, read Sid Leiman.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bottom line, any and all Jewish communities today that are heirs to a <i>Hebrew</i> textual tradition of the Bible do <i>not</i> include apocrypha, etc. Those books have certainly not been a significant part of the Hebrew textual tradition for roughly 2000 years, and it highly questionable whether they were "canon" even before that. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 21:10, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How about an original Wiki Translation of the bible?</span></h2>
<p>There doesn't seem to be an Wiki Version of the bible. (If I somehow missed it, please give me the link.) There are sites called the "WikiBible" or similar but these are bible study resources... not an original translation.</p>
<p>The best translations of the bible (in my opinion) are the collaberative efforts, so it seems like the wiki method would be terrific.</p>
<p>Obviously, it's a big project so I'd like suggestions before I set it up.</p>
<p>One way, that comes to mind, is to post (wiki style) a public-domain version of the bible (let's say, the KJV) and let people revise from there. But, of course, this builds-in a translation bias.</p>
<p>The other possibility is to just create blank books and chapters linked to public domain verions of the Hewbrew and Greek testamets. (I'm not clear if there ARE readily available public domain versions of the Heberew/Greek bibles.)</p>
<p>Here are Greek and Hebrew quotes from the [e-Sword <a href="http://www.e-sword.net/bibles.html" class="external free" title="http://www.e-sword.net/bibles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-sword.net/bibles.html</a>] dowloadable bible: "Mat 1:1 Βίβλος γενέσεως ᾿Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ, υἱοῦ Δαυΐδ, υἱοῦ ᾿Αβραάμ." "Gen 1:1 בראשׁית ברא אלהים את השׁמים ואת הארץ׃" simply pasted in.</p>
<p>Suggestions anyone?</p>

<li>If the point of the translation is to be as accurate as possible, it doesn't make sense to start with KJV, nor does it make sense to allow anyone but those fluent in the original Hebrew and in English to edit the wiki. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-03-12 13:07</small></li>

<p>Well, besides being an impossible task (in my opinion), what would a wiki translation provide that isn't already available in current translations? most of which are available on the Internet. —<a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayward_b35f.html" title="User:Wayward">Wayward</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../w/a/y/User_talk%7EWayward_8c6e.html" title="User talk:Wayward"><font color="#6BA800">Talk</font></a></sup></small> 13:27, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow! I didn't expect a response so fast. Thank you.</p>
<p>It would be an experiment, for sure, but only time would tell if it is "impossible." I probably would have said that Wikipedia was impossible!</p>
<p>In seminary, our classes worked collaboratively in translating several books of the bible. The process, itself, was very positive. Most of us were not great scholars but I think we came up with a pretty good translation of the books we did. (Mark and Galatians.)</p>
<p><i>KJV?</i> I'm thinking that's a bad idea. A strict English transliteration would be more neutral for a starting point. There are several floating around.</p>
<p><i>What does it contribute?</i> For sure, you could argue that English does not need another translation. But, on the other hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wiki-style translation would be unique in the history Christianity. In every translation I know of, there's a point where it is "received." The Wiki Version would forever be a work in progress... not unlike the whole field of translation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All the public domain translations, that I'm aware of, are either old or abandoned. The new, good ones, are under copyright. When the Wiki Version is mature, it could be compiled and ported for all kinds of uses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there is a tremendous level of biblical study by lay Christians... it would be very interesting to see how a democratically translated bible turned out. Plus, of course, input from non-Christians would add an element not present in most translations.</li>

<dd>On further thought, Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy would preclude any attempt to write a wiki Bible translation. —<a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayward_b35f.html" title="User:Wayward">Wayward</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../w/a/y/User_talk%7EWayward_8c6e.html" title="User talk:Wayward"><font color="#6BA800">Talk</font></a></sup></small> 17:48, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The place to work on a wiki-translation is Wikisource. <i>However,</i> any such wiki translation must have its guidelines spelled out and agreed upon by its contributor(s). Such guidelines would probably have to deliniate the unique features of the new wiki-translation which would make it a useful addition to the several public domain translations which already exist, and may be on Wikisource as well. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 18:23, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hmmm. Translation counts as origional research? That wouldn't normally occur to me. However, the Wikisource suggestion makes sense to me. I'll look into it. Thanks for the tip.

<li>Actually, no, Wikisource is not the place to provide your own translations of text. Wikisource only accepts previously published source text, not original research. If you want to make your own translation, you have to start a wiki, such as on Wikicities. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-03-13 16:35</small></li>

<li>One year to the day after arrival on Wikipedia, I can announce that after exploration on WikiChristian.org, Wikibooks, and Religion-wiki, there is a substantial attempt at translating the N.T. beginning with the Gospel of John on Wikibooks, presented in the context of annotated text, but still reposited as the appendix on Christianity after some contention. The facts are that the framework is quite restrictive and demanding. The parallel version (since yesterday standard 780px width) tables collapse or expand in different browsers. Maybe only John is possible, but need comments on the direction taken before proceeding further. Only one sentence was contributed by another person in the printable PDF preview called "This Little Gospel." That Wikipedia person failed to cooperate further and entreaty made to several outside scholars to peer review went nowhere. So, an open invitation to Wiki Bible oriented people to take a look. Start at WikiCities, the PDF uploaded today seems to be an unreliable view except in Netscape 7.2 or 8.0 <a href="http://religion.wikicities.com/wiki/Testimonia" class="external autonumber" title="http://religion.wikicities.com/wiki/Testimonia" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I need to step back and take a breath. Took the approach that there is no single author (of a Bible translation) even though there was only one so far. The appropriate term might be lay-student of the Word.

<dd>I had to go back to school, neglected my own lesson plan. Now the PDF has two more prophecy fulfillments converted to Modernity Version with highlighted believes because they had already been translated in John 3.
