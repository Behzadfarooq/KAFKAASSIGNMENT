<p>See <a href="../../../b/i/b/Talk%7EBiblical_canon_Archive_f210.html" title="Talk:Biblical canon/Archive">/Archive</a> for a discussion around September 2004 about the section concerning the LDS (mormon) books. A suggestion was raised to remove it, since the LDS themselves do not consider it to be part of the Bible. Some agreed, others thought this was not sufficient reason for removal. A second suggestion, to rename the page "Judeo-Christian canon" (in order to make the LDS writing fit in) gathered even less enthusiasm. The discussion dies out and neither was done.

<p>Why does this page say that the Council of Florence was not binding? It was an ecumenical council that promulgated specific doctrine, and specific passages from it occur in Denziger. I am concerned that this page contains a mistake about Florence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not familiar with the history of this council's authority, aside from the fact that the Eastern Orthodox people rejected the agreements that their representatives made at this council. My guess is that, since <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Florence_81b1.html" title="Council of Florence">Council of Florence</a> redirects to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Basel_dc20.html" title="Council of Basel">Council of Basel</a> which article is chiefly concerned with the struggle between the Pope and the fathers of Basel at this time, the editor may have considered the Council of Florence non-binding because the matter with the Basel fathers was not yet settled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It might be a good idea to make <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Florence_81b1.html" title="Council of Florence">Council of Florence</a> its own article again, and clarify its status (and any doubts about its status) there. Anyone else more familiar with the subject? <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 16:15, 3 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As the article now indicates, in the Council of Florence, the list of the canonical books occurs in the "Decree for the Jacobites", where it is not explicitly defined "for the Catholic Church". This is evidence of how well-determined the canon was at that point, of course. I don't think there was a lot of discussion at Trent before accepting this list (which Trent quotes from Florence). (At least this is what I could figure out from Denzinger.... I will look a bit deeper, though.) <a href="../../../m/p/o/User%7EMpolo_8b72.html" title="User:Mpolo">Mpolo</a> 14:39, Oct 8, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't there some reference to the dissenting view of <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saducees.html#Beliefs" title="Saducees">Sadducees</a>, perhaps language like "Some Jews recognize the twenty-four books of the Hebrew Bible as the Tanakh".

<p>Nobs, I don't think that the Saducees so much rejected the "canonized" Tanakh, as that the Tanakh was not canonized until after the Saducees disappeared. During the process of canonization, which ended at the very earliest at the very end of the first century, many people differed or debated what should be considered "holy books." But it isn't until the second century that there is a clear canonized Bible, the Tanakh. By that time there were no more Saducees, so they certainly couldn't object to it! The real important point is that <i>until</i> the Tanakh was canonized, all/many Jews differed over which books were most holy. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 23:27, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is not informative. It tells the reader that there is some information somewhere, and makes an assertion about it, but it does not transmit that information.

<dl>
<dd>How would you rewrite this paragraph:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the end of the 1st century, the Letters of Paul were collected and circulated, and they were known to Clement of Rome (c. 95), Ignatius of Antioch (died 117), and Polycarp of Smyrna (c. 115) but they weren't called Scripture as the Septuagint was and there were some who rejected them. Acts 21:21 records a rumor that Paul aimed to subvert the Old Testament. Epiphanius Heresies 29 says the Nazarenes rejected him. Irenaeus Against Heresies 26.2 says the Ebionites rejected him. Eusebius Ecclesiastical History 6.38 says the Elchasai "made use of texts from every part of the Old Testament and the Gospels; it rejects the Apostle [Paul] entirely" and 4.29.5 says Tatian the Assyrian rejected Paul's Letters and Acts of the Apostles and 6.25 says Origen accepted a 22 book Old Testament plus Maccabees as deuterocanonical plus the four Gospels but Paul "did not so much as write to all the churches that he taught; and even to those to which he wrote he sent but a few lines." 2 Peter 3:16 says they've been abused by heretics who twist them around.
<dl>
<dd>The text moves from "some who rejected" the letters in the 2nd century to those rejecting Paul's teachings in the first century without signalling the move. (The critical separation of Pauline epistles from Pseudo-Pauline is not mentioned yet.) --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 7 July 2005 20:06 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This term is used by Metzger in his <i>Canon of the NT</i>. He may have coined it. It's used because no one in the early church proposed a smaller canon of Pauline works, even though moderns consider only 7 letters to be authentically Pauline. In fact, Marcion is the first to collect them into a group, but even his opponents agreed with the selection, with Hebrews and Pastorals early on considered of a different status. Hence, you have a number of groups: 14 canonical Paulines, 10 traditional (i.e. Marcion's), 7 authentic (as determined by modern standards).</p>

<p>Yet again, here we have an article where the original editor chose to use the AD/BC date format, but where someone, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">User:Slrubenstein</a> in this case, comes along with his POV pushing and changes it to CE/BCE. If the original editors (or first major contributors) use CE/BCE then fair enough. I don't like it, but I can live with it. That can't be said for Slr and his band of followers who are systematically changing date formats - and usually not identifying the change in the edit summary. I'm inclined to change this article back to BC/AD and might do so in due course, depending on any other views added here. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 15:50, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course taking a position either way constitutes a POV, so the only really neutral position is to leave both off and just go with numbers alone. I think a reasonable compromise is to use the BC/AD notation in articles related to Christianity (such as this one), and use BCE/CE for non-Christian articles such as history. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 02:04, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Slrubenstein's comment above is well out of order. It breaks <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. Steven has argued this issue on extremely divisive religio-political grounds and stirred up a whole hornet's nest of trouble throughout Wikipedia. It's time to stop this politicking and think of the reader. BCE/CE notation is not generally used by the general public throughout the world, and it is not our place to make it more widely used. We should think of the reader and use language that he understands. That Slrubenstein can only argue with invective and incivility shows just how weak his position is. Arcturus is completely right to stand up to Slrubenstein's self-serving political campaign, which, if it is ever successful, will only serve to drive our readers away, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:26, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please stop stirring this up more, Jayjg. Surely you can't defend Slrubenstein's language above? Nor can you deny that it was Slrubenstein who put forward (without listening to alternative viewpoints beforehand) a proposal that he argued, and was only willing to argue, on religio-political grounds. Nor can you deny that, despite his many attempts to manoeuvre the discussion in the way he wanted, his proposal came nowhere near gaining a majority, let alone the 80% vote he would have needed to make it policy. Nor can you deny that he continued to lend his active and passive support to changing articles to use BCE/CE notation. It's quite clear that a small number of users choose to campaign for BCE/CE notation arguing that their political beliefs should take preference over writing in a way that readers understand in a way that has been highly disruptive to WP. It's time for these BCE/CE campaigns to stop. They have damaged the project enough already, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:41, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to Steve Rubenstein: You are right, I haven't contributed to this article because, unlike you, this and related topics are not my specialist areas. I'm more interested in date and calendar issues, amongst other things. Regarding the original format of this article. I think this is it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_canon&amp;oldid=238818" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biblical_canon&amp;oldid=238818" rel="nofollow">[1</a>]. It appears here that the first contributor - and it was a substantial contribution - used BC/AD. Further checking of the edit history <i>apparently</i> shows that you changed this format, but perhaps someone else could confirm that. As I've said, I don't like CE/BCE but if an original edit uses it then so be it. I have in the past changed some CE/BCE to AD/BC but I haven't done so for some time if it's clear that the first editor preferred it. Original use of CE/BCE might be argued as POV since it goes right against mainstream usage. Even Britannica uses BC/AD. Converting articles from BC/AD to CE/BCE is definitely POV.</dd>

<p>'Against' There is a signficant population that is offended by the BC/AD notation. Much of the current Biblical criticism is now using the BCE/CE.

<p><b>Agree</b> this article should use the AD/BC format. There is a significant population that is offended by the BCE/CE notation, but that shouldn't really matter. The more common format is more informative and more readily understood; use of this format is generally understood to <i>not</i> imply belief in Jesus as Lord or anything of the kind.

As it stands, "the people of God" is defined as "those who accept these statements". Thus logically this is self-referential nonsense. If we can preface this nonsense with, <i>According to Saint Soandso's Doctrine of XYZ (date)...</i> then it becomes a statement of fact, and part of the history of nonsense.

<dd>Sounds more like last semester's religion class. Good points given your assumptions (you defined "the people of God" - the article didn't, but should have). Common sense often turns out later to be nonsense as you suggest, so the use of the term nonsense seems a bit of modern hindsight. How much of what we assert today will in the course of future research turn out to be silly?

<p>Re: "Was the book written by a prophet?" – If we take prophecy to mean prediction of the future, then perhaps it would be good to wait a thousand years or so before canonization, just to be sure....&#160;;) --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 18:36, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a section <i>Modern interpretation of canonization</i> for this stuff, hopefully references will be provided.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I imagine the 'people of God' could be understood to mean those who called themselves Christians; in other words, was the book widely read and accepted in the Christian community. This doesn't necessarily have to be verified by quoting a specific saint, but could be the result of research finding copies of the book throughout Christendom, or widely quoted, etc. "Prophet" in this context generally means someone who "speaks forth" the word of God, a much broader definition than "one who predicts the future". I'd still like a better reference to keep this though; at least referencing <i>whose</i> modern interpretation of canonization this is. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 02:55, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text: <i>Many modern Protestants point to four "Criteria for Canonicity" to determine which books should be included in the Old and New Testament:</i> suggests that the process of determining canonicity is currently being "determined", not as the article states: "all of the below canons are considered to be "closed"." I have amended it to read more accurately, since canonicity is closed: <i>Many modern Protestants point to four "Criteria for Canonicity" to justify the books that have been included in the Old and New Testament, which are judged to have satisfied the following:</i> This adjustment based on "justification" avoids discussing <i>how</i> the canon was arrived at, which was <i>not</i> historically simply by following these criteria.

<p>I submitted a few sentences on another view of the canonization. This view is widely held within the non-Catholic Christian community. Yet, it and my links were edited out. I believe that since the sentences were accurate, that they need to be in this article (someone also removed them from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> article as well). Otherwise, this article is mainly a Roman Catholic point of view article, along with those who accept that explanation. I plan today to add the comments and links back in it.

<dd>One thing must be emphatically stated. The New Testament books did not become authoritative for the Church because they were formally included in a canonical list; on the contrary, the Church included them in her canon because she already regarded them as divinely inspired, recognising their innate worth and generally apostolic authority, direct or indirect. The first ecclesiastical councils to classify the canonical books were both held in North Africa-at Hippo Regius in 393 and at Carthage in 397-but what these councils did was not to impose something new upon the Christian communities but to codify what was already the general practice of those communities. (F. F. Bruce<a href="http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/ffbruce/ntdocrli/ntdocc03.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/ffbruce/ntdocrli/ntdocc03.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).</dd>

<dd>"The first express definition of the New Testament canon, in the form in which it has since been universally retained, comes from two African synods, held in 393 at Hippo, and 397 at Carthage, in the presence of Augustin, who exerted a commanding influence on all the theological questions of his age. By that time, at least, the whole church must have already become nearly unanimous as to the number of the canonical books; so that there seemed to be no need even of the sanction of a general council." [citing Philip Schaff, 519]</dd>
<dd>In defining which books composed the New Testament canon, these councils did "not impose any innovation on the churches; they simply endorsed what had become the general consensus of the churches of the west and of the greater part of the east." [citing F. F. Bruce, 97] (Corey Keating (PDF)<a href="http://www.ntgreek.org/SeminaryPapers/ChurchHistory/Criteria%20for%20Development%20of%20the%20NT%20Canon%20in%20First%20Four%20Centuries.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ntgreek.org/SeminaryPapers/ChurchHistory/Criteria%20for%20Development%20of%20the%20NT%20Canon%20in%20First%20Four%20Centuries.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).</dd>

<dd>So although the consensus was not perfect, by the end of the fourth century the New Testament canon is officially fixed in the sense of being ecclesiastically defined and universally accepted. From this time on there was no real challenge to the canon until the time of the Enlightenment. (S.

<dd>I think that "the theory that the Christian Bible was not known until various local and Ecumenical Councils" is a bit of a straw man. Who really advocates such a theory? Which ecumenical council ever attempted to define a biblical canon? I don't think it was until the Council of Trent, which did so in response to Luther's attempt to remove various books from both the Old and New Testaments. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 16:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, actually an Ecumenical Council never did define the canon, thus the canon is different today between Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, etc. The Catholic Church claims the Council of Trent is Ecumenical, but only they believe that claim. The "local council" for Catholicism is the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Rome_8ad1.html" title="Council of Rome">Council of Rome</a>, but this is disputed. The "local councils" for Protestants are Hippo and Carthage, but these are disputed. There are Christians who believe that these councils, rather than defining the canon, merely "affirmed" a canon that is supposed to go back to the Apostles. Of course this is a belief, truth by assertion, there is no evidence of an Apostolic Canon other than the "Law and Prophets". 209.78.17.15 20:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This paragraph is interesting, but off-topic (it has nothing to do with the Canon per se) and controversial. In the prefaces to the <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html#The_Stuttgart_Vulgate" title="Vulgate">Stuttgart Vulgate</a>, its publishers suggest that this prologue was written by <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelagianism.html" title="Pelagianism">Pelagians</a>. Speculation that the prologue was written by a 5th century Latin-speaking Pelagian seems more plausable (or less implausable) than authorship by a 2nd century Greek-speaking Marcionite. Fairness would seem to require inclusion of alternative hypotheses, which would make this off-topic thread even longer than it is. I suggest moving this paragraph to <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcion.html" title="Marcion">Marcion</a>.</p>

<dd>I think both of those sections were helpful and not off topic. It is still dealing with the Biblical canon. Both of these movements use a majority of clearly biblical works that most Judeo-Christians can agree upon, their use of others books is just as important as mentioning the early Canon's inclusion of certain non-canonical works, and the use of Apocrypha by Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics. Including the Koran, or including the Lotus Sutra would be attempting to include world religious. Saying that Mormons use the KJV plus some other texts that they believe are ancient is clearly on topic. I propose restoring these sections.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 01:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for commenting. The book of Mormon has nothing to do with Bible Canon. It has to do with Mormon Religious Canon which accepts the entire Bible cannon unaltered as one of it's holy books. Saying that any sect uses other books in conjunction with the Bible doesn't add to this article. For the sake of your position you might as well add a sentance or two saying "other Christian sects also use other books as well as the Bible such as" and include wikilinks to various religions.

<dd>HI thanks for commenting. Please see the Wiki article POV and minor views that are not held by many. In the event that a view is held by a very small percentage (and in this case it's less than a percent of all people who study the cannon) then this is not the place for that view. Anyone can come up with a belief about anything, but that does not make it valid to the discussion. I could start my own religion right here and now but it wouldn't be properly pertinent to the article. here is the link:"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view</a>", "If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not."

Or do they consider it sacred scripture along with the KJV of the 'bible'? If the latter, I can understand the position of not wanting those things mentioned in this article. But, if Mormons consider all of their scripture as their 'Mormon Bible', then we must mention it. Also, Coleman Glenn, great info on the Swedenborgian stuff.

<p>Is this Disciples of Yeshuwa dispute on the canonosity of the Pauline Writing a major enough point to stated without caveat?

<p>I was seeking fellowship in my local area with disciples of Yeshuwa so I did a google search which revealed many entries, yours included. I was intrigued with your particular site in which reference was made to the "relevance of the Disciples of Yeshuwa". In my humble opinion they are very relevant. Their web site document on 'Christian corruptions of scripture' is an absolute eye-opener in itself. In particular I was absolutely shocked to find that the apostle Paul completely corrupted the words of Deuteronomy 25:4 "You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain". Until I read the disciples of Yeshuwa document I was not aware that the apostle Paul dared in 1 Corinthians 9:9,10 to question the command of Almighty God. Paul, whilst quoting the words of Deuteronomy 25:4, had the sheer audacity to write that "GOD IS NOT CONCERNED WITH OXEN IS HE?. Or is He speaking ALTOGETHER FOR OUR SAKE?". He then proceeds to answer his own question by writing "YES! FOR OUR SAKE IT WAS WRITTEN" ( 1 Corinthians 9:9,10). How could anyone dare to write that "GOD IS NOT CONCERNED WITH OXEN"?. It is obvious that Paul's corruption of the words of Deuteronomy 25:4 was to satisfy the lust for greed of, not only himself, but also of his christian clergymen. I am sure that I speak for many when I say that the disciples of Yeshuwa' web site is a very welcome breath of fresh air showing up the cob-webs and lies of christianity for what they are.

In the grand scheme of Bible readers the percentage of people that would take into consideration the view point of the church you cite it would be so infintesimmaly small that I could not even calculate it.

<p>The introduction describes the canon as exclusive and as closed; I assume these two words mean the same thing: that books not explicitly included in the canon are explicitly excluded. I do not think that this is true. The canon of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Trent_988c.html" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a>, for instance, lists a set of books that are definitely intended to be considered canonical, but it does not say that other books not mentioned, but typically found in bibles at that time (e.g. <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer_of_Manasses_f47c.html" title="Prayer of Manasses">Prayer of Manasses</a>) are definitely excluded from the canon. A later determination might include them. Trent is one of the few canons I have actually read. The few others I have read or read about have excluded a book or two by name to be definitely rejected (e.g. <a href="../../../2/_/e/2_Esdras_3513.html" title="2 Esdras">2 Esdras</a>), but make no other claims of exclusivity or closure. Perhaps there are some exclusive canons decreed by some Protestant bodies, but these should be noted on a case by case basis.

<dd>Thanks for the citation, Lostcaesar. I look forward to following up with Denziger. I find the language of the CCC to be inconclusive. The list is complete (<i>integer</i> in Latin) but the complete list only "includes" (<i>implicat</i>) the named books; it is not said to exclude any particular apostolic or prophetic work, like <i>Prayer of Manasses</i>. There is no indication that the named books make up the whole of the <i>elenchus integer</i>. The wording in Latin seems even a little bit weaker than the wording in English.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest qualifying the word. I suggest that "exclusive" is not necessary in the first sentence and can be dropped. I suggest the third paragraph be modified as follows:
<dl>
<dd>At this time the canons below are often considered to be <i>closed</i>: additional books cannot be added. By contrast, an <i>open</i> canon would allow additional books, should they meet the criteria. Generally, the closure of the canon reflects a belief that public <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revelation.html" title="Revelation">revelation</a> has ended, and that texts from that period can be collected into an authoritative body of work.</dd>

<p>This claim is already covered in the article:</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah.html" title="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>, compiled by the second century, describes some of the debate over the status of some books of <i>Ketuvim</i>, and in particular whether or not they render the hands "impure". Yadaim 3:5 calls attention to the debate over <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_of_Songs_bf66.html" title="Song of Songs">Song of Songs</a> and Ecclesiastes. The Megillat Ta'anit, in a discussion of days when fasting is prohibited but that are not noted in the Bible, mentions the holiday of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purim.html" title="Purim">Purim</a>. Based on these, and a few similar references, <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Graetz_5469.html" title="Heinrich Graetz">Heinrich Graetz</a> concluded in 1871 that there had been a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Jamnia_95b9.html" title="Council of Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a> (or <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavne.html" title="Yavne">Yavne</a> in Hebrew) which had decided Jewish canon sometime in the late 1st century (<i>c.</i> 70–90). This became the prevailing scholarly consensus for much of the 20th century. However, from the 1960s onwards, based on the work of J.P. Lewis, S.Z. Leiman, and others, this view increasingly came into question. In particular, later scholars noted that none of the sources actually mentioned books that had been withdrawn from a canon, and questioned the whole premise that the discussions were about canonicity at all, asserting that they were actually dealing with other concerns entirely.</p>
<p>Today, there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish canon was set.</p>

<dd>Well, two immediate thoughts: (1) the paragraphs and sections in general do not always have a good lead sentence, nor do they flow from one to the other. That is a basic sort of structural issue. (2) The Septuagint is covered twice, once in the section on Judaism briefly and once under Christianity. That is because the article is not sure if is to be structured around topics (Jewish canons and Christian canons), or chronology (where the Septuagint is treated as a scriptural canon in its proper time). Lastly, the article does not seem to have an end in view (current canons) with the description flowing there (tracing the time when the canon became permanent in the sense that it can be seen as continuously accepted by a group from X time to today). That is the kind of thing I had in mind. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 20:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first sentence seems to be the mush left over from years of edifighting. "The biblical canon is a list of books written during the formative period of the Jewish or Christian faiths, which hold these books to be inspired by God and to express the authoritative historical relationship between God and his people." My comments on a slow Sunday night:</p>
<ul>
<li>a)The "list" wasn't written during the formative periods, the books were. The "list" was decided later. (For Catholics, 1500 yrs later, Council of Trent (This is untrue, for Catholics, and I believe all Orthodox churches, the "list" was compiled at the Third Council of Carthage (See <a href="../../../c/o/u/Councils_of_Carthage_fc08.html" title="Councils of Carthage">Councils of Carthage</a>) in 397 A.D. The Council of Trent merely reaffirmed that councils canonical list. --Brettbarnes 18:18, 4 March 2007 (UTC))</li>
<li>b)Jews dont consider the NT Canon to be inspired by God, which is what this sentence claims. (Either that, or it clams that the "lists" believe themselves to be inspired, not sure which is worse)</li>
<li>c) I'm sure "authoritative historical relationship" must mean something, but I'm not sure what it is, certainly doens't belong in the first sentence of an introduction.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and <b>which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the Tridentine Council [ <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Trent_988c.html" title="Council of Trent">Council of Trent</a> ]</b>.</dd>

You can't defend something, the canon of the bible, that, according to this poorly manipulated introduction, didn't even exist at the time. So, the Council of Trent was convened to defend the Canon of holy scripture that was defined at the Third Synod of Carthage in 397 (See <a href="../../../c/o/u/Councils_of_Carthage_fc08.html" title="Councils of Carthage">Councils of Carthage</a>) . Saying that the Council of Trent was the first and only council to define the canon of scripture is historically dishonest. Ironically enough, if it had not been for the Protestants, the Council of Trent would not have been necessary, and yet, Protestants try to use this council as some sort of proof of a missing canon of the bible up until that point--Brettbarnes 18:11, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I too am unhappy with the intro, both for the reasons mentioned above and because of the colorful language describing the treatment of non-canonical works. A few gripes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of all literature ever written, even of all religious literature ever written, is not "canonical". It is hardly surprising that some of that literature has been outlawed and destroyed, not to mention simply forgotten and lost, but this hardly seems relevent to this article. Presumably, what the editor meant to say was that some <i>biblical</i> literature has been outlawed and willfully destroyed.</li>
<li>I find the contention that some biblical literature was outlawed and willfully destroyed to be disputable at best. Failing to explicitly include a book in the canon is not the same thing as outlawing or destroying it. Even explicitly rejecting a book from a canon, <i>a la</i> Luther or Westminster, does not constitute outlawing or destroying it.</li>
<li>To support his contention, the editor cites the hypothetical <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Jamnia_95b9.html" title="Council of Jamnia">Council of Jamnia</a>. Needless to say, there is no documentation of this council ever outlawing or destroying any book. It does seem probable, assuming this council actually occurred, that it failed to include <a href="../../../2/_/e/2_Esdras_3513.html" title="2 Esdras">2 Esdras</a> in its canon, but as I said above, this does not constitute outlawing or destroying 2 Esdras.</li>
<li>I seem to recall reading somewhere that 2 Esdras was explicitly rejected from the canon by some mediaeval eastern regional council or other. If this it true, then it <i>might</i> explain the absence of 2 Esdras from the Septuagint, and the subsequent loss of the complete Greek text. It <i>might</i>. But even so, losing is not the same thing as outlawing or willful destruction. I know of no evidence that 2 Esdras was deliberately eradicated. At any rate, it is readily available today in the King James Bible and many other versions, and has never been lost in the West. Destruction seems too strong a word.</li>

<p>the article states that "2 of Esdras might include 1 Esdras; Esther, Jeremiah and Daniel might include their Septuagint additions" in order to try and give the impression that the early Christians believed some of the Apocrypha to be canonical. This is simply unfounded from the data here presented and is more akin to trying to squeeze in books that really are not mentioned. The list clearly accords with the Hebrew canon of the present day, and the OT canon accepted by the Protestant churches. "2 of Esdras" is clearly the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, which in the Jewish canon were originally considered as one book of Ezra. And to suggest that the "Esther, Jeremiah and Daniel might include their Septuagint additions" as being implied in this manuscript is ridiculous, as where are the mention of other Apocryphal books like Maccabes, Widsom of Ben Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) Wisdom of Solomon, Judith etc?</p>
<p>Clearly, the versions of the books that are being referred to in this AD100 manuscript are the Hebrew, Masoretic text versions, and not the Septuagint versions along with its apocrypha.

It is most famous for containing a copy of the "long lost" <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didache.html" title="Didache">Didache</a>, which was originally written in the first century.

<dd><i>The list clearly accords with the Hebrew canon of the present day</i>, says an editor above. Replace the word <i>clearly</i> with <i>plausibly</i>, and I would agree. But very little is <b>clear</b> regarding the Christian canon before the reformation, except that many different and conflicting lists were circulated. Remarkably, the synopsis in <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Hierosolymitanus_e015.html" title="Codex Hierosolymitanus">Codex Hierosolymitanus</a>, also called the Bryennios canon, does not mention Lamentations. This is a major oversight; it seems more plausible that Lamentations was implied as being included in Jeremiah, as in the LXX. But the LXX also includes Baruch and the Letter of Jeremy in its Jeremiah. Hmmm. So it's not so clear. Especially if you recall that Athanasius explicitly mentioned that Baruch and the Letter are in Jeremiah in his Old Testament canon, which like the Bryennios list was quite restrictive. Hmm. Of course, the Jewish scholars at Jamnia and elsewhere sometimes counted Lamentation as part of Jeremiah too; it seems unlikely that they though that Baruch "defiled the hands" along with the rest of Holy Scripture. Hmmm. I'm not seeing much that's clear here. I lean towards the position of the anonymous editor (regarding contents of the Briennios canon, not the allegation of R.C. bias, and not the date of the list), but wouldn't use the word <i>clearly</i>. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 14:23, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A further note: the order of the books is unusual, the Torah is split up. This makes the list an odd bird indeed, and we can not trust to our usual assumptions. Furthermore, if the reference is right and the canon dates from the 1st century, then it is even odder, and we are looking into a world about which we know very little.

<p>The Christian canon section is almost 100% OR, with very few secondary citations. It gives some blockquotes, not always properly sourced, but it is difficult to see if these texts properly apply to the context. The section often merely lists information without putting it in context or even in prose. Much of the info seems oftopic or unnecessary (the huge section on Marcion, and the section on the Diatessaron, for example). I believe that a proper cleanup would require the introduction of sourced into and the omission of the OR or out of context listings. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 08:57, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would propose that we examine the material on the canon from the History of Christianity article, which I qoute below with inline ref's visible, and consider using it instead of the current text as a base to which more material may be added as it becomes avaliable with proper citations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Biblical canon is the set of books Christians regard as divinely inspired and thus constituting the Christian Bible. Though the Early Church used the Old Testament according to the canon of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> (LXX), the apostles did not otherwise leave a defined set of new <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scriptures.html" title="Scriptures">scriptures</a>; instead the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> developed over time.

<dd>This might be fine as an added overview, though it has errors, but no reason to delete fully referenced details currently in the article that have been stable for some time now. 75.14.220.213 20:07, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For all we know, this article IS fully referenced. Look at the large reference section. Wikipedia did not always require inline citation, and many of the oldest articles are referenced, just using a different referencing system. Wikipedia has changed, and with the development with footnote coding and stricter verifiability requirements, we now basically require an inline citation to all new information, and disputed/controversial facts. However, information that has been in the article since before those rules were made shouldn't be blanked, because for all we know, all the information can be traced back to the sources in the reference section. Therefore, I would ask that LC take a look at the state of the article in 2005 and before to get an idea of how things were back then. Perhaps we could try to contact individuals who introduced the content to see if they can't help us with these sourcing issues. But blanking longstanding content is a bad idea.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 01:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have decided to raise issues one by one. By first is on the Bryennios List. First, I would like to thank the anon editor who has taken care to make certain ammendments here. However, there are still problems. The article gives an except of the OT canon, but no source. I would like to know what the source is for the actual material of the list. Second, there are some OR problems insofar as there are links which assume certain texts are to be associated with others. For example, it gives "2 of Chronicles" linked with "books of chronicles". However, it also says "4 of kings", and then again "kings" linked with "books of kings". In my understanding there must be some conflation or confusion here. Lastly, I do not understand the claims about the NT in regards with the list - does it have a NT canon also? <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 09:35, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The source for the <i>Bryennios List</i> is Jean-Paul Audet, “A Hebrew-Aramaic List of Books of the Old Testament in Greek Transcription,” Journal of Theological Studies, new series, I (1950), 135-54. The list says: 4 of Kings (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_Samuel_5b87.html" title="Books of Samuel">Samuel</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Books_of_Kings_a671.html" title="Books of Kings">Kings</a>). Does it have an NT canon? That I don't know, that claim is being advanced by <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">User:Rwflammang</a>. Personally, I suspect it does not. <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex_Hierosolymitanus_e015.html" title="Codex Hierosolymitanus">Codex Hierosolymitanus</a> includes a "synopsis of the Old and New Testaments in the order given by St. Chrysostom"<a href="http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc02/htm/iv.v.cdiii.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc02/htm/iv.v.cdiii.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> but I don't personally know what that is. 75.0.10.48 22:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As an aside, for informational purposes, Swete's 1914 <i>Introduction to the OT in Greek</i> is online, for example here: <a href="http://rosetta.reltech.org/cgi-bin/Ebind2html/TC/SweteIntro?seq=211" class="external autonumber" title="http://rosetta.reltech.org/cgi-bin/Ebind2html/TC/SweteIntro?seq=211" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. That might answer some questions. Of course it doesn't have Audet's <i>Bryennios List</i> which dates from 1950. 75.0.10.48 23:15, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
