<p>I'm not sure it's you, but I think it is. I had just put _quite_ a bit of work into fixing up citations and the like. Much of that is now gone. For example, the "media knowledge" section. I had fixed up the citations. I had factually corrected the section. I had the Miami Herald in there. All gone. If it's you, and the edit history is getting complicated. Then <b>please</b> be more careful. I've spent literally hours trying to get those details right, and it's frustrating to see it all get zapped away for no good reason. Thankyou.</p>
<p>If it's not you, my apologies. Can you figure out who it is? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 12:38, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. I'll try to sort it out. I had just been about to finish incorporating exactly that material in an organized and cited fashion. Frustrating. The article had turned into a _complete_ mess a couple hours ago. Was just horribly organized and redundant and poorly written. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 12:44, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see what's happening. I had been working on "Events". I saw your new "Failure to Act" section in the TOC because it's so large. It contains pretty much the same material that I had just been working on in Events, and in the same order. So, I thought you had just overwritten Events. There's quite a bit of redundancy between the two now. But, I apologize, you didn't overwrite me, I just read the page wrong. In turn, I suspect you may have missed my work on Events, which contains just about the same stuff. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 12:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with you that we could separate Foley's actions usefully. I'm hesitant to package the rest up as "Failures to act", as that is suggestive. I also don't know that anyone has criticized anyone but the leadership on this. Alexander, for example, hasn't gotten much heat. Nor has Reynolds. They both passed it along. The heat's really on Hastert &amp; Shimkus.</p>
<p>It might be useful to separate this out into a section on public knowledge (media &amp; pages rumors) And a second section on Congress reaction. It's a bit hard to do that while keeping the timelines intact though. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 13:06, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's almost midnight here, so I'm checking out. If you sort out "Events" into sections, and I don't object in principle, then be mindful of two things. First, some of the refs are multiply cited, and I think you need the first full cite as the first. Second, try to keep the timeline clear across sections. Thanks. Sorry I got irritated. My bad, I just got so frustrated when it falsely appeared the last few hours had gone for nought. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 13:10, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey, no worries man. I'm not making major changes to the article due to realizing that I have a very unorthodox view of the scandal. I'd rather point out possibilities and make minor changes. (I reread the Mel article and was wrong about it. I pulled his name off the list of clinton pardon page and didn't realize that there were two levels of 'pardons' there, pardon and commutation.) My civics classes were much too long ago. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 17:18, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Biblio, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Foley_scandal&amp;diff=79448603&amp;oldid=79447351" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Foley_scandal&amp;diff=79448603&amp;oldid=79447351" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> a minute ago you inadvertently removed a citation antecedent. When a reference is named, that mean that citations further down likely depend on that information. Without the prior, those later references will be null. Please be careful to check for that. I'm not sure how to avoid this issue without have an enormously long and redundant reference section. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 13:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nevermind, my bad. I didn't see that you had moved that paragraph with the ref down. I assumed it was just cut. Sorry. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 13:16, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
