<dd><i>However, according to scholars, inspiration is not extended to the transmitted texts or the translation of those texts; rather, it is the original documents (called the autographa) that are inspired.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I changed the word scholars to the names Zuck and Campbell, since that is all the reference supported. I wonder how true this claim is concerning Christianity. Certain Christian groups, it would seem, teach something different. For example, certain ecumenical councils have accepted parts of texts as inspired that, it would seem, were not part of the autograph; also, Matthew in its Greek version seems to be the accepted text, without trouble over searching for any Hebrew original. Whatever the case, the autographs being lost it seems that often the role of the Christian Church in the development of scripture is incorporated by many theological interpretations, and this “back to basics scholarly reconstruction of the autograph” seems to be a particularly arcane view of inspiration. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 07:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is probably the most common Protestant view.

<dd>"While many theological viewpoints would be willing to say the Bible is inspired, one finds little uniformity as to what is meant by inspiration. Some focus it on the writers; others, on the writings; on the readers. Some relate it to the general message of the Bible; others, to the thoughts; still others, to the words. Some include inerrancy; many don’t. Formerly all that was necessary to affirm one’s belief in full inspiration was the statement, “I believe in the inspiration of the Bible.” But when some did not extend inspiration to the words of the text it became necessary to say, “I believe in the verbal inspiration of the Bible.” To counter the teaching that not all parts of the Bible were inspired, one had to say, “I believe in the verbal, plenary inspiration of the Bible.” Then because some did not want to ascribe total accuracy to the Bible, it was necessary to say, “I believe in the verbal, plenary, infallible, inerrant inspiration of the Bible.” But then “infallible” and “inerrant” began to be limited to matters of faith only rather than also embracing all that the Bible records (including historical facts, genealogies, accounts of Creation, etc.), so it became necessary to add the concept of “unlimited inerrancy.” Each addition to the basic statement arose because of an erroneous teaching."</dd>

<p>I removed this paragraph from the intro because: (1) The first sentence, while apparently true, is a specific historical insight that begs many questions about the secular and religious scholarly work over the past several centuries; there's a whole book to write just on that one issue. (2)The second sentence confuses secular and religious scholarly work, and part of it is also overly specific for the intro (specific possibilities of archaeological sites matching up with biblical descriptions-- there's a whole book's worth of material right there too). ... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenosis_581f.html" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> 17:14, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is the previous removal from the intro. This is good stuff, but too POV and too specific for the intro of this article. It includes sources for the Chicago statement on inerrancy, and a historical assertion of perceived inerrancy by Geisler and Nix, as well as a very specific reference to Philo of Alexandria as a citation to belief in sacred texts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Belief in sacred texts is attested to in Jewish antiquity,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and this belief can also be seen in the earliest of Christian writings. Various texts of the Bible mention Divine agency in relation to prophetic writings,<sup id="_ref-Original_Source_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Original_Source" title="">[2]</a></sup> the most explicit being 2 Timothy 3:16: "<i>All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice.</i>" However, the Bible neither gives a list of which texts are inspired and their exact contents, nor a precise theological definition of what inspiration entails.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In their book A General Introduction to the Bible, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Geisler_7f55.html" title="Norman Geisler">Norman Geisler</a> and William Nix wrote that the: "process of inspiration is a mystery of the providence of God, but the result of this process is a verbal, plenary, inerrant, and authoritative record."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Some biblical scholars,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> particularly Evangelicals, associate inspiration with only the original text; for example, the 1978 <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy_c430.html" title="Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy">Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy</a> asserted that inspiration applied only to the "<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autograph.html" title="Autograph">autographic</a> text of Scripture".<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> ... 17:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For Jews, the Tanackh <i>is</i> the Bible. NPOV requires that we include not just the Christian Bible but the Jewish Bible as well. Since many books of the Christian Bible were written after the books in the Hebrew Bible, I think it makes sense regarding the order of presentation to present the Hebrew Bible first. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 09:57, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>well no kidding. My point is, there allready IS an article for the Tanackh. The Christian Bible mainpage is this one. Jews don't refer to thier text as "the Jewish bible". I am going to remove all duplicated material soon except for a concise intro to the main discussion unless there is a wikifiable reason not to.. Remember, the phrase Bible refers to the Chritian text 99% of the time. And the Hebrew Bible has a great page in and of itself and doesn't need to be duplicated.

<dd>Maybe for you Bible means Christian Bible 99% of the time. for me it means Tanakh 100% of the time. So, I gues you and I have different points of view.

<p>I am preparing to slim down and reorganize some of this article. It seems pointless to me to include "The Old testament" in a the section on the "Christian Bible" and the Tanak in the section on the "Hebrew Bible". In an effort to make this a class act article I suggest the following: Focus on the theme Christian "Bible" and divide and explain from there. For other uses of the word Bible (eg Satanic Bible, Mechanics Bible, Koran, whatever) the disambiguation page should serve well. As to the material related to Judaism, include only what is pertinant the discussion on what is commonly called the Bible.. so maybe a concise few paragraphs on History, pre Christ cannonicity, translation, etc. Lets get this article up to par. and as always CITE!!! Don't do original research here, CITE the NOTable Experts.&#160;:) Peace. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 22:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, before any of this happens, we should probably reach consensus that this article should be about the Christian Bible. As it stands, the article is currently about the broader concept of the Bible in the Judeo-Christian traditions. We have an article about the term "Hebrew Bible" which is used by acedemics to describe the set of books called the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> by Christians, and the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> by Jews. So those two articles are basically POV forks of the same topic. Then we have this article, which describes both the Christian Bible, and the Jewish Bible. It seems like there is a lot of redundent material on wikipedia, but I personally feel that the article, in order to be NPOV, should cover both Christian and Jewish bibles. Maybe we can condense material that is already covered in spinout articles, but I think it would be a step in the wrong direction to cut the Jewish POV out of this article, and make the word <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> on wikipedia, for all intents and purposes, synonymous with Christian scriptures|Andrew c]] 22:47, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying remove the section on the Hebrew Bible or not include what other religions use as thier holy texts but The focus needs to be squarely on what people consider the Bible. Jews do not call thier sacred texts the Jewish Bible, Jews don't call it the Hebrew Bible.. The first big section in the article on "THE BIBLE" should consist of what is commonly considered the Bible. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 18:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. "In an effort to make this a class act article I suggest the following: Focus on the theme Christian "Bible" and divide and explain from there" is not a plan for a class act article, it is a plan for a major NPOV violation. "The Bible" as such <i>must</i> include the Jewish and Christian Bibles. The Tanach is <b>not</b> the same thing as the Old Testament. If anything, this article could benefit from some more explanation as to why they are not the same. I agree that there are some redundancies. Perhaps this page should not even exist, and should serve as a disambiguation page for the articles on the Biblical canon, Tanakh, and Christian Bible. I suspect that all valid information in this article can be (if it is not already0 distributed among those three articles. But let's have some discussion before making such a change. In the meantime, if the article is "Bible" any attempt to rewrite this from an explicitly Christian POV is a violation of NPOV and I will revert it. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Slurb, please review the article Tanack. it is not the same as saying "Jewish Bible" The Tanack actually is only the books of the Herew origin that Christians use as well.

<dd>I concur with the two above statements by Andrew and Slrub, and I would like to make the following observations. Part of the confusion I think is on the use of phrases like "Jewish Bible" and "Hebrew Bible". The proper term is Tanakh; furthermore, calling the Old Testament any of the three aforementioned labels is inaccurate. As has been stated previously, these are not the same. The article here nicely avoids this mistake, but many other articles on wikipedia mistakenly treat "Hebrew Bible" and "Old Testament" as synonyms. If there is any improvement to be made to end confusion, it should be on the proper use of these terms. As for removing the content about the Tanakh / Jewish bible from this page, as said above, I reject this, for many reasons, not least of which because it would remove vital information — one's understanding of the Christian bible declines when it is severed from its Jewish roots and context. This is an article on the Bible: a Judeo-Christian entity.<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 12:50, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lostceaser, do you oppose my proposal to turn this into a disambiguation page for <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">Biblical canon</a> (which would describe the process by which different canons formed, and what the differences are between different canons), <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> and a new article, Christian Bibles? By the way, I am not committed to this proposal and have no objection if everyone else wants to keep this article more or less as it is. But I'd like to know your reasoning regarding the proposal. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm torn over what we should do. My first reaction to turning this page into a disambig page was positive. But I was confused on how a Christian Bibles article would look (would it just be this article minus the Hebrew Bible section?), and how this differed from Home Computer's suggestion. It seems like every section we would like to cover has a spinout article to cover it, so we face a lot of the same issues that come up at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. I think it may be best to keep the article in the current format, but perhaps doing a better job of sumarizing content that is covered in the spinout articles.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 15:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Slruben, I am really not sure; my first reaction is, on the one hand, that restructuring is needed, but on the other hand the Bible is a richer concept than just a canonical list, and it is the richer concept that I think people regularly identify with the Bible. Also, though there are different canonical lists for Christian groups, and in that sense different Christian Bibles, concerning the richer meaning there is a different sort of line of division and similarity. Just some thoughts.<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 20:43, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Allright I'm very glad to see all the response this got.&#160;:) Stay with me for a second. The term Bible over 99% of the time refers to that Christian text that has sold more copies than any other book in existance. When one types in Bible on Wiki this article pops up and it appears confusing. The Christian Bible consists of the Old testament (for which we have decided to use the term "Hebrew Bible" and the New Testament for which we have the term "Christian Bible" so now we are opperating with two separate definitions of "Christian Bible" and furthermore "old testament" is a sub heading of the "Christian Bible" section. These are key issues that I feel needs to be resolved to make this article less confusing and more usefull. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 17:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe you are mistaken in the approach of this article. This article is not devided into Old/New Testament section using the strange terms "Hebrew Bible" for the fomer and "Christian Bible" for the latter. Instead, the article is broken into POVs. The first main section deals with the Jewish POV. The second main section deals with the Christian POV. As Lostcaesar so keenly points out, there is a little redundency in that the same basic books get covered twice due to the "Old testament" vs "TNK" issue. So the reason why Old Testament (and New Testament) are subheadings to the Christian Bible section is because they are both included in the Christian Bible (just as Torah, Nevi'i, and Ketuvim get subheadings for the Hebrew Bible section). Maybe there needs to be restructuring, editing, condensing, what have you. But I stand firm in my belief that including the Jewish POV in this article is not only important, but necessary to be inclusive per NPOV policy. Why is it confusing that you get this page when you type in "bible"? Maybe spelling out your concern can help us make this page better. Do we need to make it even more clear that the word "bible" is used by both English speaking Christians and English speaking Jews?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 20:26, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, that's what I'm saying. restructuring, not deletion. I think the old testament section in the Christian Bible needs to be completely reworked, but then what would it be but basically a copy of earlier stated material. This somehow should be reconcilled. And I'm not sure where you get this from but Jews, especially in my family.. do NOT use the word Bible to describe the torah or anything else.. so a Jewish POV on the phrase "the Bible" is not accurate here. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 20:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question for <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">User:Andrew c</a> are you seriously proposing that the factual and true source for the Bible as a whole, which happens to be the Jews and Judaism, and their teachings about the Bible which are the foundations of the Bible (both as "Old Testament" or "New Testament" or as simply the originators of the "Hebrew Bible") should be cut out of this article? So what kind of Bible is this? A Christian Bible? Guess what...big problem...the Christians did not "invent" the Bible, the Jews did! Indeed without what the Jews taught in their Tanakh, the very notion of a "Messiah" makes no sense and has no context, because guess what, Christians did not "invent" the concept of a Messiah, the Jews did! Thus if the fact and truth is too much for anyone to handle, that the Jews are the originators of both the original Bible and of the notion of Messiah, then one should go back and brush up on the basics of the facts about both the origin of Christianity and what Judaism contributed to it. Wikipedia is not designed to convey the "pure theological view" of any one group, rather, as an encyclopedia it conveys the facts. And the facts are that (a) First there was a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> and a <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> held and taught by Judaism for Jews only, and <i>that</i> is most certainly referred to as <i>The Bible</i> by Jews and by Judaism (since all the word "Bible" means is "book" a very innocuous word, if ever there was one.) Then (b) along came the early Christians and built a story about a <i>Jewish</i> person called Jesus who was convinced that he was the Jewish Messiah and followers that came after him postulated that he qualified based on passages in the Hebrew Bible (they did not bring proofs from any other sources - because there were none, it was all a Jewish in-house affair), then the followers of Jesus decided that the world needed a "New Testament" so they wrote it, and the only way a "New Testament" makes any sense in the first place is if there must be a reliable entrenched "Old Testament" in place already that was always accepted as true and withstood the test of time. So let's resist <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism.html" title="Revisionism">revisionism</a> to pretend that Christianity and the New Testament had an "immaculate conception" and came out of thin air when in fact and in truth both Christianity and its later texts came directly out Judaism and the "Old Testament" - and the catch is that Jews do NOT call it or regard it as an "Old Testament," God forbid, but as an ongoing living Torah and Tanakh - so no-one will ever be able to escape or disregard those facts. So to now write a contrived article that will contain only the Christian POV will not do any justice to either Christianity or to the truth. Finally, this article has always tried to <i>respectfully</i> clarify the terminology used by <i>both</i> Christianity or Judaism in their own contexts, and in turn the rest of the article was built around that. It was a good solution and has worked well to introduce readers into the <i>totality</i> of this subject and not just to vainly hoped for Christian version. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 06:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone is arguing for what you are saying. A Christian POV argument would be completely wrong here and no one is pushing for that. We need to come to a consensus on what the world means when the Bible is used and right an NPOV article on that.. the current version is looking great in my opinion. No POV sections, one section dealing with the books of the TNK and the Old testament. Another section dealing with the New Testament. It looks good.

<p>See Lostcaeser's comment below (with a time-stamp shortly before this one). Christians do not adopt the Tanakh as their own. The Tanakh is a stand-alone collection of books in a given order. Christians change the order and recast the books as a story that leads to the new Testament. This gives (or finds) in these books meanings utterly at odds with the meanings Jews find in the Tanakh. Many of the words may be the same, but their meanings are utterly different. For Jews, Tanakh and Old Testament refer to two different things. this may not be how Christians see it, but it is how Jews see it - which means we have two different points of view, and <i>both</i> need to be expressed in the article. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:00, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was stated in the above comments that "over 99% of the time refers to that Christian text that has sold more copies than any other book in existance [<i>sic</i>, existence]", but this is simply an inflated statistic that relates only to the contributor's personal religious experience. As a member of a Reform Jewish Congregation in the United States, I would like to add my experience that we regularly use the term "Bible" to describe our religious text. Granted, in Hebrew we have different terms (most notably, <i>Tanakh</i> and <i>Mikra</i>), but it is a very common thing to simply say "Bible." In our synagogue, we do <u>not</u> say "Jewish Bible" or "Hebrew Bible" because in the circumstance that would be redundant. This article should <i>NOT</i> (IMHO) be slimmed down to discuss only the Christian meaning while relegating all other pertinent perspectives to footnotes or subsections. - <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonah_mishael_9a45.html" title="User:Yonah mishael">Yonah mishael</a> 19:55, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ok, As AndrewC noted earlier, the current layout is presented in terms of POV's here's the current format:</p>
<p>BIBLE</p>
<p>Basic Intro</p>
<p>Jewish POV</p>
<p>Christian POV</p>

<p>Bible basic Intro</p>
<p>Hebrew Bible (identified correctly as used by Chrisitans and Jews) TNK Old test</p>
<p>New testament etc etc</p>
<p>and so on..</p>
<p>Now my question is, was this a deliberate design or is this just how it fell into place? I would argue that this layout is not effective in presenting the info most sought in a clear way. I totally agree that all notable sides of an argument need to be presented but I do not think that dividing into Jew vs Christian presentation is the best way to introduce the Bible especially when "The Bible" (title of the article) is not a phrase Jews describe Jewish sacred text with. The phrase Jewish Bible is actually from the POV of gentiles. otherwise you wouldn't call it the "Jewish Bible".</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to fix this. I do not believe that organization by Religious POV on the phrase "The Bible" is helpful.. it's also a misnomer as the Christian POV seems to encompass everything in the "Hebrew Bible" section. I think almost all of the info currently in the article is good but misplaced.</p>

<dd>Home Computer continues to push an odd point of view. first, the current organization of the article is not according to points of view. It presents the Hebrew Bible first, then the Christian Bible. This is logical as the Hebrew Bible was compiled before the Christian one. Second, neither the article nor anyone else on this talk page suggests that the Hebrew Bible=the Old Testament. In fact they are not at all the same and it is wrong to suggest they are. Finally, in English Jews call their Tanakh "the Bible." Home Computer's claim to the contrary is simply wrong and in this context I wonder if he is trolling. Jews will call the Bible "the Hebrew Bible" when talking to Christians. And yes, when talkin <i>in Hebrew</i> they will call it the Tanakh. <i>Sometimes</i> when talking iin English they call it the Tanakh too. But I have countless books by Jews, and have had countless conversations in temples and synagogues, in yeshivas and in seminaries, where Jews would refer to "the Bible" when talking about the sacred books that predate the Mishnah, whether Genesis (yes, Jews use this word too!!) or Ecclesiases. And when they say "Bible" they are not including the Christian canon. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry but you're wrong. The terms "<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>" and "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Bible_cbdb.html" title="Jewish Bible">Jewish Bible</a>" are never used by Jewish people to descirbe Jewish Holy Books. "Bible" refers to the Christian works. Your perspective is not a Jewish one and arguable shouldn't be used to synthesize the Jewish POV section. Secondly, the information that goes into the TNK section and the Old testament section are going to be identical with the exception of a few sentances for things that happened after Zecharaiah. Because the Old Testament section needs to be updated and since it would contain the exact same info as the "Hebrew Bilbe" section I suggest a Christian vs Jewish format is not fluid, clear nor productive in this article. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 16:23, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, "Bible" and related terms ("biblical") are commonly used among English-speaking Jews for the Jewish Bible specifically. No other term (not even "Tanakh") is as prevalent. Vigorous denials of this will not change the fact, and I suggest that <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> drop his strange claim to the contrary; just because he himself is personally unfamiliar with the fact (or uncomfortable with it) doesn't make it any less true.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"I suggest a Christian vs Jewish format is not fluid, clear nor productive in this article..." On the contrary, such a format (for at least <i>part</i> of the article) is demanded by historical reality: The are indeed <i>two</i> basic canons contending for the title of "Bible" in the dual Judeo-Christian tradition, and no amount of wishful thinking can change this blatant fact.</dd>

<dd>Personally, I have just observed this article in the past but never much touched it. This is partly because I think that the basic organization as it stands is actually more or less what is called for. That it entails a certain amount of redundancy is also not so troubling, since these are indeed overlapping, but not identical, concepts. Though they overlap they are each extremely important in their own right, so the nature of the redundancy is dictated by the nature of the material.</dd>

Suggestion: OK check out the current intro to the "Hebrew Bible" section. It contains pretty much all the info to qualify it self as both a section on the TNK and the Old testament. The intro to that section is worded pretty well. I'm thinking there does not need to be an additional Old Testament section later on with the current wording in the Hebrew Bible section.. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 17:19, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK I've made minor arrangements what do you think about them? The Hebrew section contains all the relevant for both religious POVS. Seriously.. duplicating that would kill the article. That's all the change I'm pushing for. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 17:38, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As long as Home Computer insists that "The terms "Hebrew Bible" and "Jewish Bible" are never used by Jewish people to descirbe Jewish Holy Books. "Bible" refers to the Christian works," I see no hope for productive collaboration. He is pushing his own point of view while denying that of most English-sepaking Jews. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 08:56, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1st, I don't insist that read above conversation with Dovi. 2nd, It's not my POV I was pushing if this article is a list of conflicing POVs I was maintaining that the one held by more should be presented prominently, however I also argue this should not be a POV listing. It should be one article from an Npov stance.. 3rd, don't be so dramatic.&#160;:) We've only been discussing for a few days.. there's always hope for a peaceful concensus. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 15:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I for one do not understand the difficulty. We have established that the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament are different entities. We have established that the concept “Bible” described here is a Judeo-Christian idea. Since the two are thus both related and different, we have established two sections to describe them both, with the earlier text chronologically (and, in the Christian canon, structurally) having been placed first. I don’t see where we can really go from here, or what is wrong with this basic framework. There are many contributions that need to be made to the article and many areas of improvement to concentrate on besides this matter. It seems settled to me. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 09:05, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Lost Cesar, here was the whole difficulty.. the old testament section needed both revision and increased visibillity in the article. A full revision of the section would yield nearly 6 pages of identical information, a duplication of earlier writing onthe Hebrew Bible. Furhtermore, looking more into the definition of Hebrew Bible we find that it is an academic term used to describe BOTH the Jewish TNK and the Christian OT. So what's the logical conslusion of that? That the initial section be revised to include both the TNK and the OT. Now all of the problems are solved. POV sections are GONE, True chonologial listing makes sense, no duplications, more fluid, more clear. And this is moot but technically speaking, Chronologically (technically speaking) the OT and the "Jewish Bible" were written at the same time.

<dd>I think the article could use revision in certain ways and places, but I think energy would be better spend elsewhere. Perhaps you could mention specifics. As for HB vs OT, they are not the same, and if an academic uses them as such then the acedemic is in error, simple as that. Probably an error flowing from obcession with being pc, but if pc = error then it must be sidestepped. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 18:06, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi LC, thanks for responding again. I think all the issues have been resolved in the current edition of the article. You may be right on why the scholarly position to use the Hebrew Bible term as a neutral term for both the TNK and the OT bay be PC. Non-the-less, One section referring to all the books from Genesis to Zechariah (or Gen to Mal depending upon how you order them) should suffice perfectly because the books are in fact identical. The only difference is in what order the books are arranged. That order shouldn't justify a complete duplication of all the material (one copy for each POV) but rather, concise notations as to the difference (only one nPOV copy). Peace &amp; thanks again for discussing. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 18:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have little difficulty with what you say, Lostcaser. I would say not that "Bible" is a Judeo-Christian idea" but an English word (derived from Greek) used by both Jews and Christians although to refer to different things. If this is just a wordy version of what you mean, well, I guess it is just semantics and we agree. I just want to be clear. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 09:23, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Historically speaking Bible (or any european translation of the Greek word Bibia, has since the Bible's (Christian) inception been used to describe the Bible. Fast forward several Hundred years and in pop Jewsish culture it has also been adopted to refer to thier Holy Text as well as exhastively inclusive technical manuals. (the handyman's Bible, etc). It's by no means the main word used or a scholarly (in my understanding) usage. Again, I may be wrong. And lots of times I am.

<p>Home Computer, be warned: you are perilously close to being a troll. It should now be clear to you that for Jews the Bible is their sacred literature and refers to the books beginning with Genesis and ending with Chronicles II. Christians have their own Bible. But for you to continuously insist that "the Bible" must refer only to the sacred literature of Christians, and not Jews, verges on anti-semitism. Stop it. Keep doing it, and I will revert you automatically with no explanation as Jayjg, IZAK&lt; and I have already given you thorough explanations. You ask me to "talk to you directly."

<p>I was asked on my user talk page to take a look at this discussion.</p>
<p>Of course the Christian usage is more common, but only because Christians so outnumber Jews. Jews speaking English normally refer to Jewish scripture as "biblical" and to the canonical collection as "The Bible" or, in an interfaith context "The Jewish Bible" or "The Hebrew Bible". You will notice that numerous Jews, covering a broad spectrum of views on religion, have weighed in and we all have pretty much exactly the same experience of English-language Jewish usage.</p>
<p>Also, of course, the term Bible entered the English language in a Christian context. Few words in the English language before the last century or so entered the language in a Jewish context. That does not mean the the word now continues to have only a Christian usage.</p>
<p>Home Computer, you started this out clearly ignorant of the matter, writing 'The terms "<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>" and "<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Bible_cbdb.html" title="Jewish Bible">Jewish Bible</a>" are never used by Jewish people to descirbe <i>(sic)</i> Jewish Holy Books.' At this point you seem to be acknowledging that you were wrong on the fundamental facts, but you seem to want to draw the same conclusions. I have to say, I tend to agree with Slrubenstein: that looks to me like trolling. And I sincerely doubt that anyone is proposing "nearly 6 pages of identical information": that is almost certainly a strawman argument.</p>
<p>As for <i>Judeo-Christian</i>: that is, to paraphrase Musil, a Christian, plus a Jew, minus the Jew. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:15, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>JMabel, you are correct I was totally wrong. I was not familiar enough with Jewish usage of the word "Bible" it was my ignorance combined with an editorial boldness that started much of the problems. The other issue though was the complete lack of an good Old Testament section. There is quite an extensive "Hebrew Bible" section that yields almost all of the same info that a good OT section would have. It is roughly 6 pages. That's all I meant in that reference. The differences between OT and TNK can be noted rather concisely where the overlapping information is volumnous.

<dd>As a Jew, I am fine with calling the Jewish version of the Bible the "Jewish Bible" or the "Hebrew Bible", the "Tanakh", or the "Scriptures" (and even the "Jewish Testament"). I feel, and I suppose other anglophone Jews feel, that "Old Testament" is a Christian concept, linked to the Christian idea of Jesus being a New Law supplementing the Old Law.

<p>I think there have been multiple people on talk who have said they support the previous version that kept the Jewish and Christian section seperate. However, the article has been edited to confuse this issue. The OT/TNK section is full of Jewish terminology and imagery (and the Judaism template), while the NT section has the Christian template next to it. I think its more confusing now, than it was before, and on top of that, it seemed like multiple people supported the old format.

The current changes seem to make that sort of implementation more difficult. If I wanted to add a section on the <i>Vetus Latina</i>, where would I put it? New Testament? It doesn't work. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 07:33, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope that it was not out of place for a "newcomer" to this page to revise the opening section without a big discussion. I felt it needed to be more balanced, and perhaps an outsider could take a cooler look at the issues. Also the etymology and attributions as to "who did what and when" were lacking in references which could be provided.

<dd>Yeah that link you posted demonstrates that the title "The Hebrew Bible" is the term being used (at least by American authors). I hate to get back to this topic but it seams that in English "the Bible" even though it's used sometimes to refer to the TNK is not the definitive nor scholarly term used for Jewish Holy Books (as the title "The Hebrew Bible" maybe) in the same sense as "The Bible" is for the Christian Holy books, am I wrong about that?

<p>Ok, the introduction has gotten way out of control. Every usage of the Word Bible is now being presented and it doesn't look good.</p>

<p>1. The sacred book of Christianity, a collection of ancient writings including the books of both the Old Testament and the New *Testament.</p>
<p>2. The Hebrew Scriptures, the sacred book of Judaism.</p>
<p>3. A book or collection of writings constituting the sacred text of a religion.</p>
<p>4. often bible A book considered authoritative in its field: the bible of French cooking.</p>

For other uses see Bible disambiguation.", and then I would be quite comfortable and would encourage the removing of the other meanings from the article.

<dd>Home Computer, If it looked so nice at 14:37 why did you change it at 15:40. Dividing the first sentence into two (one of them being an incomplete sentence, at that) does not add value to the article. The previous sentence was inclusive and respects both religions' use of the term "Bible"; the revised sentences marginalizes or creates a secondary meaning. I don't particularly think its important in which order they appear in the dictionary-- it isn't a convincing argument at all for this revision. Besides there was no concensus around that issue. There was simply no discussion of it at all. IMO. --<a href="../../../s/f/d/User%7ESfdan_f912.html" title="User:Sfdan">SFDan</a> 15:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Per Andrew C, there is a concencus among him, IZAK, Slrubenstein, Lostcaesar, and Dovi, with me dessenting that the article be redivided into a Christian vs. Jewish POV on the word Bible.</p>
<p>I think this is a bad idea for reasons noted above. My request is that if it is to be redivided that it not simply be reverted (that will bring us back to square one). Rework the article so as to create an appropriate section for the Christian Old Testament. It is my opinion that there doesn't need to be a section for the old testament because one section could deal with both the TNK and the OT even though the terms are not identical.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it's my opinion that a concensus to remove the OT information would again knock the article way out of balance and into a very specific POV. This is no personal attack on any of you fine editors (except for the editor that threw around racist remarks, shame on you). Let's please come to a FULL npov concensus, and by that I mean please consider what I'm saying, though I'm the minority among us 6 I'm attempting to make sure that very prominently viewed information is correctly represented.

<dd>The Old Testament and the Hebrew Bible differ along too many terms to be discussed in the same section. Not only are they different structurally (arrangement of books), and not only do they have different content (extra, non-Hebrew books in the Old Testament), but they are understood differently. The Christian Old Testament is not a stand-alone collection of texts. Its meaning only comes into focus in relation with the New Testament. This difference is perhaps the most significant, and would be impossible to address if the two are conflated. On the flip side, from a Jewish perspective the Tanakh can and does stand on its own quite well. Lastly, you never addressed my very specific concern above. If I wanted to add information on (just for example) the <i>Vetus Latina</i>, in your restructured article, where would I put that? <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 15:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Open a Bible if you will. In the most commonly published version of all time and the canon accepted by more peolpe around the world than any other, the OT has the exact same books as the TNK, only difference being order of books. The Christian OT most certainly is separate from the NT to the point that sometimes they are even published and distributed apart from one another by Christian publishers. Furthermore, according to our own wiki, the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> is identified as what scholars of Christianity and Judaism agree on as a nuetral term to describe both the TNK and the OT. The Christian usage of the Hebrew Bible should be a part of the Hebrew Bible section, but the difference of book order should definately be noted. Unless you want to rename the Hebrew Bible section to say TNK and write an entirely new section for the OT that has the exact same info as the TNK section with the exception of book order. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a> 19:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, you are incorrect. The biblical canon "accepted by more people around the world than any other" contains books not in the Hebrew: the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox canons contain these books, and the majority of Christians "around the world" are either Catholic or Eastern Orthodox. And I just "opened my bible", and the extra books are still there, fyi. Second, wikipedia does not use other wikipedia articles as reference. Third, you did not address any of my other points. The section on the OT will not have "the exact same info" as the TNK section because it will discuss the various things I mentioned above, and besides it would concentrate more on the LXX. If you could address my other points, especially my question iterated twice, that would be a good advancement of the dialogue. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 20:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, I've been trying to dig up the refference as to which version of the Bible is the most reproduced round the world to replace the link we currently use in that section. And while there are more Catholics in the World, I still think that the majority of Bibles published in the last 50 years(thanks to the huge ammount of conservative Christian Missionaries) have not included the Appocrapha as I noted above. I'm looking for the refferences right now.</p>
<p>Also to address your concerns about the differences between the TNK and the OT in the Hebrew Bible section, there allready is a paragraph that briefly notes the septuagent and apocrapha at the end of the Hebrew Bible section, it's only 2 paragraphs long. Are those the only changes to information you are concerned about? Peace.

<dd>HC, if you want to add content from a Protestant PoV that is one thing, but to reduce Jewish or Catholic / Orthodox content, or to restructure the article around a Protestant framework, is not the way to go.

The Jewish Hebrew Bible/Tanakh and Christian Old Testament reflect both somewhat different texts and also very different perspectives, with the OT being an opening act and the TNK being a whole show. Differences between Protestantism and Catholism/Eastern Orthodoxy may be sufficient to suggest greater differentiation within Christianity. Both the Jewish and Christian Bibles are popularly understood as "The Bible". <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> requires including the different perspectives rather than selecting only one that has majority support either among the editors or within the populace.

<p>We have finally moved past the issue of whether Jews use the word Bible or not, thank goodness. But there is still a fundamental problem with Home Computer's edits, and one symptom of this problem is his opening this section by claiming that "Per Andrew C, there is a concencus among him, IZAK, Slrubenstein, Lostcaesar, and Dovi, with me dessenting that the article be redivided into a Christian vs. Jewish POV on the word Bible." Our NPOV policy insists that we provide multiple points of view. I think there are many points of view concerning the Bible, not just two, not just "Jewish" and "Christisn." Nevertheless, Jews and Christians do hold distinct points of view about the contents and nature of the Bible. The simplest example of this difference is that Jews believe that the Bible is divided into three parts (with subdivisions) and that Genesis belongs in the first section called the Torah. Christians believe the Bible is divided into two parts (with subdivisions) and that Genesis belongs to the first section called the Old Testament. For Jews, there is no such thing as an Old Testament. For Jews, the words "Old Testament" and "Bible" (or the words "Old Testament" and "Tanakh") mean two completely different things. Christians may not agree with this - in other words, Christians have a <i>different</i> point of view. (SR)</p>
<p>The consensus among Andrew C, IZAK, Lostceaser, Dovi, Jayjg and I believe Jmabel is that both points of view must be represented in this article (other points of view may be included too). In contrast, it seems that Home Computer wants to erase the Jewish point of view. Home Computer seems to want to impose a Christian (or perhaps more specifically Protestant) point of view, although I think he believes that this is not a "point of view" but just the truth. Even so, that he may think it is the truth is just his point of view. Either Home Computer does not understand our NPOV policy, or he is a troll. Either way he is acting in bad faith because he admits that he is the sole person opposed to a consensus view yet he keeps changing the introduction to remove the consensus view and impose his own. If he had good faith, he would wait until there was a consensus to support his proposed introduction; he certainly would not revert Jayjg's reverts <i>while admitting that his approach goes against the consensus</i>. (SR)</p>
<p>Home Computer expresses his bad faith in a second way. It is clear that he is ignorant of Jewish views of the Bible - he finally admitted as much concerning the fact that Jews use the word "Bible" to refer to their own canonical sacred literature. It should be clear to him that Lostceaser, Jayjg, and others have done considerable research on the Bible and know what they are talking about. Yet he makes little effort to understand what they have written on this talk page, indeed, he seems to dismiss what they have to say out of hand. I am sure he will dismiss what I have just written out of hand as well, or accuse me of having something against him "personally." My primary objection is not to Home Computer as a human being, it is to the changes Home Computer made to the introduction. This is Jayjg's objection too. It is Home Computer who takes it personally, not Jayjg. I will however say this: Home Computer's stubbern refusal to listen to what better-intentioned and better-informed people say on this talk page, and his insistence on deleting text supported by what he admits is a consensus in favor of his own version which he admits is not the consensus, makes me think that he is a troll. The fact that when Jews tell him what Jews believe he resists what they tell him and insists that he knows better what Jews believe makes me wonder whether he is an anti-Semite. He is welcome to take these final remarks personally if he wishes, but I do not state them as attacks but rather my conclusion based on his insensitive and disruptive behavior. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 17:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I discovered this dispute through <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_attack_intervention_noticeboard_ca1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal attack intervention noticeboard">Wikipedia:Personal attack intervention noticeboard</a> and in my opinion there's no need for administrator intervention. I would like to caution the editors here to observe particular sensitivity in their postings. Religious faith is a matter where people often hold deep beliefs that aren't easily swayed, and where people are often swift to take offense.</p>
<p>Since this appears to be primarily a content POV dispute rather than a civility issue, I'd also like to point out something that appears to have slipped past the collective POV filter. The perspective that editors refer to as <i>Protestant</i> both here and in the article text would be more accurately characterized as <i>conservative Protestant</i>. Broadly speaking, a hallmark of liberal Protestantism is skepticism toward Biblical inerrancy. At the liberal extreme, among <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quakers.html" title="Quakers">Quakers</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian_Universalists_1120.html" title="Unitarian Universalists">Unitarian Universalists</a>, no formal doctrine exists. The most liberal Protestants may regard no definition of the Bible as canonical, and while they value the Bible in its various forms, they regard all forms of spiritual seeking as worthy of respect - hence the Bible exists on a rougly equal level with the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a>, the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rig_Veda_498b.html" title="Rig Veda">Rig Veda</a>, and other sacred texts. I'm not a religious scholar, but I think it's worth pointing out what appears to be an inadvertent shared POV in this article and discussion.

<p>I find this whole debate very surprising, as I have never before heard anyone even suggest that what I call "the Bible" is not really "the Bible." I suppose the following is the quintessential "original research," but the vast majority of Jewish people who I have known (including myself) refer to the Jewish version of the Bible as "the Bible." This may be because the vast majority of the Jewish people I know almost always use the English, and not the Hebrew terms for things. I have even heard Jewish people, and I probably have done this myself, refer to the Jewish version of the Bible as "the Old Testament." I now realize that this is incorrect, for several reasons. However, the fact (or at least my observation) is that few Jewish people realize that there is any difference between what we call "the Bible" and what Christians call the "Old Testament." The point is that, except for those who use the Hebrew word, Jewish people quite often call our "holy book" the "Bible." As a result, both Jews and Christians have the "Bible," it is just not the same collection of writings. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 16:05, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I follow the Bible and Jesus. For the time, I believe that the laws in the Bible were an excellent framework for a civil society and the survival of man. Leviticus is a good example. Leviticus was written by the exiled Jews in Babylonia when they were just trying to survive. Whoever wrote the parts of the Bible could adapt a portion for their own beliefs, or change it completely. The Bible wasn't "faxed from Heaven" and there it was; no. Over centuries of exile, the Jews developed Leviticus to serve their own survival purposes, something anyone should do when threatened with annihilation, they made a new Leviticus that condemned homosexuality. Jesus Christ, centuries later, said in Matthew 7:1 "Judge not, that you be not judged." There is a definite reversal of what is believed in Leviticus, and is what I try to follow. Matthew 5:9.

<p>Given the controversial nature of the article, suggest that we move from bibliography-style sourcing with all sources in a mass at the end to footnote-style sourcing, particularly for controversial sections and disputes between e.g. conservative/religious and liberal/academic scholars. Jewish and Christian perspectives, etc. Footnote-style sourcing permits sourcing individual positions and claims, identifying whose point of view it is and what evidence there is to support it. Understanding that it would be too big an undertaking to switch everything at once, I suggest that we do it for new edits and content added from here on, and particularly that we use it for content added to resolve or distiguish POVs for disputes and controversies, as they arise.

<dd>It was added by ArnoldBeckham on Nov 10. I removed it because no reason was given for it. And I don't really expect one, considering the user's edit history. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheusX303_4aad.html" title="User:PrometheusX303"><span style="color:green;"><strong>Prome</strong></span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PrometheusX303_4373.html" title="Special:Contributions/PrometheusX303"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>theus</strong></span></a><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrometheusX303_6257.html" title="User talk:PrometheusX303"><span style="color:red;"><sup>-X303-</sup></span></a> 14:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good catch. An IP editor removed it. Sometimes vandalism can get lost when multiple cases occur in a short period. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheusX303_4aad.html" title="User:PrometheusX303"><span style="color:green;"><strong>Prome</strong></span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PrometheusX303_4373.html" title="Special:Contributions/PrometheusX303"><span style="color:blue;"><strong>theus</strong></span></a><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EPrometheusX303_6257.html" title="User talk:PrometheusX303"><span style="color:red;"><sup>-X303-</sup></span></a> 22:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I think Wikipedia should stop unregistred user from editing. Most of the vandal comes from them. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyWalker_5153.html" title="User:SkyWalker">SkyWalker</a> 09:26, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with SkyWalker, only registered users should edit, then you can track the changes and hold vandals accountable. Shalom! Biblical follower 14:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
