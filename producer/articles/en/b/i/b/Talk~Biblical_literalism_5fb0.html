<p>This article is pointless. It stood for a year as a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>, and I feel it should stay as a redirect. There is a section there that deals with biblical literalism. I think any efforts should first go to expanding that section. If there is a need for a spinout article after an expansion attempt, then we can open up this article, but until then, we are just repeating content and creating 2 weak articles, instead of focusing efforts on improving the first. The majority of the content here is in list format, clearly not encyclopedic. It is full of POV statements, and a lack of intext citation (and arguably original research). I propose returning this page to a redirect, and any editors interested in this topic, work on the appropriate section of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>.

<dd>Not an outrageous position, but I'd recommend doing it via a merge to the relevant section. Looking closely, I think the relevant section in <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a> should get a NPOV-section tag, as it clearly attacks the bibilical literalism position without giving any support for it. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:48, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Oppose.</b> Although Biblical literalism is founded upon an acceptance of Biblical inerrancy, persons interested in the debate over Biblical literalism should not have to mull over its implicit concepts on which they may already agree. This is analogous to suggesting that the page for "<a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_bonds.html" title="Hydrogen bonds">Hydrogen bonds</a>" be redirected to a giant article for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_bonds.html" title="Chemical bonds">Chemical bonds</a>. There are a number of debates that arise from Biblical literalism that are not explicitly related to Biblical inerrancy. Among these are Creationism vs. theory of evolution, modern geocentrism vs. "Big Bang" theory, Young Earth Creationism vs. "Big Bang" theory, etc. Ultimately, this discussion hinges on considerations of article length, and keeping these articles separate provides room for the inevitable growth of both topics. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">Arbeiter</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/b/User_talk%7EArbeiter_d707.html" title="User talk:Arbeiter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arbeiter_8001.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arbeiter">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>This "article" is terribly formatted. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a collection of debates. Bulleted argument lists are not how encyclopedias are written. If you want to write this in a debate format, there is a separate wiki for such material, but I've discarded my bookmark to it, so I can't give you a pointer. The article should not be written as arguments, it should be written as an encyclopedia article (hint, prose paragraphs, references to the secondary literature) about this hermeneutic, with appropriate balance to maintain a NPOV. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 13:23, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. I'll let this sit for awhile and see if it improves, but if not, I intend to make the literalism section of biblical inerrancy better by merging info from this article there. If one day, that section gets too big and requires a spinout article, then this page can clearly be used, but as is, I strongly feel this is a very poor example of what a wikipedia article can be.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 02:12, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Oppose</b>. This article is so very "pointful" that you can't stand it. I realize that it stood for a year as a redirect to a blatantly POV paragraph which used ridicule as its clenching argument, but the good times just couldn't last forever. I doubt that anyone who believes in the six day <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation.html" title="Creation">Creation</a> of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> chronology would have to draw the limit of God's power at having "Isaiah's trees sprouting hands and actually clapping them".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This page is overflowing with references. Could you provide some insight into what references you feel are lacking? Also, Encyclopedic sections are not always in a prose format. My encyclopedia has lists, tables, charts, and (gasp) even pictures. Wikipedia's <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_layout_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to layout">"Guide to layout"</a> states:
<dl>
<dd>"Articles <b>generally</b> comprise prose paragraphs, not bullet points; <b>however</b>, sometimes a bulleted list can break up what would otherwise be an overly large, grey mass of text, particularly if the topic requires significant effort on the part of readers. Bulleted lists should not be <b>overused</b> in the main text, but are typical in the reference and reading sections at the bottom... Just as for paragraphs, sections and subsections that are very short will make the article look cluttered and inhibit the flow. Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading, and <b>in these circumstances, it may be preferable to use bullet points.</b>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Arbeiter: If your two argument sections have greater eloquence in a list format, don't let Wiki-bullies intimidate you into altering your sections into an incomprehensible form. Censors never want "theses" they oppose to be comprehensible to the average person. Keep working towards clarity, and let them belly-ache away. Don't let anybody lead you to believe that axiomatic statements require references. Avoid using big words like "axiomatic" or "theses" in the descriptive sentences of your introductory article; theological jargon like "hermeneutics" is best left inside theology books. You don't want your readers scuttling away through links or running for a dictionary; they may lose their train of thought, or may never come back. As a matter of style, I suggest relegating Bullinger's "Figures of Speech" and Morgan's "Inconsistencies" to a "Further reading" section. <a href="../../../d/i/x/User%7EDixiePixie_f75b.html" title="User:DixiePixie">DixiePixie</a> 23:46, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Oppose</b>. Biblical inerrancy is already too big and clumsy to include all this information. After more than two weeks, there was no consensus for the merge. Also, this article is packed with references; be more specific with your complaints. <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitch-King_3980.html" title="User:Witch-King">Witch-King</a> 14:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the purpose of writing an <i>encyclopedia</i> article, the citations of scripture really don't count as references. They count as original research, which is forbidden by the core policy <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, in particular "articles may not contain any <i>new analysis or synthesis</i> of published arguments, ..., or statements that serves to advance a position." The entire sections "Arguments against Biblical literalism" and "Arguments for Biblical literalism" violate this policy. They need to be replaced with content that summarizes (and cites) literature (texts, articles, etc...) about Biblical literalism.</p>
<p>To be clear, right now this article has no relevant references. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 16:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly agree with GRBerry. We are not citing sources in this article, per wikipedia guidelines. We are instead publishing original research by interpreting the bible without citing reliable sources. I stand by my original merge proposal. I think energy should be put into expanding the literalism section of inerrancy BEFORE creating a spinout article. Per the guidelines, spinout articles should only be created if there isn't enough room to cover the topic completely in the parent article. As stated by other editors, it seems the motivation behind the creation of this article was a POV fork to counter the "blatantly POV paragraph which used ridicule as its clenching argument". Fix that fist, and if that section gets too heavy, only then move on to here, not the other way around.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 22:53, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Encyclopedia articles talking about the Bible cannot reference it? This sounded like legalistic wrangling to me, and so I checked some encyclopedias; every encyclopedia at which I looked indicated otherwise.<sup id="_ref-Americana_Bible_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Americana_Bible" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-WorldBook_Bible_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WorldBook_Bible" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Britanica-Circum_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Britanica-Circum" title="">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Encarta-Judaism_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encarta-Judaism" title="">[4]</a></sup> The English Bible is not a primary source. Every English version of the Bible is (at least) a secondary interpretation of the primary Biblical texts; each has already been subjected to scholarly interpretation and revised at multiple points in history. It is only the well-published product of this scholarly interpretation that I referenced; see <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">canonical books of the Bible</a>. Additionally, the non-Biblical references I have seen use excess verbiage or use inflammatory speech. It is not my goal to whip Christians into a frenzy; I would rather keep the arguments civilized; see <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>.

<dd>The quotation provides unnecessary verbiage that is more difficult to read and may be perceived as a malicious attack instead of an objective argument. Additionally, Biblical literalists sometimes recognize only the Bible as authoritative, and not new age scholars. Many even refuse to recognize any version not sanctioned by their denomination. These statements are supported by the weight of Scriptural quotations within Wikipedia. There is even a page specifically devoted to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_Bible_1403.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources/Bible">quoting the Bible within Wikipedia</a>.

<dd>"<i>I'll sum up what I said before. Citing a bible verse is no different from citing any other source. We don't tell editors that they can't cite the New York Times or Washington Post or AP or Reuters because there are other open source news outlets. I see no conflict of interest at all in linking to another site when it comes to bible verses. The fact of the matter is that there are a number of well researched, professional bible translations that are copyright protected.

<dd>I'm glad you feel my previous writing supports your view. The debate there was on whether copyrighted bibles could be cited as sources, and I thought that was the most ridiculous thing ever because nearly all of our other sources are copyrighted and we have no problem citing them. I, however, did not comment on when citing the bible was appropriate. When giving a plot summary of what happens in the Book of Revelation, it is of the utmost importance that we cite the actual verses being summarized. However, if we go on to say "666" represents Nero, the 7 headed beast represents the 7 hills of Rome, and give interpretations of what these verses MEAN, THEN we need a completely different source to support these interpretations. Understand the difference? Because this article is not summarizing the plot of various books of the bible, but instead giving conflicting interpretations of the text, we need citations other than the bible itself. Make sense? Furthermore, the "Arguments against Biblical literalism" section seems to be redundent with the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_consistency_and_the_Bible_6601.html" title="Internal consistency and the Bible">Internal consistency and the Bible</a> article and the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_bible.html#Internal_consistency" title="Criticism of the bible">Criticism of the bible#Internal consistency</a> section; on top of that, the content is extremely POV. It flat out states that there contradictions and inconsistencies, a position that wikipedia, in order to be NPOV, cannot take if there are opposing POVs. We can't say "Many Scriptures contradict widely-accepted scientific theories", but instead say "Biblical skeptics believe a literal interpretation of various scriptures apparently contradict widely-accpeted scientific theories". And of course, we need a citation to support this view. It doesn't matter if you personally believe certain verses contradict cosmology; publishing that information here without citation is considered original research.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 13:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The current intro does not meet wikipedia guidelines. The first sentence does not give a dictionary definition of what the topic is. I attempted to do that in my edits, but Arbeiter disagreed with my attempt on the basis of "It is presumptuous to declare built-in beliefs or motives of persons attempting to interpret Scripture". I really don't know what that means or how it applies to my first sentence, which most of the wording was gathered from the previous version of the intro. If there is something specifically wrong or inaccurate with my edit, change it, don't revert it. We still need a first sentence/dictionary style definition. Secondly, the current version does not explain a) how prevelent this view is and b) who specifically holds this view. I attempted to correct this by introducing the wikilinks to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Christianity_6b92.html" title="Conservative Christianity">conservative Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>. This is clearly information that needs to be in the opening of an article, per wikipedia guidelines. Third, <i>a priori</i> seemed relevent and more descriptive. I don't see how that term is POV, but for the sake of conceeding something, this term isn't 100% necessary for understanding that sentence. Fourth, there is no reason under wikipedia guidelines to capitalize the word scripture, which is not a proper noun. I am not married to my particular version, but as outlined above, I find the current version unacceptable. I'd like to work with the editors here to bring the intro up to wikipedia standards. How can we do that?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 21:34, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I think being critical of the phrase "a Christian belief" is a little odd. Do you have a source to back up non-Christian belief in Biblical literalism?</li>
<li>The undue weight section of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy applies. We can't simply present views without saying a) how prevelent they are and b) who holds these views. I'm not saying we need a poll or statistical analysis to say a specific percentage, but we can't ignore the issue and present this as a mainstream/common view (I mean, the first google hit for this phrase is a page arguing that no Biblical literalists exist).</li>
<li>Your comment about truth is also odd. From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth.</i></li>
<li>As for scripture, I am going to ask for help regarding this issue on the capitalization guidelines page. To me, it seems like an issue where God should be capitalized if refering to the Judeo-Christian entity, but pronouns referencing Him should not be capitalized. Likewise, the Bible should be capitalized because it is the proper name of the Christian scripture, but scripture, even though it is capitalized in some contexts outside of wikipedia, should not be capitalized here because it is not a proper noun (and the phrase Holy Scripture is clearly POV and I don't see how it can be used in wikipedia, unless in quoted material).</li>
<li>All that said, I think the article is getting a little better, though I think we should really focus on improving the literalism section of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a> first. I'm sure we can all agree that the section needs a major overhaul.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 21:27, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This should self-evident. If the Bible is ever used as a tool to convert people to Christianity without a universal warning not to take it literally, there will be non-Christian literalists (even if only briefly). However, if you contend that Christians-to-be must become Christians first before they can be wise enough to graduate to Biblical literalism, then we are at an impasse here. What may not be self-evident is that some devil worshippers use the Bible as their source material (a religious 2-for-1 special). If any of them take the Bible literally, then you have non-Christian Biblical literalists.</li>
<li>The (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">page to which you linked</a>) stated that articles need "not include tiny-minority views at all", <i>and</i>... "<i>None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them</i>". It seems that you have made a wonderful case as to why this page should not be merged with Biblical inerrancy. Are you changing your vote? After all, this would be the appropriate page for the belief you claim is so incredibly rare.</li>
<li>I cannot claim that comment. It was a quote by <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giordano_Bruno_86e7.html" title="Giordano Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a>. May he burn in Hell as he did on Earth.<sup id="_ref-StAndrews1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StAndrews1" title="">[8]</a></sup></li>
<li>Using that same argument, you should not capitalize God, since "Yahweh" is His name, and it might offend the other gods. Neither should you capitalize Bible, so as not to show POV against "Light on Yoga", "the bible of modern Yoga". But let me re-iterate, "<i>My biggest concern about its capitalization is consistency throughout the entire article. You changed just one instance, and left the others unchanged. If you decide this is important to you, please do not change the capitalization found within any quoted materials. This would essentially transform them into misquotes. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbeiter_70b4.html" title="User:Arbeiter">Arbeiter</a> 15:10, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</i>"</li>

<ul>
<li>You ignored me completely. It doesn't matter if you personally speculate that there might be devil worshipping biblical literalists. You need to provide a source. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Please, respond by giving a reliable source describing non-Christian biblical literalism. (and even if we can find one person who fits that description, wouldn't that be giving the position undue weight? what if we qualified "Christian" with something like "for the most part" or "commonly" or something that makes it clear that the majority of Biblical literalists are Christian?)</li>
<li>You ignored me again and changed the topic. We were discussing how to present POVs, not when to decide if spinout articles are necessary. The NPOV policy is clear that if we are presenting a POV, we must say who holds the POV and how prevelent it is. This is basic, encyclopedic information that should be included in the intro to the topic. As for your comment, the applicable guideline is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a>. We must be concious of POV-forking. Are we creating a spinout article because the main article is getting too long, or are we creating articles to present POVs in more favorable light. I'd say the latter, based on comments here that seem to suggest this article was created in a reactionary manner to the negative treatment of the topic over at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">biblical inerrancy</a>. I still think we should beef up and fix the section over there, and if a spinout article is eventually necessary, then use this page, instead of working in the opposite order.</li>
<li>Your analogies for capitalization are off basis because "God" is discussed in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28capital_letters%29_3b0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (capital letters)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (capital letters)</a>, and the "Bible" is a proper noun. But since the issue was consistency, not style, would you mind if I changed all the instances to a lowercase 's'?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 15:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't believe you understand your own words. If I had ignored you completely, I would have never responded. Why are you ignoring my axiomatic statement? Arguing only with my admittedly weaker side note upon which the argument does not hinge is a waste of time. Even if you are rejecting may axiomatic statement as such, the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">guideline to which you linked</a> states... "<i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source...</i>" You are the one arguing for inclusion here, so the burden of verifying is yours, and not mine.</li>
<li>You sent me to the "undue weight section of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy". From reading this entire section, it became apparent that your own statements make an excellent case for making a page "specifically devoted" to Biblical literalism. On such a "specifically devoted" page, it warns that "even on such pages, though a view may be spelled out in great detail, it should not be represented as the truth". I have presented solid competing arguments, and therefore represent neither as truth. I understand that you want to include something stating "<i>1) "how prevelent" the POV's are and 2) "who holds these views"</i>", but the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">guideline to which you linked</a> states... "<i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.

As for POV-forking, that is your POV. I have already stated why I spun this page off.</li>

<dd>The NPOV policy is not the guideline covering when and how to create spinout articles. Just because the NPOV policy says extreme minority views can have their own articles does not mean we can ingore the specific guideline available to us in these situations: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a>. The part of the NPOV policy that is applicable to my criticism is not only the undue weight section, but the "Attributing and substantiating biased statements" section as well. We need to say a) who holds a veiw and b) how prevelent they are. I agree that this information needs to be verifiable. I just found it odd that you found one or two sentences in the NPOV policy that you thought supported creation of this article so you repeat them, while specifically ignoring the guideline that covers spinout articles.

"Substa<b>n</b>tial" is a subjective adjective that would normally be too loosely defined for a response. I could have let this slide for the other referrences, but I must object to the application of this phrase to "69 Biblical references"; 69 is a "substa<b>n</b>tial" number admired around the world. Even an atheist would claim references to the Bible are "substa<b>n</b>tial" when applied to Biblical literalism. Utter blasphemy!

<p>The topic in this article confuses the issues of Biblical Inerrancy/Infallibility, but a completely separate belief of Biblical Literalism does exist to an extent. This is a form of extremism, going well-beyond inerrancy and infallibility. Biblical Literalism is what's addressed in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=13&amp;version=47&amp;context=chapter" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=13&amp;version=47&amp;context=chapter" rel="nofollow">Matthew 13</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=4&amp;version=47&amp;context=chapter" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=4&amp;version=47&amp;context=chapter" rel="nofollow">Mark 4</a>. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=3&amp;version=47&amp;context=chapter" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=3&amp;version=47&amp;context=chapter" rel="nofollow">John 3</a> also sheds some light on this subject, as Nicodemus initially took a parable literally. While inerrancy and infallibility are nearly identical and widely-accepted forms of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermeneutics.html" title="Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a>; literalism is completely different. In fact, the Biblical positions of inerrancy and infallibility outright reject literalism, based largely on the Scripture referred to above. On these grounds, Biblical Literalism defines itself as non-Christian. In light of this, Biblical Literalism should NOT redirect to either of the other two articles, and should be classified as not being a legitimate Christian belief. -- Dulcimerist 17:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Christian Dogmatics" by Dr. Franz Pieper, Concordia Publishing House, Volume III page 317 (Translated into English) - "Every word must be taken in its first, that is, its proper meaning, until circumstances contained in the context or an express declaration of the writer compel one to substitute the figurative or symbolic meaning for the natural. If this principle were not observed, human language would cease to be a medium of intercourse. We would forever be in doubt whether a statement is to be taken literally or figuratively, that is, we would not know what the speaker or writer actually means. As the interchange of 'signifies' and 'is,' so also the interchange of the sign and the signified (<i>signum pro signato</i>, or <i>signatum pro signo</i>) results in 'suicide' of language."

In doing some additional reading, it's appearing that true <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_literalism.html" title="Biblical literalism">Biblical literalism</a> doesn't exist, or cannot exist. I know of no religious groups who take this Scripture passage the literal way: <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mark_938f.html" title="Gospel of Mark">Mark</a> 9:43-48 - "And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, 'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.'" Somebody needs to provide verification that Biblical literalists performing these actions do indeed exist, in order for this topic to exist. --Dulcimerist 20:49, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is outrageously non-neutral for an article on "Biblical literalism" to consist of an introductory paragraph, followed by a section on "objections," and nothing else. I took a quick look at the prior history,and there was some material there once. Arguments against on a topic of opinion are rather pointless by themselves.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What is wrong? Has the discussion here scared away everyone who could write a reasonable explanation of the position? (I am not among those who could, but I came here to see the arguments)</dd>
<dd>The position that there are no believers in this today is inherently rather hard to defend. You would quite literally have to check the beliefs of every member of the more conservative churches. if the position is that there is no current citable literature on it, that too would take an extensive survey.</dd>
<dd>Even if both of the above were true, there has certainly been such a view in previous times, and that could serve as the focus of a respectable article.</dd>
<dd>There may also be such a view in other religions than Christianity, such as Orthodox Judaism or Islam. Even if not now, such views must have been expressed earlier. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 00:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

Article is due for a major overhaul. There are plenty of fundamentalists who adopt a literalist view (which is not, by the way, the view that every verse in the Bible is literal but that the historical and narrative expositions are literally (and plainly) true). What the article was describing before was indeed a straw man that nobody believed in. So we need to rewrite the article along the following lines:</p>
<p>1) what parts of the bible do literalists consider plainly intended to be interpreted as literal (Genesis, history of Ancient Israel, historicity of Jesus, miracles, etc.) and which parts do they not (poetic verses, parables, dreams, and stories prefaced with indicators that the text was supposed to be allegorical rather than literal)</p>
<p>2) what churches and denominations adopt the plain reading or literalist standpoint and which churches and denominations do not?</p>
<p>3) what are the controversies surrounding literalism (creation vs. evolution, Jesus seminar, belief in miracles and the "hand of God in history", the choseness of the state of Israel, etc.)</p>
<p>This is a beginning at least.</p>

<dd>What what is the difference between literalism and inerrancy? If there isn't, then we need to merge these articles (which is what I have been suggesting all along). As for question #2, I don't believe anyone has found a single denomination or church that supports literalism, and we have been looking. But if we can find any more verifiable information that can be added, that'd be great. (I'm not against that or anything, I just have been unable to locate it myself).

<p>Sorry to answer your questions fully.. 1. All of it. (per the sources) 2. a. None (per some sources) b. anyone who disagrees with us (per some others) 3. a. No one wants to be called a Literalist. b. Literalists cause racism and mental illness. Granted all the soures on the subject are.. somewhat POV. I'm afraid you've stumbled onto a theologically dirty word.. No one believes in the complete lack of parables but people who believe in the inerrent literal interpretaion of Genesis are often accused of that. So we cite what's there and document accordingly.

<dd>Note that the "sources" you have selected (newreformation.org) are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>. Find sources that actually deal with biblical literalism as it is practiced. This third-rate source builds its own strawman and knocks it down. Hardly reasonable. Your own POV that no one wants to be called a literalist and that literalists cause "racism" and "mental ilness" is not cited by any notable sources.</dd>

<dd>You need to realize that the definition of literalism is NOT that the entire Bible is literal. It's that the historical and narrative parts of the bible are meant to be interpretted literally. In fact, there are many groups who hold to this. This is not inerrancy which holds that the God has inspired the scriptures to never be wrong because inerrancy doesn't make any claims for how one is to interpret the Bible. Literalism makes it clear that unless it is clear from context, the Bible is meant to be read plainly. It's as simple as that.</dd>

<li>the Bible , or parts of it, are true in the literal sense only and that no other method of analysis is acceptable , and</li>
<li>the literal meaning of some or all parts must be true, in addition to whatever other interpretations there may be.</li>

<li>The first position is an exceptional one, and I am not at all sure that any church holds it today--I think it may have been used historically against those who arrived at an allegorical meaning that another arty thought was excessive.</li>
<li>The second is another matter, and is the traditional doctrine of the Catholic church and of the Jewish orthodox position, and perhaps the whole of Islam.

<dd>Yes I think you have the gist of the first position. The second is held by everyone? that believes in Christ. Paul even argued that if Christ didn't really literally exist that he would be the most worthless man of all.. certainly parts of the Bible have been verified by secular sciences and archeology.. it's been overwhelmingly agreed upon by virtually everyone that at the very least SOME of the Bible is true.. so I think we're dealing with the first category in this artcle.

Read the <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a3.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a3.htm" rel="nofollow">Catechism</a> 115-119. Also, there is nothing about "biblical literalism" in the RCC article. And I seriously think that if you asked Wikiproject Catholicism or the editors of the RCC article to help out with the Catholic doctrine of Biblical Literalism, you'd get confused looks. What more, the Catholic position on the interpretation of scripture is presented already at the inerrancy article. Maybe I am confusing what you said, but it sounds like you are suggesting that this article focus in on the Catholic POV of how they interpret scripture? If that is the case, maybe we do need an article like that, but I doubt that "biblical literalism" is the correct title. But I could be wrong. Shall we discuss this with Wikiproject Catholicism?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:51, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You will notice the term I used was "traditional Catholic doctrine" -- but look again at the Catechism--the notes cite Aquinas. To give a WP articles as authority for the content of other articles in the WP is a little illogical. Additionally, I think what concerns most of the editors here is the relationship of this doctrine to the Protestant sects. No fundamentalist Protestant church accepts Aquinas as authority. What we need here are real sources, and those who believe in the doctrine or some approximation thereof are the ones to help find them. I agree we need to find the customary title, and I think we need to more firmly distinguish from Biblical inerrancy, which seems to be a more general position. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>

<dd>You may be right regarding needing additional clarification from inerrency. The intro keeps getting reverted to a very watered down, almost indistinguishable definition from inerrency. regarding Thomas Aquinas, I don't think he is any more a biblical literalist than Wesley or any other protestant figure. The term literalist is just not a real doctrine. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 14:57, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<i>The first position is an exceptional one, and I am not at all sure that any church holds it today</i> -- incorrect. There are plenty of churches who argue for a literal interpretation of the Bible. Most large denominations do not make this a tenet or part of their creeds, but plenty of small churches hold as a belief necessary for membership that the narrative/historical parts of the bible were intended to be read literally. These groups are not "big tent" and they tend to be less visible than the big churches (the largest evangelical churches leave some room in their statements of belief for allegorical interpreters), but they are out there. This really cannot be denied. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 11:53, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Science I think the issue we are coming to here is that many churches accept "parts" of the Bible as literal. I've never heard of any part of the Bilbe as "entirely" literal as people who throw around the term literalist imagine. But as noted above, secular historians and scientists would argue that parts of the Bible are literally true. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 14:53, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more time: Biblical literalism DOES NOT MEAN taking the Bible "entirely literal". It means applying plain reading and a literal interpretation to the parts of the Bible that the specific reader making the literalist claim believes are intended to be interpreted as literal. It is a movement that is specifically geared towards attacking those people who claim that historical narrative and exposition <i>may be</i> figurative (such as secular historians and scientists). Literalists say, "No, when it is clear from the context that the text is intended to be plainly literal, then the plainly literal meaning of the text is the correct and inerrant version". For example, the geneologies from Genesis are interpretted as literal ages by literalists whereas non-literalists obviously balk at human beings living to such ridiculous ages. This is a doctrine that is slightly different from inerrancy which makes no claim for whether a literal intent is ever found in the Bible. The Catholic Church, for example, has obliquely acknowledged that it is more than possible that there is no such intent, but is still a very big proponent of the inerrancy of the scriptures acknowledging the figurative and allegorical intent of many of the scriptures that literalists believe to have a literal intent.</dd>

<dd>Andrew, there are many such churches to chose from, but basically any church that subscribes to a plain reading of the bible without acomodating allegorical interpretation is a literalist church. Many Adventists are such people (though the largest Adventist demonination carefully avoids excluding all allegorical interpreters in their creed, though they strongly caution against this kind of "revisionism".)</dd>

<p>the above article discusses how the term may be less useful than other markers, but still admits that it is a present sociological conceptualization.</p>
<p>I would remind the readers that Wikipedia's job is not to change the discourse but to report on the discourse. It may be that biblical literalism is a misleading, pejorative, or contradictory term. However, that does not mean we can state plainly that it is this way when there are resources that use it as a simple marker. Criticism of use of the term or application of the term is fine, but stating as "fact" that there are no literalists is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>.</p>

<p>I think the definition distinguishing literalism &amp; inerrancy is a good one. Now we need some examples of the use of "literalism", pejorative or otherwise. I think its worth some effort to find recent positive use. Perhaps we can go on to further improvements while we look. Unless I'm mistaken, St Augustine also accepted other means of interpretation, but he wrote an enormous body of work.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should discuss literalism as a reaction against the medieval over-allegories, but I'd need some examples.</p>
<p>it is obvious that those working on this article have very diferent viewpoints of Biblical interpretation, but we should be able to present this one fully --in a positive way, before criticizing it. And I think the wording of the criticism should speak for itself. There is no point in rehearsing the familiar arguemements against the literal truth of the Bible here. Inerrancy (&amp; perhaps elsewhere) is the place. I think they are presented a good many times in WP and not very subtly in the least. I suppose I should say that since i personally regard the entire question as an extremely interesting one intellectually but without the least applicability to my own beliefs one way or another I might be considered neutral. I think we should set a good example to other controversial discussions. A viewpoint needs to be fairly presented before it can be attacked &amp; defended. See Aquinas for the classic method. Let us also accept that the truth is not decided by the best argument. If it were, none of us might be very close to it&#160;:).</p>

<dd>Thank you for your compliments. I encourage you to do some searches. Previous attempts at serahing for a positive use of this term have come up nulll and void which is what sparked the whole, should this even be an article debate (see way above). But now even I am convinced that the popular use of this term warrents its own article.. however here's a question I offer to, if it becomes clear that no notable figure or organizations positively identifies with this term and it's only used negatively, what would your proposal be then?

<p>These two concepts are the same. When people in everyday conversation talk about biblical literalism they are definitely talking about the contextual method. The only controversy is whether Genesis or the miracles of Christ have a literalist context or not.

<dd>As your first analysis shows, you can't even understand the critiques I'm trying to make toward your arguments. I want to accomodate your opinion that literalism is a pejorative straw man, but that is an opinion to be reported, it is not a fact. Literalism as skeptics describe it is the belief that narrative and expository parts of the bible are literal. Do skeptics sometimes uses strawmen to attack this position? Sure! But that doesn't mean that the term itself is a strawman. More than this, you haven't demonstrated that ANYBODY uses the definition you are advocating. In fact, my suspicion is that not only does nobody use this definition, it is a definition concocted by the Conservative Christians to attack those who attack them. If they can claim that literalism is a doctrine that nobody holds then the skeptics who attack literalism look like they are tilting at windmills, don't they? --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously a major source of conflict is over what exaclt literalism is in the first place. The term is used generally, in a pejorative sense, to refer to any number of diverse views held by conservative Christians that generally contradict common knowledge of history, science, and reality. For example, if someone is a Young Earth Creationist, they can be considered a 'biblical literalist' because they assume Genesis 1-2 is a historical narrative. However, this term is very rarely used by the people it is meant to describe (GRBerry, during the AfD, did find a reference from a creationist group that used the term for itself). The problem is there is no defined, self-identified doctrine of 'biblical literalism'. So how do we reflect that in this article? Sourcing is an issue from all sides. I don't know how to proceede, and I don't know enough about this topic to contribute properly, so don't be shock is my participation level lowers. The recent edit warring has also been a turn off. If it continues, I may request page protection until issues can be worked out on talk.

<dd>It's not Wikipedia's problem if the Christian conservatives play a zero-sum game when labels they don't like are applied to them. Relying on the sour grapes and building their own straw men that somehow "literalism" refers to the belief that the entire bible is literal may be what they believe, but it is not the definition of literalism. All we need to do is point out that they don't use the term to apply to themselves. But just because they don't use the term to apply to themselves doesn't mean that nobody uses the term. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:36, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, the actualy quotes (qhich were deleted/removed/reorganised) and citations demonstrate that it's a commonly held belief among all types that people called Biblical literalists believe parables and metaphores should be interpreted literally. That's the main issue here. And that's the main point that should be stressed in the definition.</dd>

I went through the resources very carefully and cited them properly. The sources do not demonstrate that "literalists believe parables and metaphores[sic] should be interpreted literally". That's a mischaracterization of the sources as well as being patently absurd because there is no such thing as such a "literalist". The sources state that there is a sense in which someone can use "literalism" as a lazy-sort of intellectualism and effectively build straw men. I placed this quote in the article as it is actually what the sources say, your paraphrasing was biased.--<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 12:50, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Each one of these articles (and more that were removed) at one point identifies the Biblical Literalist as ones who reject parable, metaphore and symbolism and thus take the Bible at it's literal meaning. The examples used are from Genesis to Jesus to Revelation. Some spoke of the suppose Literalist interpretaion of prophesy ans grotesque because fire would have to pop out of Jesus' eyeballs. somespoke of Jesus life and times, some spoke of obvious flaws in an literalist interpretation with the dispensations in Revelation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The straw man most often used in these articles is to paint different types of Christians as believing something they do not. These sources come from a variety of communities and each points its finger at some type of Christian whether it be all Christians, political right, conservatives, protestants or fundamentals to be call Biblical Literalists due to some stance they've taken that should have been interpreted as a metaphore or parable instead. This seems to be a common theme in our culture, Literalism thrown around as a way to make our oppenents posittion easily defeatable without actually understanding it. The whole truth is much more complex. There are a hundred and one interpretaional techniques and a billion individual applications of those techniques. Nameing anyone one a Biblical Literalist that is more literal than I on any given position is what we're seeing.

<dd>I actually like the current one. You included the relevant information in an appropriate manner. I wrote the above at your request.</dd>
<dd>But now that you mention it, the new version intro is messy looking. That quote doesn't belong there right in with the definition, it should be further down and cleaner, not just thrown in like that. Also The Ewell dictionary quote should be coupled with info on the historical method because that's what it is describing.</dd>
<dd>Basically I like the information that's there right now, edit.. I would rearrange to make the distinction between the historical method and the strawman technique of calling people a literalist more clear. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 20:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I checked out that page and I did find a few things in common: the prose was clumsy, the capitalization nonstandard, the participles hanging, and the pronouns equivocal. We had similar problems in the previous version of this article. There are some obvious differences: literalism is a more immediate and recognizable term. More people know what a "literal interpretation of the Bible" is meant to imply than know what "Hyper-Calvinism" is supposed to mean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not too enthralled by the absolute naming of Hyper-Calvinism as a pejorative in that article, but I don't have enough research about the subject to discuss that there. However, I am certain that here "biblical literalism" is not <i>always</i> a pejorative. Sometimes it is simply a placeholder or a descriptor. Therefore, I would not be content if you stated baldly that "biblical literalism" is <i>necessarily</i> pejorative but would be fine if you could find a citation that indicated as much.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For starters, I'm an Eastern Christian, not an Evangelical, but it seems the anti-Christian polemicists have expanded the definition of "Biblical Literalism" far beyond how it is applied among Protestant Fundamentalists.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Eastern Christianity,unlike Western Christianity, takes a more Platonistic allegorical approach to interpreting the Bible, yet we believe in the Virgin birth, the literal resurrection from the dead, the immorality of divorce, homosexuality, etc. Opponents of Christianity, especially those intent upon normalizing homosexuality, have broadened the definition of Biblical literalism far beyond what it means to its adherents.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Young Earth Creationism, that's biblical literalism, the refusal to see spiritual allegories in the stories of the Flood, Creation, etc., that's Biblical literalism. The funny thing I see is that atheists are frequently more literal in their mocking misunderstanding of the Bible than the vast majority of traditionally minded Christians.</dd>

<p>I think every interpretation from the beginning has included the use of metaphor and similar literary devices within the scope of literalism. Jesus as recounted in the gospels was not speaking of removing physical specks from one's actual eye. Since the most striking literary device in the gospels is the parable, this must have been evident to every hearer and reader, even the least sophisticated. But I would think there would be room for consderable debate about just what is to be taken as a device and what meant literally. The Jewish interpretation for centuries of a hand for a hand, has been: "that is, the value of a hand." (whereas most contemporary criticism thinks the literal meaning was originaly intended, especially because of the similarity with other near Eastern law codes.) <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 17:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly.. that's why the term Biblical literalism is so contentious. Everyone uses metaphores in thier understanding of scripture.. (including Jesus as you pointd out).. yet everyone who uses the term Literalist claims that the accused is not considering topic a,b,or c as a metaphore as they should. And then another person comes calling someone else a literalist fort not believing x,yor z is a parable. A literalist is alsways someone who is more literal concerning any portion of the Bible than the accuser basically.. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 17:57, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Side note, that's the main usage of the term in culture. There are others who've attempted to make a more sensical definition of the word which should also be in the article (and is) but in that sense it seems to be a misunderstanding of a real hermeneutic model. --<a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHome_Computer_010e.html" title="User:Home Computer">Home Computer</a>∴<a href="../../../h/o/m/User_talk%7EHome_Computer_4528.html" title="User talk:Home Computer">Peace</a> 17:59, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just because the literalist is more literal than the accuser doesn't mean that the accuser is claiming that a literalist interprets the entire Bible literally.

<dd>But the sources don't support what you're saying, as I have just pointed out. They support that there are times when anti-religious folk use biblical literalism as a straw man (that's in the article) but they don't support the contention that the definition of biblical literalism is the belief that the entire Bible should be interpreted literally. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was User:71.103.74.182 who had fixed Norman Geisler's name; I just noticed it when I tried to figure out why you were reverting everyone else's contributions to this article. Don't bother with itemizing the changes for me, but I do think it would be a nice gesture if you would examine the edits that you reverted for any other improvements that were lost. The article is never going to improve if it just keeps on going back and forth between two versions, even if your version has fewer orthographic errors.</dd>
