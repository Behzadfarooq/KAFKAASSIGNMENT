<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, the Bible Students who remained affiliated with the organisation under Rutherford adopted the name <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, from a scripture in the book of Isaiah - "'Ye are my witnesses,' saith Jehovah, and I am God.'"

<p>Although the schism resulted in nearly three-quarters of the original membership leaving the organisation, Rutherford and his Board of Directors maintained control of the official organs of the Bible Society itself, including its offices, publications, and official journal - <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Watchtower_7928.html" title="The Watchtower">Watchtower</a></i>. The Annual Report of Jehovah's Witnesses for 2005 reports the active number of Witnesses worldwide to be 6.6 million.</p>

<p>M.L. McPhail, Pilgrim member of the Chicago Bible Students, disassociated himself from Russell's movement at the same time as the New Covenant controversy emerged, and led the <i>New Covenant Bible Students</i> in the United States, founding the <i>New Covenant Believers</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>. The group published <i>The Kingdom Scribe</i> magazine until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. The group still exists today under the name <i>Berean Bible Students Church</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, the <i>Italian Bible Students Association</i> in Hartford, Connecticut withdrew its support from the Watchtower Society and changed its name to the <i>Millennial Bible Students Church</i>, then eventually to <i>Christian Millennial Fellowship, Inc.</i>. They eventually rejected many of Russell's writings as erroneous. The group is now located in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the Bible Student congregations which hold to the writings and views of Pastor Russell refer to themselves under the generic title "<a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Bible_Students_d3ea.html" title="Associated Bible Students">Associated Bible Students</a>". All congregations are autonomous, and despite use of this title, may not necessarily have contact with others. Those using this name are the largest segment resulting from the massive exodus from the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watchtower_Society_7fc7.html" title="Watchtower Society">Watchtower Society</a> in the decade following Russell's death in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>. This occurred after <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Franklin_Rutherford_6e4e.html" title="Joseph Franklin Rutherford">Joseph Franklin Rutherford</a> was elected the new president, and began changing the doctrinal platform and organizational structure Russell had supported.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, four members of the Board of Directors for the Watchtower Society were expelled by Rutherford on a legal technicality that would have equally applied to him.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Directors took issue with Rutherford's actions for numerous reasons as well as insisted he was violating Pastor Russell's will.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> they held the first Bible Student Convention independent of the Watchtower Society. At the second convention a few months later, the informal <i>Pastoral Bible Institute</i> was founded. They began publishing <i>The Herald of Christ’s Kingdom</i>, edited by R. E. Streeter. Although the magazine continues to be published today <a href="http://www.heraldmag.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heraldmag.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral_Bible_Institute_b18d.html" title="Pastoral Bible Institute">Pastoral Bible Institute</a> is essentially defunct, with only an editorial committee publishing the magazine.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> <i>Berean Bible Institute</i> also formally separated from the Watchtower Society in 1918. They published <i>The Voice</i> and the <i>People's Paper</i> magazine. Offshoot congregations of the BBI still exist, but the full number of all Bible Students in Australia is estimated at less than 100.</p>
<p>In December 1918, Charles E. Heard and some others, considered Rutherford's recommendation to buy <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_bonds.html" title="War bonds">war bonds</a> to be a perversion of Russell's <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a> teachings. As a result, they founded the <i>StandFast Bible Students Association</i> in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. The name originates from their decision to “stand fast" on war principles that Pastor Russell had espoused. Opposed to public witnessing, they eventually dwindled in numbers, and then completely dissolved, but not without giving birth to a splinter group known as the <i>Elijah Voice Society</i>, founded by John A. Herdersen and C. D. McCray in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>. They were especially noted for their witnessing and pacifist activity.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, Norman Woodworth, cousin of C.J. Woodworth, left the Watchtower Society after having been involved with their radio ministry, to create an independent Bible Student radio program <i>Frank and Earnest</i>. Funding was provided with the help of the Brooklyn congregation of Bible Students. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> they sponsored and held the First Annual Reunion Convention of Bible Students at the old Bible House used by Pastor Russell in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh.html" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, the <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn_Bible_Students_Association_94cd.html" title="Dawn Bible Students Association">Dawn Bible Students Association</a> was founded (by Norman Woodworth among others) for the sole purpose of again publishing the "<a href="../../../s/t/u/Studies_in_the_Scriptures_aae3.html" title="Studies in the Scriptures">Studies in the Scriptures</a>" series that the Watchtower Society had officially ceased publishing of in 1927. The Dawn began publication of a leaflet called <i>The Bible Students Radio Echo</i> as a method of following up the immense interest in the radio program. This publication was soon made into a magazine and renamed "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dawn_%28magazine%29_bdc1.html" title="The Dawn (magazine)">The Dawn and Herald of Christ’s Presence</a>". It was initially a bi-monthly, and then later a monthly journal. Today, they carry on with publishing work, as well as radio and television programs. Over the past thirty years controversy has surrounded the Dawn as their publishing committee began to espouse more liberal points of view, pulling away from some of Charles Russell's viewpoints, and alienating many Bible Students as a result. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> a group of Bible Students at a Convention in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Collins_67c1.html" title="Fort Collins">Fort Collins</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> formally decided to cease their spiritual fellowship with and financial support of the Dawn Bible Students Association for this very reason. Although not an offshoot group per se, they refer to themselves as "Independent Bible Students". The split was not intended to eliminate or restrict personal fellowship, but rather was viewed as a 'stand for the truth' by ceasing sponsorship of elders associated with the Dawn, and avoiding attendance at conventions held by congregations that supported the Dawn. In recent years attempts have been made to bring the two sides back together, with varying results. A committee that had been formed at the 1974 Convention decided to begin publishing a monthly non-doctrinal Bible Student news and information magazine, called "The Bible Students Newsletter". It has become what is now the most widely distributed publication amongst all Bible Students worldwide.</p>
<p>Although nearly all congregations, known as an "Ecclesia" (from the Greek word for "called out ones") are under no central leadership, most of the well established Bible Student congregations and members remain firmly united and strongly linked. Many Ecclesia's sponsor yearly or bi-yearly conventions, usually held from April through October. Although the general public are invited, the majority in attendance are usually Bible Students from surrounding areas, or those who have traveled from abroad. Depending upon the convention, total attendance is usually less than one-hundred. The yearly Dawn General Convention (held in late Summer), Chicago Bible Student's New-Years-Eve Convention (held around December 31st), the Indiana-Ohio Convention (held in June or July), and The International Convention (held biannually in Europe on even years during the month of August) see the largest overall attendance, sometimes numbering over two-thousand.</p>

Upon his death all remaining members of this group ceased any thought of entering heaven, and believed they would instead live upon a perfected earth in God's Kingdom as a group referred to as the "modern worthies", associates of the "ancient worthies" – the ancient Jewish prophets which God will resurrect to guide the world in his Kingdom.</p>

<p>In 1917, Alexander F.L. Freytag, Branch manager of the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> Watch Tower Society since 1898, founded the <i>Angel of Jehovah Bible and Tract Society</i> (also known as the <i>Philanthropic Assembly of the Friends of Man</i> and <i>The Church of the Kingdom of God, Philanthropic Assembly</i>). When he started publishing his views he was ousted from the Watchtower Society by Rutherford in 1919. He published two journals, the monthly <i>The Monitor of the Reign of Justice</i> and the weekly <i>Paper for All</i>.</p>
<p>Jesse Hemery was one of the most prominent Bible Students of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and had been appointed president of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Bible_Students_Association_5c1d.html" title="International Bible Students Association">International Bible Students Association</a> by Pastor Russell in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>, holding that post until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>.

<p>According to the magazine <i>The Herald of Christ's Kingdom</i> <a href="http://www.heraldmag.org/2006_history/06history_12.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.heraldmag.org/2006_history/06history_12.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> published by the Pastoral Bible Institute, the Bible Student movement shares some views with other denominations. These views, however, when taken collectively, outline a doctrinal position that is distinct from mainstream Christianity. Some of these teachings are:</p>
<p>Inspiration of the Bible: Bible Students are united in holding that the sacred Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, are inspired and are the final authority for authentic truth. Correct doctrine is to be established in beliefs that harmonize all scriptures on each subject. No non-scriptural words (such as Holy Tradition) may be made an article of faith.</p>
<p>Creation: Bible Students believe in creation, while admitting for some evolution in the animal creation, and that man (and thence, women) are a direct creation of God, physically and mentally perfect.</p>
<p>Original Sin: Believing that Adam and Eve were created perfect, the Bible Student position is that the sin of disobedience in the Garden of Eden resulted in all their posterity being born under the blight of sin, imperfection, and death.</p>
<p>Nature of God: The Bible Student position is neither Trinitarian nor Unitarian. While they believe that Jesus is the Son of God and possesses the nature of God, the divine nature, since his resurrection, they do not accept the position of co-eternity or co-equality between the Father and the Son. They also don't accept the doctrine of incarnation; according to them Jesus was wholly flesh while on earth, having divested himself of his spiritual nature. They also don't accept the concept of the holy spirit being a person; they consider it the disposition or influence of God.</p>
<p>Nature of Man: In distinction from inherent immortality, the Bible Student view is that man is mortal by nature, and that immortality is available only by meeting conditions of obedience. They hold that the human soul is not a distinct entity, but is the result of the union of the body and the breath, or spark, of life, and that death is the dissolution of these two elements.</p>
<p>State of the Dead: Because death is the dissolution of body and breath, the soul that sins dies - goes out of existence - until the resurrection process begins in the future kingdom of Messiah. The Bible “hell” is merely the grave, and is neither a place of eternal fire nor conscious separation from God.</p>
<p>Virgin Birth: While Jesus was miraculously begotten by God through the holy spirit in the womb of Mary the Bible implies that she did not remain a virgin thereafter and had additional children by Joseph after the birth of Jesus. Her human nature was the same as others of the fallen race, and there is no Biblical indication that Mary had an “immaculate conception”.</p>
<p>Ransom and Restitution: The main purpose of Jesus’ first advent was to provide a ransom, or substitutionary atonement for Adam, and hence the entire race descending from him. This Ransom was provided at the cross of Calvary, and is efficacious for all who have ever died. It promises resuscitation for all humanity in Christ’s 1000-year kingdom, along with the opportunity to obtain and maintain perfect human life for eternity. The ransom also provides for a select number of faithful Christians to attain to a heavenly reward for the purpose of assisting Jesus in the rehabilitation of planet earth to perfect Edenic conditions.</p>
<p>Resurrection: After Jesus Christ was crucified, he was raised to life as a spirit by his Father, God, and given a divine body in the express image of God’s person. The human body that he inhabited prior to his death was permanently sacrificed, never to be taken back.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Calling: At his first advent, Jesus began calling out from mankind a special class to be his church, or bride. To these he promises a part in heaven with himself and the Father, and a kingdom role of reigning over mankind with himself for blessing all the families of the earth. Those who accept this invitation make a complete vow of consecration or commitment to do the will of God as they see it revealed and at the cost of a surrender of the right to a life on earth. This consecration is witnessed by a baptism (complete water immersion,)</p>
<p>Second Advent: As with most Christians, the expectation that Jesus Christ would return to finish the work that he began two thousand years ago is an important part of their faith. Most Bible Students share the following beliefs in the second advent:</p>
<p>Object: That the object of the return is the resurrection of the dead and the establishment of a new world order of peace and righteousness, in which all sin, sorrow, and death will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Manner: Jesus returns invisibly, at first unnoticed by the world at large as he gathers his saints to himself, then eventually manifesting his presence to all as he comes with his saints.</p>
<p>Time: Though not in universal agreement, the majority of Bible Students believe that God's appointed time for his return was in the near past (1874), and that he is currently in the process of finishing his church, evicting the old regime of the adversary, tearing down the religious, social, and political structure to set up his kingdom, and is supervising the preparation of Israel for kingdom work.</p>
<p>Return of Israel: The establishment of the nation of Israel and the return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland is an indication of the restoration of God's favor to that nation, and an indication of the nearness of Messiah’s kingdom. Bible Students anticipate a return of Israel to the borders promised to Abraham; and a final conflict in the Middle East, in which their ancient prophets will be resurrected and God will, through them, bring about an unprecedented miraculous deliverance, introducing the worldwide kingdom of Christ which will resurrect, reform and rehabilitate all of mankind, expanding thence to a worldwide dominion of peace.</p>
<p>Church Organization: The Bible Student community is organized on a strict congregational basis, with each local group totally autonomous. Each group selects its leaders (elders and deacons) by a total vote of their consecrated members, and cooperates with other congregations as determined by that local group. All expenses are paid entirely by freewill voluntary offerings with no collections of mandated costs, The ministry serves on a non-paid and voluntary basis.</p>
