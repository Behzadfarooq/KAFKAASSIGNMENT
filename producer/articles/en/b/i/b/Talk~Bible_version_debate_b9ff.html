<p>The contributor(s) of the "Criteria for choosing a translation" section mentions some good points regarding translation yet fail to mention the most important aspect of translation. The translators knowledge of the languages being translated from and to. Additionally there are many well proven examples of translation bias done by teams of translators from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>Some of the arguments presented are one-sided, e.g., "There are others that realize that our knowledge of ancient Hebrew and Greek has improved over time and realize that a more accurate translation is possible.", implying that everyone else is misguided. I personally believe it has gotten worse with time since the older languages get lost with time, but that's just my belief. Point is I think this needs to be more balanced. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBourgeoisdude_beb0.html" title="User:Bourgeoisdude">Bourgeoisdude</a> 14:43, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Christians are not the only people reading Scripture. Bear in mind that the first half of the Bible is called the Hebrew Bible, and remains the sacred text of Judaism. I have removed what pieces of articles suggested that Christians were the only people concerned with Biblical scholarship. On the subject of languages. No, our grasp of Greek and Hebrew have improved, not diminished. Historical preservation and general archeology are such that we are finding new fragments in the Biblical languages all the time and these help us get a better perspective of the world at that time. Where you stand determines what you see, and we can see a great deal more these days. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerricMaker_59b3.html" title="User:MerricMaker">MerricMaker</a> 13:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From the look of the article even in its present state, one would need to delete most of it to eliminate Christian bias and make it more scholarly. Still, I think this topic deserves some attention. At present, I have not found a good article comparing the various translations objectively, or at least one that would give the translators' goal with their version.--<a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJECompton_af90.html" title="User:JECompton">JECompton</a> 00:46, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the text that claimed that in Ruth 3 the "feet" were a euphamism for genetalia. This is by no means an agreed-on interpretation, e.g., <a href="http://bible.gen.nz/ruth/3/introduction.htm" class="external free" title="http://bible.gen.nz/ruth/3/introduction.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bible.gen.nz/ruth/3/introduction.htm</a> gives arguments against this claim. I can't find strong citable claims that argue FOR this interpretation. (There's a podiatrist on the web who thinks this is true, but there's no evidence that he knows anything about ancient Hebrew.) The example is a very poor one. If an example is used, it needs to be much more obvious/clearer. It's not clear an example is needed, anyway. -- 129.246.254.14 22:13, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can think of three examples of exegetes who interpret the word to be "feet." Walter Brueggeman (the OT guy in his book <i>Old Testament Theology</i>), Mary Joan Winn Leith (the editor and footnotes author for Ruth, Esther, Greek Esther, and Jonah in the Oxford NRSV), and Harold Washington (the editor and author of the footnotes for Proverbs and Sirach in the Oxford NRSV). I'm putting the segment back in and finally learning how to make footnotes in WIKI. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerricMaker_59b3.html" title="User:MerricMaker">MerricMaker</a> 03:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found lots of folks who interpreted the text in Ruth 3 as meaning "feet". I take it you mean you found credible sources that interpret THIS passage as meaning "genitals", yes? (The issue isn't whether or not the word "feet" is sometimes a euphamism.. the question is, IN THIS PASSAGE is that a justifiable interpretation?). I'll add at least one counter-citation, since this is a debated interpretation. On the one hand, this is probably Wikipedia at its best - we each found a citable source, so we'll present both sides. Okay. But frankly, I think the debate means this is not a great example - surely we can find another example that's less debated! -- <a href="../../../d/w/h/User%7EDwheeler_7975.html" title="User:Dwheeler">Dwheeler</a> 03:23, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's the deal, you aren't going to find something that isn't debated. You pick a scholar or a set of scholars, but each side has an argument that's as well thought out as its opposite number.

According to the statement in wikipedia</p>
<p>In Biblical Hebrew the word "feet" is sometimes used as a euphemism for "genitalia" (usually of the male sort).[1] So in Ruth 3:14 we have the quote "So she lay at his feet until morning." Formal equivalence makes it the reader's responsibility to determine what "feet" means in the context, risking the possibility that the reader completely misses a possible meaning of the passage. <b>Dynamic Equivalence might render the passage "She made love to him until the morning."</b></p>
<p>could someone find a translation that actually translate the passage to mean genitalia or made love to him. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 00:00, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most modern translations with footnotes mention this feature, just not in body text. In any case, each interpretation is well-cited for this article, and this entry isn't about the book of Ruth. The Ruth passage was just a convenient example, related to modes of translation. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerricMaker_59b3.html" title="User:MerricMaker">MerricMaker</a> 04:46, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My point is that in the article it says a DE might render it as....., if one actually does we should cite it if none do perhaps that sentence needs to be re worded a bit <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 16:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we need an example of something that is ACTUALLY rendered differently by different translations. We could keep the Ruth example as an "extreme" example (to make the distinction more obvious), but one that causes a REAL difference would be better.

<dd>Actually, I would argue that it is perfect. It is a well-known oddity of Hebrew, appears in most footnotes as a possible interpretation, but isn't used in body text because it's too salacious. Even very free intepretations like <i>Living Bible</i> avoid using it because (let's face it) most of the freer interpretations are produced by right of center groups of scholars who tend to minimize the sensual bits of the Bible. Hence, it's an ideal example of choices made in translation. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerricMaker_59b3.html" title="User:MerricMaker">MerricMaker</a> 01:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a mistake, and not ideal. I can't even find ONE example where people have translated the main text differently! EVERYONE translates this as feet. No exceptions. As an example of "translation differences", quoting a text where there are NO real translation differences is not helpful. Even if "most" footnotes include this comment - and I actually doubt it - the fact remains that this is NOT an example where translators translate the text significantly differently. Its salaciousness is not the issue here; for whatever reason, translators do NOT translate the text differently, so it's a lousy example of translation differences. Let's find at least one case where there is an ACTUAL difference in text, and use that as an example. This page lists some ESV vs. NIV differences: <a href="http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/briefing/webextra/march04_compare.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/briefing/webextra/march04_compare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/briefing/webextra/march04_compare.htm</a> In particular, John 17:6, where ESV: 'I have manifested your name' contrasts with NIV: 'I have revealed you'. They say: "'Revealed you' and 'manifested your name' could easily mean the same thing. But the NIV leaves out that what Jesus revealed was God's name, which is in the Greek text. This is a very important idea, for Jesus is soon to pray about God’s name (in the following verses). The glory of God is tied up with God’s name, and so we hear echoes of Exodus 34 and John 1. Jesus has revealed God’s name, which is his glory, his goodness, his grace and truth. To leave out the key word ‘name’ significantly changes the connections and logic in the passage. The simplification takes away a real opportunity to understand the text better and make connections to the rest of the Bible. The English is a little simpler and more understandable, but we have lost the text." With this, we have an example that actually occurs, instead of a speculative difference that at most causes the addition of footnotes. -- <a href="../../../d/w/h/User%7EDwheeler_7975.html" title="User:Dwheeler">Dwheeler</a> 22:30, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's an interesting idea, but I disagree with it. Dynamic vs. formal equivalence is just ONE issue among many that THIS article should cover. I think most of the GENERAL dynamic vs. formal equivalence stuff should go in the "dynamic vs. formal equivalence" article, but specifics involving the Bible (such as which translation fits where), and other stuff including WHICH source document to translate, KJV-only movement, and the reasons WHY Bible translations matter, belong in this article.
