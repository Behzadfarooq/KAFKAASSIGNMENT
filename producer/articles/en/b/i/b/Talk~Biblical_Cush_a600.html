	    <p>There is no second wife of Moses in the Bible. All references to moses' wife is singluar. It is very clear that Tzipporah is the Kushite wife. Any arguement otherwise is illogical. Let me guess, it's hard to believe that Tzipporah was Black? If not, then pretend Kushite means "white" and re-read the passage. Surely then there is no "question". Please don't put any more of the anti-black theory into this article.</p>

<p>The way I read it, Moses sent his wife back to her own family. My Bible (NRSV) reads:</p>
<p>"After Moses had sent away his wife Zipphorah, his father-in-law took her back, along with her two sons." (Exodus 18:2-3)</p>
<p>Then one doesn't hear much about wives for a long time, until Numbers 12:</p>
<p>"While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had indeed married a Cushite woman); ..." (Numbers 12:1)</p>
<p>But, to be perfectly honest: to me it really doesn't matter whether it is his first wife or second. I read it as a clear sign that there is no difference between the races, and those who judge by the colour of the skin are themselves to be outcast. It is similar to the hadith wherein Muhammad marries a wealthy Meccan girl to a freed black slave. If I remember correctly (anyone knowing where to find this hadith please tell me!) the family of the girl objects, until the Prophet explains that it is really someone's faith that matters - not colour or wealth.</p>

<p>First, I don't know that there's any scholarly consensus on this; second, even if it were true, it would refer to events of 5,000 B.C. or earlier, so I don't see how it's too directly relevant to the Bible. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 02:53, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cush has had various meanings, principly that it meant "dark" as if referring to an individual with a dark character or dark deeds. Other meanings have been "burnt," "fiery," "impulsive," "forceful," and "chaos." 'Dark' rather than 'black' would be a better meaning. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWiccaIrish_7ca2.html" title="User:WiccaIrish">WiccaIrish</a> 04:52, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>'Cush' is a Hebrew word that means 'black'. 'Aithiopia' (Ethiopia) in Greek meant 'burnt skin' or 'burnt faces' and referred to the same territory. During ancient times Cush covered present-day Sudan (just north of Ethiopia), the Horn of Africa, as well as parts of southern Saudi Arabia (Yemen, etc). Also, 'Bilad as-sudan' (Arabic for 'Sudan') meant 'land of the blacks'. Enough said.</p>

<p>This information is absolutely horrible, I can't even edit all of it because I'm sure it would be consider vandalism. There really should be some type of supervision to make the sure the info. is correct because wikipedia has a reputation for being unreliable.</p>
<p>Cush refers to the Nubian civilization. It has NOTHING to do with the modern language family of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. All Biblical references to "Cushites" and "Ethiopians" are referring to Nubians of upper Egypt. Modern Ethiopia has historically been called Abyssinia and the Axumite empire wasn't even formed until 500 BCE. 'Ethiopian' is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew 'Cushite', it refers to the Egyptian Nubians with dark skin. It certainly has nothing to do with Middle Eastern people.</p>

<dd>Huh?? You are saying that Ancient Cush has nothing to do with the modern (<a href="../../../c/u/s/Cushitic.html" title="Cushitic">Cushitic</a> people or language family??? That sounds kind of like the Aryan theories!! Do you have any reliable basis whatsoever for alleging that Ancient Cush has "nothing to do" with the modern Cushitic people or language family?? (Outside of "Aryanist" literature, that is?) Cushitic people language family has EVERYTHING to do with the Ancient Empire of Cush, the connections are reliably drawn going all the way back, and it is only certain neo-revisionists trying to create an imaginary gulf between the two for their own agenda, but anyone who has looked at the actual ancient records knows better! I suppose now you are going to come up with a new original theory that someone else came along and somehow "convinced" the modern Cushites that that was their name! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 23:24, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
