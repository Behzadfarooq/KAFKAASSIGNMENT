<li>As you see, I'm an avid SpongeBob fan and the month and year the movie takes place in is June 2004, not March 2031.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I can prove your theory wrong: Spongebob won 374 consecutive employee of the month awards. which is 31 years, and 2 months. Spongebob joined the Krusty Krab in 1998. So, 31 years and 2 months would basically be around, well, 2029/2030. and IF The movie took place in June 2004, SpongeBob would have started working there in April 1973. 1973 is 4 years BEFORE the Krusty Krab opened, 13 years BEFORE SpongeBob was born, and 20 years before Squidward started working there. The calender in Spongebob's bedroom AND the calender at the Krusty Krab both are in March: March 7th has a drawing of the Krusty Krab 2 in Spongebob's room. When he updates the Krusty Krab calender, Plankton says: "March 14! No wait, it should say the day that Krabs fries!" -AMK152</li>

<li>I can prove <i>your</i> theory wrong: the show and movie are TIMELESS, as the show's creator, Stephen Hillenburg says in the insider book, SpongeBob Exposed. -SpongeJustin4</li>

<ul>
<li>you tell 'em spongejustin4</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Well, using 2004, is INCORRECT info, even though the show is TIMELESS, 2031 is the correct year. -AMK152</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The movie and show might not be canon with each other. Maybe SpongeBob was born in 1956 in the movie and 1986 in the TV series which explains why there is references to Popeye and Krazy Kat in the movie.</li>

<li>Does the year really matter that much? -- <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobman123_b0c5.html" title="User:Bobman123">Bobman123</a> 22:48, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I don't know...i'm just saying that 2004 for the movie is illogical...i removed "2031" from the Krusty Krab section and it just says March 7, and March 7-14, which makes it sound weird w/o the year, but some people kept changing the year, so i just removed the year. -AMK152</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Why don't you e-mail Stephen Hillenburg and ask him about the the years in which the show is set. SpongeBob, just like every other Nicktoon has no set date, each episode has a different timeline. Proof from "Hooky": "Nobody took breaks from the Krusty Krab since the chum famine of '59." This encyclopedia is ruining SpongeBob. No more TWENTY THIRTY-ONEs! 17:03, 10 April 2006 (UTC)~</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I have gone through certain sources (a couple episodes) and other information to come to the conclusion that the year in the movie can not be determained due to the fact that a) the year SpongeBob was hired is not accurate b) squidward could have won employee of the month between SpongeBob's first day at work and the movie, changing the year. -<a href="../../../a/m/k/User%7EAMK152_484f.html" title="User:AMK152">AMK152</a> 13:10, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In "Bossy Boots," Squidward rips off his pink KK uniform (ending up naked) and a police fish comes over, writes a ticket, and sticks it to Squidward's crotch. That could imply a "no public nudity" law, even if it isn't explicitly stated. --69.69.161.249 23:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WAY TOO LONG!!!!!</span></h2>
<p>I'm sorry, but this article is WAY TOO LONG, because it has WAY TOO MUCH DETAIL! For example, we should list the <i>name</i> of "Mrs. Puff's Boating School" and a BRIEF description of what it is. Including the questions and answers of the driving test is totally excessive. Also, there are many things included in the lists that I, a SpongeBob fan, have NEVER heard of. Granted, I've missed several of the more recent episodes and I don't play any of the video games, but things still need to be cited. And all the unnecessary fluff has GOT TO GO! I think that a complete re-write is in order. --76.1.32.129 19:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I feel that some of the sections should be separated, e.g. a "Places in Bikini Bottom" article. That way all the information stays in Wiki but doesn't clutter up the main Bikini Bottom article. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreniW_c089.html" title="User:AndreniW">AndreniW</a> 21:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh really? I'm removing the cleanup-rewrite sign as this article looks fine to me. What? In an article called Bikini Bottom YOU don't want to include The Fry Cook Games, The Great Snail Race, Hobbies, Bubble blowing, surrounding cities etc. It doesn't matter if you never heard of them. They exsit. That's the matter. If you can tell me what you want deleted and what you want kept do so, but for now the article look's fine. What, article's aren't supposed to have detail. And please stop screaming, 76.1.32.129, it could be considered vandalism to some people. Sections should be seperated? So we should start another article called "Places in Binki Bottom" I don't think so. Why can't that info be on Bikini Bottom? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreebark_7d8a.html" title="User:Treebark"><font color="green">Tree</font></a><a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreebark_7d8a.html" title="User:Treebark"><font color="blue">bark</font></a> <font color="red">(<a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreebark_5ddb.html" title="User talk:Treebark">talk</a>)</font> 14:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm the one that put it there (under an IP address rather than my username), and I sadly do think that this article needs a tremendous amount of work. I never said *which* things I hadn't heard of--for your information I *have* heard of Fry Cook Games, Greak Snail Race, and bubble blowing, and I'm perfectly fine with them staying there. But there are some things that I haven't--the ones that stick out in my mind are "Quittersville," "Failuretown," and "Loserburg." Haven't heard of them. If they do exist in SB's universe, that's fine, but nothing should be in the article unless it can be cited. And I'm sorry, but I still think the article contains way too much extraneous detail--which is probably the main reason why it's currently 57 kb long. When an article starts getting over the preferable size, it's probably time to start trimming it down or dividing it into sections. And I was not "screaming"--I was merely trying to emphasize what I was saying. I apologize if I came off as a screamer; I'll instead use asterisks for emphasis in the future. I'm going to restore the "cleanup-rewrite" tag" and I'll very soon start making the changes that need to be made. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyLegsKC_77db.html" title="User:CrazyLegsKC">CrazyLegsKC</a> 19:13, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to watch this page, but have you listens to Chimps Ahoy? It clearly says the places for losers are failuretown, and loserburg. Please create an article <b>Places in Binki Bottom</b> when you remove some of the towns. Any edits I don't like maybe reverted. Instead use &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which will come out as bold. Italics will come out using the same thing but replacing the b with an i. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreebark_7d8a.html" title="User:Treebark"><font color="green">Tree</font></a><a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreebark_7d8a.html" title="User:Treebark"><font color="blue">bark</font></a> <font color="red">(<a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETreebark_5ddb.html" title="User talk:Treebark">talk</a>)</font> 02:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, using <b>'''</b> 's will make it bold, and <i>''</i> 's will make it italic. And why would I remove towns and put them in there? Bikini Bottom <i>is</i> a town, so it would be a factual error to place other towns there. Plus, it's <b><a href="../../../p/l/a/Places_in_Bikini_Bottom_13ee.html" title="Places in Bikini Bottom">Places in Bikini Bottom</a></b>, not <i>Binki</i> Bottom. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreniW_c089.html" title="User:AndreniW">AndreniW</a> 03:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed changes</span></h2>
<p>Here are the changes I think should be made.</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of towns should be given its own page, under the title Towns in SpongeBob SquarePants or List of towns in SpongeBob SquarePants, or something similar. Since this article is about <i>Bikini Bottom</i>, it shouldn't include information about other towns. We can provide a link to the new page, with a brief description, such as "Various other towns are located near Bikini Bottom, and are sometimes included in the stories."</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/r/s/Mrs._Puff%27s_Boating_School_d6fa.html" title="Mrs. Puff's Boating School">Mrs. Puff's Boating School</a> should be given its own page. There's enough information on it here, as well as some info from the show that hasn't been mentioned, for it to merit its own article, IMO. Plus, as said above, it's kind of excessive to give this much detail about it in an article about Bikini Bottom.</li>
<li>The "Unofficial History" section should be trashed completely. It seems very sketchy, and, by its own admittance, is "Unofficial"--only things that are official canon should be included.</li>
<li>Each of the entries in the "Homes" section should be moved to the pages of their respective characters. I think the descriptions are too detailed to be included on this page, or the "Places in Bikini Bottom" page. We can include a list of the homes (ie, "SpongeBob's pineapple home," "Sandy's treedome," "Squidward's Easter Island Head"), with links to their descriptions on the character pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know what you think of these changes. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyLegsKC_77db.html" title="User:CrazyLegsKC">CrazyLegsKC</a> 18:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMO, the change of the Places in Bikini Bottom to its own article was a good idea. But, I think that the features should COMPLETELY be moved over there, to decrease the size of the article. I say when the Places in Bikini Bottom article gets bigger, we then can separate that, but the only "places" that should have their own article are <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty_Krab_d6bd.html" title="Krusty Krab">Krusty Krab</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chum_Bucket_eb37.html" title="Chum Bucket">Chum Bucket</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goo_Lagoon_01ef.html" title="Goo Lagoon">Goo Lagoon</a>.

<td>The article needs a fair bit of improvement if it is to become a featured article. The lead could be expanded and an opening picture of the fictional city would help. The article has too many lists and should try to focus on eliminating the lists and writing good prose. With any fictional entity, the focus should not be on just describing fictional details but instead describing the relevance and relation of these details to the real world. Fictional entities are often a reflection of the cultural setting from which they emerged, you already noted this with statements like "which are similar to that of United States laws" now try to expand on that point. Comprehensively describing all the details of a fictional entity is not necessary and may not even be beneficial in a well-written article. <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedars_695e.html" title="User:Cedars">Cedars</a> 01:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</td>
