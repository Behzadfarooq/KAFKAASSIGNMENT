<p>Bikini Bottom is similar to an average American city. The city consists of various businesses, including restaurants, stores, and manufacturers. The city has a stable economy, a balanced education and health systems, a structured government, and a firm law enforcement system. There are even stadiums, amusement parks, and other recreational facilities.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Geography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
<p>Bikini Bottom's geography consists of mountains, dense forests, lakes, lagoons, caves, grasslands, reefs and rivers. Other features include volcanoes, trenches and deserts in the surrounding region.<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Major geographic features include <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goo_Lagoon_01ef.html" title="Goo Lagoon">Goo Lagoon</a>, Goo Lagoon Sea Caves, Sand Mountain, Flounder Hill, Guppy Mound, Kelp Forest, Kelp Swamp, Kelp Caves, Kelp Vines, Jellyfish Fields, Jellyfish Lake, Spork Mountain, The Brain Coral Fields, Make Out Reef, Mount Climb-Up-and-Fall-Off,<sup id="_ref-Valentine_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Valentine" title="">[7]</a></sup> Mount Kabloovious (volcano at the nearby town of Palm Bay), Rock Bottom (a separate city), Ancient Mariner Valley, and Atlantis.<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup>The Mermalair is another underground cavern in Bikini Bottom, although it is a man-made hideout and not a natural formation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Location">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Location</span></h3>
<p>Bikini Bottom is located at the bottom of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, next to its signature island, <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Atoll_54a5.html" title="Bikini Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>, according to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hillenburg_1b5b.html" title="Stephen Hillenburg">Stephen Hillenburg</a>. There are many instances of proof on the show: After being scared off by ghosts, Sandy evacuated to Texas. She was seen flying east from the Pacific Ocean.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[8]</a></sup> In the Employee of the Month computer game, a fish mentions that Bikini Bottom is located in the Pacific Ocean. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_SpongeBob_SquarePants_Movie_ae02.html" title="The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a></i>, when <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_5703.html" title="SpongeBob">SpongeBob</a> was singing the "Goofy Goober Rock", the camera rose out of the water into outer space. When it did, it came out of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Bikini Bottom is part of the United States. This was revealed at the end of the commercial, "<a href="../../../p/l/a/Plankton%27s_Holiday_Hits_86da.html" title="Plankton's Holiday Hits">Plankton's Holiday Hits</a>." Also, Gary mentions that it is a "free country" in "<a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Takes_a_Bath_1fd5.html" title="Gary Takes a Bath">Gary Takes a Bath</a>," which is a statement made by Americans.</p>
<p>Bikini Atoll that is shown at the theme song is facing the north. This was revealed in "<a href="../../../p/r/a/Pranks_a_Lot_e9fa.html" title="Pranks a Lot">Pranks a Lot</a>" where Sandy evacuated to the right (east) of the screen.</p>
<p><a name="Cityscape" id="Cityscape"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Cityscape">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
<p>The city is divided into various districts, including Downtown Bikini Bottom, Goo Lagoon, Sand Mountain, Jellyfish Fields, Kelp Forest, the Flying Dutchman's Graveyard, Residents' Row (SpongeBob's / Patrick's / Squidward's homes),<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[9]</a></sup> Make Out Reef, Ancient Mariner Valley (the location of Neptune's Paradise.)<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[10]</a></sup> and Palm Bay.</p>
<p>The city is divided by its main road, Conch Street, which runs from downtown and past the homes of SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick, through the <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty_Krab_d6bd.html" title="Krusty Krab">Krusty Krab</a> restaurant, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chum_Bucket_eb37.html" title="Chum Bucket">Chum Bucket</a> and the Reef Theatre cinema. The road intersects with Barnacle Road and Coral Avenue. Anchor Way is not far off from Conch Street. Conch Street runs north-south as revealed in the <i>SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom</i> video game. Downtown Bikini Bottom is located in the northernmost point of the city, while SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick's House are on the southern part of the road. Goo Lagoon is located west of the road, while Jellyfish Fields is to the east. Other establishments are located more southerly, including Sandy's house, Shady Shoal's, the Krusty Krab, the Chum Bucket, and the Movie Theater. The Kelp Forest is located more southerly.</p>
<p>The County Line is the boundary of Bikini Bottom<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup> and in <i>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</i> video game, it is very close to downtown Bikini Bottom. This is very fitting, given that it serves as the northernmost district of Bikini Bottom, according to the <i>SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom</i> video game.</p>
<p>In every episode in which the skyline of Bikini Bottom is shown, features such as buildings, houses, and anchors can be seen. This is most likely Mr. Krabs's house. In earlier episodes of the series, a red flower arch can be seen, which now no longer appears in the skyline. The Sea Needle, which is the tallest point in Bikini Bottom, is oddly never seen in the skyline. The Sea Needle only appears in two episodes of SpongeBob, <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Hibernation_Week_0813.html" title="Pre-Hibernation Week">Pre-Hibernation Week</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/e/r/Mermaid_Man_and_Barnacle_Boy_II_d014.html" title="Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II">Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II</a>.</i> The Sea Needle also appears in the video game, <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_for_Bikini_Bottom_2943.html" title="Battle for Bikini Bottom">Battle for Bikini Bottom</a></i> where it is shown just outside of downtown Bikini Bottom. In some episodes, a lighthouse appears in the skyline, most likely Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Other episodes feature the Krusty Krab's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquee.html" title="Marquee">Marquee</a>. A large <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_%28implement%29.html" title="Fan (implement)">fan</a>-shaped structure, most likely a <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudder.html" title="Rudder">rudder</a> from a ship, is seen in some episodes.</p>
<p>In the center of Bikini Bottom the citizens work and live in large, gray buildings made of metal. There are some other forms of buildings, mostly aquatic-themed as seen above. Further out from the town citizens need to use whatever is available and easy to live in, such as Patrick's rock, Spongebob hollowed-out pineapple, and the stone monument Squidward lives in.</p>
<p><a name="Climate" id="Climate"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Climate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
<p>Since Bikini Bottom is in the Pacific Ocean below <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Atoll_54a5.html" title="Bikini Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>, it should have a sunny <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtropical_climate.html" title="Subtropical climate">subtropical climate</a>. It receives rain and snow from the nearby icebergs and having its own ski resort which sometimes receives snow. The clouds are shaped like flowers, which Spongebob does not notice until "Pressure" where he says "You know what that cloud looks like? A flower," and Sandy replies "They all look like flowers, Spongebob."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Population">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Population</span></h3>
<p>The population of Bikini Bottom is uncertain. The creator of the show, Stephen Hillenburg, confirmed that Bikini Bottom is a large city. Before almost leaving the city, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Cheeks_3a2c.html" title="Sandy Cheeks">Sandy Cheeks</a> sang a song about the city, describing it as "Crowded and Smoggy,"<sup id="_ref-Chimps_Ahoy_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chimps_Ahoy" title="">[11]</a></sup> which is the characteristics of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. The physical look &amp; feel of Bikini Bottom suggests that it is in fact a much smaller city. A one-time Pretty Patties joint created by SpongeBob attracted 46,853 customers. Almost everyone from the city is there, which may suggest a population of around 50,000.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[12]</a></sup> In the episode <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squilliam_Returns_436f.html" title="Squilliam Returns">Squilliam Returns</a>, Squidward mentions Bikini Bottom is a "hick town," meaning it is probably quite small like most hick towns. Also, in <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty_Towers_f269.html" title="Krusty Towers">Krusty Towers</a>, Squidward mentions Bikini Bottom is in the middle of scenic nowhere, which could mean it's very small, which is the criteria of isolated cities.</p>
<p><a name="Demographics" id="Demographics"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Demographics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h3>
<p>Bikini Bottom's populace, like that of the rest of the series, consists of various anthropomorphic fish, whales, crabs, sponges, octopi, starfish, anchovies, lobsters, sharks, and most other forms of sea life, including sea monsters. Some forms of sea life, like jellyfish, seahorses, snails, and worms aren't sentient however, and are treated like pets or wild animals. An example of this is SpongeBob's pet snail, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_the_Snail_3731.html" title="Gary the Snail">Gary</a>. The first known land creature to live in Bikini Bottom was the Dark Knight, an ancestor of Sandy Cheeks, before the 12th century (Bikini Bottom was then known as Bikini Bottomshire).<sup id="_ref-Dunces_and_Dragons_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunces_and_Dragons" title="">[1]</a></sup> Sandy Cheeks, a squirrel from <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, is (along with Jerry the Snail and Wormy the Butterfly) the only land creature seen living in modern Bikini Bottom.</p>
<p><b>"Animals"</b> in Bikini Bottom are similar to those "animals" in the real world. Some are treated as pets, while others live in the wild.</p>
<p>A majority of "animals" live in the wild. First and foremost, jellyfish are similar to bees. There are many types of jellyfish that live in Bikini Bottom. Pink are the most common, blue are uncommon, green are rare, purple are very rare and only one <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albino.html" title="Albino">albino</a> jellyfish exists. White and orange jellyfish are seen in the videogame <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lights%2C_Camera%2C_PANTS%21_45ec.html" title="Lights, Camera, PANTS!">Lights, Camera, PANTS!</a>. Jellyfish reside mainly in Jellyfish Fields, which has a population of four million jellyfish. They make and live in hives, another similarity to real-world bees. In earlier episodes, jellyfish were plain pink, but later on, more jellyfish began to appear with spots, but plain pink ones still exist. Jellyfish are similar to cows in that they can be "milked" for their fresh jellyfish jelly. Second, scallops are similar to birds. They are usually found in groups at Goo Lagoon, particularly acting as seagulls. Scallops are usually orange or purple. There is also a colossal clam named Clamu in the Bikini Bottom Stadium. It's currently a mother of one. Third, seaslugs were seen in the video game, <a href="../../../s/u/p/SpongeBob_SquarePants%7E_SuperSponge_b7c3.html" title="SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge">SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge</a>. They are known to dislike everyone. Fourth, seahorses, which are similar to horses, can be ridden and are very interested in food. Fifth, the Alaskan Bull-Worm is a large, omnivorous worm that attacked various parts of Bikini Bottom in its sleep in "<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy%2C_SpongeBob%2C_and_the_Worm_b46c.html" title="Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm">Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm</a>". It eventually went on to destroy the entire city. Sixth, sea urchins, which are small "bug-like" creatures whose bites cause severe itchiness (a possible similarity to fire ants or mosquitoes). Seventh, Nematodes which are worm like creatures that travel in groups and consume common objects by eating or drinking them. They once destroyed SpongeBob's house by sucking the pineapple juice out of it.<sup id="_ref-Home_Sweet_Pineapple_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Home_Sweet_Pineapple" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other "animals" are treated as pets. Two well-known "pets" are snails and worms. Snails are similar to cats and are common as pets, but they are also known to lurk in alleys and forests. A well-known character Gary the Snail is one of them. Worms are similar to dogs, and are also common as pets. At one point SpongeBob also owned a worm.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In the Medieval Era, Bikini Bottomshire was under the rule of King Krabs (ancestor of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_H._Krabs_bec9.html" title="Eugene H. Krabs">Eugene H. Krabs</a>) and was under attack by the evil wizard, Planktonomor (ancestor of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheldon_J._Plankton_a713.html" title="Sheldon J. Plankton">Sheldon J. Plankton</a>). SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star were transported to this time after a jousting accident. They were expected to arrive in this era because they were the "prophecy." According to Princess Pearl, "the prophecy" was that they (SpongeBob and Patrick) were the ones to save the kingdom. Princess Pearl (daughter of King Krabs) was kidnapped by Planktonomor's fire-breathing jellyfish, and taken hostage at Planktonomore's tower. Fulfilling the prophecy, SpongeBob and Patrick saved Princess Pearl and defeated Planktonomor. Later, during a parade while celebrating SpongeBob and Patrick's heroic deeds, King Krabs invented the Krabby Patty, which would be passed down through the Krabs family, and the formula being kept secret.<sup id="_ref-Dunces_and_Dragons_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunces_and_Dragons" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The modern era is very quite similar to the real world, in that sporting events began, as well as the establishment of businesses, and the growth of the city. In the early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, about 1902, a sporting event called the "Great Snail Race" was started, and Lightning Larry Luciano won the first race. However, not much more information about the Great Snail Race is known, until 102 years later. Around the 1920s and 1930s, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy were born. Mermaid Man first used his utility belt around 1937. From there on, he used his belt to protect Bikini Bottom from evil. He would later join with Barnacle Boy to fight crime together.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, Eugene H. Krabs was born.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[16]</a></sup> In his childhood, he immediately became a financial genius as he is known today. In 1947, his father gave him a dollar, in which he loved so much; however he spent it on a soda, which was upsetting to him. Not long after, a war occurred, in which the events are unknown. After the war, Mr. Krabs fell into a deep depression, which seemed endless; however, a bankrupt retirement home, the Rusty Krab, gave him hope. Mr. Krabs decided to buy the building, rename it, marking the establishment of the Krusty Krab. A famine in 1959 wiped out the chum crops, causing Mr. Krabs to give his employees a break. It is unknown how the rivalry with Mr. Krabs and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheldon_J._Plankton_a713.html" title="Sheldon J. Plankton">Sheldon J. Plankton</a> began,Although it will be revealed in Friend or Foe?, but it was about 1977 when Plankton first tried to steal the secret formula. Mr. Krabs and Plankton competed against each other in the Fry Cook Games, which started around 1981. Mr. Krabs won gold one year for lifting two barrels of pickles. Plankton won the onion ring routine another year with a broken antenna.</p>

Around 2002, Mr. Krabs and Plankton celebrated 25 years of their rivalry. Plankton acquired help from his family, which was eventually foiled by Mr. Krabs. The 102nd running of the snail occurred about 2003. Lighting Larry Luncino, still living, lit the torch of good sportsmanship, and the games began. The race resulted in Rocky (Owned by Patrick Star) winning. In 2017, while trying to hide from SpongeBob and Patrick, <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squidward_Tentacles_1ba5.html" title="Squidward Tentacles">Squidward Tentacles</a> froze in the Krusty Krab freezer, staying there for 2000 years, but eventually coming back.</p>

<p>In the present time, Bikini Bottom has had various occurrences of destruction. In <a href="../../../d/y/i/Dying_for_Pie_e7b5.html" title="Dying for Pie">Dying for Pie</a>, a bomb pie fell on Squidward's face, causing a nuclear explosion (with Squidward dead center). In "<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy%2C_SpongeBob%2C_and_the_Worm_b46c.html" title="Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm">Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm</a>," an Alaskan Bull Worm struck Bikini Bottom, which made Sandy hunt it down. Bikini Bottom was moved away, but the worm crushed it. In "<a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormy.html" title="Wormy">Wormy</a>," while Sandy was out of town SpongeBob and Patrick were given the duty of taking care of her pets, one of which was a caterpillar named Wormy. Wormy grew into a butterfly overnight, which caused SpongeBob and Patrick to freak out, thinking Wormy's dead. They then proceeded to cause a mass hysteria that lead to the city's destruction. <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> also took effect in the short, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Endless_Summer_%28SpongeBob_SquarePants_short%29_078a.html" title="The Endless Summer (SpongeBob SquarePants short)">The Endless Summer</a>."</p>
<p>Years later, Mr. Krabs opened a second restaurant, namely the "Krusty Krab 2." Plankton initiated his evil Plan Z, and stole King Neptune's Crown, thereby framing Mr. Krabs. He was frozen because of this; however, SpongeBob and Patrick set out toward Shell City to retrieve Neptune's crown, and then saved the day.<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 4017, Squidward was unfrozen from the freezer, and found out that Bikini Bottom was advanced and painted entirely of chrome. He used a time machine, but accidentally went back too far, to the early prehistoric era.</p>
<p>In the next eternity, Squidward Tentacles and <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_SquarePants_f415.html" title="SpongeBob SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> are still alive, working at the Krusty Krab as skeletons.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Bottom_be45.html" title="Edit section: Government">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>
<p>Bikini Bottom's government, although uncertain, are set up just as they would be in the real world. Three different types of governments rule over Bikini Bottom: Monarch, Republic, and Totalitarian (although temporarily).</p>
<p><b>Monarchy</b> has been a political system since at least the Medieval era, before the 12th century. Although there have been three families ruling Bikini Bottom, it can be logically correct. King Krabs is the earliest known king. He ruled over Bikini Bottomshire during the Medieval era, and his daughter, Princess Pearl, was the heir to the throne.<sup id="_ref-Dunces_and_Dragons_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunces_and_Dragons" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is possible that the Krabs "dynasty" could have spawned over different generations, but this is not confirmed. At is most likely that the Neptune "dynasty" followed, as there has been a mention of "Neptune XIV," who rules during the present time. A book entitled "SpongeBob Meets the Princess" tells a story where "Princess Neptune" visited Bikini Bottom. It is most likely she is the daughter of King Neptune XIV, whop appeared in "<a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune%27s_Spatula_a21c.html" title="Neptune's Spatula">Neptune's Spatula</a>." Since the movie takes place sometime after the series, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Neptune_c135.html" title="King Neptune">King Neptune</a> (most likely XIV) governs over the sea and, for example, punishes anyone who steals his crown. He lives in his own castle in Atlantis, which is very close to the Bikini Bottom city limits.<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup> His daughter, Princess Mindy, is the heir to the throne after her father. She is Princess of the Sea, and will be Queen of the Sea someday.<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup> In <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_Dumb_2a05.html" title="Rule of Dumb">Rule of Dumb</a>, it is revealed that Bikini Bottom had another family ruling Bikini Bottom. King Amoeba and Queen Mildew are featured as monarchs on a family tree. They are the great-great-grandparents of Patrick and Gary. Since their four children are shown to be one prince and three princes, and not Kings, it is most likely that Amoeba and Mildew's oldest child, Princess Tulsa is not shown as Queen, and generations afterward do not show and further royal titles. It is very likely that this "dynasty" occurred in the middle of the Neptune <i>dynasty</i> and ended possibly in the 19th or early 20th centuries. In "<a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_Dumb_2a05.html" title="Rule of Dumb">Rule of Dumb</a>" Patrick discovers his royal family, which is not the Star family, but comes from his paternal grandmother's side. It is stated that he is the new ruler of Bikini Bottom. Since the Neptune dynasty was still occurring, it is likely that Neptune XIV died and his heir was not yet ready to rule. After becoming king, Patrick ruled like a tyrant until the citizens became tired of him. Afterwards, Patrick decided to quit just when it was revealed at the end of the episode, that Gary's father Sluggo is the older child of Princess Tulsa, and Gary is crowned King. It is likely that this occurred about a decade before the birth of Princess Mindy. King Neptune XV could have taken over after Gary's reign, thereby allowing the Neptune "dynasty" to return. The order of monarchs would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>King Krabs (11th/12 century)</li>
<li>Princess Pearl (11th/12 century)</li>
<li>Neptune's I - XIII (After Krabs' dynasty and before the modern time)</li>
<li>In between above: King Ameoba and Queen Mildew</li>
<li>Return of Neptune's I - XIII</li>
<li>Neptune XIV</li>
<li>Patrick Star</li>
<li>Gary the Snail</li>
<li>Neptune XV</li>
<li>Princess Mindy</li>
</ul>
<p>Bikini Bottom's known <b>Republic</b> form of government contains two known positions: the Mayor and the President. The mayor, (whose name is uncertain), has been known to open unfinished bridges and present the Great Snail Race. The president is elected by the residents of Bikini Bottom. <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squidward.html" title="Squidward">Squidward</a> ran for president, but was revealed to be the president of <i>"The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge"</i>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[18]</a></sup> Then, on February 19, 2007, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Star_7e8c.html" title="Patrick Star">Patrick Star</a> beat <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_the_Lobster_8bee.html" title="Larry the Lobster">Larry the Lobster</a> in the 2007 Election on Nick. The score: 100%-0.</p>
<p>After initiating his evil Plan Z, Plankton brought Bikini Bottom's populace into slavery. He renamed Bikini Bottom as Planktopolis, and become its <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a>. He created a <b>Totalitarian</b> form of government. By then, Plankton ruled the city as King Neptune was too busy worrying about his "thinning" hair and both the mayor and president were presumably under Plankton's control. However, <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_5703.html" title="SpongeBob">SpongeBob</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Star_7e8c.html" title="Patrick Star">Patrick</a> soon put a stop to this and Plankton was ultimately arrested for his actions.

<p>Bikini Bottom has a courthouse, in which trials take place like any American city court, except there was no prosecutor. The only known trial is "<a href="../../../k/r/a/Krabs_vs._Plankton_df20.html" title="Krabs vs. Plankton">Krabs vs. Plankton</a>." Plankton sued Mr. Krabs for falling on the Krusty Krab floor when there was no wet floor sign. Plankton sued for everything of what Mr. Krabs had. The trial was headed by Judge Stickleback, and due to a fall, Defendant Eugene Krabs' lawyer was unable to defend. SpongeBob LawyerPants became Mr. Krabs' new lawyer. The trial resulted in a victory for the defendant.</p>

<p>The public education system in Bikini Bottom consists of three schools which are Bikini Bottom Elementary, Bikini Bottom School and Bikini Bottom High (which features prom night in the gym). There are two schools which cater for driver's education. Those boating schools are run by Mrs. Puff (who is the major boating school teacher in Bikini Bottom) and Mrs. Flounder (who runs classes on Monday mornings). The best boating instructor, according to Mr. Fitz (The Superintendent) is Sam, with his boot-camp like school. There are two colleges in Bikini Bottom, they are Bikini Bottom Community College (where <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Star_7e8c.html" title="Patrick Star">Patrick Star</a> and Flatts the Flounder once attended) and Bikini Bottom University.

<p>Bikini Bottom has a wide arrange of different transportation systems. As in the real world, roads and highways serve Bikini Bottom buses, taxis, and boats. (Boats are the underwater equivalent of cars.) An airport is run in Bikini Bottom as well as a lighthouse at Goo Lagoon helps ships who are traveling at night to see.</p>
<p>Bikini Bottom's main road is Conch Street. Conch Street runs from SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses; past the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; and stretches as far as downtown Bikini Bottom. It intersects with Coral Avenue, which is located in Downtown Bikini Bottom. A series of highways run just on the outskirts of the city and in the middle of downtown, a thruway is present. A road leads from Atlantis to Bikini Bottom, as seen in the SpongeBob SqaurePants Movie. Another road leads from Bikini Bottom to <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Bottom_3776.html" title="Rock Bottom">Rock Bottom</a> which goes past the Glove World Theme park. An interesting feature of this road is that for a distance it runs straight down a cliff. The only ways up from the bottom are by bus or with a balloon. Other roads include Albatross Avenue, Anchor Way, Barnacle Road, Doofus Drive, Seashell Street, Shallow Grave Road, and Stormy Way.</p>
<p>The name of the city bus service is <i>Snailways</i>. This bus service stops at almost anywhere in Bikini Bottom and beyond (much like a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greyhound_Lines_ff03.html" title="Greyhound Lines">Greyhound</a> Bus).<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[20]</a></sup> Sandy Cheeks mentioned in a deleted scene of the recent movie that buses run from Shell City to Bikini Bottom, although <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_5703.html" title="SpongeBob">SpongeBob</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Starfish_3979.html" title="Patrick Starfish">Patrick</a> took alternative transport by riding <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hasselhoff_ecef.html" title="David Hasselhoff">David Hasselhoff</a>.<sup id="_ref-SpongeBob_Movie_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpongeBob_Movie" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Bikini Bottom Hospital.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The healthcare in Bikini Bottom is uncertain; the Bikini Bottom Hospital has been able to cure or have a cure for any patient, with the exception of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_poisoning.html" title="Food poisoning">food poisoning</a> and eating bombs (Mr. Krabs has seen this case 11 times). Many different sicknesses have been cured, such as the Suds, car accident recovery, cash-coma, and others. Dr. Gill Gilliam is the most well-known doctor in Bikini Bottom. He always appears on the scene when a health issue is involved. There are also health insurance agents, which contributes to the health system, as mentioned by Mrs. Puff. Additionally, SpongeBob was recommended by a physician at the Bikini Bottom Hospital, Dr. Gilliam, to be admitted into Weenie-Hut General, which is a hospital for weenies. The Bikini Bottom's healthcare system also applies to pets and even objects. A Vet Hospital is located on Conch Street, where the Doctorfish is also a veterinarian. The veterinarians can sometimes mistake Squidward's clarinet playing for a dying animal. Ambulances usually appear the moment someone gets injured, which can be indicative of good healthcare.</p>

<p>The Arts give Bikini Bottom a better outlook on knowledge and creativity.

Bikini Bottom News Flash.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The city paper is called the <b>Bikini Times</b>. It features the regular news, as well as daily comics. One of the comics is called <i>The Wisenheimers</i>. There is another newspaper that is called the <i>Bikini Bottom Inquirer,</i> which is a parody of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_National_Inquirer_6998.html" title="The National Inquirer">The National Inquirer</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are two science <b>magazines</b> called <i>Fake Science Monthly</i> and <i>Boring Science Digest</i>. Another magazine is called <i>Fancy Living Digest</i>. There is another magazine that is called <i>Long, Tan and Handsome</i>. There are two dance magazines: <i>Dance Now</i> and <i>Interpretive Dance Quarterly</i>. Another magazine is <i>Frown Digest.</i><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[27]</a></sup> Other magazines include <i>Lobster Home Journal,</i> <i>Jellyfish Weekly</i>, <i>Urchin Weekly</i>, <i>Octopolian</i>, <i>CarpNews</i>, and <i>Snow Tires Weekly</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are three <b>radio stations</b> in Bikini Bottom, which are called KRUD (the best "you-will not-get-away-with-stealing-my-car" hits), KRUM (top 40 music)<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[28]</a></sup> and KOLD (K-Old, your all-oldies station). There also appears to be boy bands and rock bands; the first being "Boys Who Cry" that Pearl enjoys and "Stingray 5000" that Patrick happily found in the dumpster, and "Ned and the Needlefish", who appear in "Wigstruck".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is unknown how many <b>television stations</b> there are in Bikini Bottom but we do know that there are programs such as <i>Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy</i> and <i>The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy</i> cartoons, <i>Bikini Bottom News</i> (television newcast anchored by Perch Perkins), <i>Retirement House Girls Gone Wild</i>, <i>Bikini Bottom Car Wash</i>, <i>The Rockfish Files</i> and the list goes on. It is known that there is a separate channel featuring somebody playing the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goofy_Goober_88c8.html" title="Goofy Goober">Goofy Goober</a> guitar (as featured on SpongeBob's TV in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_SpongeBob_SquarePants_Movie_ae02.html" title="The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a> computer game), a kids station (featuring cartoons), a sports station (football was only seen), a science channel, an exercise program with a sea anemone and a boxing channel (both featuring boxes, seen in the episode <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiot_Box_%28SpongeBob_SquarePants%29_9774.html" title="Idiot Box (SpongeBob SquarePants)">Idiot Box</a>).</li>

<p>The main religion in Bikini Bottom is uncertain; the citizens of Bikini Bottom worship the Roman god of the sea, <a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune_%28mythology%29.html" title="Neptune (mythology)">Neptune</a>. The movie shows this, and there is evidence in the episodes. There are phrases such as "Oh Neptune!", "Neptune's gentle creatures", and "Where in the name of Neptune". However, Sandy may be <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> since she is a land critter from Texas and she brought Christmas down to Bikini Bottom (even though Santa Claus did not come and Squidward had to give away everything but his new clarinet instead).<sup id="_ref-Christmas_Who.3F_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Christmas_Who.3F" title="">[17]</a></sup> In the episode, "<a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_In-Law_4b82.html" title="Enemy In-Law">Enemy In-Law</a>," Mr. Krabs is shown stealing a hat from a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a>.

<p>It is most likely that in Bikini Bottom, most of the citizens enjoy <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>. SpongeBob frequently watches the sport in his spare time. Squidward had dreams of becoming a <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_Receiver_ed13.html" title="Wide Receiver">Wide Receiver</a>. Sporting events occur in Bikini Bottom, such as the Fry Cook Games (parody of the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a>), the Great Snail Race, and the Anchor Toss Competition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every year Bikini Bottom has the <b>Fry Cook Games</b> (a spoof of the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> but with fast food). The Fry Cook Games are held at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum. The first annual competition was held in 1980. Eugene H. Krabs and Sheldon J. Plankton went head to head against each other until the 21st Fry Cook Games in 2001. There, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Krusty_Krab_c9bd.html" title="The Krusty Krab">The Krusty Krab</a> was represented by SpongeBob SquarePants, and The Chum Bucket was represented by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Star_7e8c.html" title="Patrick Star">Patrick Star</a>. In the 21st Fry Cook Games, there were 8 events. The tie breaker was bun wrestling. The winner was never determined.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[29]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Great Snail Race</b> is an annual race between snails at Oyster Stadium, which is located in the Bikini Bottom Zoo. At the pre-game ceremony, of the 102nd Running of the Snail, Lightning Larry Luciano (The winner of the first race) lights the <i>Torch of Good Sportsmanship</i> (although very slowly). After the torch is lit, the games begin. The first snail to make it across the finish line, wins. The result of the 102nd race ended with Rocky (won by default, owned by <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Star_7e8c.html" title="Patrick Star">Patrick Star</a>, actually a rock) in first place, Snellie (owned by <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squidward_Tentacles_1ba5.html" title="Squidward Tentacles">Squidward Tentacles</a>) in second place, and Gary (disqualified, owned by <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_SquarePants_f415.html" title="SpongeBob SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>) in last place, disqualified due to the coach running on to the race track. Patrick had the trophy engraved to Squidward Tortellini (mistaken for Squidward Tentacles), because he had wanted to win very badly.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[30]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Anchor Toss Competition</b> is a contest of strong ocean dwellers tossing a large anchor on a 510+ yard field. A referee goes and measures the distance between the tosser and the anchor, but is constantly hit by it. SpongeBob was part of the contest, along with Sandy Cheeks, Don the whale, and Larry the Lobster.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../j/e/l/Jellyfishing.html" title="Jellyfishing">Jellyfishing</a></b> is a fictional sport that is similar to <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a>. It involves hunting jellyfish using a wooden net and a plastic jar. The sport was first introduced in the episode "<a href="../../../j/e/l/Jellyfishing_%28SpongeBob_SquarePants_episode%29_7e53.html" title="Jellyfishing (SpongeBob SquarePants episode)">Jellyfishing</a>." In the episode, the characters SpongeBob and Patrick take their neighbor Squidward to Jellyfish Fields, where many episode plots involving jellyfishing would be set in. <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon.html" title="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, the cable TV network that owns the rights to <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>, has released two products based on the sport. They are slumber bags and wall borders.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[31]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>'<b>Bubble blowing</b> is another hobby in Bikini bottom. But the only bubble blowers known are SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, although Squidward has blown bubbles before.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[32]</a></sup> SpongeBob once set up a <i>Bubblestand</i> and charged 25 cents for bubble blowing; 25 cents for lessons. There is a special <i>technique</i> to bubble blowing: "First go like this, spin around. Stop. Double take 3 times: 1, 2, 3. Then, PELVIC THRUST. Stop on your right foot, DO not FORGET IT. Then bring it around town. Then you do this, then this, and this, then this, then that, then this and that." Some awkward shapes of bubbles include an elephant (Patrick: It's a Giraffe!), butterflies, worms, among others. Two bubble-themed episodes are "<a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubblestand.html" title="Bubblestand">Bubblestand</a>" and "<a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubble_Buddy_7c32.html" title="Bubble Buddy">Bubble Buddy</a>."</li>

There are even weight lifting competitions at Goo Lagoon. SpongeBob even has a small fitness center at his house. However, instead of weights, SpongeBob uses stuffed animals (rabbits) as weights. SpongeBob has used a stick with two marshmallows attached to it, which he could not lift. <b>Swimming</b> is a very popular sport at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goo_Lagoon_01ef.html" title="Goo Lagoon">Goo Lagoon</a>. There are small circular pools elsewhere in the city. <b>Volleyball</b> Just like the real sport.
