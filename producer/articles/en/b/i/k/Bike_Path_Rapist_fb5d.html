<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/k/Bike_Path_Rapist_fb5d.html" title="Edit section: The lead up to the arrest of Sanchez">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The lead up to the arrest of Sanchez</span></h2>
<p>Armed with information from a DNA profiler that a suspect was Hispanic, members of the Bike Path Rapist Task Force started putting together separate lists of men: one list of all the Hispanic men who were interviewed by the Amherst Police Department during the Linda Yalem murder investigation, a second list of Hispanic men who were arrested in the City of Buffalo for prostitution, and a third list of Hispanic men who were questioned in a series of unsolved rape cases in the City of Buffalo.</p>
<p>The third list led police to Wilfredo Caraballo, initially questioned by Buffalo Police in 1981 concerning a rape in Delaware Park.Days after that rape, the victim told police she saw the man who attacked her at the Boulevard Mall. A friend with the victim wrote down the license plate of the car the suspected attacker was driving. The plates were traced to a car driven by Caraballo.</p>
<p>Police wanted to talk to him as a potential person of interest in the Bike Path Rapist case, but he now lives in North Carolina.</p>
<p>"We took a second look at the uncle, who lives out of state. And we thought the best way to clear him was to get his DNA," said Patronik.</p>
<p>Police called Caraballo in North Carolina, and because of having to cross state lines and different jurisdictions, they determined it might be too difficult to obtain a sample of his DNA.</p>
<p>Instead, Caraballo's brother, who still lives in Buffalo, agreed to provide police with a sample of his own DNA.</p>
<p>Those test results cleared both uncles, but the results also determined that a close relative of the men might be a strong match for the DNA found at a number of crime scenes.</p>
<p>Patronik says that the doctor who conducted the DNA test told police, "I think you're warm, and it could be someone in the family."</p>
<p>At the very same time, Caraballo called one of the investigators back to give him new information about who was driving that car back in 1981. Initially, he told police the car was sitting in his driveway.</p>
<p>"Wilfredo had called me, and he admits to me, someone was driving that vehicle. And I said, 'who might that be?' He said 'my nephew Altemio.' I said 'did you ever tell the police?' And he said 'I don't remember if I did' which is an indication that he probably didn't," said Rozansky.</p>
<p>Police who were cross-referencing the lists of Hispanic men arrested for prostitution in Buffalo and Hispanic men questioned by Amherst Police also obtained the name "Altemio Sanchez."</p>
<p>"Three different people were doing three different things. And it did all come together at once. So it's hard to say there was an 'aha' moment. For the first time ever, in all these years of investigations, we finally had all the pieces of the puzzle in one place. And everything got laid on the table, and all of a sudden, it just 'popped.' And all these different investigators started coming up with the same name," said Redmond.</p>
<p>"When all the leads and all the information we had converged on Mr. Sanchez, he was a lot better looking suspect than anybody we had prior to that. And everything seemed to fit," said Savage.</p>
<p>"25-plus years on investigation. And this case came down to about an hour," said Nigrelli.</p>
<p>Police knew Sanchez's pistol permit was revoked because of previous prostitution arrests, but that pistol was never turned into authorities.</p>
<p>Investigators thought they could potentially obtain Sanchez's DNA from sweat that may have been on the gun. So police questioned Sanchez at his home on Allendale in Cheektowaga, and he placed the pistol in a clear plastic bag for the officers.</p>
<p>"He seemed pretty matter of fact about the whole thing," said Savage.</p>
<p>Police also questioned Sanchez's co-workers at the company commonly referred to as American Brass.</p>
<p>"And we spoke with some people who knew him, and asked about him, at his place of employment, and everyone said 'gee, he's a nice guy.' At the time, they didn't know why we were looking at him, we didn't tell them," added Savage.</p>
<p>Because police did not obtain a strong enough DNA sample, and believed Sanchez was at the top of their list of potential suspects, the Cheektowaga man was followed 24/7. He was observed going shopping, going to the doctor's office, even the gym.</p>
<p>"He liked to do his shopping and his everyday things in the morning, after work," said Patronik.</p>
<p>"It was a pretty intense couple of days," said Savage.</p>
<p>Mychajliw: "How so?"</p>
<p>Savage: "There are so many things going through your mind. We had him under surveillance. Number one, you don't want to lose him. You don't want him to go out, when we're supposed to be around him, and have him get away and commit another crime."</p>
<p>The most important part of surveillance for police: trying to obtain a sample of Sanchez's DNA with the hopes of comparing it to DNA samples found at various crime scenes.</p>
<p>But how could they follow him so close, collect DNA evidence, and not be seen?</p>
<p>Investigators had their answer the Saturday night before the arrest. That is the night Sanchez and his wife dined at Sole' in the Walker Center Plaza on Main Street in Williamsville.</p>
<p>"I was at Sole' when we observed him go in," said Rozansky.</p>
<p>Investigators told the staff there not to touch anything on Sanchez's table. His waitress even apologized for not clearing the table right away. Three officers immediately took the dinnerware once Sanchez and his wife left.</p>
<p>Another team of investigators followed him to the Borders Bookstore on Walden near the Galleria Mall.</p>
<p>There, police also obtained a coffee cup used by Altemio Sanchez.</p>
<p>"We had another surveillance team pick him up (follow him). And they had another item. So, it was not a good night for Altemio," said Rozansky.</p>
<p>The next day, at approximately 5pm on Sunday, a doctor at the Erie County Crime lab called officers at the Bike Path Rapist Task Force Headquarters at 45 Oak Street with the news: he believed the DNA obtained from Sanchez matched DNA found at various crime scenes.</p>
<p>Police believed Altemio Sanchez was the so called Bike Path Rapist.</p>
<p>A number of officers were sitting around a conference call at 45 Oak Street and heard the news.</p>
<p>"I was speechless. I was stunned. It was like winning the Super Bowl. Hitting a home run to win the World Series. And winning the Presidency all at once," said Redmond.</p>
<p>"It's probably the longest 24 hours I've ever waited. I couldn't believe it. I was actually in shock.</p>
<p>He's been at this so long. And so many attacks. The guy was like a phantom. And to put a face, a name, to who he was, to have his DNA in hand, to definitively show that he was the guy, it was the high point of anything I'll ever be a part of investigating," said Savage.</p>
<p>Now police had to determine when and where they were going to place Altemio Sanchez in custody, and how they were going to interview him.</p>
<p>"And just like a little kid the night before Christmas, I didn't sleep. I didn't sleep through the night. I tossed and turned. I thought about different interview tactics," said Nigrelli.</p>
<p>Sanchez worked the overnight shift at American Brass Sunday night into Monday morning.</p>
<p>Three police cars followed him. Most streets were empty because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. A light snow fell that morning.</p>
<p>"We had to stick with him. We were pretty sure he knew that we were following him. It was Martin Luther King Day. There wasn't much traffic on the roads as usual, so that made it even harder for us. He pulled over to the right side of the road, State Police Vehicle got in front of him, and I was behind him. And one of our vehicles was on the side of him. He just asked us 'what was going on.' We just told him we needed to talk to him. He wasn't under arrest at that time. Had him get out of the car, he was searched, placed into one of our vehicles, and he was driven back to be interviewed. This guy is thinking about how he's going to react to that day, for the last 25 years. I'm sure he's rehearsed that moment in his head a million times," said Savage.</p>
<p>Sanchez was interviewed for about ten hours by investigators on West Eagle Street. Eventually, police told Sanchez about all of the DNA evidence, and how a sample of his DNA was collected.</p>
<p>Days after the arrest, 2 On Your Side confirmed that a photograph of Sanchez and his wife taken at a party was Friday, September 29th, the same day Joan Diver disappeared.</p>
<p>Members of the Bike Path Rapist Task Force credit cooperation from a number of police agencies for making an arrest.</p>
<p>"For the first time ever, in all these years of investigations, we finally had all the pieces of the puzzle in one place. This task force has only been around for two months. Nobody had everything all at once," said Redmond.</p>
<p>But did police drop the ball individually twice in this investigation? Once back in 1981 when Buffalo Police officers took Wilfredo Caraballo's word that no one drove his car. Could officers have questioned his neighbors to see if it ever left the driveway? Could they have put more pressure on Caraballo?</p>
<p>Amherst Police also questioned Altemio Sanchez after Linda Yalem was killed, even collected his fingerprints.</p>
<p>On January 15, 2007, police in <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erie_County%2C_New_York_fad6.html" title="Erie County, New York">Erie County</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> arrested a suspect named Altemio Sanchez and charged him with the murder of Majane Mazur, a charge to which Sanchez has pled not guilty. On January 19, 2007, an Erie County grand jury voted to indict Altemio Sanchez for the murders of Linda Yalem and Majane Mazur.</p>
<p>Police say DNA found at eight crime scenes matches DNA secretly taken from Sanchez before his arrest<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Many of the rapes attributed to the killer will go unprosecuted due to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> on the prosecution of rape that was in effect in New York at the time those crimes were committed<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
