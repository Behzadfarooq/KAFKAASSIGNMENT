<p>Thank you for correcting the libelous, slanderous and erroneous vandalism that occured to the Nancy Steinbeck site regarding accusations of fraud and other misrepresentations. The person who vadalized the site is very sick, and lawyers are watching her stalking behavior. Could you please keep an eye on the site and continue to revert the material back to the original text? She re-posted her venom immediately after you made the correction.</p>

<p>Sorry but you were the only person who left a link on my page, im wondering if you can help me? Images are not loading on the wikipedia site, they are coming up with small crosses, is there anything i can do?</p>
<p>In reply, thanks for trying to help but not looging in for a few days seems to have cleared the problem, apparently the area i live in has a weak internet connection and sometimes things like this happen. Thanks for helping i appreciate it.</p>
<p>That article on sn00ker has been taken off, just to let you know. What a waste!</p>

<p>You wrote: &gt;hi -- I see that you have said (on Talk:Dibatag) that you are the copyright holder for &gt;the text that was on Dibatag. I don't know if that will help, since we can't tell where &gt;the text came from (except that at least part of it was written by "Bauer, J") and we &gt;can't tell who you are. So you can see how it's not a very compelling argument, at least &gt;from a legal standpoint. Perhaps another admin can help sort this out.</p>
<p>&gt;I would add that a Wikipedia rule is no original research, so putting your own scientific &gt;work into wikipedia, particularly if it's not published, is generally frowned upon.</p>
<p>&gt;I wrote a brief stub on Dibatag/Temp as a placeholder, and you should feel free to edit &gt;that as you wish, since you say it is incorrect and you obviously know a great deal more &gt;about the dibatag than I. Bikeable 18:20, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I say:</p>
<p>Yes, I am the author and sole copyright holder and it is an adapted summary - i.e. not the scientific publication, which was published by the Somali National University - it is there in the library but is not on the internet. I therefore believe that your argumentation holds no ground.</p>
<p>See, I am not interested to edit factual wrong stubs, which were created by copying wrong info from an xyz website to wikipedia. I wanted to contribute significantly, but if the admins and others do not like it or make things overly difficult, then I just leave it, though I feel that to create such hickups is against the spirit of Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Well, I was editing the page for something else, and saw the links of the form [[plural link]]s, and I just assumed that they would look funny -- like <u>bear</u>s -- so I thought I was cleaning them up. Now that I poke around a little more, I see that the wiki engine displays [[bear]]s as <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bears.html" title="Bears">bears</a>, which is pretty clever. So I was making entirely useless changes.

<p>G'day Bikeable,</p>
<p>the trend of nominators voting came about because one closing admin (I forget who, but I suspect it might have been <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> – it often is) announced he wasn't counting nominations as votes. Suddenly a bunch of nominators started adding explicit "votes", and one user even modified the AfD page to say "you should vote to begin consensus-building", which is the closest thing to nonsense on stilts you'll find in a Wikipedia guideline. My problem with nominators voting (apart from the sheer repetitive inelegance of it) is that: a) it discourages well-written nominations, since the nominator's intention is summed up with a simple "delete" (or, occasionally, merge or speedy delete, because people are silly); and b) it encourages the perception that AfD is a vote. AfD is <i>not</i> a vote, although it has vote-like aspects&#160;;-), and a well-written argument for deletion is worth several times its value as a "vote".

<p>When I went to list him I discovered that he had already been listed with a note that he had requested to be blocked as I had added that note to his talk page. I proceeded to add a link to it under the block request, but discovered he had already been blocked. I have had an extensive email dialogue with the user in question. He is pretty pissed about trademark infringement. I advised him to take it up with permissions/wikimedia folk and possibly contacting the Dutch group if he has international trademark status. The blocking admin gave him similar advice on the talk page of an IP that he was using after he was blocked. The page is now semiprotected with the {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses4_0ba2.html" title="Template:Otheruses4">Template:Otheruses4</a>}} tag on it. He seems to have stopped for now.

<dd>I should have gone to bed long ago, however staying up has allowed me further communication with the "vandal." He just sent me a rather cordial email explaining how he isn't a bad person, just someone who has been writing code for 20 hours straight. I think he has legitimate points. I have advised him to bring them up on the talk page of the article whe the block expires. He will not be vandalizing the page any longer. I have explained relevant policies regarding naming conventions and hope I have allayed (alaid, it's too late to think right now) some of his fears regarding how the article ranks on google. We are working it out offsite and it will no longer be a problem. I ask that you keep the page on your watchlist to see what he puts on the talk page. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 10:41, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Check the external links for my source for the diagnostic criteria for this personality disorder. I am of the understanding that the inclusion of DSM diagnostic criteria is acceptable on Wikipedia based on their existence in numerous articles. You are certainly mistaken about the copyright holder. Although Psychnet-UK.com has reprinted the diagnostic criteria from the DSM, they are not the copyright holder; they merely have the first page that comes up when performing a Google search for <i>self-defeating personality disorder</i> and <i>sadistic personality disorder</i>. --<a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENeantHumain_9180.html" title="User:NeantHumain">NeantHumain</a> 22:40, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again. I can't really say I'm interested in having a lengthy discussion on copyright issues. The <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_5c59.html" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">DSM</a> is psychiatry's bible. It's a big fat book listing descriptions, diagnostic criteria, and other information about all kinds of psychiatric disorders. It also contains some appendices as many books do. One of the appendices apparently contains disorders that, for various reasons, are not part of the formal diagnostic taxonomy for the time being. Self-defeating personality disorder, sadistic personality disorder, and depressive personality disorder are among these. They are included to continue research into their validity and usefulness. I do not know APA's position on the use of DSM materials on Wikipedia, but it is already prolific (look up nearly any of the DSM's disorders), so I am merely keeping with current practice. I do not know whether Wikipedia has obtained the right permission to have DSM diagnostic criteria listed, but this article isn't exactly a novel case. Sadly, I have very little interest in formal procedure, policy, and other bureaucratic matters; so I suggest you pursue this matter with someone who might be better acquainted with what copyright permissions the American Psychiatric Association has granted Wikipedia. Again, I only see a precedent which says diagnostic criteria from the DSM is acceptable material here.--<a href="../../../n/e/a/User%7ENeantHumain_9180.html" title="User:NeantHumain">NeantHumain</a> 00:06, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I noted you put the notice up on the Fightdemback.com article.</p>
<p>Almost the entire article was a fairly mad smear article written by a noted Sydney neo-nazi (darrinh) who has a bit of a beef with FDB due to this article;- <a href="http://www.fightdemback.org/2005/12/19/who-is-who-in-the-nazi-zoo/" class="external free" title="http://www.fightdemback.org/2005/12/19/who-is-who-in-the-nazi-zoo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fightdemback.org/2005/12/19/who-is-who-in-the-nazi-zoo/</a> (Copied from the daily telegraph which is no longer available)</p>
<p>The only real non defamatory stuff in the wikipedia article was the name of the site and the fact its an anti-racist group. The utter nonsense about pornography is pure garbage, and asserting that the group is comprised of "anarchists and communists" etc, a common smear the far right uses against anyone left of ghengis khan, is just plain unfair and wrong. FDB is a respected organisation that has provided consultation to legislators, expert witnesses in courtrooms, and intelligence consulting to federal and state police agencies, among other things. Its a community group, that yes, does have a bite.</p>
<p>How would I go about calling for a deletion vote? I could rewrite a new article, but I am involved with the group (I'm a security studies lecturer in perth, and provide some consulting to the group as well as assist with the website) , so I would probably require someone to go over it to point out obvious POV errors.</p>
<p>Personally I'd rather just have the thing deleted. I'll be the first to admit I'm a little rusty with wikipedia layout conventions.</p>

<p><br />
Seems that Mr. DuckMonster is not telling the whole truth. Most of the forum members of fightdemback are self admitted marxists. They were booted from their previous hosting provider for storing adult material in breach of the TOS. Unfair and Wrong?, perhaps Mr DuckMonster you should have considered that beforehand and that user profile that one of you created about me in wikipedia was just plain silly. - darrin.</p>

<p>I don't think the comment that Wikipedia isn't a recipe book is useful. Bacon and Egg pie is a culturally significant UK food. There are a heap of obscure US foods like <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pot_pie.html" title="Pot pie">Pot pie</a> that have articles. While the current article is a stub, it does provide the basic information to differentiate between <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon_and_egg_pie.html" title="Bacon and egg pie">Bacon and egg pie</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiche.html" title="Quiche">Quiche</a>, a food uniformed barbarians may mistakenly think is similar. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Law_9021.html" title="User:Alex Law">Alex Law</a> 02:28, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i -- thanks for the note. That's fine, a little more research shows me it's pretty well used and significant enough. Sorry if I was too quick on the deletion tag -- fortunately, {{prod}} lends itself to an easy removal. I would ask you to add a sentence or two about the cultural significance, if you can -- even a statement of where it is popular would give it some context. thanks! <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong> 03:00, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Unfortunately as a first generation Australian of UK extraction, I can't give much info on the regional/cultural importance of <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacon_and_egg_pie.html" title="Bacon and egg pie">Bacon and egg pie</a>, that would have to come from someone in the UK.

<p>Please remove the speedy deletion on User talk talk:Get-back-world-respect. There is currently a dispute up on AN/I about whether that user should be allowed to delete his User Talk space. That user has put up an invalid speedy deletion on their user talk space.

They even blocked my talk page and removed my request to get it deleted and my statement that I wanted to retreat and get no further messages there.

<p>I disagree with your listing my previous submission for deletion, but I am unsure whether this is the apporpriate place for this "discussion" to take place. Nevertheless, the article is entitled the Hypermodernity Club, and you seemed to dismiss it quite flippantly, not to mention that I perused your interests and continental thought was conspiciously absent. I am a college professor and although I have just begun to contribute to Wikipedia, I was quite shocked that my article was met with suspicion so soon. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paulambery01 (<a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaulambery01_4f58.html" title="User talk:Paulambery01">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paulambery01_f76f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paulambery01">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I noticed you added a prod tag to this article and write to explain my subsequent removal of the tag. Consistent with <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, after a tag has once been removed, it should not be re-added, irrespetive of the propriety of the original removal or the (arguably) untoward behavior of the remover in failing to explain his/her removal on the talk page or in an edit summary. Even as I likely will vote to delete the article should it be listed on AfD (I'm not convinced that it's original research, at least in view of our general tendency against ascribing that appellative to sundry video game summaries, notwithstanding some of my objections to that [ostensibly settled] policy), I don't think we should act contrary to policy here, and I expect you simply didn't notice that the prod tag had already been added and subsequently been removed (I, myself, having made that error on two occasions now review edit histories to ensure the tag hasn't already been applied). In any case, I left a note on the talk page of <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a>, the original prodder, to the effect that he may want to list the article for deletion, so likely the page will be taken care of in any case.

<dd>I assumed it was a video game summary, but the article doesn't seem to say.

<p>B - I couldn't dig up a reference for you on the edit I made to your hip hop page. It's a great page, but the purpose of the edits was to properly frame the early participants. Given the nature of the work, it's not enough to say that I was there - but the founders of hip hop would only be called "inner-city" African Americans by someone from outside of that group. As such, posting Bambaataa's statement and keeping that language is to miss the point entirely. The founders were part of a Black (US and Caribbean) and Latino (Afro/Indio/Euro Puerto Rican) collective in places like the Bronx and Harlem. Their US and Caribbean origins were a seminal part of the formation of the music. Bambaataa's statement does not say anything to contradict this. Jamaican transplants like Kool Herc and KRS-One must be part of this mix as well. I don't know if I have the time to look up a reference - but if that really matters to you - you should delve deeper because it will be impossible to find someone who was there who would suggest the roots of hip hop are not a mixture of these various African cultural elements. As for "inner city" - it's a sloppy euphemism that should be phased out as soon as possible. Moreover, additional research will reveal that many of hip hops legends (and many founders) did not reside in the so-called "inner city." Russell Simmons?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response Bikeable. Is the sandbox really a development/ staging site? I'll look - but Zoe was pretty quick off the mark, and didn't provide much of an explanation. How do you guys get to be administrators? I don't understand wiki very thoroughly yet - though I do link a lot of our oinline media article to explanations on wiki becuae I find it pretty objective, through and up to date (The Mohammed Cartoons crisis thing was an excellent and very prompt article that I linked our ABC report sites to for example).

<p>Thanks again for prompt response Bikeable. I'll follow up on your suggestions. The wiki thing continues to unfold. I love the "Recent changes patrol" .

I found an article concerning characters of a game which has been copied directly from the game iteself. The descriptions are simply those which have been given to the characters by the designers. What sort of tag should i label this article with , sorry but im totally confused.

<p>If you could look up some stuff and put this thing to rest that would be great. The main question is: does the book in fact list any 21st-century family members named Karl-Philipp V (supposedly a current prince), and a presumptive heir named Stefan? Does the book actually mention anything present-day at all, or is it just a book about the empire, which is, let's face it, gone for centuries? Everything I find says the only current prince is Karel Jan (Karel VII) Schwarzenberg, Czech senator and former chancellor. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 13:44, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps many do not uderstand the methodology around these "google" type searches Ms. Oreskes did in the ISI database. I have also tried to duplicate her work using the same search parameters. This study also shows how these work <a href="http://www.norvig.com/oreskes.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.norvig.com/oreskes.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. When I do, I typically find many articles that use the terms "climate change" that are not explicit scientific studies of attribution of human CO2 to climate change. They many times are based on biological studies of organisms adapting to "climate change", and the authors many times mention human causes as a given, but the paper's research is not about that and does not explicitly show attribution. I also suspect Ms. Oreskes is quite biased on this issue and was not an objective researcher who found what she wanted, thus not the scientific method nor following scientific principles of research. Thus I believe it significant that she has left out what % was explicit research aimed at proving or supporting attribution, or disproving explicitly natural variations or other possible causes of global warming. Perhaps this is too picky, but I value science and the scientific method highly, and her study lacks rigor and documentation and if I had peer reviewed it it would have been rejected. Thanks, I know I am in a minority but skeptics are also the heart of science and progress, and it is easy to get into groupthink and ignore us, but do so at the peril of destroying scientific debate and research. Oops, forgot to sign it.</p>
<pre>
 I am certainly glad to hear you say that the Oreskes article cannot verify that consensus exists on the AGW issue, ever since I answered the original AGU and AMS surveys in the mid 1990s, and got the responses that the majority did not line up in favor of AGW, I have suspected political biases at work lately to try and prove something that I cannot see from my interactions with paleo-climatologists and geologists.  However, from reading the Wiki page on scientofoc consensus, most people come away thinking that she proved it and it exists, that is intellectually dishonest, but I guess I can't change that since so many object.

<p>Hi there - I noticed that you've re-added the db-bio tag to the Michael Loomis new article - I had added the tag, but removed it after I re-checked the notability guidelines - the article affirms that he's a baseball catcher for a US university, and according to our notability guidelines those who play at US college level sports are notable enough for articles. Whilst it clearly needs cleaning up and rewriting - well, you've been around here a lot longer than me, from your contribs, so I just thought I'd check why you re-added the tag (no, I don't think he's a major person or anything, I'm just purely going by the guidelines, still feeling my way through deletion stuff). --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_807a.html" title="User:Mnemeson">Mnem</a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemeson_Esperanza_c3bd.html" title="User:Mnemeson/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/n/e/User_talk%7EMnemeson_24d9.html" title="User talk:Mnemeson">son</a> 15:35, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, to be perfectly honest, I've never thought patrolling new changes to speedily delete things was the most practical use of my time on Wikipedia, nor anyone else's.

<p>A colleague and I are conducting a study on health wikis. We are looking at how wikis co-construct health information and create communities. We noticed that you are a frequent contributor to Wikipedia on health topics.</p>
<p>Please consider taking our survey <a href="https://websurvey.jmu.edu/ss/wsb.dll/27/wikipedia.htm" class="external text" title="https://websurvey.jmu.edu/ss/wsb.dll/27/wikipedia.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>This research will help wikipedia and other wikis understand how health information is co-created and used.</p>
<p>We are from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The project was approved by our university research committee and members of the Wikipedia Foundation.</p>

<p>Dear Bikeable, could you please tell me why you decided to remove my contribution about 'Aviation Smog' (a new term for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contrails.html" title="Contrails">Contrails</a>) to the entry about <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smog.html" title="Smog">Smog</a>?</p>
<p>It is not uncommon and certainly not unacceptable to coin e new term for a new phenomenon, especially not if this might help to make people aware of the newness of this phenomenon. The term Smog also was a term that was newly coined for this reason:</p>
<p>The term "smog" was first coined by Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper, “Fog and Smoke,” for a meeting of the Public Health Congress. The 26 July 1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux, “[H]e said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as ‘smog.’” The following day the newspaper stated that “Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog.” (Source: <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smog.html" title="Smog">Smog</a>)</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the terms <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contrails.html" title="Contrails">Contrails</a> and Aviation <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirrus.html" title="Cirrus">Cirrus</a>, please have a look at my website with pictures of 'Aviationsmog' since 1995: <a href="http://www.contrails.nl" class="external text" title="http://www.contrails.nl" rel="nofollow">Contrails</a> Kind regards, Robert C.
