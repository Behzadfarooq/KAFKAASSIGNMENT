<p>Did Annette Funicello ever wear a bikini in a film? I seem to recall a Disney Channel documentary in which she reminisced about being asked by "Walt" always to wear a one-piece. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></p>
<p>I found this, but is it to the point?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ironically, in most of those beach movies she wears the most conservative clothes of anyone, though she's the star of "party beach" -- watch how often she's wearing hostess pants and blouses while the girls around her are in skimpy outfits. For instance, in Pajama Party she wears a nightie and flimsy robe while everyone else is in tight-fitting shorts and PJ's that become tight, wet, and see-through when everybody falls in the pool. She has said that she didn't think it would be proper for her to wear a bikini, and Walt Disney himself had asked her not to when she started making the non-Disney beach movies in the early '60s.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Carey_0db0.html" title="Mary Carey">Mary Carey</a> was recently a candidate for Governor of California, and therefore (I, in my naivete, think) a public figure.

<dd>Being a public figure is a defense against claims of breaking portrait right, not against claims of breaking copyright. If you had taken a picture of her wearing a bikini, we would have been allowed to use it, but we're not allowed to just take a picture from elsewhere and use it.</dd>
<dd>On a more positive note: <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=55305" class="external free" title="http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=55305" rel="nofollow">http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=55305</a> - it's not completely GNU/FDL compatible, since the author must be noticed before use, but it's a hell of a lot closer than much of the other things that are uploaded. <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=84025" class="external free" title="http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=84025" rel="nofollow">http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=84025</a> has no usage restrictions, but the water avoids a very good view. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndre_Engels_23d0.html" title="User:Andre Engels">Andre Engels</a> 04:37, 7 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Attribution is ok, share alike is borderline but I would like to allow it, but noncommercial is clearly going against the GNU/FDL. Also, the lower part of the bikini is almost completely covered by further clothing, which I think is a big minus.

<dd>This is a slightly confusing use of the NPOV principle. The Anome thought the article was better illustrated with the German image - i.e. his opinion was related to the presentation of the article. The NPOV principle usually relates to not advocating opinions in the article. "Bikinis are by far the best form of swimwear." etc. would be unacceptable POV.</dd>

<dd>In terms of encyclopedic value, neither image is as good as the Micheline Bernardini image. They have no historic interest or value beyond a million other photos across fashion magazines around the world. These factors are, to my mind, more important than picture quality. It is a shame the Bernardini image doesn't have a copyright tag or I would advocate removing both images and using that one as the main picture instead. I would compromise with those proposing keeping a bit of titillation in the article by keeping the FHM picture which at least comes with a bit of social commentary. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 10:23, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Anome admits that he removed the picture because in his point of view it is "licentious and objectifying," qualities that in his point of view are "unencyclopedic." Since it is impossible to define or measure licentiousness, objectification, or unencyclopedicallity, his reason for removal boils down to "he doesn't like it."</dd>

<dd>Actually The Anome didn't make those comments at all - someone else did, but he acting upon them by changing the picture. Nevertheless I think there is a difference between simply not liking the picture, and not liking it in this article. For instance, if the person in the picture were a famous model with an article, I would support including the picture in <i>that</i> article, but I don't in this. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 15:04, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Such bikini 'girl' images define what a woman should be, when they are ubiquiteous. The other images of women become invisible compared to bikini and other 'sexy' images. They are forgotten, and what is forgotten and invisible doesn't exist in people's minds. Then only the 'sexy' are images of proper women, which means that the women that are not like that have been failed. (OK, the Madonna &amp; Whore myth complicates the situation, but I don't go to that length.)</dd>

<dd>Titillation is of course in the eye of the beholder, but there are cultural definitions for pin-up images. Then members of a culture can recognize its pin-up images (if it has such). And what was the purpose of the photographer, or the model when she took that odd expression?</dd>

<dd>The image has been criticized for bringing down the tone of Wikipedia, and making people to question Wikipedia as a reliable source. I completely agree with this. An user in the featured pictures candidate discussion said he likes the image because "she's classy...". Odd criteria for selecting an image. Such image in this article can be interpreted that Wikipedia is a playground of a set of heterosexual men, who regard a woman only as a passive eye object. This surely repels some potential female contributors. However, if the image would be in the article about the model, and the model would be famous for such poses, the image would be illustrative.</dd>

<p>This is why I posted this image. The woman depicted <i>is</i> on a beach, and may well have gone swimming. She does not appear to be oppressed by the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_gaze.html" title="Male gaze">male gaze</a> in the least. However, she <i>does</i> look attractive. Should she perhaps wear a burka to prevent this? The bikini was designed for (specfically female) body display. (Note that men's swim trunks are effectively monokinis.) People who do not want to display their bodies will wear a one-piece swimsuit, or the even more modest swimwear which is available from the clothing companies that specialize in such things. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 00:32, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

What is a typical woman wearing a bikini&#160;? The asian girl is in a swimming pool, most girls I've seen in a swimming pool were wearing a bikini. IMO a bikini is a sexy outfit by nature. How to show a pic of a bikini that isn't sexy&#160;? I can imagine two solutions&#160;:</p>
<p>- showing a bikini without a girl inside&#160;?</p>
<p>- showing a girl wearing a bikini that is areal turnoff for most peoples&#160;?</p>
<p>Obviously the Michelle Bernardini pic has an historical value but what is it's copyright status, can we claim fair use&#160;? BTW I prefer not to imagine the debate if someone the idea to illustrate <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monokini.html" title="Monokini">monokini</a>. As for the picture from the German Wikipedia I find it's photographic quality very low&#160;: bad lighting, bad composition and ugly background.... <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 00:36, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Straw man argumentation. I didn't complain about the visible bare skin, but the Asian woman's expression. And people don't swim in bikini because it can lower when wet. They take the sun. That's why the picture is also unrealistic. I used the word 'sexy' sarcastically because pin-up and similar images depict what people think the other people find sexy. According to such images no man likes plump or curvy women, which is funny. If you crave for more 'sexy' images to Wikipedia, go and place some colour pictures to articles Penis and Muscle. Sarcasm aside, I agree that the Image:Bikini_Model_Jassi_3.jpg looks like it was taken in a backyard of a factory, but the woman's being is more realistic and the picture is hardly offending. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 20:24, Oct 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disambiguation page</span></h2>
<p>I propose that this article name be changed to a disambiguation page referring to each of the three bikini articles, and that this article be renamed Bikini (bathing suit). The bikini garment was named (quite inappropriately) after the atoll that was bombed uninhabitable, and I think first disambiguation reference should go first and foremost to the atoll, which is an ongoing (albeit mostly quiet) political dispute between the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_the_Marshall_Islands_d4ec.html" title="Republic of the Marshall Islands">Republic of the Marshall Islands</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Out of respect for the Bikini people to be represented fairly on Wikipedia, I propose that the atoll article be first in a disambiguation page, followed by this article on the swimsuit. That way, anyone who speaks English in the world who wants to gather sincere information on the Bikini issue will not first have to tangle with articles about what half-naked women in developed nations wear to the beach. I am also preparing to add an article for <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Bikini_7919.html" title="Flag of Bikini">Flag of Bikini</a>, one of the most memorable flags that few people have seen. (I originally lived in the Marshall Islands, and I would compare something like this to the idea of having the Titanic article space be about the Hollywood movie instead of the ship that sank, or having the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> article be about the computer game instead of the religion that founded Pennsylvania.) - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 13:57, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I oppose this proposal. It is convention here that we <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">use the most common name of a person or thing</a>. Someone looking up "bikini" is almost certainly looking for the swimming suit, and to receive an article designed "out of respect for the Bikini people to [ensure they are] represented fairly on Wikipedia" would be annoying. In common usage, the word "bikini" with no modifiers refers to the swimming suit. The (former) island has its article at <a href="../../../b/i/k/Bikini_Atoll_54a5.html" title="Bikini Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>. Consider the lone word "Washington." The only thing called simply "<a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a>" is the state, so its article goes there. Everything else has a natural disambiguator attached (not a parenthetical phrase no one ever uses outside Wikipedia). The city is <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>, the person is <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, the obelisk is the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Monument_ef56.html" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a>, and so on.

<dd>Pejoratives because, to be absolutely frank... It is <i>nauseating</i> that the most powerful country on earth nukes a distant land with whom they are not at war into the stone age, and yet "bikini" is forgotten by most in that same country except as a swimsuit that impacts men's shorts "like an atomic bomb". That adds sheer insult to injury of the Bikinian people and the people of the nearby atolls who were given fatal doses of radiation from the Bravo test. When you see the official flag of Bikini and its people — which I just barely uploaded to Wikimedia Commons — you will understand. I always attempt to speak with a neutral point of view, but in this case, I need <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepto_Bismol_0043.html" title="Pepto Bismol">Pepto Bismol</a>. Bikini's citizens are still alive and around, and they still want their atoll back, and they're still begging the United States to help them clean up the poisons that linger in their land. However, <i>editing</i> as neutrally as I can, I chose to recommend a disambiguation page instead of redirection outright. I recommend it because it really has been and still is a sensitive political issue. Would you do the same if suddenly a swimsuit called "Hiroshima" became better known than the city? - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 17:37, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't apply the results of autofellatio image poll here, the cases differ so much. The only common thing is that some people feel both the images are too obscene for an encyclopedia.

On the other hand, no-one has nominated the autofellatio image as a featured picture candidate, or criticized it pronouncing prevalent, twisted norms.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism of critism section</span></h2>
<p>"Bikinis are often criticized by feminists as a means of turning women into sex objects. Many from other cultures also criticize it for the same reason." There is lot of weasel words in this section. What cultures, what feminists? Feminism is so varied and long movement, that is is possible and even probable, that a part of is has critisized it. But which part, which authors? Does the contributor of the paragraph know it or was that just a guess? I know only a small subset of feminist literature, but I can't remember such criticism. All criticism that I remember attacks e.g. having bikini 'girls' in yellow press, beauty contest and other public rating of women's looks. But this is different from criticizing a garment. And no feminist has criticised bikini because it makes woman look unworthhy (read: hooker). They have attacked the concept of a hooker. So this addition seems unprecise, even dubious. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 12:19, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't contrib this but i jsut finished linking Feminism and unsectionizeing it. While i wouldn't have added this myself and I would like to see the support, feminism is a vast subject and im sure that there is critisim by some part of it somewhere. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 20:31, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i dont see how this really adds to the article. i dont seee how a pic of a allegegly famous chariter which i have never hear of is representative of media. id just as soon see the picture and section go and be reduced to, at most, one line int he above article. what do ya'all think about this? <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 03:09, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What happened to the use of this image? While I don't want to argue over who is cuter/prettier/sexier/blonder, that image is professional quality, while the rest that are <i>currently</i> in the article are just plain ugly (the pictures themselves, not necessarily the models). The old image is <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> and is incredibly clean. Is there some special objection which I've missed?</p>

<p><i>"Two-piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes have been observed on Greek urns and paintings, dated as early as 1400 BC."</i></p>
<p>What were these garments called? <i>"Bikini"</i> is a modern word; what were some of the older terms for two-piece garments? Did the top and bottom parts often go by separate names? If so, what were some terms historically used for the bikini top / brassiere and the bikini bottom / panties? I don't mean to sound lewd or anything, but I (and probably some readers) would be interested in knowing what some of the "real" words for these things are, apart from modern-day nicknames, euphemisms, and genericized trademarks. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvun_a92b.html" title="User:Corvun">Corvun</a> 07:42, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the "Roman Bikini" fraction of the article, the veiwpoint is somewhat skewed. I am only quoting a history channel special now, so I could be wrong, but it is beleived that the Romans beleived the breasts to be "too sexual" for public display (even in a non-nude sense), hence the women of the time wore tight cloth bands around their chests to obscure their bust lines. and they looked very sexy thank u!</p>
