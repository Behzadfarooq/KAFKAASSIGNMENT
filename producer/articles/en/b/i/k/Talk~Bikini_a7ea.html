<p>someone should put in a bit about how wearing the full bikini including bottoms has faded with the introduction of womens swim board shorts - <a href="http://starbulletin.com/96/06/24/features/story1.html" class="external free" title="http://starbulletin.com/96/06/24/features/story1.html" rel="nofollow">http://starbulletin.com/96/06/24/features/story1.html</a> <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPMA_64d9.html" title="User:PMA">PMA</a> 12:20, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, seeing as that article was written ten years ago, and bikinis don't seem to be any less popular now than they were at that time, I don't really think it was all that accurate. Full bikinis are still the most predominant female bathing suit style to this day. SteveJ2006 04:57, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The Channel4 link mentioned is of pretty dubious relevance. A couple of the entries refer to bikinis, including number 1 - reference to bikini sales skyrocketing after the release of the Bond movie <i>Dr No</i>. But it's the top 100 sexy moments in movies, not anything intrinsically (or even substantially) about bikinis. I've changed the wikilink in "Media Depictions" to a link to that site, and removed it from the "External links" section; if the consensus is to remove it altogether, I won't argue. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../p/a/d/User_talk%7EPaddles_d91c.html" title="User talk:Paddles">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paddles_cfed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paddles">C</a></sub> 12:49, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I found it really baffling that this article flat-out says "women's swim suit," when the word "bikini" is in common usage to describe a similar style of men's bathing suit. The word clearly seems to have been applied to the women's style first, but it seems bizarre to act as though men's bikinis don't exist, especially when they're referred to as such in the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedo_%28suit_style%29.html" title="Speedo (suit style)">Speedo (suit style)</a> article. I'd make the changes myself, but (a) I don't know the history of men's bikinis and (b) it would require a heck of a lot of editing of the article to change all the references that ignore men's bikinis. I'm relatively new to Wikipedia, so I don't know what the most preferable solution would be. --Grvsmth 03:02, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you. And the overall article is too focused on swimwear. I have worn men's bikini underwear since I was 12, and was surprised there is no mention of boy's or men's undergarments here. They are sometimes referred to as "European style underwear". <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETeamgoon_1f64.html" title="User:Teamgoon">Teamgoon</a> 05:39, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, balance for all such swimwear (be it for males or females) and details on the other clothing called "bikini" would be very helpful -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 18:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, I've never heard men's trunks being called bikinis (in England). Maybe that's an American thing? I've always just called them <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedos.html" title="Speedos">speedos</a>. I've added a line linking to speedos, anyway. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishies_Plaice_425f.html" title="User:Fishies Plaice">Fishies Plaice</a> 11:03, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. I've never heard anyone refer to a piece of men's swimwear as a bikini. Speedo, yes. And I'm American, so I don't think it's an American thing. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctormatt_2991.html" title="User:Doctormatt">Doctormatt</a> 02:19, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have, and I'm also an american. It's definitely far rarer in colloquial speech, but when you go into a store and need to disambiguiate what style of stuit you are looking for, I would ask for the "Bikini style" men's bathing suit, not "speedo style". Speedo is a brand... it's kind of like saying that people only ever call tissues "kleenex".<a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemon-lime_9ffb.html" title="User:Lemon-lime">Lemon-lime</a> 23:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Those are swimming trunks. The clue here is <i>bi</i>, as in <i>two parts</i>. Speedo is a brand name which has become genericised, though, like hoover or kleenex. We have had many <i>many</i> attempts to add nonsense about "male bikini wearing" so you're going to ened some really solid sources if you want anything about men in this article. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:54, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some thoughts on the images:</p>
<p>The initial picture here is good, although showing a bikini on a dummy might be more illustrative of the suit itself. That's a minor point. If the picture of the woman in the bikini is what we keep, we should probably have one right next to it of a man in a bikini for comparison.</p>
<p>The "<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monokini.html" title="Monokini">monokini</a>" doesn't really seem to add anything, since it's literally just "a bikini with the top removed."</p>
<p>The sun-bathing footnote should be text. There's really no reason to have a photograph at all.</p>
<p>The string bikini is missleading. A string bikini and a thong are different things, introduced in different time periods. Having a picture of a thong makese sense, though the picture we have is not very good. Having a picture of a string bikini doesn't really make much sense unless we have a more complete section on the development of the various styles.</p>
<p>The ancient roman mosaic is great, but the section that it's in is just a caption for the text. That section should be re-written and moved to the start of the history section with a {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} link to <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimsuit.html" title="Swimsuit">Swimsuit</a>. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 18:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Romana_del_Casale_38ae.html" title="Villa Romana del Casale">Villa Romana del Casale</a> mosaic outfits weren't "swimwear" at all -- they were workout gear (for exercising and competing athletically in). Someone has removed the section; it should probably be restored (I just added a link for now). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 13:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added an image of Princess Leia in the infamous metal bikini. Hopefully it will be considered appropriate; I think it is because an illustration would serve well since there are no pictures for that section (media depiction). <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedd_the_Jedi_745b.html" title="User:Jedd the Jedi">Jedd the Jedi</a> 10:37, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks to me like the amount of images on this page is getting <b>way</b> out of hand. Personally, I don't think this page needs any images at all. Who can seriously claim to not know what a bikini looks like? However, I think at the most three images can be justified in an article of this length. I'm going to remove the most recent additions and move the remaining images around to improve the layout. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotman1974_0598.html" title="User:Robotman1974">Robotman1974</a> 11:43, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
