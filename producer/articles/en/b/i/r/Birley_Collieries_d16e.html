<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birley_Collieries_d16e.html" title="Edit section: The collieries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The collieries</span></h2>
<p>The Birley collieries were owned by the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Coal_Company_76c9.html" title="Sheffield Coal Company">Sheffield Coal Company</a> who also owned nearby Brookhouse and North Staveley collieries. These collieries stood either side of the M.S.&amp; L.R. line less than a mile to the east of Woodhouse East Junction.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a> the Sheffield Coal Company, which had been founded in 1805, signed an agreement with the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Manvers_0fe1.html" title="Earl Manvers">Earl Manvers</a> to work below his lands in the Frecheville, Woodhouse and Hackenthorpe area, just outside the then Sheffield boundary. Over the following ten years they sunk and developed <b>Birley West Colliery</b> on a site in the Shirebrook Valley between <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodhouse.html" title="Woodhouse">Woodhouse</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hackenthorpe.html" title="Hackenthorpe">Hackenthorpe</a>.</p>
<p>A further 10 year plan followed in which more land was acquired and a new shaft sunk, however, it was not until Spring <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a> that work commenced on this new sinking. The following year the part completed colliery gained the name <b>Birley East Colliery</b>. Although a small amount of coal was being cut from the new colliery, brought to the surface at Birley West, it was not until <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> when a new winding engine was installed that it fully came on stream. Later expansion came with mining rights being obtained from the Duke of Norfolk to mine below Handsworth Common.</p>

<p>Birley West drew its last coal in 1908 and production then concentrated on the East pit.</p>
<p>The last coal was drawn at Birley East on 15 October <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> but the life of the pit was not quite at an end. In December 1943 <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Bevin_13aa.html" title="Ernest Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>, the Minister of Labour announced to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> at a ballot was to be held, from time to time, in which those men whose National Service Registration Certificates end with the chosen number would be transferred to the mines. This gave rise to the term <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bevin_Boy_d7f2.html" title="Bevin Boy">Bevin Boy</a>. Many colliers had the new trainees alongside the production unit but at Birley they were able to use the recently closed facilities. Accommodation was provided in Nissen huts on Beighton Road, the first occupants arriving in early <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>.</p>
<p>Following the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the demobilisation of the Bevin Boys, came new trainees, this time men from our allies in Europe wanting to make their home in England, particularly a large contingent from Poland. Even after the last trainee moved on the end was not quite in site, a new borehole topped with a pumping house was constructed on the site to help solve the water table problems at Brookhouse. This operated until the closure of Brookhouse Colliery in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> when it was finally switched off - the end for Birley had arrived.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birley_Collieries_d16e.html" title="Edit section: The Birley Branch">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Birley Branch</span></h2>
<p>In 1851 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway proposed to construct a series of short branch lines with the objective of increasing the railways coal carrying. Parliamentary permission for these lines was granted under the M.S.&amp; L.R. (Coal Branches) Act, 1852 but only one of the lines was built, that from Woodhouse East Junction to Birley (West) Colliery.</p>
<p>The Birley Coal Branch was 2.75 miles in length and came into use in June 1855, having being built by Thomas Waring and Company for the sum of 9989.00. The line was single track and operated under "One engine in steam" principle. The line was worked by the M.S.&amp; L.R. (later <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Central_Railway_afed.html" title="Great Central Railway">Great Central Railway</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_%26_North_Eastern_Railway_5570.html" title="London &amp; North Eastern Railway">London &amp; North Eastern Railway</a>) until 1934 when the colliery company took over operations. It was at this time that the colliery changed from a production unit to a training centre.</p>

<p>This accident took place on the section between Woodhouse and Birley West colliery. The " <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_Mails_3ed9.html" title="Paddy Mails">Paddy Mail</a>" was 'topped and tailed' by colliery locomotives, BIRLEY No.3 at the front and ORIENT at the rear. The driver on the front locomotive, Mr. A. Brammer, should have been in possession of the single line staff for the section, but he did not have it and the train was involved in a head on accident with a light locomotive coming in the opposite direction. The two coaches were so badly damaged that they were replaced with a rake, bought second - hand, from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Northern_Railway_%28Great_Britain%29_198e.html" title="Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)">Great Northern Railway</a>.</p>

<p>The Paddy Mails were not the only passenger trains to use the branch. On an annual basis, from the mid-1890s to the outbreak of World War One, the branch was used by the "Pitmen's Family Outing" - a trip, on which the workers voted for the destination from a selection of seaside resorts. The workers contributed 2d (less than 1p) per week to the 'trip fund'. The trains were run on Saturday's and started as early as 3.00 a.m. from the colliery yard, passengers boarding by ladder into coaches which could only be described as 'basic'- compartment stock with no toilets. The return train, depending on destination, could arrive back well into the early hours of the Sunday morning.</p>
<p>On 15th June <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> three trains were run, in the working timetable, No.15 from Beighton at 5.00 a.m., No.14 and No.16 from Birley Colliery yard at 4.35 a.m. and 5.10 a.m. to Bridlington and Scarborough. All trains also called at Woodhouse. The trains arrived back just after midnight. In total these trains were shown as carrying 50 Committee, 2,500 adults and 350 children.</p>
<p>In 1913 the excursion ran to Blackpool with a departure time from the colliery yard around 3.00 a.m. and an arrival back at 5.00 a.m. on the Sunday.</p>

<p>All the locomotives, except those shown, passed to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Coal_Board_1869.html" title="National Coal Board">National Coal Board</a> on nationalisation. The locomotives could be found working at either Birley or Brookhouse collieries as required, although some were allocated specific workings.</p>
