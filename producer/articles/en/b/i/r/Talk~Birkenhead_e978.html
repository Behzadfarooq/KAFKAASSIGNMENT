<dd>I live in Birkenhead and I do not at all consider myself to be a scouser, the accent is not at all alike. I also hate living in this area and am ashamed to admit it to fellow Brits as it's such a chav-infested area.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Liverpool was (and still is) a place you went to rather than the place you lived in. They had different councils and were in different counties. When I worked during a vacation for Birkenhead Corporation's Parks &amp; Gardens Dept 38 years ago, there was an old gardener there, who reckoned that there were small differences in the words used. Examples of the words he gave are 'jigger' and 'entry' to mean an alleyway. Of course being a scouser isn't just about the accent but shows there were different histories. Inevitably, after the first tunnel was built there was greater mixing and the differences in language may have been vanishing fast even then. In the 1950s, there were certainly people in Woodchurch with the old Cheshire accent,which was more of a country accent, but the next generation went to the local schools and assimilated. <a href="../../../j/m/c/User%7EJmcc150_196b.html" title="User:Jmcc150">JMcC</a> 10:15, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was born in &amp; live near to Birkenhead. I was born in sight of the Pier Head, if that counts for anything! I'm happy to be called a 'Scouser'. Scouse is quite tasty. Though this isn't the Wiki definition, I would consider the most modern version of a 'Plastic Scouser' to be someone who has disowned the 'Liverpool conurbation', to any extent, &amp; now lives in another city.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Liverpool &amp; Birkenhead are, essentially, a single conurbation, these days, courtesy of the ferries, underground railway &amp;, particularly, the road tunnels. As JMCc, pointed out, the western Wirral accent has, or at least did have, a more rural inflection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>n.b. Skaus is a Norwegian-Viking word, &amp; may be a word which was introduced to the area much earlier than C19. Wirral was occupied by Norse Vikings during the early 10th century. <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/-sczsteve/VIKING_WIRRAL.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/-sczsteve/VIKING_WIRRAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">Viking Wirral</a></dd>

<dd>The article has now been corrected. WikiPedia is not a democracy no matter how many times you try to use it for your propoganda purposes, no matter how many of your mates you get to vote it will still be free for anyone to delete as it is simply wrong.

It was abolished in 1965 after being gutted in 1889 to form the County of London. The end.</i> as an unacceptable example and your over simplification of the situation regarding Cheshire falls into the same category. Yorkshire has never existed as an administrative county in any form: are you therefore trying to tell me I'm not a Yorkshireman? The county of Cheshire is a traditional and historic entity, not just a former administrative county. An encyclopedic article must reflect this. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshire_Phoenix_%28194.203.110.127%29_a8d8.html" title="User:Yorkshire Phoenix (194.203.110.127)">Yorkshire Phoenix</a> 08:48, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A distinction should be drawn between the content of the article and which categories it's in. The system of categorisation we have uses the modern <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_counties.html" title="Ceremonial counties">ceremonial counties</a> (which is why <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleckheaton.html" title="Cleckheaton">Cleckheaton</a>, for example, is in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_West_Yorkshire_d1e6.html" title="Category:Towns in West Yorkshire">Category:Towns in West Yorkshire</a> rather than a "Towns in Yorkshire" category, and why <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilston.html" title="Bilston">Bilston</a> is in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_the_West_Midlands_cbe0.html" title="Category:Towns in the West Midlands">Category:Towns in the West Midlands</a> rather than <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Staffordshire_4c7e.html" title="Category:Towns in Staffordshire">Category:Towns in Staffordshire</a>). For that reason, this article should only be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Merseyside_ecc5.html" title="Category:Towns in Merseyside">Category:Towns in Merseyside</a>. Categories are not the place to explain complicated situations about what county somewhere is/was in. By all means, explain in the article that Birkenhead has historically been in Cheshire, and remains so for certain non-administrative purposes. But having it in more than one "county" category defeats the point of categorising.</dd>

<dd>Also, it was this talk page that was added to <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Cheshire_2280.html" title="Category:Towns in Cheshire">Category:Towns in Cheshire</a> rather than the article.

<p>To be honest I'm inclined to agree with you about Birkenhead and towns within the ceremonial counties falling wholly within Yorkshire. What would you do about Earlby and other Yorkshore towns administered by other authorities, such as Lancashire County Council or Co Durham? (I presume the towns formerly in Cleveland but south of the Tees are now listed under <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Yorkshire_4d9b.html" title="North Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>?) <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshire_Phoenix_%28194.203.110.127%29_a8d8.html" title="User:Yorkshire Phoenix (194.203.110.127)">Yorkshire Phoenix</a> 10:31, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To take another example, <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedbergh.html" title="Sedbergh">Sedbergh</a> is listed in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Cumbria_3a67.html" title="Category:Towns in Cumbria">Category:Towns in Cumbria</a>, but also in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Category%7EYorkshire_b580.html" title="Category:Yorkshire">Category:Yorkshire</a>. That makes sense because (i) it's currently in <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> and (ii) it is a Yorkshire-related article, having historically been in Yorkshire. Similarly, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendal.html" title="Kendal">Kendal</a> is listed in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Cumbria_3a67.html" title="Category:Towns in Cumbria">Category:Towns in Cumbria</a> and in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Category%7EWestmorland_7be8.html" title="Category:Westmorland">Category:Westmorland</a>.

<p>Given that your latest examples <i>appear</i> to support my argument that Birkenhead should be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Cheshire_2280.html" title="Category:Towns in Cheshire">Category:Towns in Cheshire</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Merseyside_ecc5.html" title="Category:Towns in Merseyside">Category:Towns in Merseyside</a> do I take it your objection is based on the confusion caused by the existence of a current local government division called <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, which doesn't include Birkenhead (a problem not apparent with <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmorland.html" title="Westmorland">Westmorland</a>)? <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshire_Phoenix_%28194.203.110.127%29_a8d8.html" title="User:Yorkshire Phoenix (194.203.110.127)">Yorkshire Phoenix</a> 11:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I was suggesting was the following: that an article on <i>Anytown</i> should be listed in <i>Category:Towns in Countyshire</i>, where "<i>Countyshire</i>" is the current <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_county.html" title="Ceremonial county">ceremonial county</a>. If there are good reasons why another county should be listed, then list <i>Anytown</i> under <i>Category:Traditionalshire</i> (but <b>not</b> <i>Category:Towns in Traditionalshire</i>). I know it's a subtle and, on the face of it, seemingly pointless distinction, but it keeps <i>Category:Towns in Countyshire</i> and <i>Category:Towns in Traditionalshire</i> consistent as listings of towns currently in each ceremonial county.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, under this approach, Birkenhead should definitely be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Merseyside_ecc5.html" title="Category:Towns in Merseyside">Category:Towns in Merseyside</a>, could legitimately be in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7ECheshire_e2ec.html" title="Category:Cheshire">Category:Cheshire</a> (although this isn't absolutely necessary), but should definitely <b>not</b> be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Cheshire_2280.html" title="Category:Towns in Cheshire">Category:Towns in Cheshire</a> (which would include only towns in the current ceremonial county, e.g. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winsford.html" title="Winsford">Winsford</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runcorn.html" title="Runcorn">Runcorn</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earby.html" title="Earby">Earby</a> should definitely be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Lancashire_b92b.html" title="Category:Towns in Lancashire">Category:Towns in Lancashire</a>, could possibly be in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Category%7EYorkshire_b580.html" title="Category:Yorkshire">Category:Yorkshire</a>, but should not be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Yorkshire_62e0.html" title="Category:Towns in Yorkshire">Category:Towns in Yorkshire</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Likewise, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch%2C_Dorset_9dbc.html" title="Christchurch, Dorset">Christchurch, Dorset</a> (a much less controversial example) should definitely be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Dorset_6602.html" title="Category:Towns in Dorset">Category:Towns in Dorset</a>, could possibly be in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Category%7EHampshire_977c.html" title="Category:Hampshire">Category:Hampshire</a>, but should not be in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Hampshire_91d9.html" title="Category:Towns in Hampshire">Category:Towns in Hampshire</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That there is still a local government division called Cheshire which doesn't include Birkenhead (or West Kirby, or Altrincham, etc.), unlike Westmorland, does indeed cause confusion. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 12:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we can agree here. Without a Category:Towns in the historic county of Cheshire it would have the capacity to cause confusion (even with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7ECheshire_e2ec.html" title="Category:Cheshire">Category:Cheshire</a>), and Birkenhead being part of the traditional county is covered in the body of the article (so long as that vandal leaves it alone). As for <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> towns in other local government areas, however, I'd have to stand by the argument that the towns themselves never left Yorkshire, and so the likes of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earby.html" title="Earby">Earby</a> should remain in <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Yorkshire_62e0.html" title="Category:Towns in Yorkshire">Category:Towns in Yorkshire</a>. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshire_Phoenix_%28194.203.110.127%29_a8d8.html" title="User:Yorkshire Phoenix (194.203.110.127)">Yorkshire Phoenix</a> 12:27, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
