<dd>Hi Mamageek. Please see my reply on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7ECondom_a1ee.html" title="Talk:Condom">Talk:Condom</a>. Is there an infobox for methods of protection against STD's? Because I think there should be some discussion taking into account the dual use of the device.

<dl>
<dd>There is already a line in the infobox relating to STD protection. I additionally added the term "Birth Control" before "Type" in order to make the infobox more general in nature. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamaGeek_2ede.html" title="User:MamaGeek">MamaGeek</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/m/User_talk%7EMamaGeek_3208.html" title="User talk:MamaGeek">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MamaGeek_df5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MamaGeek">Contrib</a>) 16:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Mamageek for jumping in to get this started. I've converted it to a wikitable which will be easier to edit and added the additional fields I first proposed on <a href="../../../b/i/r/Talk%7EBirth_control_f3bb.html" title="Talk:Birth control">Talk:Birth control</a>. I've taken the basic style from <a href="../../../d/r/u/Template%7EDrugbox_2667.html" title="Template:Drugbox">Template:Drugbox</a>, upon which I recently worked. The image will be optional (can't think there will be one suitable for coitus interruptus&#160;!), and with optional parameters of <i>width</i> (else defaults 250) and <i>caption</i>. My intention is to add a test for the 'period_LighterHeavier' value so that it either appears in one or other of the Advantage/Disadvantage sections (or not at all if undefined - eg for the natural methods). I will add conditional tests to final version, so that some entire sections are hidden if not defined (eg the Medical Notes section). I've put in dummy values for IUDs to illustrate how some of fields might be completed. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 17:47, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I like the new layout. I made a minor change in wording for consistency. Three of these fields apply only to certain types of BC (clinic review, periods, weight gain). I also see a problem with putting Advantages and Disadvantages in an Infobox at all. Some methods have long lists of either or both (see <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertility_Awareness_4450.html" title="Fertility Awareness">Fertility Awareness</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depo_Provera_caa1.html" title="Depo Provera">Depo Provera</a>, for instance). How, then, would you decide which benefits/effects make the Infobox, and which are only in the article? <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamaGeek_2ede.html" title="User:MamaGeek">MamaGeek</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/m/User_talk%7EMamaGeek_3208.html" title="User talk:MamaGeek">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MamaGeek_df5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/MamaGeek">Contrib</a>) 18:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hence those (clinic review, periods, weight gain) fields will be optional and the rows not displayed at all if not defined. As to Depo-provera - main risk emblasened across article is FDA warning re osteoporosis - but no such warning in UK (last time I remembered to look), issues of infection/bruising/bleeding at injection site wont warrant mentioning on template- I would accept "FDA warn re bone thinning", but main factors for hormonal methods risks &amp; benefits will be DVT incr,breast cancer incr, endometrial cancer decr, strokes if history migraines, and a medical note that risks of combined pills for smokers is increased such that after age 35, smokers should be on progesterone only pill instead (35 is the cut off for smoker&amp;COCP being more risky than "natural" outcome of smoker&amp;pregnant). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 22:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Think about how this will be used, effects on periods heaviness will be too complex to try and rigidly define. The only one that increases is IUDs and merely stating "heavier" is unfair as this should really be "may be heavier", similarly for COCP periods are generally lighter but also regular (one it its indications), whereas for POP they are lighter, infrequent and irregular, and for Depo-provera lighter and very infrequent (majority women by 2nd injection stop having altogether). So I shall split these into separate optional paramenters - if not defined then row not shown (so FA wont use or show either).<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 23:17, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the advantages/disadvantages section doesn't really belong. Too much of it applies only vary narrowly... to hormonal methods and IUDs, but not to the rest at all. And STD-protection yes/no doesn't belong universally in "advantages." I preferred MamaGeek's much shorter version. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 02:57, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the "Live" version, many of the parameters if not defined will not be shown at all, specifically because they do not apply to many of the natural methods. However, as a means of sumarising information, the fields are there so that data can be presented in a consistant manner. Fair point about STD - I'll make it jump between sections then. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 00:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quick question before I turn this live with coding - what to call it&#160;? Options might include 'BirthControl infobox' (my preference and will auto-locate to better place in lists of infoboxes better that other options) ), 'Infobox BirthControl', 'BirthContolBox', 'Birthcontrolbox' (but last two sound as if control boxes for birthing process). Remember <a href="../../../b/i/r/Template%7EBirthControl_811f.html" title="Template:BirthControl">Template:BirthControl</a> already active as the bottom navigation/summary box for these articles. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:30, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi MammaGook - just back from my holiday. One can change formating, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure of the problem that you are seeing on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_Family_Planning_47cb.html" title="Natural Family Planning">NFP</a> - what browser are you using - on my Internet Explorer, all data is displayed left-aligned and without any additional spacing that would make it justified (i.e. as per a newspaper when all but last line of a paragraph made to reach right-margin). Is this page still displayed in your browser as justified as of today 29th June&#160;? - if so I can easily adjust the coding... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 14:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is really strange, as quite clearly left-aligned by default when I also view with Internet Explorer 6 under Windows ME. I wonder if this is how your "my preferences" are set up? Under <b>Skin</b> are you using the "MonoBook (default)", and under <b>Misc</b> is "Justify paragraphs" unticked&#160;?

<p>The classification of any effect as an advantage or disadvantage is POV--they should be listed together as Effects, rather than separated according to an opinion of what is beneficial or harmful. Weight gain may be considered an advantage for some, while those who think STDs should be there to intimidate youths may consider disease protection a disadvantage. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:51, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Advantages &amp; Disadvantages allows for NPOV (if one can consider an increase or decrease in an outcome as a viewpoint) as both plus and minus points can be mentioned (NPOV is not about a bland averaged but reporting both sides fairly). The aim is one of distinguishing side-effects and concerns that women often express over a particular method (weight gain is far more frequently asked of me as a GP rather than precise differences in effectiveness between two methods of contraception). Likewise use of a particular method and not getting an STD is surely better than use of a method and getting an STD - however whether one should be using a particular method in the first place is not the subjective opinion that this template is designed for. What the social implications are of the differences in effects of various methods and how this affects ethical/religious views on availability or promotion of particular forms is not what this summarising template is about (for that discuss as prose within the article or in the more general <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">Birth control</a> umbrella article). Reduction in ovarian &amp; endometrial cancers for those on combined hormonal pill would seem to far outweight risks of stroke, DVT, breast cancer, so POV would be to state that evidence based medicine suggests that all women who are not actively trying to conceive should be on the pill - hmmmm no one is seriously going to try to enact that public health policy, and nor does listing the increases or descreases imply such a POV - effects at reducing or increasing certain rates of cancer can though be distinguished in the current form of the template. Finally splitting information between parameters of the template helps provide a consistamt approach at this summarising, otherwise we may as well have just an uncoordinated single parameter of "Information" with free text in a variety of styles and level of coverage in each article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right, listing increases or decreases isn't POV, but characterizing a specific change as "Good Thing" or "Bad Thing," which "Advantages/Disadvantages" does, is. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 04:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Need to call them something - one has in drug literature "purpose" or "indications" as the positive things that a treatment aims to achieve and "side-effects", "warnings" and "contraindications" as things that limit the appropriateness of using the drug, but we don't accuse drug companies of bias purely on basis of the use of these standard headings (failing to include information within a section yes). Nor, as an example, would debate over say the wisdom of treating mild depression with an SSRI (which quite rightly belongs in the article) be appropriate in the dry descriptive encyclopaedic sections of Indications and Side-effects, but rather in a separate section of "Debate" or "Controversy". So would "Actions and therapeutic effects" &amp; "Side effects" be any less POV in your POV&#160;? The current template section terminology is certainly shorter and, to my personal pro-contraception view point, "disadvantages" sounds much stronger than just "side effects". <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 05:05, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The characterization of an effect as intended occurs from the perspective of someone who prescribes the drug, or the drug company which intends it to work. We don't accuse them of bias, but it's still a specific perspective on the situation rather than an objective category that exists independent of any personal opinion about what the drug <i>should</i> do. What's intended and what's a side effect changes even within the medical community, as with offlable prescriptions. I'd rather the template be divided along more objective categories, such as types or areas of effect (effect against STDs? Effect on periods?) rather than whether such effects are good or bad. Then each reader, who has his or her own perspective on whether such things should occur, can decide which is an advantage or disadvantage. We're not here to provide advice on which method to use, just information about them. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 05:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So we would have list of parameters of possible effects eg Cancers, Cardiovascular, Weight, STD prevention etc - I suppose one could so structure if consensus of other editors so wished. However I think this will seem more awkward and is being unnecessarily slavish to those who might see offense at the current template setup (we don't allow those who object to a particular drug to alter the standard decriptive system of "Indication", "Caution", "Warnings" &amp; "Side effect" structure as set out in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDMOS_93c4.html" title="WP:MEDMOS">WP:MEDMOS</a>. It will I suspect reduce the usefulness of the template as a summarisation for those who are pro-contraception but trying to compare one method against another.

<p>I think the problem with the weight gain parameter is more that it always appears in disadvantages - the <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lactational_Amenorrhea_Method_669b.html" title="Lactational Amenorrhea Method">Lactational Amenorrhea Method</a> article currently has "weight loss" listed as a disadvantage of the method. Funny. Anyway, on topic: I prefer having advantages and disadvantages listed in the infobox. I believe it greatly increases the utility of the infobox. Any POV introduced by particular use of the box should be able to be solved by discussion on the Talk page of the particular method. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 23:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>re Weight loss - the parameter previously only considered weight loss as 'Yes' occuring or 'No' not induced. I've now added in option of 'Loss' when it is shown as an advantage (heading is 'Weight loss' rather than 'Weight gain'). Likewise STD protection, quite a few articles had this as 'Possible' which I have now included in the template coding. Let me know if any foul-ups on any page you view (but I think I have checked them all). <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:04, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest having sections "Advantages", "Disadvantages", and "Other effects". Then editors of each birth control page can decide where to put each effect. I would tend to put weight gain or loss under "Other effects" since it could be good, bad or neutral for different people. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:27, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to edit this infobox to change "failure rate" to "pregnancy rate". This is the usage in some birth control literature e.g. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1997/conceptbl.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1997/conceptbl.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and I believe this usage is growing and that it will become standard. The phrase "pregnancy rate" is much more courteous towards those people whose lives happened to begin while their parents were trying to prevent pregnancy. "Failure rate" can be perceived as very negative towards those people; "pregnancy rate" is neutral and its meaning is quite clear -- even slightly clearer than "failure rate", perhaps, which could possibly be misinterpreted in some contexts as a failure to achieve pregnancy. I'm also planning to similarly edit the wording on the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">birth control</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_family_planning.html" title="Natural family planning">natural family planning</a> pages and perhaps other pages. I'm leaving an opportunity for discussion before making the change. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:27, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree: <i>"which could possibly be misinterpreted in some contexts as a failure to achieve pregnancy"</i> – but the whole point of contraception is NOT to "achieve pregnancy". A pregnancy despite use of contraception is therefore not what is being sought and not a "success" as far as the method goes, indeed it is a negative reflection on the particular method. Terminology usage in the UK is still to describe failure rates. The view that "usage in some birth control literature ... and I believe this usage is growing and that it will become standard" is a personal opinion and thus excluded from article space by <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, unless you can site an authorative source explaining that the terminology is to change. The reference given is for a US webpage in 1997, which is hardly indicative of a changing use of terminology (just that this one paper in 1997 so phrased).</dd>
<dd>Of course I agree none of this implies any judgement on those people so borne, but we do use terms such as "planned pregnancy" or "unplanned pregnancy" when making antenatal referals or supporting people in making a decission on how they wish to proceed (continue with pregnancy or not to) - see current UK FPA's <a href="http://www.fpa.org.uk/information/detail.cfm?contentid=290" class="external text" title="http://www.fpa.org.uk/information/detail.cfm?contentid=290" rel="nofollow">Information about unplanned pregnancy in Northern Ireland</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Further, and from 2006, example of terminology usage comes from <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Health_International_ebee.html" title="Family Health International">Family Health International</a>, <a href="http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/factsheets/pillcorrect.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/factsheets/pillcorrect.htm" rel="nofollow">Using Pills Correctly</a> which describes <i>"Typical failure rates among pill users are as high as 12% to 20% in some surveys."</i> So I am not convinced of a changing international use of terms. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The only people I've seen take <i>offense</i> to the term "failure rate" are natural family planning groups, whose views that it's frequently immoral to avoid pregnancy are certainly out of the mainstream. I have seen objections to the term "failure rate" when used for barrier methods of birth control, as condom research about breakage, slippage, etc. will refer to those events as "failures" regardless of pregnancy outcome. The duplicate meaning of failure with respect to these methods can lead to confusion, and "pregnancy rate" is more precise. Not an issue with any of the other types of methods, though, so I don't have a strong opinion either way. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">C</a></sub> 02:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
