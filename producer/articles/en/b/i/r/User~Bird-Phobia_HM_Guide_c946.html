<p>This game is a role-playing, farm simulation. If you are a fan of the Harvest Moon series, this game will be a pleasant addition. If you are new to the series, then this game is not a bad choice to start off with. There are some new changes and some things that remain the same. For instance, in this game you can raise your child and the townspeople get older. You can make your own crops by hybridding. There are new animals. You can change the view around. The seasons are shortened to only 10 days. Those are only a few changes. Some things are the same. You can still get married. You can still raise crops, animals, make recipes, go fishing, expand your house, and just travel around town looking for stuff. There are sprites in this game and the Blue Feather.<br />
The story of the game is based on your character. He leaves the city to take over his father's farm. His father and Takakura once worked on the farm, but your father died and Takakura couldn't tend to the farm himself. Now you and Takakura work on the farm and you must live your life by getting married and raising a son.</p>

<p>Forget-Me-Not Valley is the name of the town you live in.</p>
<p>There are items in many of the buildings that may say a certain recipe.</p>
<p>A. Your Farm- Your farm is basically in the middle. This is where you live, grow crops, and raise animals.</p>
<p>B. The Spring- When you leave your farm and go up to the woods, you will find the spring. You can fish here and there is also allot of flowers and forage here.</p>
<p>C. Inner Inn- When you leave your farm and go down you should find the Inner Inn. You can play a milk drinking game here with Grant, Rock, or Hugh when either one of them is here. To win you have to drink more milk than your opponnet. Keep pressing "A" as fast as you can. You have 60 seconds to do this. Grant is easiest, Rock is second, and Hugh is the hardest. You do not win anything by winning.</p>
<p>D. Blue Bar- The Blue Bar is next to the inn. When Griffin is behind the bar you can order a drink. These are the drinks you can order: Red Punch- 100G Blue Punch- 100G Moon Trip- 120G Moomoo Milk- 150G Cherry Pink- 200G Stone Oil- 300G</p>

<p>F. Romana's Villa- The mansion on the pathway up from the houses is where Romana lives.</p>
<p>G. Pyrotehnician Twins- Down from the path is where the twins live. They live in the tower, not the little shed. You can play a game with them when they are there. In this game you have to get as much triangles as possible. Move your cursor over to an empty line and press "A" to activate it. Then try to close it off with surrounding lines. You can take larger areas containing more triangles. You can't take your opponnet's lines or triangles. But if you take an area with an opponnet's line then that becomes your's, but it is not the same for triangles.</p>
<p>H. Cody's Studio- Down from the Twin's house is Cody's Studio. This is where Cody lives.</p>
<p>I. Daryl's Lab- Daryl's Lab is right behind the Blue Bar.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Chapters/Walkthrough">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chapters/Walkthrough</span></h2>
<p>In this section I'll explain what happens in each chapter and what should be done. This only really explains what differences take place during the chapters since you really don't have to do anything or just do certain things like just raise animals or grow crops. Except getting married all aspects of the game are optional. I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do, but I will give my suggestion.</p>
<p>The game lasts 30 years, but you only play 10. The other 20 pass during the intervals betwen chapters.</p>
<p>To sleep you will have to go to the little table next to your bed and choose sleep. You only sleep for 6 hours, but when you get the alarm clock you can choose when to wake up.</p>
<p>Capter 1- The Beginning Chapter 1 lasts 1 year</p>
<p>When you start the game Takakura will bring you around town and your farm. Name yourself, your farm, and your cow. You will also get to pick a dog. You can have a floppy-eared one or a pointy-eared one. Name your dog. After all that you can begin to play.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1 you have to get married or the game will end. You can marry either Celia, Nami, or Muffy. Sometime during the first year the Harvest Sprites will give you the blue feather. You have to build your relationship with any of those girls up to 4 hearts to marry her. You can view their hearts in their diaries. Celia's is upstairs at the house on her farm. You can't see it, but it's on the bed. Muffy's is in the colorful lamp at the end of the Blue Bar. Nami's is in her room on her desk. Celia is the easiest to please. Her hearts go up fast. Muffy is easy too. Nami is a bit harder. Offering the feather to the girls you don't wish to marry boost the hearts of the girl you want to marry. When they accept the feather you will not get married yet, but at the end of the year. If you do not propose to anyone, at the end of the year whichever girl likes you the most will ask you to marry them. If you do not get married the game will end after this chapter.</p>
<p>In the Summer Takakura will find a horse for you. You can ride the horse anywhere in town and call it from anywhere in town by pressing "R" twice. Pressing it once calls your dog who only comes when you are on the farm.</p>
<p>Chapter 2- Happy Birthday Chapter 2 lasts 2 years</p>
<p>At the end of Chapter 1 you will get married and you will have a son. You will need to pick a name for him and also a name to have your wife call you. Your house will have been expanded, giving you a kitchen. When you talk to your son he sometimes ask to play with him. This is just picking him up then throwing him in the air, cuddling him, or singing to him. This improves your relationship with him since you cannot give him gifts yet.</p>
<p>Things have changed around town. Grant, Samantha, and Kate moved into town and built a new house. Dr. Hardy moved into Galen and Nina's house and Galen moved to a little house near Vesta's Farm. Sadly, Nina has died. Early in the morning around 6 or 7 when you speak to Galen outside his house you can play a little game where you wash Nina's grave. If you do a good job her ghost will appear and thank you. This also raises your realtionship with Galen since he is too depressed to recieve gifts.Hugh has grown up a little here. Van also starts to sell a goat, but only in the Spring.</p>
<p>Starting from here is the time to influence what career your son will take. Refer to the Children section for further information.</p>
<p>Chapter 3- Happy Harvesting Chapter 3 lasts 3 years</p>
<p>After Chapter 2 you will get a little scene hinting at what your child is interested in. Your son is older now. You can now give him gifts, but you can't pick him up anymore. Your house expanded again giving your son his own room. The items in his room reflect his career choices. Also, reading his diary tells you what he's into.</p>
<p>Not much changed around town. Hugh got a little older, so did Lumina. Now you can get Tartan and start creating hybrids. Van also starts to sell a bear. (Not a real bear, sort of)</p>
<p>You can still influence your son in this chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter 4- Happy Farm Life Chapter 4 lasts 2 years</p>
<p>After Chapter 3 you will get another scene hinting at what your son wants to be. Now your son is a teenager. Your house expanded and now you and your wife have your own room. Your character is now a little older too.</p>
<p>Mostly everyone in town has aged. Hugh, Wally, Chris, Samantha, Kate, Kassey, Patrick, Tim, Ruby, Rock, Marlin, Van, and Takakura have aged. Nami and Muffy have aged. Van starts to sell a Vase. It doesn't do anything, but it has a recipe in it.</p>
<p>You still have time to influence your child's career.</p>
<p>Chapter 5- To the Journey Chapter 5 lasts 1 year</p>
<p>You will get another scene as to what your son wants to be. Your son has aged a little bit. Your house doesn't expand anymore. Your son falls in love with either Kate or Lumina. Remember, your son will not get married. He just falls in love.</p>
<p>Nothing really changed in town.</p>
<p>Keep influencing your son's career.</p>
<p>Chapter 6- The Twilight Chapter 6 lasts 1 year</p>
<p>You get another scene as to what your son wants to be. Nothing changes at the farm. This is the last chapter and it only lasts a year, so finish up anything you wanted to do.</p>
<p>You, Takakura, Celia, Wally, Chris, Grant, Vesta, Carter, Flora, Griffin, Tim, and Daryl age. Since your son's career is set you might as well make friends with everyone you were trying to avoid while influencing your son or just anyone you didn't make friends with.</p>
<p>Your son cannot be influenced anymore. His career is decided.</p>
<p>This is the last chapter. If you completed this chapter, Congratulations, you completed the game.</p>
<p>Walkthrough- This is my suggestion as to how you should progress through the game.</p>
<p>Chapter 1- When you start the game Takakura will explain the story and the person he is speaking to is your father. He will give you a tour of the farm and you will have to name your farm, cow, and yourself. Two dogs will run up to you and you have to choose one to keep. You have the choice of a pointy-eared dog or a floppy-eared dog. Then name your dog and Takakura will give you a tour of the town and introduce you to everyone.</p>
<p>Now you begin to play. Go outside and talk to and hug your cow and then milk it. Take your cow outside using that little red button outside the Barn and you should leave it out. You might as well leave your animals outside most of the time to save fodder. Takakura left you two B rank tomato seeds in the Tool Shed. Go get them and plant them. Take out the hoe, sickle, and watering can too. Pick up the mugworts on your farm and go explore the town. As you go around pick up mugworts and flowers. Decide who you want to marry and make friends with. Child Tip- Avoid friendships with people that might influence your kid to a career you don't want easily. For instance, If you want Nami's kid to be an athlete, (Good luck), avoid friendships with Cody or Sebastian because they influence him to a career in art.</p>
<p>Go to Vesta's Farm and buy some seeds. For now, buy either 5 tomatoes and 5 watermelons or 10 tomatoes. Crops are not a good source of income, so save them for recipes.When Van comes to town buy the Brush and Fishing Pole from him. Go catch some fish and when your tomatoes are ripe, pick them and make some Marinade.</p>
<p>Go to the dig site and dig around. Unless you're trying to woo Nami you don't need to spend much time here in this chapter. Instead spend time fishing. But dig here until you find the first tablet.</p>
<p>On the first day of Summer the Harvest Sprites will give you the Blue Feather. when you have either Celia, Muffy, or Nami's affection to 4 hearts offer it to whomever you want to get married at the end. Once again, you will get married at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Sometime during Summer Takakura will buy you a horse. On a sunny day be outside when he comes back from Town.</p>
<p>Now throughout the chapter make money by shipping milk, crops, fishing, or digging. During the year I also suggest buying a male and female chicken and a sheep. Make sure you buy some Bird Feed and something to sheer the sheep too. Also build the Pond so you can get the ducks in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Now that you are done with the first chapter, you will have a wife for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Chapter 2- Now you have an cute little boy running around. You cannot give him gifts yet. To raise his affection you play a little game with him. Sometimes when you talk to him he will asked to be carried. Then pick him up and throw him in the air, hug him, or sing to him. Your son has a toy box, in it is a Scratch Pad. If you don't want him to be an artist and you have Nami's kid, take it out. You should also buy the Ball, Toy Car, and Blocks from Van. They each have a different career of influence. (See Children Section)</p>
<p>Now that your on your feet, you should follow a certain flow. Wake up and water your crops and then tend to your animals. Then go around town either fishing, making friends, taking your son places, etc. Then that night water your crops again and care for your animals and go to sleep.</p>
<p>In the Spring, either now or any other Spring, Van will start to sell a goat. When you have the money buy the goat which comes with its own milker which you don't really need.</p>
<p>The dig site has expanded giving more spaces to dig and new items. Dig until you have a desired amount of items and until you found the tablet.</p>
<p>Use that little infertile field next to your house to grow trees. Plant bananas, peaches, grapes, apples, and oranges. You have room for one more so pick another to plant. I planted another peach tree.</p>
<p>Now, a new thing you should start doing in this chapter is growing higher rank seeds. Buy fertilizer from Vesta's Farm and once a day place a bag on your crop. If you want A rank, do it once every other day, and once a day for S rank. Remember you still need to water them.</p>
<p>In this chapter you should have a goat, a cow, a bull, a horse, a sheep, a rooster, two hens, and two ducks male and female. Get any of the event items you missed and buy all of the tools from the Ledger.</p>
<p>Now you will get a scene hinting at what your son is on the path to be.</p>
<p>Chapter 3- Follow the same flow of watering crops and caring for animals.</p>
<p>Your son is older now and you can now give him gifts. He likes milk, ores, Jade Balls, or recipes. You have a little less options for influencing him now.</p>
<p>The dig site has expanded again. Dig for more items and the tablet.</p>
<p>Tartan is available in this chapter. Enter Takakura's house when he is home at night to get Tartan. Talk to Tartan often to get the Hybrid option. Then start creating hybrids and growing them.</p>
<p>You should also start buying Good Fodder to get S rank milk from your cows easier.</p>
<p>You should buy the Food Processing Room in this chapter and get the Seed Maker. Use the Seed Maker so you don't always have to buy seeds from Vesta. Put half of the crops you grow into the Seed Maker to recieve the same amount of seeds and so you can keep some crops. Buy the bear from Van for your son. Also buy another hen and another cow. Keep two spaces in the barn open for your cows' offspring. Start trading your cows in for Star cows.</p>
<p>Use the field in between the Chicken Coop and the locked shed to plant your hybrid trees. Since you don't need your other trees so much anymore, if you want, cut some down and plant some other hybrid trees. Use the big field for crops and some more trees if you want.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter you will get another scene indicating which career your son is into.</p>
<p>Chapter 4- Follow the same flow for crops and animals.</p>
<p>Your son is now a teenager and you can't do much more for his career, but you still have time.</p>
<p>The dig site has expanded again. Dig for more items and the tablet. It is more worth you while to spend time digging in this and the following chapters, but you shouldn't need much more money.</p>
<p>Keep digging, fishing, and cooking. In this chapter start raising your hybrids to A and S ranks. And use the Seed Maker to make their seeds.</p>
<p>Buy the Vase from Van and build the Milking Room. Be careful of the Milking Room Glitch. If you save the game while a cow is inside it will be stuck there for a while. Buy two more hens for a full coop. Have all your cows be Star cows.</p>
<p>You will now get another scene about your son's career.</p>
<p>Chapter 5- Follow the same flow of gameplay you've been using.</p>
<p>Have a horse, a goat, a sheep, a bull, two cows, five hens, a rooster, and two ducks. Make sure all your cows are Stars.</p>
<p>The dig site has expanded again. Dig for more items and the tablet.</p>
<p>It might start to get a little boring and repetitive in this chapter, but keep raising S rank crops, digging, fishing, and cooking. This is also the last chapter that you have the oppurtunity to influence your son. If you do start to get bored then try playing the Milk Drinking game in the inn or the Triangle game at the tower.</p>
<p>This will be the last scene that states what your son's career will be.</p>
<p>Chapter 6- This is the last chapter and year of the game. Follow the same flow of the game you've been using.</p>
<p>Since this is your last chance make friends with any of the townsfolk you missed and get any items you forgot. Get the highest rank cows and milk and crops.</p>
<p>Fill the last two spaces in the barn with the last babies your cows can have.</p>
<p>On the very last day, Winter 10, talk to your frinds one last time, say goodbye to your animals, put all your items in the tool shed, put all your food in the refridgerator and Food Storage, say goodbye to your wife and son, and watch the last scene of the game.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have completed the game. Now you should start a new game and marry a different girl and push your son to a different job.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Animals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Animals</span></h2>
<p>The animals in this game live on your farm. The livestock live in the barn. The fowl live in the coop. And the pets hang around the farm.</p>
<p><a name="Cows" id="Cows"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Cows">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cows</span></h3>
<p>Cows are pretty much the main money makers in the game. You can milk them twice a day and they will give you up to 4 bottles of milk each day. They only give milk for about 40 days. You will then have to get them pregnant to get more milk.</p>
<p>Cows need to eat twice a day. To get food for them get your sickle and cut grass in the field. If you move your animals out into the field they will eat the grass out there and you do not need to put food in their feed box. To get your cow to produce S rank milk buy Good Fodder from your ledger and feed them that in their feed box. Good Fodder just makes them happier though, they still need to eat regualr Fodder. If your cows get dirty, take them outside and push them over the that little water box. Then use your brush to wash them by pressing "Y".</p>
<p>Cows give milk for 40 days. To get them to give milk again you will need to get them pregnant. To do this buy a bull. When it matures go to your Ledger and order a miracle potion using the farm's bull. Using another farm's bull costs money. Sometimes your bull might get your cows pregnant by itself. After about 30 days your cow will give birth to a calf. For about 5 days your cow will produce Mother's Milk which you will have to feed to the calf. Eventually the calf will eat fodder which you will have to place in its bin. Now your cow will give milk again. After about 10 days after giving birth, you should get your cow pregnant. It will still produce milk and you don't have to go 30 days without milk.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of cows: Normal Cow- 4000G Brown Cow- 5000G Marble Cow- 5000G Star Cow- 7000G</p>
<p>To milk a cow get on the side of it and press "A" when the little sign says "milk". You have a milker to milk your cows, but you do not need to use it.</p>
<p>Each of their milk is of different quality with different prices.</p>
<p>Normal Milk B- 75G Normal Milk A- 115G Normal Milk S- 150G</p>
<p>Brown Milk B- 115G Brown Milk A- 175G Brown Milk S- 225G</p>
<p>Marble Milk B- 115G Marble Milk A- 175G Marble Milk S- 225G</p>
<p>Star Milk B- 270G Star Milk A- 405G Star Milk S- 540G</p>
<p>If you have the Food Processing Room you can make butter and cheese.</p>
<p>Regular Butter- 225G Good Butter- 300G Regular Cheese- 225G Good Cheese- 300G</p>
<p>You shouldn't leave your cows out in the rain or any of your animals because they might get sick. They also get sick if you don't feed them. If they are sick buy medicine from your Ledger. Have some on hand just in case. When they are sick give them the medicine to cure them. If they are not cured try again the next day.</p>
<p>If you have the Milking Room, never save the game when your cow is inside. Otherwise it will get stuck for a while. It might be released if you get it pregnant, it is about to have a baby, or eventually it will come out, but it will probably be sick. Unless it is pregnant. I don't think pregnant cows can get sick.</p>
<p>Breeding- There are a few things to know about breeding your cattle. First off it will be random whether or not it will be a cow or a bull. Now, what depends on what type of cow will be born depends on its parents. If you breed a Normal cow with a Normal bull then you will get a Normal Calf. If you breed a Brown cow with a Normal bull then it will also be random as to what type you get afterwards, but it is more common to get the lower rank. When ordering a Miracle Potion, the Other Farm's Bull will be a Normal bull.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Bulls">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bulls</span></h3>
<p>The bull's only purpose is to get your cows pregnant. You should have only one bull for that's all you need. The bulls also need to eat twice a day and they do not produce milk. Leave them outside and they will eat themselves. When you buy a bull it will take about 30 days for it to mature into an adult to impregnate your cows. If your bulls get dirty take them outside and push them over to that little water box. Then use your brush to wash them by pressing "Y".</p>
<p>There are 4 types of bulls: Normal Bull- 3000G Brown Bull- 4000G Marble Bull- 4000G Star Bull- 6000G</p>
<p>Don't leave your bulls outside in the rain.</p>

<p>Sheep aren't that lucrative and don't require much care. They eat once a day. Leave them outside and they will feed themselves. They produce wool. They produce wool once every season (10 days). To shear them you will need the clippers. Buy them from the Ledger or use the ones from Wally. Sheep cost 1500G. If your sheep get dirty take them outside and push them over to that little water box. Then use your brush to wash them by pressing "Y".</p>
<p>You can't ship your wool so you will have to sell it to Van or one of the townspeople.</p>
<p>Wool:</p>
<p>Normal Wool- 75G Golden Wool- 600G</p>
<p>Don't leave your sheep out in the rain.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Chickens">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chickens</span></h3>
<p>Chickens do not live in the barn. They live in the Chicken Coop. There are male and female chickens (roosters, hens). The females lay eggs without the rooster, but you need a rooster for them to lay Fertilized Eggs. Male and female chickens cost 900G. They eat bird feed which you will have to buy from the Ledger. If you leave them outside they will eat the grass. You can hatch your own chickens by putting a fertilized egg in the incubator. Don't show your chickens or anything to your chickens. They don't like that.</p>
<p>Eggs:</p>
<p>Egg- 40G Fertilized Egg- 50G Golden Egg- 300G</p>
<p>Take the chickens inside when it rains otherwise they might get sick.</p>
<p><a name="Ducks" id="Ducks"></a></p>

<p>You will only get ducks if you built a pond in the first chapter or beginning of the second. Wake up after your wife and you will get a scene where ducks come to your pond and your wife asks to keep them. You cannot buy ducks so do not sell either of these ducks if you want more. The ducks won't lay eggs, but if you have ducks sometimes a duck will hatch from a fertilized egg. Just think of it like ducks lay eggs, but make the chickens sit on them. Ducks also need to eat bird feed and will eat grass if you leave them outside. They will also sometimes sit in the pond. Ducks can be sold for 500G. Don't show your ducks or anything to your ducks. They don't like that.</p>
<p>Take the ducks inside when it rains otherwise they might get sick.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Goat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Goat</span></h3>
<p>Now the goat is only available from Van beginning in the second chapter and only available in Spring. The goat costs 4000G. It comes with a goat milker, but again you do not need to use it. Just use your hands if you want. You can only get a female goat and the goat gives milk only for 40 days like the cows, but unlike the cows the goat cannot get pregnant to give more milk. You cannot sell the goat either. The only way to get rid of it is to let it die. Leave it out in the rain, don't feed it, or don't give it medicine. You might as well keep it though, you'll eventually have all the money you need. The goat eats once a day and can be milked only once a day. Leave it outside and it will feed itself. You can only buy one goat. If your goat gets dirty take it outside and push it over to that little water box. Then use your brush to wash it by pressing "Y".</p>
<p>Goat Milk:</p>
<p>Goat Milk- 115G Good Goat Milk- 300G</p>
<p>If you have the Food Processing Room you can make goat cheese and butter.</p>
<p>Goat Cheese- 155G Goat Butter- 150G</p>
<p>Don't leave your goat out in the rain.</p>
<p><a name="Horse" id="Horse"></a></p>

<p>The horse doesn't really require much care since I don't think it can die. It eats once a day and it will feed itself if outside. You can also feed it apples by holding an apple and showing it to it. You can ride your horse anywhere in town and call it by pressin "R" twice. In the Summer or Fall of the first year Takakura will return from Town and give you the horse. If your horse gets dirty take it outside and push it over to that little water box. Then use your brush to wash it by pressing "Y".</p>
<p><a name="Dog" id="Dog"></a></p>

<p>You get a dog at the very beginning. Choose either a pointy-eared or a floppy-eared dog. They don't require much care either. When you're on your farm call it by pressing "R" once. It has a food dish where you can feed it. If you feed it once a day it will prevent Murrey from stealing your food in the Food Storage, but only for that day.</p>
<p>I. Cat</p>
<p>If you are friends with Romana, in the Fall of Chapter 2, wake up at around 9 AM and Romana will visit your farm and present you with a black cat. It really doesn't do anything. You can feed it in the dog's dish, but it pretty much just hangs around.</p>
<p>J. Chihuahua</p>
<p>To get this dog you need to be friends with Carter and Flora. You also need to have dug up all 6 strange tablets in the dig site. One a chapter. This dog is the same as the cat. You can feed it, but it does nothing. You can see this dog at Carter's Dig every now and then. It just sits around. It's tiny.</p>
<p><a name="Crops" id="Crops"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: Crops">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Crops</span></h2>
<p>To grow crops you will need a hoe. Use the hoe to till a square on one of the fields. Then you can plant your crop. The big field in the back is the most fertile field. All crops can grow there, but if you use the other fields you might have to use fertilizer for a particular crop. You will have to water your crop. You should water it twice a day. Trees grow in any field without fertilizer or water. Watering trees makes them grow faster and fertilizer increases their fruit's rank.</p>
<p>I will only place the first generation crops here. Not hybrids. Buy them at Vesta's Farm. This is how they will be laid out:</p>
<p>Crop- Seed Price Growing Season Class B Rank Selling Price A Rank Selling Price S Rank Selling Price</p>
<p>Tomato- 30G Spring-Fall Vine 35G</p>
<p>Watermelon- 60G Spring-Summer Vine 75G</p>
<p>Turnip- 20G Summer-Winter Root 25G</p>
<p>Melon- 50G Summer-Fall Vine 70G</p>
<p>Sweet Potato- 40G Fall Only Root 60G</p>
<p>Carrot- 30G Fall-Winter Root 45G</p>
<p>Potato- 40G Winter-Spring Root</p>
<p>Strawberry- 30G Fall-Spring Vine</p>
<p>Trees take about a year to grow and you do not need to water them. If you plant them adjacent to another tree or crop they will not grow. Trees stop growing in their harvest season and they grow for the rest of the year and in any soil. But they only have one harvest season. Plant them like this:</p>
<p>O-Tree X-Soil</p>
<p>XXXXXXX XOXOXOX XXXXXXX XOXOXOX XXXXXXX</p>
<p>Apple- 820G Fall</p>
<p>Orange- 820G Summer</p>
<p>Grapes- 900G Fall</p>
<p>Peach- 1120G Summer</p>
<p>Banana- 1500G Summer</p>
<p>Vesta's Farm only sells B rank seeds. To raise the rank. Place fertilizer on your crops every day. That should raise them to S rank. Then you should place them in the seed maker and you won't need fertilizer anymore. You still have to water them.</p>
<p>A good way to get S rank seeds without blowing all your money is to raise them to S rank and then place them in the Seed Maker. You will then get two new bags of S rank seeds. Keep this up to continue to get S rank seeds.</p>

<p>Carter's Dig is located up the path from Vesta's Farm. You can spend time here excavating. When Carter is in the dig site talk to him and he will give you a little shovel. You can dig in each of the tiled areas. You can dig after you dig once in an area. Sometimes you'll find something this way. The site expands every chapter giving more tiles and different items. Every chapter you can dig up a strange tablet. This is the only item you cannot keep. Carter will take this. There are six of these and after getting all six you can get a chihuahua. Sell any other items to Van or give them as gifts. At 5 PM you cannot dig anymore for that day.</p>
<p>I will list what items can be found at the dig site, what chapter you find them in, and the price you sell them for. Each item found in a previous chapter can be found in the following chapters.</p>

<p>Unlike previous Harvest Moon games, there are only three girls you can marry. Nami, Celia, and Muffy. You also have to get married in this one. If you don't the game will end after the first chapter. To win the hearts of these ladies you must give them gifts to raise their affection levels. Once their levels are up to 4 you can propose and they will say yes. View their heart levels in their diaries. The harvest sprites will give you the Blue Feather in the first year.</p>
<p>Nami- Nami is an intelligent, quiet wanderer. She will leave town if you do not marry her. She likes Statues and Fossils from the Dig Site and also Trick blue flowers. They are around only in Fall. She is the hardest of the 3 to marry. (Still easy though) Her diary is in her room at the inn. It's on the desk and get there early in the morning or late at night to view it.</p>
<p>To raise Nami's affection faster give her a recipe, something from the dig site, and a crop. She can accept these three gifts in one day.</p>
<p>Celia- Celia is a down to earth farm girl. Marlin won't like you if you marry her. She likes flowers and crops. She is the easiest to marry. Her diary is in her room at Vesta's Farm. It's on the bed, you won't be able to see it, but press "A" near the bed to view it.</p>
<p>To raise Celia's affection faster give her a flower, a milk, and a crop. She can accept these three gifts in one day.</p>
<p>Muffy- Muffy is a nice girl who wants a man to start a family. She likes flowers and coins. She's in between to marry. Her diary is hidden in the colorful lamp at the Blue Bar.</p>
<p>To raise Muffy's affection faster give her a flower, a milk, and a crop. She can accept these three gifts in one day.</p>

<p>In this game you have the ability of raising your child from a baby to an adult. When he gets older he will choose a career. This section explains on how to influence him to a certain career.</p>
<p>Your son has 6 career options. Farmer Rancher Athlete Musician Artist Scholar</p>
<p>Your son will be different depending on who you marry. They will have different strengths and interests which lead to their careers. Strengths are what they are good at and interests are what they like. Keep in mind, you will only alter their interests. Their strengths stay the same.</p>
<p>They will be based on a scale of 1-5, 1 being the lowest, and 5 being the highest.</p>
<p>Nami's Son's Strengths: Plants- 4 Animals- 4 Athletics- 1 Music- 4 Art- 5 Study- 5</p>
<p>Celia's Son's Strengths: Plants- 5 Animals- 5 Athletics- 2 Music- 2 Art- 4 Study- 2</p>
<p>Muffy's Son's Strengths: Plants- 1 Animals- 2 Athletics- 5 Music- 5 Art- 2 Study- 1</p>
<p>Nami's Son's Interests: Plants- 4 Animals- 1 Athletics- 1 Music- 1 Art- 5 Study- 1</p>
<p>Celia's Son's Interests: Plants- 5 Animals- 4 Athletics- 2 Music- 2 Art- 2 Study- 1</p>
<p>Muffy's Son's Interests: Plants- 1 Animals- 5 Athletics- 5 Music- 4 Art- 1 Study- 1</p>
<p>Now here I will say how to influence your son to a certain career.</p>
<p>Farmer- Give your son seeds, crops and flowers Befriend Vesta Take him to Vesta's farm as a baby</p>
<p>Rancher- Show him animals Have one of every animal Show him milk and eggs Keep him on the farm Milk cows by hand Keep animals outside</p>

<p>Artist- Befriend Cody Take him to Cody's Studio Leave only the Scratch Pad in the toy box</p>
<p>Scholar- Befriend Carter and Daryl Take him to Daryl's Lab Show him stuff from the dig site Keep the toy car in the toy box Use the milker to milk your cows</p>
<p>When talking to your son conversation choices may also influence him to a certain career. Also, when you take him somewhere, he will run away, but that's fine, just take him there.</p>
<p>At the ends of Chapters 2,3,4, and 5 you will get a scene about what your son is currently into. Here will be which ones are which.</p>
<p>Chapter 2-</p>
<p>Artist- Your son will be drawing and your wife will notice his talent and ask you what you think.</p>

<p>Chapter 5-</p>
<p>Farmer- Your wife will tell your son why you came to the farm. He will then declare that he wants to be a farmer like you.</p>
<p>Your son will fall in love too. Celia and Muffy's child likes Kate and Nami's son likes Lumina.</p>

<p>When you set up shop the villagers who pass by might stop at your shop. Talk to them and they will ask for something. They ask for things they like. You have three options. You can keep the price, lower the price, or refuse to sell.

<p>Hybrids are crops that are made by fusing two other crops.</p>
<p>In order to make hybrid crops you need Tartan. Tartan is a two headed plant that lives with Takakura. To get him be friends with Takakura and on Chapter 3 enter his house when he is home at night. This triggers a scene with Tartan. In order to get the option to hybrid you will have to talk to Tartan frequently and eventually that option appears when he asks what you want. To make a hybrid, show Tartan two different seeds. There are three flowers that boost seeds effects. I'll start with them.</p>
<p>Gemsoil+Seed=Allows crop to grow in any soil. Happy Lamp+Seed=Allows crop to grow in any season. Upseed+Seed=Boosts seed's rank</p>
<p>Find Gemsoils in the Fall Find Happy Lamps in the Summer Find Upseeds in the Winter</p>
<p>Now I'll start with how to get the 2nd Generation Crops. Also note that Tartan doesn't get it right all the time so keep trying. All hybrids grow in fertile soil. And make sure you enter the seed in the order I have written.</p>

<p>A good way to get S rank seeds without blowing all your money is to raise them to S rank and then place them in the Seed Maker. You will then get two new bags of S rank seeds. Keep this up to continue to get S rank seeds.</p>

<p>Here I will list various ways to make money fast. You might not want to use these often because then you'll have so much money and that might take away from the fun of making money by farming or raising animals.</p>
<p>When your tree's fruit is ripe, put the fruit into the seed maker and sell the seeds to Van. Tree seeds are worth a lot.</p>
<p>Go into your kitchen, and use Ruby Spice as the only ingredient. This makes another Ruby Spice and you keep the previous one. Sell them to Van, but make sure you keep one.</p>
<p>This isn't really a different way to make money, but it is a way to utilize the above method to get all farm buildings. Once you get the Ruby Spice use the method to get many, up to 99. If Van is not around store them in your shed, food storage, or fridge. Then sell them when he comes back to get a ton of money. Build the farm buildings. Doing this everyday should allow you to get all the buildings by the first chapter.</p>
<p>Cut down grass to make fodder. Go into the barn and take fodder out and put it into your rucksack. Sell the fodder to Van. Each fodder is worth 10G. 99 pieces are worth 990G.</p>
<p>When you catch any fish that is worth less than 150G, cook it into Sashimi and sell that for 150G.</p>
<p>Raise any crop to S rank. Place that crop in the Seed Maker for two new bags of S rank seeds. You can then sell the S rank crops while continuing to grow them. This works with all crops, but you get a bigger profit from S ranks.</p>

<p>In this section I will list all the information that don't really fit into their own sections.</p>
<p>A. Eating B. Weather C. Dreams D. Feeding Pets E. Locked Shed F. Decor</p>
<p>A. Eating Your character must eat in this game. If you don't you could pass out. You will know he is hungry when he grabs his stomach which makes a rumbling noise and the word "Guu~" appears above his head. Now it's time to feed him. If you are in the dig site you cannot eat, but you should be fine until you leave. You have three options for food. Weeds/Mushrooms- These can be found throughout the town in different seasons. They're the least filling. Crops- The fruits and vegetables you grow on your farm. They're secondary filling. Recipes- The dishes you cook in your kitchen. They're the most filling.</p>
<p>Eating the mushrooms outside the tree by the Spring takes you inside the Harvest Sprites house. They always complain about hunger, but there is nothing you can do.</p>
<p>B. Weather There are four different types of weather. Sunny- Regular day and most common. Rainy- Rain showers down for a while. Waters your crops for you and may sicken your animals. Snowy- Snow falls down, only in Winter or end of Fall. May sicken your animals. Hurricane- Very heavy rain. May sicken your animals, waters your crops, and may destroy some crops.</p>
<p>C. Dreams The dreams are those little, wiggly pictures you see while you are sleeping. They represent how your character is doing. There are three. Good- Your character will have a happy face, be surrounded by food, with a yellow backround. This means you are doing well. You are well fed, with a high stamina and fatigue. Normal- Just a bunch of blue bubbles. The default dream. Always have this dream at beginnings of chapters. You just have a normal stamina and fatigue. Bad- Your character is in the backround with blue bubbles. This means you have low stamina and fatigue and you are hungry.</p>
<p>E. Locked Shed The shed next to your big, fertile field doesn't open and won't open. It was originally supposed to be a stable for your horse, but Natsume didn't keep that idea and never removed the shed. The sheds by Romana's Villa and The Twins' Tower don't open either.</p>
<p>D. Feeding Pets Next to your dog's house is a little dish. Put food in this to feed your pets. You can put any food in it and you will be feeding the dog, cat, and chihuahua. They all have to have their own separate food though. Feeding your dog everyday will prevent Murrey from stealing food from your Food Storage.</p>
<p>F. Decor- Your house will get decorations. This is a list of all of the items you could get in your house.</p>
<p>Alarm Clock, Bear, Son's Bed, Your Bed, Blue Rug, Blue Mats, Blue Tablecloth, Help Bookshelf, Son's Bookshelf, Son's Box, Calender, Cody's Art, Diary, Dinnerware Shelf, Son's Dresser, Your Dresser, Kitchen, Refridgerator, Son's Rug, Your Rug, Kitchen Table, Son's Table, Toy Box, Ball, Blocks, Toy Car, Scratch Pad, Kitchen Trash Can, Living Room Trash Can, Son's Trash Can, Television, Vase,</p>
<p>This is all the stuff that might be in your son's room due to what his career might be or his friends.</p>
<p>Art Boards-Artist, Fireworks Ball-Friends with Twins, Painting-Artist, Plant-Farmer, Weights-Athlete,</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBird-Phobia_HM_Guide_c946.html" title="Edit section: FAQ">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">FAQ</span></h2>
<p>This is a list of many questions that are frequently asked about the game. They can all be answered in other parts of the guide, but the most common questions are here.</p>
<p>Q. Why won't my cow give me any milk? A. Cows give milk for only about 40 days. They will have to have a baby to start producing milk again. For the first few days after birth your cow will produce mother's milk which should be fed to the baby.</p>
<p>Q. How long before my cow can get pregnant/How long until my bull matures? A. When you purchase cattle or after they have been born they must mature before they are able to impregnate or produce milk. This takes about a year.</p>
<p>Q. What is the green heart when I try to milk my bull? A. The green heart means he likes it.</p>
<p>Q. Where'd my calf go? It's not in the hatch. A. Yes, it is. From time to time your calf might not be visible in the hatch. Chang views, wait a minute, or come back later and it will be back.</p>
<p>Q. How do I buy the ducks? A. You don't buy them. If you built a pond in Chapter 1 they'll show up in the Summer of Chapter 2 if you wake up after your wife. Keep in mind, if you sell any of these first two ducks you won't get anymore.</p>
<p>Q. Why don't my ducks lay eggs? A. Ducks do not sit on their eggs. Sometimes a fertilized egg might hatch into a duck though. So this draws the conclusion that ducks lay their eggs and the chickens sit on them. Just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Q. How do I get rid of my goat? A. Your goat will stop giving milk eventually and it cannot start again and you cannot sell it. So the only way to relieve yourself of the goat is to let it die. A way you can do this is keep all your animals in the barn except the goat and it might get sick from rain or a hurricane. Or leave it in the barn with no food. However, you really shouldn't kill the goat. It's just one space in the barn and you really don't need that many cows or sheep.</p>
<p>Q. Is there a watering can that waters multiple crops? A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Why haven't I gotten married yet? I gave her the Blue Feather. A. No matter when you give her the feather you will get married at the ened of the year. And no there is no cute little wedding scene.</p>
<p>Q. Can I marry Flora? A. No.</p>
<p>Q. How about Lumina? A. No.</p>
<p>Q. How can I get into Nami's room? A. You can either follow her around late at night until she goes to her room or wait for her to wake up in the morning. She'll hang out in her room for a while before she leaves or goes to sleep.</p>
<p>Q. Where can I safely store my food? A. Well, your wife and kid sometimes eat the food in the refridgerator and Murrey will occaisonally steal food from your Food Storage. But the Food Storage is safer. If you catch Murrey tell him he can't have the food and he might not show up again for a while or feed your dog everyday to scare him away. However, the safest place is still in your rucksack.</p>
<p>Q. Do the Harvest Sprites/wife/son help out on the farm? A. No, you'll have to do everything yourself.</p>
<p>Q. How do I carry my son? A. When your son has not asked to be carried or has his arms up, press "Y" next to him to pick him up and carry him.</p>
<p>Q. How can I get more recipes? A. Cook any food for 25-30 times to unlock Desserts and Hors D'Oeuvres. Then 10 more times to unlock Entrees.</p>
<p>Q. Why won't my son stay put? A. When you take him somewhere, he'll leave and start walking home. But if you take him somewhere to influence him in his career, you just need to bring him there and you can let him leave.</p>
<p>Q. That creepy bear is alive. What is up with that? A. There is a scene where the bear you buy from Van is walking around in your son's room. That's it, don't worry about him.</p>
<p>Q. How do I open up my own shop? A. Go next to the tree at the bar, and press "A" when you have the option to set up your shop.</p>
<p>Q. What is that shed for? A. The shed by your fertile field does nothing. It was originally supposed to be a stable for your horse, but Natsume didn't proceed with that idea and left it there.</p>
<p>Q. Does Murrey leave? A. No, so don't even bother giving him money unless you are feeling charitable.</p>
<p>Q. What does MukuMuku do? A. Aside from some scenes with Daryl and mention of him from a few villagers, nothing.</p>
<p>Q. Is there a Harvest Goddess in this game? A. No, but there is a scene where the sprites speak of wonderful things to get a goddess, but no. There is a goddess in the next town over.</p>
<p>Q. Is there a free-play mode? A. Other than starting over, no.</p>
<p>Q. Is this game like/better than Animal Crossing? A. Yes, this game has similarities between Animal Crossing, like you go fishing, make friends, raise a town and house in AC, and a farm in HM. I personally think AC is better, but it all depends on what you like.</p>
<p>Q. What is this next Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life about? A. In December, supposedly, a Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life for Girls will be released. It is basically the same thing except you are a girl instead of a boy and I assume you will also have a daughter instead of a son.</p>
