<dd>There's a million and one places, but 'quiet' and (obviously) near the train station makes me think of Raphael's, by the Central Library. It's also quite light and airy, which is good as the chances of nutters at meetups are quite high, so it'd be easy to get away. There's a Wetherspoon's opposite (slightly cheaper drinks), but Raphael's is always quiet (thanks to that very same Wetherspoons), and they don't play music. Plus there's a really fit barmaid, and a McDonald's nearby. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 11:58, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Back to population&#160;:-) I'm a little confused - are the metropolitan area of Birmingham and the West Midlands conurbation different delineations? It certainly seems so from the two different population figures quoted in this article's opening paragraphs. <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9090&amp;More=Y" class="external text" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9090&amp;More=Y" rel="nofollow">New 2004 estimates</a> have been released and I don't know which figure(s) to change. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECormaggio_adcc.html" title="User:Cormaggio">Cormaggio</a> <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECormaggio_9609.html" title="User talk:Cormaggio"><sup><small>@</small></sup></a> 17:39, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes - Coventry is part of the West Midlands but can't be considered part of the Birmingham conurbation - drive along the M6 and you'll see why!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 21:47, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Just to clarify Matthew's comments. Coventry is part of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28county%29_3cb5.html" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands (county)</a>, but is physically separate from the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_conurbation_887c.html" title="West Midlands conurbation">West Midlands conurbation</a>. This includes pretty much the whole of the metropolitan boroughs of Birmingham, Sandwell, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, the urban half of the metropolitan borough of Solihull (which has most of its population), plus parts of the neighbouring boroughs of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Warwickshire_cf5f.html" title="North Warwickshire">North Warwickshire</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleshill.html" title="Coleshill">Coleshill</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_Orton_341d.html" title="Water Orton">Water Orton</a>) and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromsgrove.html" title="Bromsgrove">Bromsgrove</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/g/Hagley.html" title="Hagley">Hagley</a>). This is as per the source I quote below, although how you define an urban area is open to some debate and I'd suggest many would consider the area around <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannock.html" title="Cannock">Cannock</a> to be as good as part of the same conurbation. The figure quoted in the article for the conurbation is from the article <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_urban_areas_of_the_European_Union_be66.html" title="Largest urban areas of the European Union">Largest urban areas of the European Union</a> which quotes National Statistics figures <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&amp;More=Y" class="external text" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&amp;More=Y" rel="nofollow">here</a> as a source. (Interestingly enough the figure in the article is 2,275,000 in 2005, the source quotes a figure for 2001 of 2,284,093. I'm unsure where the 2005 figure comes from. The article also quotes a Europe-wide source at the University of Avignon but this source shows the page for the UK as a work in progress and gives no data). The figures you have new estimates for are those for the county so you should change the second figure in the article. IMO, there is actually no good reason to quote the population figures for the <b>county</b> in an article on Birmingham, whereas those for the urban area have some relevancy. I would remove the county figures but someone would only put them back again and there are more useful ways to spend my time... <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 18:58, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This seems to be where this was taken from originally - <a href="http://www.locatebirmingham.com/sectors/professional_and_financial/legal_sector" class="external text" title="http://www.locatebirmingham.com/sectors/professional_and_financial/legal_sector" rel="nofollow">Locate Birmingham</a> which includes the very words. I'm not sure this is a wholly unbiased source however. A linked page on the <a href="http://www.locatebirmingham.com/sectors/professional_and_financial/" class="external text" title="http://www.locatebirmingham.com/sectors/professional_and_financial/" rel="nofollow">same site</a> states that over 100,000 people work in the financial services industry in B'ham and this fact is sourced back to an (apparently) independent report. <a href="http://www.invest.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/Uploads/InfoSheets/finance.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.invest.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/Uploads/InfoSheets/finance.pdf" rel="nofollow">This government site</a> clearly states Birmingham is <b>Britain's</b> second largest centre for financial services (and as London is Europe's largest then I guess the claim is not yet disproved). The UK is apparently the largest insurance market in Europe, so again the claim is not disproved. It depends, partly, on what they mean by Birmingham, what they mean by Europe, and what they mean by insurance market&#160;:) <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 19:55, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>He's quite happy to buy into all of that, other than that Birmingham is Europe's second-largest insurance market - especially given London's prominence in such matters.

<dd>I would guess it is biased rubbish, like much of this article. London is the biggest, probably followed by Zurich and then Frankfurt. Silly really having it on this page. I doubt from my knowledge of the business life of Birmingham if it is even second in the UK in this sector; Edinburgh and Manchester both have much bigger financial sectors than Birmingham and this will be reflected in insurance. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 11:55, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a point of interest, please can you elaborate on the size Manchester's financial services sector? I ask because I don't really have a clue what's there! That Edinburgh's is sizeable is pretty obvious because of the banks and insurance companies headquartered there, but I can't think of anything equivalent that would swell Manchester's financial services sector, and given my anecdotal knowledge that Manchester's would be larger than Birmingham's is a bit of a surprise. I work for one of the Big 4 accountancy firms, for instance, and our Birmingham presence is notably bigger than our Manchester presence. From having spoken with other accountants in and outside the area I'm fairly certain the same applies for the other three Big 4 firms. Plus there are quite a few offshoots from London banks, brokers, insurers, and so on in Birmingham too - so while there aren't any major headquarters, the financial sector's still a major part of the city's economy. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 18:46, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the revision works just fine - just because there are no headquarters doesn't mean that there aren't any insurers present. As an easy-to-find example, there's a large Direct Line office beside Snow Hill Station, and there must surely be plenty of companies that aren't household names!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 18:46, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose that it partly depends on what we're discussing; the Big 4 are different beasts to insurance and if it's true that Birmingham is a particular centre of accounting firms, then let's put that in? Also I have long heard that it is the second city for property firms outside London, and I will look for evidence on this point. However, the particular point I was correcting was the "second in Europe" assertion, which was clearly nonsense. On the Direct Line point, a quick check on their corporate website <a href="http://www.directline.com/about_us/contact.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.directline.com/about_us/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a> shows none of their main addresses in Birmingham; they have lots of ordinary business offices though in all the major cities, but I believe the one you are thinking about is a call centre; call centres whilst offering valuable low-paid employment are not what I think many people would consider evidence of a leading role in the market. Most I think would look at things like HQ locations, aggregations of big name company offices, etc. Note that Direct Line's national HQ is in Croydon and it's main subsidiaries are HQ'ed in Glasgow. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 19:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Second city</span></h2>
<p>I've updated this sentence to remove the undue prominence given to Manchester in what is an article about Birmingham. Note that I say the prominence is undue not because I am partisan but because it is given in the opening sentences of the article - this is an article about Birmingham, not about which city is the UK's second city. Let that battle be fought out by those who care particularly on the page that I have linked through to, and I suggest we aim to keep this article free of that particular squabble. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 17:15, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I notice this has come up again - and it will keep coming up until the reference is removed.</dd>
<dd>Firstly, I do not support the use of the word <i>generally</i>, as that implies that the majority of people think this way. Unless you have a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that, it should be taken out. At least the word "some" shows the uncertainty in the labelling.</dd>
<dd>However, I would advocate removing the claim entirely from the first paragraph of both articles. The introduction to an encyclopaedic article is not the place for unofficial titles and unverifiable information. Stick to facts such as it being the largest of the core cities, and the reader's intelligence fills in the blanks that Birmingham is indeed very important. You can't talk about something as ill-defined as a second city without using <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a>, or the entire long, sourced discussion over at the second city article; let's at least keep the weasel out of the introduction. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquilina_e23d.html" title="User:Aquilina">Aquilina</a> 11:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See comments above re. verifiable sources. Given that there is the general regard shown by the above sources, I think that the second-city description should remain. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 11:21, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel that this section is too listed. Could this be editted into paragraphs and possibly sub-headings such as retail, historical, cultural and miscelaneous etc? Other city articles are also doing the same to their sections which have lists in them by breaking them into paragraphs. The list we have is extensive and takes up a lot of room.</p>
<p>Also, I feel we could begin a section on the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Coat_of_Arms_7d34.html" title="Birmingham Coat of Arms">Birmingham Coat of Arms</a> as there is significant information on it in the article for a summarised section to be added possibly in the politics heading.</p>
<p>The same applies to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Birmingham_a2da.html" title="Religion in Birmingham">Religion in Birmingham</a> which would make a sizable and detailed section on the Birmingham page.</p>
<p>Expansion to the Geography section is greatly needed with references as well of course. This will also mean extensive information on the River Rea and its threats to flood in the Digbeth/ Deritend which has affected planning applications for developments such as Digbeth Coach Station. Information on other tornadoes including the 1930s tornado as well as some more information of the last two tornadoes, with the first being the most damaging. Images of the impact and images of other areas of geographical importance would also be greatly appreciated and enhance this section further. Also information on park areas around the city as well as the green belt by the River Cole could help this section alot. Overall, this section needs a lot of expansion work and maybe this article could become a featured article. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 14:50, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism warning on second city status</span></h2>
<p>I think the vandalism warning and threats of auto-reverts should be removed on the "second city" statement. There is evidence both for Manchester and Birmingham being Britain's second cities, including conurbation populations, administrative district populations, urban area definition census data and in addition, other common datums of "city status" such as numbers of corporate headquarters, key transport connections to the capital, media outlets, etc. On many of these definitions, Manchester is significantly ahead of Birmingham. I think this is one of those "local pride" things that people in Birmingham (but increasingly not Birmingham City Council who no longer use the term) have clung to against the evidence; nationally, to institutions like the civil service, the BBC, newspapers, main media organisations, planners, etc, there seems little doubt that Manchester is regarded as the second ranking city in the UK after London, with Edinburgh or Glasgow third. I speak by the way as a citizen of neither Manchester or Birmingham! I do think it's time to overcome this prejudicial statement and alter the text. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 20:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See previous discussions above including, for instance, the general perception in the national media - I'd be vary wary of opening this can of worms again as the matter seems to have been stationary on the Birmingham and Manchester pages on Wikipedia for a good while now, and even the Second City of the UK has been stable without petty advocacy wars going back and forth! Additionally, speaking also as a citizen of neither Manchester nor Birmingham, nor as someone born in either, I think you're very much underestimating Birmingham in comparison with the other cities you mention, perhaps arising through being selective with the criteria by which you're making your measurement. There are no official standards for what a second city is but the non-Mancunian indicators of opinion seem to be that it's typically seen as being Birmingham. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 21:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Typical of Wikipedia; don't worry about the facts, it's the war we want to avoid! Anyway, there is no such consensus amongst non-Mancunian opinion; if this is so for example, why did the BBC not hesitate for one moment when considering relocation of major staff elements from London that these would logically be deployed in Manchester? Manchester is widely regarded in government as being the second centre. Also note that Birmingham used, for example, to have key financial institutions outside London like a branch of the Bank of England; the latter can now only be found outside London in Manchester, Edinburgh, Leeds and Glasgow. The prosecution rests your honour. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 21:48, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your points:
<ul>
<li>I think we have the facts covered by the way that the articles currently read, and I also think we have them written in a relatively non-contentious manner, as borne out by the stability of the relevant sections of all articles concerned.</li>
<li>I don't understand why you think that the BBC chose to locate Radio 5 et al in Manchester because of some kind of 'prestige factor'. Large organisations such as the BBC just don't make snap decisions (where they 'don't hesitate') as to where to locate, and I'm highly sceptical that a place's perceived prestige would come into the consideration at all. Rather, they make considered decisions involving relevant factors, and in the BBC's case I would expect these to include cost, perception to be representing the whole of the UK rather than just the South East (there's already a decent BBC presence in Birmingham with, for instance, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archers_9d85.html" title="The Archers">The Archers</a> being recorded at The Mailbox, with other TV and radio programmes also being based out of there), the extent of regional coverage (London can cover the southern half of the UK, which includes Birmingham, well enough; Manchester can cover the northern half better than Birmingham can), availability of staff, and suitable premises, given the timing of the move.</li>
<li>I also don't follow the claim about government.</li>
<li>Last, there's no key element of the Bank of England outside London. That there's a branch in a given city means little about a city's prestige - and there's certainly an agency in Birmingham because it's in the office I (nominally) work in (he says, writing from Chelmsford....&#160;;-)) - see <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/contact.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/contact.htm</a>&#160;! You seem to be defining your own arbitrary criteria of second city (second city = has recent BBC move from London and branch of the Bank of England?) and then applying them without giving much consideration to wider things. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 21:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Currently Wikipedia is misinforming the whole world about this important perception point on England and the UK. It is a matter of urgency that we alter the introductory text to make it plain that far from settled, there is considerable contention on this point, and many national and international authorities regard Manchester as Britain's second city. By the way, another indicator of importance; there is just one foreign consulate in Birmingham, that of India.

<dd>Having actually read the entire article, it seems implicit to me that the headline 'Britain's Second City Sandblasts Its Image' follows on from the opening paragraph, which reads 'GREATER Manchester has Britain's second-largest urban population'. This is incorrect - and there's a correction at the end of the article to say so. In this case, 'second city' seems to be being attributed by size alone, and that attribution is self-admittedly incorrect.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">User:G-Man</a> is right to say that your second link undermines your own point: <i>The Economist</i>, <i>The FT</i>, and Radio 4 all using it to refer to Birmingham, and moving through the pages you see more such references from other reputable sources, and you also see <i>The New York Times</i> using 'second city' in the sense noted above, which seems to have been through a mistake about the size of Greater Manchester. As I have said before on these pages, it's nigh-on impossible to find anything that links Manchester in this way other than the MORI survey that you mention below and coverage of it - I note that you state that there are 'many national and international authorities [that] regard Manchester as Britain's second city', but do not back this up with any evidence. Please also remember the old adage with sources - a bubble doesn't mean a boil. Just because somebody has written something somewhere does not prove a point - the source needs to be reputable, and even reputable sources can make mistakes. The BBC was yesterday referring to 'Turin Bombes'; presumably these exist in the same universe as the 'Turing Shroud'!</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure why you think there is just one consulate in Birmingham, because there are plenty: Swedish, Indian, Italian, Pakistani, Thai, and so on. Quite why they're needed when London's only a 90-minute train ride away is a question worth asking, but whatever source you're getting your information from, I'd change it! <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 21:22, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Google link as evidence was quite useful and as any statistician will tell you, you can lie with Statistics. You can say, "oh look, top link points to Manchester" or you can say "most of those links say Birmingham is the second city." Now, I think all of this is silly. On the front page we should change that to "The United Kingdom's second largest city." Then the Manchester page can keep the "Second City" comment which can be backed up with <i>Google rankings</i> that are subject to change all the time and google bombing. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrBobla_8849.html" title="User:MrBobla">MrBobla</a> 18:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in agreement with you and in disagreement with you. I agree that in themselves Google searches rarely prove anything much. However, they can be useful in determining the kinds of links returned and from this the quality of the sources - as I've discussed above. The population fact is uncontroversial and perhaps should be included, as other towns and cities include their place in the population pecking order. However, for reasons I've previously written here, I think that to remove the 'generally considered to be the UK's second city' wording from the Birmingham article is to misrepresent things. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 21:39, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but that's the whole point Matthew - generally considered by who? I have raised a number of evidential points that many important criteria and authorities do not generally consider it to be the second city, which you bat aside as irrelevant or whatever and yet which do undermine the claim here. My point is that it is now only "generally considered" the second city in one place - Birmingham! The rest of the country and the world thinks it's Manchester. Oh and one more set of criteria - second offices of national media outlets. How many national newspapers have a second office in Birmingham? Answer: zero. Manchester? 6. We could go on, but alas, the facts I think scarcely matter here... Birmingham is third or fourth in the UK, but to it's own people, it ranks second!

<dd>In the past, the title "second city" was given to the city with the largest population.

<dd>A mere repetition of the trite and simplistic comparison of local authority district populations which have no bearing on relative status; see endless discussions on other city pages about the false picture given by such simple data. Instead consider the more objective criteria of metropolitan county and urban area populations if you want to just go on population, most experts giving Greater Manchester more people than urban West Midlands on those more intelligent criteria.

<dd>We've been here before at least several times. There are a number of problems with mentioning of Manchester on the Birmingham page, including:
<ul>
<li>'general' appears to be the most reflective term of the facts as they exist in the world: see numerous discussions above regarding the use of 'second city'. It seems rather blinkered to suggest that this isn't the <i>current</i> general view;</li>
<li>this is a page about Birmingham, not about second-city status. 'Generally' makes obvious that this is not set in stone and the link to <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_city_of_the_United_Kingdom_6b33.html" title="Second city of the United Kingdom">Second city of the United Kingdom</a> allows people to find out more if it's important to them.</li>
<li>if there is a need to include Manchester on the Birmingham page then there is at least an equal need (and arguably a greater need, given Birmingham's <i>general</i> consideration as being the second city) to include Birmingham on Manchester's page. This leads to numerous unresolved partisan edit wars as both sides add and delete the other city from the two pages. The historical consensus on both pages has been to keep the wording as it was previously (Birmingham considered generally and Manchester considered by some) with a clear link to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_city_of_the_United_Kingdom_6b33.html" title="Second city of the United Kingdom">Second city of the United Kingdom</a> page. Up until now this seems to have kept both the Birmingham and Manchester pages free from back-and-forth edit wars as well as documenting the state of affairs. If the wording changes on either the Birmingham or the Manchester pages ... cue undesirable edit wars on both sides. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 11:45, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lots of POV here, so at least temporarily I have restored the mention of Manchester. The central problem is the "second city" label which should be removed as it is contested, biased and misinforming. Most authorities in the UK regard Manchester as second city. Therefore either the second city label should be modified or Manchester should be recognises. Since the claim is not mentioned on the Manchester page, there is no edit war to get into other than here on the Brum page which repeatedly gets misinformationalised by the pro-Brum crowd desperate to get their faded and fanstasy second city label back on the page.

For instance, mention of 'most authorities' without any reference to who these authorities are or any kind of hard, reliable evidence.

<dd>For all those interested, it has been demonstrated to Majabl many many times that there are numerous authorities both in the UK and internationally who consider Manchester to be the second city, and this is enough to give good grounds that this is a debated issue, which should be reflected in the article. This user persistently ignores this, instead vandalising the page with repeated POV lines that Birmingham is the second city and rejecting any and all attempts to discuss the matter sensibly.

<dd>That's rather a presumptious conclusion to arrive at - you haven't demonstrated any such thing, which is precisely why we're having this debate. What you have done is set your own arbitrary criteria (for example, number of foreign consulates), half-argued your point with some misleading statistics without reference to source (for example, that there is just one foreign consulate in Birmingham), and then deigned to respond to any counter-arguments. You quite clearly seem to be pushing your own POV with your fingers in your ears to anything to the contrary, and I strongly object to your accusation of vandalism. Please check Wikipedia's definition of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" rel="nofollow">Vandalism</a>] in future before meting out such a claim.</dd>

<p>People keep making this mistake, so it's worth pointing out (again) specifically and clearly. By size of population within formal city boundaries, Birmingham is indisputably not the second city - it is the first city.

<dd>This is getting very frustrating now! With regard to the first link, yes, a survey said that 34% of people noted Manchester to be the second city and Birmingham was in second place with 29%, so it's clear that Birmingham isn't the only contender for second city and that some think it to be Manchester. But this is one survey, commissioned by an interested party, and occurred immediately after the Commonwealth Games. It doesn't all of a sudden change the general perception! A couple of months ago <i>The Economist</i> used 'second city' to refer to Birmingham. Does this suddendly change the pendulum back the other way? No, it simply adds to a body of evidence.</dd>
<dd>With regard to the second link it points to a page that says '"44.6% of all statistics is bullshit"' - I don't follow your point. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 12:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Nobody is disputing that some don't see Manchester as being the UK's second city, nor that the view is unanimously for Birmingham; merely that the <i>general</i> view is towards Birmingham. Note also that he doesn't 'remember to mention mention poor lowly' (and I'm not sure what the use of this emotive language in your point is) Edinburgh, Leeds, Milan, Saint Petersbourg, Gothenburg, Malmö/Copenhagen, or various other successful cities, so by your logic these must all be backwaters too! <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 17:06, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LSE popn experts recent report shows that the widely disseminated view that West Midlands conurbation is larger by popn than Greater Manchester is wrong, and also getting more incorrect as time passes. In 2001, the widely published figure was West Midlands: 2.570m and Greater Manchester: 2.513m. But these assesments contain serious mistakes the report says. The West Midlands "contiguous urban area" should exclude Coventry and this gives a figure of 2.19m. Greater Manchester has now swallowed new surrounding towns and the contiguous urbanity has a popn of 3.12m. <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/PDF/census%20brief%201%20for%20web.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/PDF/census%20brief%201%20for%20web.pdf" rel="nofollow">LSE report on Britain's conurbations</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 12:32, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the 2001 Census, the West Midlands Urban Area had a population of 2,284,093; and the Greater Manchester Urban Area had 2,244,931. Coventry/Bedworth Urban Area counts separately at 336,452. The two main urban areas are within the error correction of one another, and depending on how the Urban Area is measured, Liverpool and Manchester can be seen part of the same urban area! However, what has this to do with an article on Birmingham? After all, Wolverhampton is a separate city, and the Black Country is very vocally separate too. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteven_J_53c4.html" title="User:Steven J">Steven J</a> 19:02, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This subject is too dull to spend too much time on, but the page on <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_Conurbation_44ca.html" title="West Midlands Conurbation">West Midlands Conurbation</a> defines the area in detail as per the ONS definition (the full stats for the whole of England can be seen <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&amp;More=Y" class="external text" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&amp;More=Y" rel="nofollow">here</a>) and as Steven J states it does not include Coventry. The LSE article that Mark Thomas links to itself makes the usual error of treating the county boundary as the conurbation boundary for both Greater Manchester &amp; the West Midlands (wrongly including Coventry in the West Midlands conurbation and Wigan in the G.Manchester conurbation) and says nothing whatsoever about G. Manchester swelling to 3.12m that I can find.</dd>
<dd>I notice, BTW, that Mark Thomas is not taking time to edit the Manchester page to include a reference to Birmingham which he would surely do if he were the even-handed party he makes himself out to be. As the whole two-bald-men-fighting-over-a-comb scenario is laid out in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_city_of_the_United_Kingdom_6b33.html" title="Second city of the United Kingdom">second city of the United Kingdom</a> article a link to this article is sufficient to satify the tiny number of international readers who may care to indulge themselves in this essentially meaningless local squabble.</dd>
<dd>I've previously suggested the wording of the sentence should be <i>Birmingham is often described as the second city</i> as this can be factually demonstrated by reference to the numerous descriptions of the city as the second city. IMO "generally considered" makes me immediately ask "by whom?". The word "generally" implies that someone somewhere has counted all the uses of the term "second city" in the UK and confirmed that most of these are to Birmingham. Of course, no-one has done this and I find the use of "generally" weaselly in that it implies a majority that cannot be accurately measured. "Often" implies no majority, merely regularity. I'm sure that even Mr Thomas can agree that B'ham is often called the second city even if he doesn't think that's true. Is Manchester often described as the second city? It is certainly <i>sometimes</i> described as the second city (though mainly by people from manchester as faras I can see - all the sources that get quoted refer back to one poll conducted effectively by Manchester itself, which is therefore to be taken with a huge pinch of salt). Debates about the size of the urban conurbation or the population of the city as per its boundaries are pretty sterile as "second city status" - whatever that means - is clearly not simply a matter of size. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 20:52, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Often' is moot - I am not sure that I would say 'second city' is used all that often as a descriptive phrase, though when as such it is generally used of Birmingham. Even if it is used often, I think implying no majority of uses of the phrase in reference to Birmingham is under-egging the pudding and in itself being weaselly! Though you don't explicitly say so, you seem to be thinking this too with your distinction between 'often' and 'sometimes', and your note of all sources quoted for Manchester coming either from a partisan source or being in reference to the MORI poll.</dd>
<dd>Of relevance is that I was a bit bored last night (stuck in a hotel room in Chelmsford!) so started pulling together a list of links cribbed from various media sources by searching for 'second city' on their search pages. It's perhaps worth noting that there were several from the Manchester <i>Guardian</i>, and none I could find there referred to Manchester! <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 22:59, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't believe that it is unprovable to state that B'ham is <i>often described</i> as the second city - though I conceded this is still a fairly poor phrase. I do think it is unprovable to say it is <i>generally considered</i>. The issue about the majority is that as no-one has counted the opinions of all people in the world or in the UK on this issue, it is wrong to use a term that implies there is a majority view on this subject as this is not empirically verifiable. Personally, I consider that B'ham is the second city - whatever that means - and I think that this is the consensus in the UK as a whole. However, as I can't empirically demonstrate this, then I support avoiding language that implies there is a consensus. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 14:11, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On reflection, I think there are two key problems. The first, as you say, is that it's not possible to conclusively prove a general consideration or feeling. Fraud is generally considered to be wrong, for instance, but is this scientifically provable? I would suggest no more than that it is conclusively provable that Birmingham is generally seen as the second city.</dd>
<dd>The second is that we are currently looking at things from the perspective that Birmingham is generally seen to be the UK's second city. Would we be better flipping this around and finding some way of writing that when 'second city' is used, especially by non-partisan sources, it is typically used of Birmingham? My only concern with this would be of being too emphatic about it or about not being emphatic enough.

<dd>First off, I am certainly no weasel so there! Anyway, down to business. I did used to edit Manchester in similar terms but all the Brummies went over to that page and got rid of it. The problem I would guess is that the Mancunian:Brummie ratio on WP of people interested in editing UK-related pages is about 1:5 whereas the actual importance ratio between the two places (I would hardly glorify Birmingham by calling it a place - more of a coagulated heap of dereliction) - is about 473:11.2 - the result - chaos! Nothing makes sense on this Wikipedia thingy. Anyway, I digress. Second City. What is that exactly? Is it the second biggest by super-metrically time adjusted micro-analysed super dataanalytically assured totally confidently decided on by mega-confident statisticians of supernaturally gifted pan-paranormal weightistically giftamundod megabrainy guys in shiny government towers! Nope. It's what <b>you think</b>. And what most of us think is, well, (and I include all the Brummies because they secretly think it, they're longing to think it, they wish Michael Stipe or Razorlight or ELO would come and tell them) - we think that it's Manchester. That's what the surveys say. That's what the government thinks. That's what foreigners think. That's what the motorway planners (who've bypassed Birmingham with their super M6 Toll Road think and that's what generations of superbly gifted but under-financed railway engineers think. And that, fellow Wikipedians, is what you really think too, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

<p>As the result of someone's recent edit, I notice that the primary units of distance in this article are kilometers, not miles. Is this normal for UK articles?

<dd>The Birmingham transport is basically a transport hub other than the 12 hour bus service. In the 2005 elections the political parties mentioned that they would construct an underground metro system (light rail system) with upto 12 different lines running through the West Midlands. However this has not been heard of since then. If built this would include over 300 stations all around the Midlands including Tamworth, Wolverhampton, Kidderminster, Solihull, Walsall, Sutton Coldfield, Redditch, Bickenhill, Cannock, Bromsgrove, Dudley, Wombourne, Halesowen, Sandwell, Stratford, Dorridge, Coleshill, Birmingham international airport and Drayton Manor theme park. 98% of these stations would need to be underground to decrease the traffic on roads. It would run 24 hours. This would have to reopen the Curzon street railway station which would make the Eastside a more frequently visited place and a hub for most of the trains coming in to Birmingham city centre along 30 other new stations that would have to be built in order for the transport system to be easy accessible in the city centre. The lowest station would have to be around 50 metres deep in to the city centre and allowing people with disabilities to go there without any help.</dd>

<p>As I have said earliar, I believe there are too many headings in the Culture and Atrs in Birmingham section and some sections need to be merged. This comes as I have recently read the guidelines for featured article status and one of these was that the table of contents must not be long. When comparing the table of contents to other articles, it is probably the largest I have seen. If this was cut down, and I already have commenced this with the transport section, then we could be well on our way to getting Birmingham featured article status.</p>
<p>I believe that two sections need to be created to merge the majority of the sections under Culture and Arts.</p>
<p>The Music section will merge together the Popular Music and Classical Music sections together. The Media section will merge Radio, Television, Newspapers and Film.</p>

<dd>I've just beaten you to it! I've changed the 'generally considered' to 'considered by some'. Opinion polls (especially those that don't detail their methodology, like this most recent one) are by no means definitive and 'a bubble doesn't mean a boil', but with this and the 2002 poll there's certainly good indication that the question of second city is becoming closer. I've implied earlier today on <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnited_Kingdom_651d.html" title="Talk:United Kingdom">Talk:United_Kingdom</a> that the people responsible for marketing Manchester and Manchester's council are doing a far better job at raising awareness of the place than their Birmingham equivalents, and in the eyes of the wider population at least this seems to be being listened to! That said, find me a reputable, non-partisan media source that uses 'second city' in a UK context to describe anywhere other than Birmingham. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 15:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think the way the second city status is decided is now completely different to how it was done back in the past. It used to be done officially but now it is all down to public decision. Back when Birmingham was 'officially' declared second city, it was all down to the population of the city. Now so many other factors are being introduced such as culture, arts, media, sport and even the buildings it has. I'm more aware of the buildings side of things as I regularly take part in such discussion on internet forums and the amount of times such an issue is raised, buildings are quick to be introduced. As a result, this poll proves nothing. There is only a gap of 8% between the two and if a wider poll was carried out, that could change. No government or council website can prove that either Manchester or Birmingham is the second city. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 15:16, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I totally agree that it would be impossible to definitively state that Manchester has usurped Birmingham's position, I just thought that it can no longer be "generally considered" to be the second city any more. I have to admit being biased towards Manchester, however, and this latest report did fill me with a little bit of glee! Besides which, if there is no longer (and I didn't know there ever was, excuse my ignorance) an "official" second city status, it is obviously extremely difficult to assign this title to any particular city, and define all of the criteria by which it is judged. --<a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_def4.html" title="User:El Pollo Diablo">El Pollo Diablo</a> (<a href="../../../e/l/_/User_talk%7EEl_Pollo_Diablo_1f7c.html" title="User talk:El Pollo Diablo">Talk</a>) 16:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This debate is getting tiresome. It should be, "is the second largest city in the UK."</p>

<dd>The article already says that, but also mentions that Birmingham is widely considered to be the second city. This should be acceptable by all, I'd have thought. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 16:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed about the "largest" being Birmingham (although it's very, very close on conurbia comparisons, so close that it is within error margins) but isn't that the problem though Matthew - that it isn't "widely considered" to be "second city" (whatever exactly second city means). I grew up in the North of England and I think everyone there just assumed Manchester was second city. I was very surprised that people in Birmingham thought differently. I worked a long time in local government in London, and pretty much everyone I discussed it with there thought it was Manchester - this view appears to be shared in central government. I personally believe that the "second city is Birmingham" view is mainly a West Mids phenomenon although granted that on population grounds it is (narrowly) true. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 17:25, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Heh - I can tell a similar story, but from the other side of the fence, having been born in the East Midlands and grown up in Tyne &amp; Wear and Northamptonshire, and being at university in Yorkshire; and at the same time seeing all media references to 'second city' being descriptions of Birmingham. So when there was the 2002 poll after the Commonwealth Games I was understandably taken aback by something I'd previously attributed to particularly parochial Mancunians. Naturally, the current government courts Manchester because it's a Labour heartland; Birmingham is much more politically diverse, especially at a local level. It will be very interesting to see what happens come a different ruling party (be that by general election or Scottish seccession - either way I expect the current government to be shafted)!&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 17:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting to hear about it from another perspective. Didn't it always used to be the case supposedly that the government focused politically on the West Midlands because it was a key battleground in the elections with many marginals? I believe this was stated on TV coverage of at least the last ten general elections and probably further back. I actually don't think it's anything to do with current governments - it's a long running cultural belief especially I think in London. When business people or government officials in London think where to have a "second office" Manchester usually is the first thought. I'm not saying they are right to think that way, just observing. Personally I have to say I think central Manchester is a bit of a dump compared to central Birmingham, but each have their good and bad points. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 17:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure, but there's certainly a body of feeling locally that the current government has something against Birmingham and the rest of the West Midlands county - a good example being the decision to locate the new Wembley in London rather than back Birmingham's bid, which seemed to have more popular support. (Personally I'd have thought somewhere just off the M1, slightly north of Northampton, would be a decent central location for the English national stadium. This is because the geographic centre of the UK's population is, I understand, somewhere around Stoke-on-Trent and gradually slipping south east - so shift it east and south a bit to account for the removal of the non-English countries.) <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 17:59, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such things like this are nothing new. Such claims were raised a long time ago and there is a sense that the government are favouring Manchester and the generally northwest area over the Midlands. There are so many points that could be made, even the BBC decision to move to Salford is believed to be a politically spurred move. Transport in Birmingham is the main problem. Birmingham has been shafted so many times. New Street Station is one example as the government have left it in the dark for years and now that people such as Richard Branson are calling for change, they are finally waking up - only problem is, they are only proposing a cosmetic change to the station (obviously to reduce costs). Next is the Midland Metro, Birmingham is being ignored over and over again by the government. Birmingham is probably the biggest city in Western Europe to not have a significant Metro system. I personally believe in this anti-Birmingham conspiracy. - <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErebus555_1839.html" title="User:Erebus555">Erebus555</a> 13:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One could consider the amusing <a href="http://www.londonleben.co.uk/northlondonersview.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.londonleben.co.uk/northlondonersview.pdf" rel="nofollow">mental map of a North Londoner</a> as an example of how different people visualise Britain. I don't think personally it's a clear-cut case of London favouring the North-West or some such. I do think there is a cultural bias against the West Midlands in Britain, along with other similar ones against for example the Welsh. It's partly denegration of the Brummie as having a poor accent, working-class and stupid. This was admirably well discussed on Radio WM recently by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Chinn_c47e.html" title="Carl Chinn">Carl Chinn</a> who probed the history of the accent and it's role in Britain. I believe he thinks the roots of this attitude go back to before the industrial revolution and include catholic/protestant bitterness and even inter-regional feuds from Anglo-Saxon times. So it's not something that will shift in a hurry! My general impression of the "London view" is that Birmingham (and the Midlands as a whole) is almost invisible. It's not that they are down on it, just unaware. They have heard of Manchester and Scotland. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 15:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Being ignored is as bad as being disfavoured, if not worse. With regard to the accent, it would help if when an accent was on television it wasn't some overblown stereotype, as Benny from Crossroads was, but was more like most people actually speak. Additionally, there's a study out there somewhere that indicates that there is some UK-based snobbery at play, because foreigners who aren't aware of the connotations tend to quite like the Birmingham accent. Anyway, from the above I surmise that Midlanders have either got to incessantly harp on about how fantastic the place is, so much so that everyone else starts to believe it, or threaten to declare independence!&#160;:-) I'm for the latter - it would be interesting to see how the north and south managed with a whole new country separating them by land.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 17:50, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There would have to be a connecting Euro-tunnel, "trans-Brummie-link" or some such. I presume the new country would be called Mercal or Brummo or something similar? Would it be a republic? If so, I propose Ed Doolan as first president. Never mind that he's Australian. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 18:03, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You might get UDI from Nottingham. Plus the tank barriers snaking across country would cause traffic problems on the A417. And god only know what would happen to Oxford. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 18:40, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
