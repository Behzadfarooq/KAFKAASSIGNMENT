<dd>That shouldn't apply to place names in Category titles. This isn't a matter of categorization in the title, its about narrowing the Category to apply to one single city. Remember, in the article namespace, we can use disambig pages. In Category, there is no equivalent. Category:Birmingham could apply to many other articles (see <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Birmingham (disambiguation)">Birmingham (disambiguation)</a> for a few). I think its perfectly reasonable to allow <a href="../../../b/i/r/Category%7EBirmingham%2C_England_dd12.html" title="Category:Birmingham, England">Category:Birmingham, England</a> to remain as is. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> 23:56, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Though I believe that the category deserves to stay named as it is, I do think that there are far too many articles associated with it. For city-name categories, I'd limit it to articles which are about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical locations within the city (buildings, parks, schools, roads, etc.)</li>
<li>Notable residents (born in, or significantly tied to the city)</li>
<li>Businesses headquartered in the city</li>
<li>Media (newspapers, radio stations, website portals, etc.)</li>
<li>Local government</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, read the city's article, and include <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanac.html" title="Almanac">almanac</a>-type information using reasonable judgement. Some items in this are currently over-categorized into it, such as <a href="../../../r/i/p/Rip_van_Winkle_b25e.html" title="Rip van Winkle">Rip van Winkle</a>. If people want to really see all articles linking to a city page, they can use "What links here" - the category doesn't need to have <i>everything</i>. I think this one can turn into a nice example of good categorization for cities, an perhaps should be documented in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> 00:13, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also agree. Would be nice to trim this back, and I think it needs it. Out of curiosity, what's the opinon of creating "Bands from Birmingham" or categories like that, in order to further seperate this category a bit.

<dd>There already is a Category:Residents of Birmingham, England, and I'd like to know what should belong in such categories. Everyone who ever lived in Birmingham for a while? If yes, persons who lived in 10 cities in their life can have 10 "residents of foo" categories in their article? That sounds like alot of categories, but at the moment I don't really know how that could be shortened. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 20:21, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

There is no over-categorization; there is no attempt to include in the category all articles linking to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> (to suggest otehrwise is at best a red herring). All the articles in this category are relevant to (and will be of interest to people studying) some aspect or other of the City of Birmingham. Why should someone who belongs in ten categories not have those ten categories shown at the foot of their article? If not that; then what are categories for? That said, I would have no objection to, say, a sub-category of "Music of Birmingham" or some such. Please explain why you think <a href="../../../r/i/p/Rip_van_Winkle_b25e.html" title="Rip van Winkle">Rip van Winkle</a> should not be in this category, making explicit references to the circumstances in which it was written. Please also state the optimum or maximum permissible number of articles for inclusion in this category (since some apparently believe it has "too many"; stating the logic which leads you to arrive at your figure. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 21:07, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

Maybe you could react to that first before we discuss another article?</dd>
<dd>"Too many" categories per article simply doesn't look very good and it makes things not very easy to overlook. That's not my main argument here tho, many articles don't belong in this category, whether these articles have many other categories or not. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 21:49, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say 10 categories are a bit too much, but it depends on how big the article is.

<dd>I've no problem with a lot of categories, as long as they are important. If they're just cruft, get rid of them. This reads more like a connections list. I'd say, for example, that since <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow_4da5.html" title="The Legend of Sleepy Hollow">The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</a> isn't set in Birmingham, it certainly shouldn't be listed merely because it was written there (or <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamgee_Tissue_ce08.html" title="Gamgee Tissue">Gamgee Tissue</a> just because it was invented there). Equally, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Archers_9d85.html" title="The Archers">The Archers</a> isn't about the culture of Birmingham, and it isn't significantly affected by the culture of Birmingham any more than any other British city. Places that are in Birmingham should of course be included, companies that are based in Birmingham perhaps should be included, bands should only be included if Birmingham was an essential part of their history (like Liverpool was to The Beatles). <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:25, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looking at this talk page, most of the people who raised their voice here think this category is overcategorized, and it was explained what should belong in this category and what shouldn't, so I'm going to remove some articles that to not belong to this article (bands, books, etc.) from this category. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 19:38, Aug 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>ContiE, I agree with you about this, and what few comments have been made to this page also seem to support the opinion that there are too many extraneous articles in this category. However, I think it will be difficult to gain any traction over someone determined to revert. I suspect that an RfC will be needed for each and every article that you want to extricate from that category. Once there is a clear majority in favor of removing from a specific article (as with LOTR), Andy will have a harder time continuing his reversion. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:26, 7 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that there are <i>extraneous</i> articles. It is important not to develop a "George Washington slept here" kind of mentality when categorizing. For example <a href="../../../r/i/p/Rip_Van_Winkle_d26f.html" title="Rip Van Winkle">Rip Van Winkle</a> should not be included here partly because the story isn't related to Birmingham and partly because the author's article is already in Category:Residents of Birmingham, England.</p>
<p>And although there isn't really such a thing as too many articles within a single category, if you find several articles (5 or 7 maybe) that could be grouped together, creating a subcategory would be a logical step. —<a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMoverton_f107.html" title="User:Moverton">Mike</a> 19:22, Aug 7, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Category:People of Birmingham, England - "Residents" implies on people that have homes there. This sub-cat should include all articles about <b>people</b> who originated from, or are strongly tied, to the city. (Think this way - each person article should have one <i>maybe</i> two such categories... is Birmingham one of those?)</li>
<li>Category:Places in Birmingham, England- "Places of interest" implies the places need to be interesting. This sub-cat should include all articles about <b>physical locations</b> within the city (buildings, streets, airports, etc.).</li>
<li>Category:Government of Birmingham, England- This sub-cat should include all articles about <b>governing bodies</b> within the city. It should also include any "government-devised" area divisions ("lines drawn on a map" such as districts, towns, etc.) within its confines.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Residents" was chosen deliberately, to provide an objective qualifying measure. There is a difference between "Places", which would include all the wards, districts, towns, villages and oethr centres of community, and "Places of interest" which are generally buildings, museums, art venues and other historical or tourist attractions. There are few "goveernemnt derived" divisions whcoh are not also "Places" as I have just described. Surely this debate should be generic, and not repeated for each town and city in the UK, or even World?? <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 23:26, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to say that this is certainly one of the most confusing category pages I've come across, and I'd like to see (or help with) further sub-categorisation (or complete removal from the category hierarchy) of the vast majority of the articles which are currently there. People coming to this category are surely most likely to be looking for info about things to do with Birmingham, rather than an exhaustive, and almost completely non-differentiated scatter-gun approach to everyone and anything that ever existed in, though of, or passed through the place. Furthermore, the main <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham%2C_England_2dda.html" title="Birmingham, England">Birmingham, England</a> article itself serves as an excellent point for linking to many of the things which would seem to be present here, in the category page. This seems much more sensible than including <i>everything</i> about Birmingham in a single one-level category. If there are enough things to make a sub-category, then why not make one?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As it stands, the list of <i>things</i> which is present in the main category is very hard to parse, as although they (supposedly) all have something to do with Birmingham, they have nothing in common except that. This makes it very difficult to pick out what things might actually relate to, so difficult to assign meaning to them. I'd like to see Birmingham looking more like the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Category%7ENew_York_3105.html" title="Category:New York">New York category page</a>, with many well-organised sub-categories. <a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmcm_a5d3.html" title="User:Pmcm">PMcM</a> 14:17, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>...or more comparably, the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Category%7ELondon_3b0b.html" title="Category:London">London category</a> even. Note how there the articles tend to be in the form 'X about London', 'Y of London', 'List of Z in London', rather than seemingly arbitrary names, places, entities, bands... There are no doubt many more articles in the tree stemming from the plain London category than there currently are in the Birmingham one, but because they are much better organised, it is trivial to find what you might be looking for.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, a lot of the things which are/were in the Birmingham category (<i>Rip van Winkle?!</i> A joke surely...) could/should be more easily, and appropriately found by anyone doing research on Birmingham via <i>What links here</i> from that page, rather than indiscriminate overpopulation of the category page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By all means have many things which are (pretty tenuously) related to Birmingham, but plonk them in more sensible sub-categories. The current very lazy approach is like having a Yellow pages with a single category called <i>"Businesses"</i>... <a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmcm_a5d3.html" title="User:Pmcm">PMcM</a> 23:45, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I definitely agree with you (PMcM).

Still, besides many comments like yours, nothing has changed yet. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 23:56, Aug 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The category in its current form is not useful at all, due to its lack of organisation. Possibly you (both?) should support an expansion of the sub-categories by... expanding the sub categories? Suggestions for serious consideration: <i>Areas of B'ham</i>, <i>Bands of B'ham</i>, <i>Bands influenced by B'ham</i>, <i>Artists influenced by B'ham</i>, <i>Notable inventions of B'ham</i>, <i>Venues in B'ham</i>, etc. Having lots of categories with say... three to 50 things in them will be much more useful than the current undifferentiated mass that we have here at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Less realistically, and on a lighter note, I'd <i>like</i> to see a category: <i>Things which don't have anything much to do with B'ham, except in the eyes of one terribly stubborn individual</i>. Everything in the current B'ham category could go in there, until the useful bits are shuffled around into the appropriate sub-categories.</dd>

<dd>Subcategories would be nice in <i>some</i> cases, but I do not think we need a category like <i>Bands influenced by Birmingham</i> etc., therefore the only thing I could to would be to remove the categories from some articles, which gets reverted as I already said. Categories like <i>Areas of Birmingham</i> would be fine, but that's not really the thing I'm complaining about.&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 00:35, Aug 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks to <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">User:Pigsonthewing</a> for putting in a lot of effort and making some very sensible sub-categories. Would you like myself and others to help you out in this task, or is this category 100% <i>your baby</i>?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With respect to personal abuse, it would seem to be (from looking at your other ongoing crusades) something with which you are more than capable of dealing, albeit in a rather abrasive, and brusk manner. The majority of your counterpoints to people's issues raised with some of your edits (XP, Prince Charles as a painter, etc.) seem to take the form of "I know best", "So? I don't care", and "Please explain, with reference to...". This is often the case after someone has just spend five to ten minutes of editing time explaining quite clearly their point of view.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just to <i>try</i> and explain my reasoning against the over-categorisation issue once more (although I'm starting to lose the will to live with this one) I would imagine that out of people looking for things relating to Birmingham, probably a tiny minority will be interested in the fact that <i>Rip van Winkle</i> was written there. These people <b>can read it in the article</b>, so there's no need to include it in the category. I am, however, willing to concede to your sensible idea of having it in the <i>Literature of...</i> sub-category, which is infinitely more sensible than simply having it lying - inexplicably - in the main cat.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can't really understand your fixation with needing to populate various categories to extreme degrees. To digress somewhat, and go back to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles</a> example; if I was to consider Prince Charles, I would think of him as a Prince (clearly), future king, philanthropist and possibly, eventually, I'd remember that he's a painter in his spare time. A quick glance at the categories he is in suggests that he is a well-known and influential painter most of the time, which is "a fallacy". His inclusion in the category for the sake of name-dropping devalues its usefulness, much in the same way as many of the Birmingham entries did. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh paint too; why are they excluded? <b>(This question is rethorical)</b>. Furthermore - and quite incredibly - <i>not a single mention of his painting activities occurs in the article</i>, yet he is in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_painters_5fad.html" title="Category:British painters">British Painters category</a>...? This seems pointless. Should he also be in a <i>Known wearers of shoes</i> category?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You have no doubt noticed a pattern developing in your edits; that they are praised, with the exception of some of your categorisation decisions, which you seem to single-handedly taking the high-ground on. Polite requests by many users are met with terse put-downs, and a dreadfully unhelpful "No surrender" attitude. This is in no way in the spirit of Wikipedia, and is intensely frustrating for any user who has the patience and time to put up with it for more than a few rounds. I also note that you seem to be the only person in your corner on this issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly you should consider being somewhat more accommodating on the issue of categories? The time you spend defending your repeated reverts could much more productively be spent doing other editing tasks, which are more beneficial to the community, and don't put so many noses out of joint. I also refer you to the unfortunately titled '<a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_762d.html" title="Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">Stay cool</a>' page, which I have found most helpful.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks again for making the additional sub-categories. It looks much more sensible already. Again, I'm more than willing to help you out with these, provided everything I do isn't instantly unilaterally reverted! <a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmcm_a5d3.html" title="User:Pmcm">PMcM</a> 15:09, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC) <i>(Not doing too well at remembering to sign things today...)</i></dd>
