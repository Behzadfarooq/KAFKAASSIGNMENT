<p>Actually, the easiest way is just to click the "signature" box on the editing bar (the row of boxes that is above the editing space on the edit page, starting with a <b>B</b> for bold and an <i><b>I</b></i> for italic) - the signature box is second from the end. Otherwise, you should use four tildes: ~~~~, which will addyour signature plus the date.

I have been going through articles looking for bad links to Wikisource, which in many cases cause editors to repeatedly add works to the completely wrong place. I have followed links to prompt that a page did not exist on Wikisource with <i>18</i> deleted edits. As I was going through my search I found these many blank pages and thought would be remiss not to tag them, but I could hardly complete the nomination then and make any headway through my list. They have sat ignored and blank since July and so I thought little harm to let them sit a bit longer till I finish my primary project. If you believe I would do better not to tag further articles as go through my list I will refrain from doing so. I truly more concerned about Wikisource issues, but felt bad looking at all the blank pages and doing nothing--BirgitteSB 17:05, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've completed the current ones; the problem is that I run a bot to find broken nominations every day. The task can't be fully automated (there are many false positives), so I have to manually look at every article that gets tagged with {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd_0e24.html" title="Template:Afd">afd</a>}} but doesn't get completed. Because of the strange things that can sometimes go wrong with noms (moved articles, single nominations for multiple articles, etc.), it actually takes longer to complete a half-done nomination than to start a new one from scratch. If you expect to find a lot more of these, please either complete the nominations as you make them, or else drop a list of the articles on my talk page instead of tagging them yourself. I do agree that these need to go, and would be happy to list them myself. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 17:16, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>thank you indeed, the template is very useful; I was very unhappy with all the broken links generated by the split of wikisource into subdomains.

<p>Thanks for your kind words. I like to share and wikipedia has been a great place for me to write articles on topics I am knowledgeable. I have met several interesting people working on articles together. I was a little shocked when as soon as I added my article on Wikinomics that it was marked for a "candidate for deletion" because there were less than 100 hits in Google. Seems somewhat odd. It would have been nicer to just suggest a different location. But what is still not clear to me is what if this is not original research? Could it just the application description of transaction costs to wikipedia, something anyone with a basic class in economics could do? Is that a valid article to write? Then to be told to put it back on wikipedia only created more confusion. I think your idea to put it back into wikipedia just just under a dry topics like "economics" and "transaction costs of shared knowledge systems" is a good idea. I can then talk to other people about it that care about those topics and we can all write a good articles together. There are plenty of good sources I can quote from my economics and knowledge managment textbooks. I am frustrated, but I understand that there really is not a place for collaborative discussion yet on new topics there people threaten to delete thoughtful work. The article was really part of an economics assignment for a class, but with all this moving back an forth I think that Microsoft Word is a good format also&#160;:-O. YIKES!</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again for your sympathetic note and your empathy. Nice to see that there is someone else out there that cares about my feelings. I just wanted them to be validated. OK, now I feel much better.&#160;:-) - Dan --Dan 18:04, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re your user page: Yeah, I know the anti-agriculture bias you are talking about.

<dd>As I said on the talk page I could support anything that otherwise gains widespread support. That includes Macedonia (former Yugoslav Republic of); Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia); Macedonina (Republic of Macedonia); Macedonia (modern nation); Macedonia (Eastern European republic); Macedonia (Slavic nation); as well as countless other possibilties. I cannot grasp all the import of the slight differences under disscusion, so I am not willing to push any of these options which meet sincere strong oposition. You, I believe, understand all these contentious points.

<p>I copied your comment here above for continuity, so let's continue <i>in your place, not mine</i>, if you agree&#160;:-). Ok, I sincerely think that with your proposal you have given an idea that will really help to end this bickering. My first impression would be that the most acceptable name from all sides, would be the one I proposed above. The quick reasons I can think of right now follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all we are <i>not inventing names</i>. I've seen this version in other sites etc, plus it is common to put after the names in parentheses their first few disambiguating terms.</li>
<li>The name is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">in due weights</a> according to the situation internationally. I mean, many people (including themselves) call them simply Macedonians, some 2/3ds of the countries have recognised the RoM name, and Greece, plus all international organizations plus 1/3d or so of the countries use the spellout, or the initials of fyrom.</li>
<li>Most pro-Greek users will be sad that the name Macedonia is first and outside of the parentheses, but I suspect they'll most probably prefer it, since it contains the fyrom spellout (hidden, but it does).</li>
<li>Most pro-Skopian users will have the exact opposite feelings from the Greeks, and may prefer it because it finally puts in parenthesis all the bickering.</li>
<li>Most third users will find that this is an equitable presentation of the real situation and support it.</li>
</ul>

<dd>All I need to is to see widespread support for such a move. Although I can understand your points, it would probably be best to be open to other possibilities. These things are settled when everyone's input is taken into account and hopefully a satisfactory solution is arrived at. Keep in mind the number one goal of a page title is signal to the reader what they can find in the article. This title in particular is also trying to specify what is different about this <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia.html" title="Macedonia">Macedonia</a> from all the others on the disambig page. As long as a version succeeds at doing those two things; I would not oppose it, with my support going to a wording which is also supported by a wide range of people. I realize that is not a great deal of help, but if I knew what the actual answer to this was I would certainly tell you.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <strong class="selflink"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></strong> 19:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I didn't know that the Ang: wikisource had been created until you told me about it, so thanks for letting me know! I'll try to put up some things to the en: domain when I can, I'm just wondering if it's the right place to put documents in a foreign language (is Goethe in German or English there?).

<dd>I don't really consider anglo-saxon a foriegn language to en.wikisource. Our policy is to title the text by the most common name. Since most (if not all) Anglo-Saxon works did not have "titles" as we would use the term today, I believe they will end up with modern titles (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/en:Bright%27s_Anglo-Saxon_Reader" class="extiw" title="s:en:Bright's_Anglo-Saxon_Reader">s:en:Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader</a>. But I am not against titling works in Anglo-Saxon as long it has been published that way at some point. In fact many works should probaly be disambiguation pages with links to the original Anglo-Saxon as well as modern interpretaions. I really think it would be great to have an Anglo-Saxon Portal that could be written in Anglo-Saxan on en.WS. We have not started portals at all yet as we are waiting for the namespace manager. This is all just me brainstorming so others may disagree, but I think all english languages should be at en.WS. Since we are working with staitic texts we do not have to worry about one editor writing in scots and another adding a bit in middle english. In fact we do not even have to deal with the british vs american spelling problems that en.WP does. I think that to make a seperate ang.WS is really a wasted effort as far as all the administrative work that must be done. If we just used the infastructure of en.WS everyone would have more time to actually work on texts.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <strong class="selflink"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></strong> 18:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>... Sorry about that - it came out much more salty than I had intended. I don't fault any individual members, and have proposed an alteration to the deletion policy to encourage more contact effort before closing the deletion. I would very much appreciate it if you could restore the documents temporarily so I can grab the formatting, and I will do the work on the alternate sourcing (and Ideally get a GFDL-compatible license issued from the archives department at hte Baha'i World Centre on the other texts as well, if possible).

<p>I hadn't noticed you'd also put a reasoned response on the RFA talk page at first. Cool.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to discuss things on the Sean Black RFA. People should do that more. Especially when they're being as logical and polite (which you are!) &#160;:-)</p>
<p>Notice that I'm not saying that anyone is out for revenge or any such thing. Just that RFA is biased towards people who have had bad experiences with a candidate.</p>
<p>I sometimes have a tendency to put things briefly and a tad crudely. Perhaps I have to be just a tad more careful, as it takes a lot more time to explain exactly what I meant after doing so. (It does attract attention of course, so it's a tricky tradeoff&#160;:-))</p>

<p>I wanted to point out that I have come across many cases of clear copyright violations which do not qualify for the speedy deletion criteria. Generally it is because they are older than 48 hours; as I do not participate in RC patrol, I guess I don't find the new ones. However most of the violations I have found would also fail the "commercial" requirement even if they were new enough. With that in mind I find the advice to use speedy clear copyright violations misleading.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <strong class="selflink"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></strong> 21:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I'm home. My flights were excellent (although with an hour's delay from Munich to Belgrade). Glad everything worked out for you. I can only imagine the manager's surprise. The waitress at our place was kinda stomped when she saw ten of us. We were trying to sqeeze in and make enough room for the pizza plates - it was great. Some of the guys later went to "Red Line" and I met Ivan Krstic (the organizer of The Hacking Days) with Wolf (that's his IRC nickname) later that evening. Yeah, Boston was great, but not as great as NYC! I had a blasting time there. All in all, I have 453 images on my photo.

<p>Greetings. You seem upset with me. It's a shame that dealing with the backlog at <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> is often such a thankless task.</p>
<p>Wikipedia does try to respect the copyrights of other nations, in the sense that we consider works created in Iran to be copyrighted even though those copyrights are not enforceable here. But as Wikipedia servers are in Florida, we <i>do not</i> recognize the copyrights of works whose copyright is considered to have expired in the U.S, or works that are not considered copyrightable here. (Mexico, for example, protects works for 99 years after the death of the author, and France considers photographs of buildings to be violations of the architect's copyright.) This has been hashed through many, many times. See <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublic_domain_57d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Public domain">Wikipedia:Public domain</a> for details.</p>
<p>I removed the entries because they had been dealt with, not because I was trying to hide anything. All my actions are free for all to see, and I'm quite willing to answer any questions you have. But your hostile tone in talking to me about this issue has not helped the situation.</p>

<li>Wikimedia Foundation</li>
<li>Mediawiki</li>
<li>Copyrights</li>
<li>General info</li>
<li>Sister projects</li>
</ol>
<p>The panel will be a part of a more general Internet conferance that will be held 21-23 December 2006 in Ankara, Turkey.</p>
<p>I am looking for a person to cover the "sister projects" topic. And I was told that you would be an approporate person for the job.</p>

<p>The first thing I have to answer is: "yet we are told that it is a widely held objection". Look back through the postings. Taxman, JzG, Andrew Levine—these are not casual, one-off editors objecting; if you think it's a problem now, imagine it becomes policy—believe me, you'd have your hands full with the objections. Part of my thinking has been how wrong it is that a party of people (you and me included) numbering in the single digits is going to "decide" this. We aren't—we can streamline what <i>is,</i> but new, radical innovations are not on the radar IMO (I do view the exception as "radical"). Even SlimVirgin (not to put words in her mouth) I see as ambivalent regarding, rather than truly in favour of, the pop culture exception.</p>
<p>That off my chest, yes, maybe "accredited" is better. Jules is suggesting that people might read "professional" in the "I-get-paid-for-it" sense, but I don't see this; I only read "professional" that way when thinking of athletes and (maybe) of musicians. I read it in this context as "acceptable for a .edu or a journalism site"--i.e., regardless of whether you get <i>paid</i>, others (especially places of publication) would acknowledge your "credentials" and accept your work as "in the ballpark." I think through that...and, yes again, "accredited" is broadly what I mean. I just want to be able to say to a pseudoscientist, <i>Nature</i> wouldn't <i>recognize you, even if you're "right". You just don't have the wherewithal to state "Z is A" in a general purpose work</i>...(e.g., a <b>tertiary encyclopedia such as Wikipedia</b>). Our policies need to clearly say this. While on this topic, let me state that aliens and astrology were not meant to be glib—pseudoscientists will see through the slightest contradiction in policy and badger the hell out of you on talk pages. I don't want this exception b/c I can imagine, in a very practical sense, the shit it will cause.</p>
<p>If perhaps we can agree on this adjective, be aware that others will scream bloody murder. Frankly, I think some just don't want a policy, or at least want a caveat within policy that would render policy moot. I believe (difficult as it's been) that you want clarity—good. I want clarity—a clear policy that speaks to most examples but doesn't pretend it can speak to every example. I don't want a page that says "here are the rules—and BTW if you don't like them, forget them". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 23:31, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do understand that, for different reasons than my own, you feel the pop culture exception won't work; I only went back over that to emphasize that I wasn't the only person objecting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Slim hasn't commented on the discussion recently, and I'd be curious her opinion. One thing occured to me: is "recognized" perhaps meant to cover accredited? "Recognized professional" is quite close to "accredited professional" really, just not explicitly demanding a piece of paper. Some might use it as a wedge—"'recognized' in the gaming community, say—but that wouldn't really hold up long. If anything is redundant there, it's "expert": "When a recognized professional <s>expert</s> writing in his or her area of expertise..." is probably fine. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:25, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your time Madam. Let me explain what exactly i have done so it will be easy for you. The dynasty of Chalukyas starts with Badami Chalukyas. So I have given a brief detail of the overall Chalukya Dynasty at the header. Then I have gone in detail explaining about Badami Chalukyas on the same page since they are the "original" Chalukyas, created "sister pages" for Kalyani Chalukya and Eastern Chalukyas going into details in each of the sister pages. In the main page called "Chalukya Dynasty" I have elaborated on Badami Chalukyas as they were the first dynasty. If you still feel there is ambiguity of any sort , dont hesitate to let me know.

<p>Thanks for your note - I don't really care much about that link - it wasn't my addition as I said. But I think that editor was high-handed and I don't appreciate being threatened - this link has been there for a while, and only came up because some anonymous person removed it without discussion. I was looking for some other opinions from editors of that page before a decision was made to remove it.

<dd>Hi again - if you're interested, you can see my response on <a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor">User talk:Veinor</a> - I'm not confused, actually, although I wasn't clear about the {{helpme}}, so thanks - but it did get someone's attention (yours), so I wasn't that far off... My point is that linkiing to a Myspace Music page for a dead musician may not be so completely clearly a violation of the WP:EL guidelines which by definition are interpretatable to some extent. Anyway, we'll see what happens. I do appreciate your jumping in and diffusing the tension a bit - seems to me he was escalating without reading my responses which isn't a good idea.

<p>No problem. I actually have no idea what I should have done to complete the transwiki procedure, I was already happy that I could do as much as I did&#160;:)</p>
<p>But now that we're at it, could you clarify how the copyright status of the text in question should be sorted out? The points unclear for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original author wrote the proclamation in Hungarian, in 1956. He died in 1979. Thus his work is under copyright until the end of 2049 (70 yrs) per the Hungarian copyright regulations. But since it is a proclamation, it is by definition something that is intended by the original author to be distributed as widely as possible. Doesn't that negate some of the restrictions on the use of the work?</li>
<li>What are the rights of the translator? More precisely, what are the requirements on the translator and/or the translation to make it compatible with either Wikipedia or Wikisource?</li>
</ul>

<dd>Thanks for your answer. In this case I think the matter will be settled, since there's a Hungarian Wikipedian who plans to translate the text to English again and release it under GFDL.

<p>We tolerate trolls too long - and they are the biggest source of busy work and negative productivity on Wikipedia. Personally, I have only called 2 people trolls, and both times I am sure they are. You are probably right that the truth is not a defense to a personal attack; however, we should not tolerate the activities of trolls, and here we are doing just that and wasting our time discussing their BS. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 03:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thx for the note. We substantially agree. Months of behaviour sometimes requires a response, and I think you can tell from my introduction that I was reluctant. There comes a time when the subtle snide comments and constant stirring of the discussion needs to be identified as such. In that we disagree. Fortunately, obvious trolls can be blocked, and have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABlind14" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3ABlind14" rel="nofollow">blocked indefinately</a> by Jimbo and others.

Unfortunately, Duke53's behavior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93136162" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93136162" rel="nofollow">before</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93177574" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93177574" rel="nofollow">after</a> his "refactoring" continue to show a lack of understanding of what AGF means, what the difference is between an editor profering evidence about the location of an IP address and the addition of material to an article.

<p>As an aside you said "I believe the things we are discussing at Temple garment would be contentious even if the issue had been brought out in the most mild way." I <s>strongly disagree</s>, having been involved with emotionally charged discussions on pages in the Latter Day Saint movement, I have seen controversial topics discussed professionally. The established LDS editors defending Wikipedia's cherished principles against the pro-LDS editors, by explain to them how things work, and support the reverts and neutral edits made by other editrors (regardless of their background). I have even been told re my position on the garment issue that I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tr%C3%B6del&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91045452" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tr%C3%B6del&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91045452" rel="nofollow">sold my soul</a>.

<dd>I think you're right - while it could have been handled differently - I think the topic is so sensitive to some that it would have denigrated eventually.

<p>As you wish. I should point out that any username blocks I have issued in the past were fully compliant with the username policy as it existed at that time. If the username policy tells me to block non-latin usernames I shall do so, if it does not, I will not. If you object to a policy, <i>change the policy</i>, not the people who follow it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have attempted to address the copyvio issues with a replacement article on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreek_administration_of_Smyrna_%281919-1922%29_Temp_60a2.html" title="Talk:Greek administration of Smyrna (1919-1922)/Temp">Talk:Greek administration of Smyrna (1919-1922)/Temp</a>.

What's the next step? Do we need wait for an admin to get involved as the copyvio template suggests or are you willing to remove the copyvio notice and let me replace the current revision with the one at [[[Talk:Greek administration of Smyrna (1919-1922)]]?</p>
