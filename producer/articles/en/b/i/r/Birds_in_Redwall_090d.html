<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Argular">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Argular</span></h3>
<p>An eagle who, for reasons unknown, left the mountains and lived close to Kotir, occasionally picking off various soldiers of the wildcat <a href="../../../t/s/a/Tsarmina.html" title="Tsarmina">Queen Tsarmina</a>, whom he hated. He was old, however, and though competent as a flier, travelling higher in the air than any arrow could reach him, and a fierce fighter, his eyesight had deteriorated with age. The Queen, knowing of his one desire to one day eat a pinemarten, dressed a scheming fox, Bane, who had fallen out of her favour into a cloak belonging to a pinemarten who had once worked for her. Argulor, supposing the fox indeed to be his most favoured target, swooped down and carried him away. After finally winning a terrible battle against the fox in the air, and killing him, he realised his mistake, and, feeling cheated, his old heart sank, never to beat again.</p>
<p><a name="Boldred" id="Boldred"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Boldred">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boldred</span></h3>
<p>An owl living near Noonvale, Boldred is an expert mapmaker and friend to many beings in the vicinity. Boldred dwelt on a large mountain, occasionally chastening the Gawtrybe Tribe of young squirrels that lived nearby. She had a mate Horty, and a daughter Emalet, and taught the young one all she knew about aristry. Boldred helped <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin the Warrior</a> and his comrades as they traveled to Noonvale, and later flew alongside the Warden of Marshwood Hill in the attack on Marshank. She was voiced by Sherrill Parsons in the full-cast audiobook of <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_9648.html" title="Martin the Warrior">Martin the Warrior</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="Brantalis" id="Brantalis"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Brantalis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brantalis</span></h3>
<p>A barnacle goose, Brantalis was shot down by vermin while flying over Green Isle. He was saved by Leatho Shellhound, and flew to Redwall Abbey to receive treatment for his injuries. He spent quite a while there, his only complaint the presence of Pandion Piketalon. While recovering, he helped the Redwallers search for the coronet of the High Rhulain, and helped fight off an attacking gannet.</p>
<p>Brantalis flew back to Green Isle to deliver the coronet to <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiria_Wildlough_327a.html" title="Tiria Wildlough">Tiria Wildlough</a>. Whilst there, he joined forces with Pandion, putting aside their rivalry to save Leatho Shellhound. After the cats where erased from Green Isle, Brantalis was appointed official courier between Green Isle and Redwall Abbey. He was voiced by Roy Carruthers.</p>
<p><a name="King_Bull_Sparra" id="King_Bull_Sparra"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: King Bull Sparra">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">King Bull Sparra</span></h3>
<p>Ruler of the Sparra who nest in Redwall Abbey's roof spaces, King Bull was a fierce tyrant, to the point that if he made a joke, or found something amusing, everyone else had to laugh as well. King Bull lost the <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Martin_fbfa.html" title="Sword of Martin">Sword of Martin</a> to the serpent <a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmodeus_%28Redwall%29_1e64.html" title="Asmodeus (Redwall)">Asmodeus</a>. Since then, he was driven mad by a desire to recover it. His madness led to his end when Matthias, a Redwall mouse, came seeking the sword. After keeping the mouse prisoner, King Bull was tricked into leaving. Upon his return, he saw Matthias escaping. The two became locked in battle, and fell into Redwall Abbey's pond. King Bull drowned, although leaving a fragment of his sharp beak in Matthias' shoulder. His niece Warbeak became the new Sparra Queen. He was voiced by Ben Campbell on the animated TV series and by Billy Maher in the full-cast audiobook.</p>
<p><a name="Dunwing" id="Dunwing"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Dunwing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dunwing</span></h3>
<p>The mother of Warbeak and sister to King Bull Sparra, Dunwing was the widow sparrow who helped Matthias recover <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_9648.html" title="Martin the Warrior">Martin the Warrior</a>'s sword, which had been lost after her late husband and King Bull were frightened off by a giant adder <a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmodeus_%28Redwall%29_1e64.html" title="Asmodeus (Redwall)">Asmodeus Poisonteeth</a> having taken it out to dig for worms. Matthias was being held prisoner by King Bull and his warriors, but she befriended him, and managed to help him escape by spreading a rumour that Asmodues was dead or dying and that it would now be safe to recover the sword. In his haste to recover it, the sparrow-king forgot all about Matthias and flew away, leaving Matthias free to escape.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Gerul">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gerul</span></h3>
<p>A barn owl who came to Redwall Abbey, Gerul was the companion of a hare named Clecky. Upon taking up residence, he helped fight of the forces of Emperor <a href="../../../u/b/l/Ublaz_Mad-Eyes_217c.html" title="Ublaz Mad-Eyes">Ublaz Mad-Eyes</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Glokkpod" id="Glokkpod"></a></p>

<p>A fierce shrike from the kingdom of Southsward, Glokkpod made the mistake of flying into the dungeons of Castle Floret as the windows were being repaired. Locked in, he was tormented by the minions of <a href="../../../u/r/g/Urgan_Nagru_1e25.html" title="Urgan Nagru">Urgan Nagru</a>, the Foxwolf. Escape later came for him in the form of a group led by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dandin_the_Sword_Carrier_feae.html" title="Dandin the Sword Carrier">Dandin the Sword Carrier</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_Gullwhacker_9585.html" title="Mariel Gullwhacker">Mariel</a>. He helped them escape, but due to insults from one of the party members, he flew off in a huff, never to return.</p>
<p><a name="Sir_Harry_the_Muse" id="Sir_Harry_the_Muse"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Sir Harry the Muse">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sir Harry the Muse</span></h3>
<p>A poetic owl who lived near the highlands where sat the ruins of <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loamhedge_Abbey_38ee.html" title="Loamhedge Abbey">Loamhedge Abbey</a>. Nearly everything he said was spoken in rhyme. Sir Harry met up with the company of Matthias the Warrior as he pursued <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slagar.html" title="Slagar">Slagar</a> the Cruel and his minions. Helping them out, Sir Harry departed, feeling that it was not his business. However, Harry later returned, helping to save a member of the group from a pair of vultures.</p>
<p>Sir Harry had heard of Redwall, and decided that he wanted to live there. After helping the group get to their destination, he accompanied them on their return. He was elected leader and poetry instructor to the sparrows who lived at Redwall. Due to his frustration with their language, he retired several times, but his love of leading the Sparra led him to take up the position time and time again. He was voiced by Andrew Gillies on the animated TV series and by Ron Delacruz in the full-cast audiobook.</p>
<p><a name="Wild_King_MacPhearsome" id="Wild_King_MacPhearsome"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Wild King MacPhearsome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wild King MacPhearsome</span></h3>
<p>A massive golden eagle and king of the mountains north of Redwall, MacPhearsome was also the sole owner of the Flowers of Icetor. When <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrugg.html" title="Thrugg">Thrugg</a> the otter came seeking the flowers for an antidote needed for his sick friends, MacPhearsome was impressed by the otter's audacity. He was even more astonished when he met Dumble, Thrugg's baby dormouse companion, who was ready to fight the massive bird. He was voiced by Simon Smithies.</p>
<p>Carrying Dumble and the flowers to Redwall, MacPhearsome met the Redwallers and became friends with many. Dumble was so friendly with him that, adopting MacPhearsome's Scottish accent, he suggested that the new season be named the "H'autumn of the H'eagle." For many years afterward, Dumble would sleep outside, waiting for a visit from his old friend.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Mighty Megraw">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mighty Megraw</span></h3>
<p>An osprey with a Scottish accent, Megraw had his wing dislocated by a band of magpies living on the isle that was home to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlfox.html#Marlfoxes" title="Marlfox">Marlfoxes</a>. After some time of living with the wing, he met <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_Leader_%28Redwall%29_df67.html#Songbreeze_Swifteye" title="Abbey Leader (Redwall)">Songbreeze Swifteye</a> and her companions, including the warrior <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dannflor_Reguba_b845.html" title="Dannflor Reguba">Dannflor Reguba</a>. Recruited by Song's grandfather, Gawjo Swifteye, Megraw had his wing healed and helped them storm the island. After dispatching the magpies, he took over the isle, though he promised to come and visit Redwall.</p>
<p><a name="Orocca.2C_Taunoc.2C_Nutwing.2C_Nutclaw.2C_and_Nutbeak" id="Orocca.2C_Taunoc.2C_Nutwing.2C_Nutclaw.2C_and_Nutbeak"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Orocca, Taunoc, Nutwing, Nutclaw, and Nutbeak">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Orocca, Taunoc, Nutwing, Nutclaw, and Nutbeak</span></h3>
<p>A family of Little Owls who came to live at Redwall. Orocca and Taunoc were forcibly ejected from their former home when a powerful storm knocked down their tree, which at the time contained Orocca and her three eggs. Fortunately, the tree landed on the crumbling south wall of Redwall Abbey, and the workers-led by champion <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arven.html" title="Arven">Arven</a>-helped rescue the nest. Orocca and her eggs took up residence in the kitchens, followed shortly afterward by Taunoc.</p>
<p>The three eggs hatched just before the arrival of the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a> <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a>, bearing the badgerbabe <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russano_the_Wise_cd40.html" title="Russano the Wise">Russano the Wise</a>. The four young creatures were close companions, being the youngest ones at Redwall at the time. It was because of Russano that the young owls learned to speak. In the tradition of Little Owls, they later chose their own names, which all contained "Nut" because that was the first word they had learned, taught to Russano by Redwall's otter gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Many seasons later, Nutwing was the only one of the five still living at Redwall. Old and alone, he still served as a valuable member of the community. However, tragedy struck shortly after he befriened newcomers <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dannflor_Reguba_b845.html" title="Dannflor Reguba">Dannflor Reguba</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_Leader_%28Redwall%29_df67.html#Songbreeze_Swifteye" title="Abbey Leader (Redwall)">Songbreeze Swifteye</a>. The Abbey was invaded by several Marlfoxes, and they took Nutwing hostage as a distraction. In order to ward off the young defenders, they killed Nutwing, thrusting his body onto young Song before knocking her out.</p>
<p><a name="Pandion_Piketalon" id="Pandion_Piketalon"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Pandion Piketalon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pandion Piketalon</span></h3>
<p>An osprey native to Green Isle, Pandion was caught in a trap that caught an iron barbed star in his mouth. Despite this, Pandion was still a fearsome opponent, and before escaping tore off part of the face of the wildcat who tried to kill him, <a href="../../../r/i/g/Riggu_Felis_afd8.html" title="Riggu Felis">Riggu Felis</a>. As a result, Felis ordered the death of all birds on Green Isle. Pandion, injured, flew until he finally landed in Mossflower, where he was found and tormented by a gang of vermin. Fortunately, he was saved by a group of Redwallers led by <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiria_Wildlough_327a.html" title="Tiria Wildlough">Tiria Wildlough</a>.</p>
<p>While he was recovering, Pandion told Tiria of Green Isle's plight. When she set out to liberate her otter brethren on the island and take up her position as queen, Pandion accompanied her, acting as eyes and ears. He later teamed up with the goose Brantalis to save the otter Leatho Shellhound by flying him away from Felis' burning fortress, but so burdened was cut down by Riggu's thrown battleaxe. However, his death was quickly avenged as Tiria slew the wildcat with her sling, the load the same star that had been stuck in Pandion's mouth. The body of the brave osprey was then laid to rest in a lake on Green Isle. He was voiced by Greg Longridge.</p>
<p><a name="Stryk_Redkite" id="Stryk_Redkite"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Stryk Redkite">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stryk Redkite</span></h3>
<p>One of the great red kites who live in the mountains, Stryk was wounded in a rockslide. With an injured wing, she flew to Redwall, seeking help. Upon arriving, she was set upon by the invading forces of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Ironbeak_3e2c.html" title="General Ironbeak">General Ironbeak</a>, but saved by the Redwallers. The stubborn bird refused to let herself be treated, but was drugged by Sister May, a Redwall mouse she grew to be quite fond of and called "Sissimay."</p>
<p>Stryk recovered just in time to save the captured Redwallers from General Ironbeak. Flying into battle, she slew the General, and helped drive away his remaining forces. She later departed, and came back with a mate named Skine and an eggchick. To Sister May's delight, the female was to be named after her, but she insisted that her name be May and not "Sissimay."</p>
<p>Stryk was voiced by Ellen-Ray Hennessy on the animated TV series and by Nicky Mackay in the full-cast audiobook.</p>
<p><a name="Rocangus" id="Rocangus"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Rocangus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rocangus</span></h3>
<p>Son of Laird MacTalon, Rocangus was a young falcon. During one his flights, he injured his wing, and met up with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrugg.html" title="Thrugg">Thrugg</a> the otter and Dumble the doormouse. Traveling towards Rocangus' mountain home, they were attacked by crows. Theys put up a good fight, but were about to be defeated when a band of Rocangus' kindred showed up and saved them. After fulfilling Thrugg's quest, Rocangus and a band of his friends travelled by land back to Redwall with the otter. He was voiced by Roy Carruthers.</p>
<p><a name="Skarlath" id="Skarlath"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_in_Redwall_090d.html" title="Edit section: Skarlath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Skarlath</span></h3>
<p>A young kestrel who became frozen to a tree, Skarlath was an intended victim of <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swartt_Sixclaw_cda1.html" title="Swartt Sixclaw">Swartt Sixclaw</a>. However, he was saved by fellow captive <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunflash_the_Mace_cb96.html" title="Sunflash the Mace">Sunflash the Mace</a>, and helped him escaped in turn. Skarlath advised Sunflash against his chosen course of action, which was to attack Swarrt head on. He suggested to Sunflash that the pair would work together, using hit and run tactics to weaken Swartt until he could be killed. Skarlath was also the one to propose Sunflash's name, unwittingly using the one that the young <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Lord_f370.html" title="Badger Lord">Badger Lord</a> had been given at birth.</p>
<p>The pair traveled together for many seasons, Skarlath serving as Sunflash's messenger, eyes, and ears. The badger could summon Skarlath by folding a leaf and blowing it like a whistle, perfectly audible to Skarlath's sensitive ears.</p>
<p>Skarlath continued to serve Sunflash when he came to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a>, acting as courier to the badger's various allies. He later flew alongside his friend in the final chase after Swartt, but was sadly brought down by a vermin arrow.</p>

<p>A barn owl who lived quite a distance from Redwall, and who had been on good terms with <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squire_Gingivere_0fd2.html" title="Squire Gingivere">Squire Gingivere</a>, until he alienated him with his appalling diet and table manners. He was, however, instrumental in assisting Matthias in his quest to find Martin the Warrior's sword, which was hidden in the den of the giant adder <a href="../../../a/s/m/Asmodeus.html" title="Asmodeus">Asmodeus Poisonteeth</a>, and was so sceptical of the idea of Matthias ever coming out alive, that he promised never to eat another mouse again. This presumably brought about the reconciliation of himself with Squire Gingivere, because the last we hear of him is when he is waiting with his former feline rival, helping to pick off (although presumably not eat) the last of <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluny_the_Scourge_b2b3.html" title="Cluny the Scourge">Cluny the Scourge</a>'s army.</p>

<p>A goshawk who lived in Mossflower woods, Tergen met and became friends with <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakkety_Tam_MacBurl_d49c.html" title="Rakkety Tam MacBurl">Rakkety Tam MacBurl</a>. Due to taking a vermin arrow in his wing sometime beforehand, Tergen was unable to fly for a time. He accompanied Tam and his <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Patrol_f0f8.html" title="Long Patrol">Long Patrol</a> allies to Redwall Abbey, where he received treatment for this injury. In order to keep his mind off the fact that he could not fight, the leader of the Long Patrol assigned him wall guard duty due to his keen eyes, which he used to scout out vermin serving under <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulo_the_Savage_7f2f.html" title="Gulo the Savage">Gulo the Savage</a>. Many seasons later, after his wings healed, Tergen accompanied Tam and his family on a trip to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamandastron_%28Redwall%29_d54e.html" title="Salamandastron (Redwall)">Salamandastron</a>. Tergen then stayed there with his Long Patrol friends, serving as lookout for the mountain. He was voiced by Greg Longridge.</p>

<p>A sparrow warrior who befriended Matthias, Warbeak was a vicious fighter. The two bickered at first, but in time established a friendship. Following the death of King Bull Sparra, Warbeak took his place as queen. She led the Sparra against the forces of <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluny_the_Scourge_b2b3.html" title="Cluny the Scourge">Cluny the Scourge</a>. Sadly, she later fell in battle against a horde of rats, and was put to rest by her friend in <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo.html" title="Mattimeo">Mattimeo</a></i>.</p>
<p>Warbeak's only living family was her mother, Dunwing, her father having been killed by Asmodeus. On the animated TV series, she was voiced by Tracey Moore; in the audiobooks, she was played by Eithne Brown in <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Redwall_%28book%29.html" title="Redwall (book)">Redwall</a></i> and by Keddy Sutton in <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattimeo.html" title="Mattimeo">Mattimeo</a></i>.</p>

<p>The Warden of Marshwod Hill is a massive heron who patrols the region from which he takes his name. He is a fierce opponent to lizards, snakes, and other foul creatures who invade his territory. The Warden is incredibly dedicated, and has a set of rules. He also is constantly repeating, to the amusement of those who know him, "I am the law!" Despite his ferocity, the Warden is vulnerable while asleep.</p>
<p>The Warden aided <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_the_Warrior_%28Redwall%29_c5d4.html" title="Martin the Warrior (Redwall)">Martin the Warrior</a> and his companions when they had to travel through his domain to get to the town of Noonvale. Afterwards, he aided the army that stormed Marshank, fortress of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badrang_the_Tyrant_d1d9.html" title="Badrang the Tyrant">Badrang the Tyrant</a>. He was voiced in the full-cast audiobook by Dave Foode.</p>

<p>A powerful goshawk living in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossflower_Wood_6640.html" title="Mossflower Wood">Mossflower Wood</a>, Krar Woodwatcher is a formidable enemy. He first met Martin and his comrades, most particularly <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonff_the_Mousethief_6d7b.html" title="Gonff the Mousethief">Gonff the Mousethief</a>, while they were on their quest to learn the fate of <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_the_Warrior_5ef2.html" title="Luke the Warrior">Luke the Warrior</a>. Pledging his friendship, he watched over them as they traveled to the coast, even fighting off a massive swan. He later accompanied them home to Redwall when they came back that way.</p>
