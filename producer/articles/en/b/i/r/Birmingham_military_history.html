<p>At Metchley Park,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> near <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harborne.html" title="Harborne">Harborne</a>, there are the remains of two large first century <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> forts, it is believed that they were used as a base during the invasion of Britain<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and could have been used in the first north-western advance into <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. Much of the site is now gone; the construction of the banks of the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_and_Worcester_Canal_8ef1.html" title="Birmingham and Worcester Canal">Birmingham and Worcester Canal</a> resulted in part destruction of the southern extremity of the camp, including most of its fort. The most recent excavation took place in 1999 and it was established that the main fort probably housed a <a href="../../../c/o/h/Cohors.html" title="Cohors">cohors equitata</a> <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliaries_%28Roman_military%29_66ff.html" title="Auxiliaries (Roman military)">milliaria</a>, this comprised a minimum mixed force of 1,000 men who were heavily-armoured foot-soldiers with a compliment of a lightly-armed cavalry team.</p>
<p>In the 19th century people theorized that the camp was built by the ancient <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a> (a theory supported by its being adjacent to the line of <a href="../../../r/y/k/Ryknild_Street_0de6.html" title="Ryknild Street">Ryknild Street</a>) which runs through the area, others proposed that it was built by the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danes.html" title="Danes">Danes</a> although no factual evidence supports this theory. Some few pieces of ancient weapons, such as swords and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle-axe.html" title="Battle-axe">battle-axes</a>, and portions of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckler.html" title="Buckler">bucklers</a> have been found at the site.</p>
<p>Excavations have uncovered Roman <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granaries.html" title="Granaries">granaries</a>, store-houses, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barracks.html" title="Barracks">barracks</a>, a rampart with timber towers, a guard chamber, various smaller buildings, <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">pottery</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tools.html" title="Tools">tools</a>. These have dated the fort to a few years after Romans first landed in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a> it is now thought the site was abandoned by the end of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_century_AD_aca9.html" title="First century AD">first century AD</a>.</p>

<p>Local <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeologist.html" title="Archaeologist">archaeologist</a> Peter Osborn has suggested that there is a strong the possibility that the battle between ancient <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Briton</a> warrior queen <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boadicea.html" title="Boadicea">Boadicea</a> and the Romans took place in or around the area now called Birmingham sometime during 61AD.</p>
<p>"We know for certain that the battle between the 200,000 ancient Britons and the Romans happened somewhere in the Midlands." "This spot is on the route to Metchley, the Roman fort in Birmingham and it's for this reason, if no other, that we think this could be where the battle took place."</p>
<p>However Dr Simon Esmonde Cleary an Archaeology expert at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Birmingham_7145.html" title="University of Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> remains sceptical.</p>
<p>"The short answer is we don't know where the battle took place, anybody's guess is as good as anyone else's. The last time we had Boudicca was in what is now <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. We know the Roman Army was coming down from Wales. It would be fascinating if it were true but, as yet, I haven't seen any evidence it is,".</p>
<p>Until recently suggestions for the battle field site range from <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicestershire.html" title="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwickshire.html" title="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>.</p>
<p>The construction of new apartments has been put on hold until a full excavation is completed.</p>

<p>By the early 16th century Birmingham had already evolved into a well established arms maufacturing town, in 1538 churchman John Leialand passed through the Midlands and wrote:</p>
<p>"I came through a praty street or ever I entered Bermingham. This street, as I remember, is called Dirty (Deritend). In it dwells smiths and cutlers and there is a brooke that divides this street from Bermingham ........ There be many smiths in the towne, that use to make knives and all manner of cutting tools, and many lorimers that make bittes, and a great many naylours, so that a great part of the towne is maintained by smiths, who have their iron and sea-coal out of Staffordshire."<a href="http://rifleman.org.uk/Birmingham_Small_Arms_Co.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rifleman.org.uk/Birmingham_Small_Arms_Co.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>The two main towns responsible for military weapons at this time were Birmingham and London, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III_f037.html" title="Henry III">Henry III</a> however did not look kindly on British made weapons and he turned to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> for help in manufacture of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">bronze</a> cannons, he bought shells and bombs from the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> and much of the armoury and swords came from the more experienced <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_people.html" title="Flemish people">Flemish</a>. The majority of gunpowder was delivered from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> until the threatened invasion by the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Armada_a625.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/8/1588.html" title="1588">1588</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Howard%2C_1st_Earl_of_Nottingham_9bbe.html" title="Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham">Howard of Effingham</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Francis_Drake_4c9b.html" title="Sir Francis Drake">Sir Francis Drake</a> failed to capitalise on an initial victory over <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>'s fleet and allowed it to sail up the Channel by due to low supplies of imported gun powder, this proved the importance of more British arms manufacture as opposed to imports.</p>
<p>During the invasion by the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Armada_a625.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a>, the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentry.html" title="Gentry">gentry</a> of Birmingham and adjoining counties, contributed large sums of money which are said to have been sufficient to hire and equip around 43 war ships.

<p>By the early part of the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> Birmingham resembled a large sprawling smiths village, aided by the abundance of nearby sources of coal and iron ore many metal workers set up small foundries and workshops, Birmingham was an important manufacturing town with a reputation for producing <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a>, the villages trade stretched far and wide and in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1637.html" title="1637">1637</a>, a London <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutler.html" title="Cutler">cutler</a> protested against the import of 'Bromedgham blades' which were often made of similar standard but at less cost.</p>
<p>Unlike nearby towns such as <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamworth.html" title="Tamworth">Tamworth</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley.html" title="Dudley">Dudley</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartlebury.html" title="Hartlebury">Hartlebury</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton.html" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burton.html" title="Burton">Burton</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichfield.html" title="Lichfield">Lichfield</a> there were little or no military defences. In <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> unrest between the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers_%28royalists%29.html" title="Cavaliers (royalists)">Royalist</a> (<a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire.html" title="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>) and the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">Parliamentarians</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwickshire.html" title="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>) lead to many small battles and skirmishes taking place in surrounding countryside. The allegiances around Birmingham were blurred with a mish mash of landowners, nobility and gentry all fighting for different sides.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavaliers_%28royalists%29.html" title="Cavaliers (royalists)">Royalists</a> first passed through Birmingham proper in great force in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> the town was mainly <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a>, and some looting took place, as an apology to the town <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">King Charles</a> ordered two of his captains to be hung, this did not appease the town and some time later a baggage train of the king was captured and delivered to Warwick.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> With further unrest both sides prepared for war, the smiths of Birmingham were called upon and over 15,000 sword blades were manufactured, these were supplied to Parliamentarian forces only.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_Norton_16fd.html" title="Kings Norton">Kings Norton</a> and Hawksley both acted as battlefields during October, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine_0e3c.html" title="Prince Rupert of the Rhine">Prince Rupert</a>'s troops were ambushed with many casualties, both sides claimed the upper hand.</p>
<p>In March <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a> Prince Rupert requested entry to the village to build his billets there to strengthen the Royalist stronghold, Rupert was known locally as 'Prince Robber, Duke of Plunderland', he was mistrusted by the town and refused entry, the villagers, knowing their fate and with makeshift defences bravely prepared to defend their families and businesses from an impending Royalist attack. Two of Ruperts <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragoon.html" title="Dragoon">Dragoon</a> charges were repelled but further attacks by the overwhelming forces (Led by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Denbigh_0c2d.html" title="Earl of Denbigh">Earl of Denbigh</a>) resulted in the fall of Birmingham.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile a Parliamentary troop from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Bull_Ring_72fa.html" title="Birmingham Bull Ring">Corn Cheaping</a> (lead by commander, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Thomas_Graves_73b4.html" title="Captain Thomas Graves">Captain Thomas Graves</a> of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moseley.html" title="Moseley">Moseley</a>) had arrived too late to defend the town and were pursued by Denbigh up until Cape Hill where by a stand was made by Graves, Denbigh was killed and his Royalist troops were routed, Graves and his troops then continued their escape.</p>
<p>The stand of the villagers against Rupert, the death of his favorite Officer Denbigh, and the supply of weaponry to Parliamentarians gave Rupert the perfect excuse to allow his troops freedom to injure, rape, kill, and plunder Birmingham for one night of "fun". By the time Rupert had left the village he had destroyed one third of it by fire.</p>
<p>During the 1st and 2nd <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> Birmingham's poor defences and unfortunate close proximity to the Royalist/Parliamentarian battle fields led to further minor ransacking by Royalist forces, the town continued to manufacture weapons of all kinds during this period though and was heavily relied upon by <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s forces for such wares. As the Royalists were gradually routed from the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midlands.html" title="Midlands">Midlands</a> normality returned to the area but the plight of the people during the early raids was remembered in song 'The Armourer's Widow' which was still sung well into the 19th century.</p>
<p>Birmingham's small arms manufacture continued and during the mid to late 17th century the villages smiths were well renowned for their manufacture of quality weapons which by now included the firearm. Sir Richard Newdigate approached manufacturers in the town in <a href="../../../1/6/8/1689.html" title="1689">1689</a> with the notion of supplying the British Government with small arms. It was stressed that they would need to be of high enough calibre to equal the small arms that were imported from abroad. After a successful trial order in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1692.html" title="1692">1692</a>, the Government placed its first contract. On 5 January <a href="../../../1/6/9/1693.html" title="1693">1693</a> the "Officers of Ordnance" chose five local firearms manufacturers to initially produce 200 "<a href="../../../s/n/a/Snaphance.html" title="Snaphance">snaphance</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musket.html" title="Musket">musquets</a>" per month over the period of one year, paying 17 shillings per musket, plus 3 shillings per hundredweight for delivery to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>

<p>Gun manufacture in Birmingham continued to develop, mainly around the Digbeth area but also in what was later to become know as the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter_2be6.html" title="Gun Quarter">Gun Quarter</a>.</p>
<p>A meeting was held October 5, <a href="../../../1/7/4/1745.html" title="1745">1745</a>, by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Warwickshire_Fusiliers_1b43.html" title="Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers">6th Regiment of Foot</a> for the raising of a regiment of volunteers to oppose the <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobite_rising.html" title="Jacobite rising">Jacobite rising</a>.</p>
<p>The town contributed to a fund to repel the rumoured invasion by France in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1758.html" title="1758">1758</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Warwickshire_Fusiliers_1b43.html" title="Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers">6th Regiment of Foot</a> recruited in the county of Warwickshire in 1778 so successfully that it was called "The Warwickshire," Birmingham supplying a large proportion of the men, and raising by public subscription £2,000 towards their equipment.</p>
<p>The Birmingham Independent Volunteers corps were established in 1782 as a teritorial army. When, as an aid to recruiting, territorial links of infantry regiments were first established in <a href="../../../1/7/8/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a>, the 6th became the 1st Warwickshire Regiment, reflecting their recent connections with the county. During the French Revolutionary Wars in 1794 in the West Indies, the 6th took part in the capture of Martinique, Guadeloupe and St Lucia from the French and in Casdebar in August 1798 they gained a Battle Honour.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a> the Birmingham Loyal Association of Volunteers corps were established. Alternately, the 1782 corps may have become the Loyal Association, or some part of it, or the two organizations may have existed side by side. The Loyal Association was formed in response to the threat of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolutionary_Wars_5553.html" title="French Revolutionary Wars">French Revolution</a>: two companies were formed, one mounted on horseback and one on foot. Each company consisted of 500 men, and operated under the commands of Captain Pearson and Lord Brooke. The men were armed with muskets brought from <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>. The Loyal Association held their first parade in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleshill.html" title="Coleshill">Coleshill</a> Street, August 15, 1797. On the 4th of the following June, a grand review was held on Birmingham Heath (then unenclosed), "to the delight of the local <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belle.html" title="Belle">belles</a>, who knew not which the most to admire, the scarlet horse or the blue foot." <a href="http://www.abacci.com/annotated/ebook.aspx?bookID=304&amp;pagenumber=90" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abacci.com/annotated/ebook.aspx?bookID=304&amp;pagenumber=90" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Over 100,000 spectators were said to have been present.</p>
<p>With the many gun makers and work shops the quality of gun manufacture in the town needed to be controlled, government viewing rooms were opened in Bagot Street in 1798, employing sixty or seventy people to ensure that guns produced: were of the necessary standard to provide for the British army. Military use, however, was accompanied by a major market in the Atlantic slave trade. A 1788 Parliamentary report counted over 4,000 gun makers, with 100,000 guns a year going to slave traders.</p>

<p>The Loyal Birmingham Volunteers corps were established in 1802.</p>

<p>Birmingham Loyal Association of Volunteers had the honour of escorting Lord Nelson when, with Lady Hamilton, he visited the town in 1802. At a review on August 2, 1804, the regiment were presented with its colours, and for years the "Loyals" were the most popular men of the period. Our neighbours do not seem to have been more backward than the locals, though why it was necessary that the services of the Handsworth Volunteer Cavalry should be required to charge and put to flight the rioters in Snow Hill (May 29, 1810) is not very clear.—See also</p>
<p>Barracks were built in 1793, at a cost of £13,000, as a consequence of the riots of the city in 1791.</p>

<p>The Orsim bombs used in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, January 15, 1858, were made in the city.</p>
<p>The official natal day could be argued as the 14th of December, 1859, when a town's meeting was held "for the purpose of adopting such measures as might seem desirable for placing Birmingham in its proper position with regard to the great national rifle movement." The Hon. Charles Granville Scott had been previously selected by Lord Leigh (the Lord-Lieutenant of the County) as Colonel, Major Sanders had accepted the Captaincy, Mr. J.O. Mason been appointed Lieutenant, and 111 names entered on the roll of members of the 1st Company, but it was not till the above-named day that the movement really made progress, the Mayor (Mr. Thos. Lloyd), Sir John Ratcliff, Mr. A. Dixon, and Mr. J. Lloyd each then promising to equip his twenty men apiece, and sundry other gentlemen aiding to dress up others of the rank and file. The money thus being found the men were soon forthcoming too, the end of the year showing 320 names on the roll call, a number increased to 1,080 by the close of 1860. The latter year saw the first parade in Calthorpe Park, the opening of the range at Bournebrook, and the formation of the twelve companies forming the first battalion, but, notwithstanding many liberal donations (the gunmakers giving £850), and the proceeds of the first annual ball, it closed with the corps being in debt over £1,000. On the formation of the 2nd county battalion, Col. Scott took command thereof, Major Sanders being promoted. He was followed by Lieut.-Col. Mason, on whose resignation, in February, 1867, Major Ratcliff succeeded, the battalion being then 1,161 strong. Col. Ratcliff retired in June, 1871, and was replaced by Major-General Hinde, C.B., who held command until his death, March 1, 1881. Major Gem who temporarily acted as commander, also died the following Nov. 4, Major Burt filling the post till the appointment of Col. W. Swynfen Jervis. The first adjutant (appointed in 1860) was Captain McInnis, who retired in 1870, having received bodily injuries through being thrown from his horse; he was succeeded by the present Adjutant-Colonel Tarte. The first uniform of the corps was a grey tunic with green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this was changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn by the 60th Rifles, with the exception of a broad red stripe on the trousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the cap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in 1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon perhaps our boys will all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the Staffordshire battalions. The annual balls did not become popular, the last taking place in 1864; <a href="../../../b/a/z/Bazaar.html" title="Bazaar">bazaars</a> were held October 14-17, 1863, and October 24-27, 1876; athletic displays had been given (the first in May, 1865). At the Volunteer Review, July 24, 1861, before the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cambridge_f9b6.html" title="Duke of Cambridge">Duke of Cambridge</a>; at the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Park%2C_London_cc60.html" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a> Review, June, 1865, before the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>; at the Midland Counties' Review at <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby.html" title="Derby">Derby</a>, June, 1867; at the Royal Review at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Berkshire_8835.html" title="Windsor, Berkshire">Windsor</a> in 1868; and at every inspection since, the Birmingham corps has merited and received the highest praise for general smartness and efficiency; it was one of the crack corps of the kingdom. The first march-out of 720 to Sutton took place June 21, 1875, others joining at the camp, making over 800 being under canvas, 744 attending the review. The camping-out at <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetly.html" title="Streetly">Streetly</a> Wood had annually recurred since that date; the first sham fight took place June 20, 1877. The "coming-of-age" was celebrated by a dinner at the Midland Hotel, January 29, 1881, up to which point the Government grants had amounted to £26,568 14 s (£26,568.70), the local subscriptions to £8,780, and the donations to £1,956 1 s 3 d (£1,956.06) The Birmingham Rifle Corps is now recognised as the First Volunteer Battalion of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Warwickshire_Regiment_d7fb.html" title="Royal Warwickshire Regiment">Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a>, having been linked to the "Saucy Sixth," under the army scheme of 1873.</p>
<p>The Midland <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">Rifle</a> Club was started in 1875, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> Rifle Association dating from 1861. Both clubs used the range at Sandwell Park, by permission of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Dartmouth_a6bd.html" title="Earl of Dartmouth">Earl of Dartmouth</a>. At the International Match at Creedmore, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, in 1881, the representatives of this neighbourhood scored high numbers, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal.html" title="Corporal">Corporal</a> Bates (of the M.R.C.) taking the only first prize secured by visitors in the open competitions of the U.S. Associations.</p>
<p>In 1881 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Royal_Warwickshire_Fusiliers_cd31.html" title="The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers">The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers</a> were created drawing massively from the city's stock. The Royal Warwickshire Regiment reorganised as the county regiment of Warwickshire, encompassing also its Militia and Volunteer infantry.</p>

<p>The Warwickshire regiment drew massively from the Birmingham area especially in the first world war, an initial recruitment drive in the city mustered over 8000 men to fight in British regiments, due to the successful recruitment the government advertised again and subsequently recruited a further 4000 volunteers, initially named the 1st, 2nd and 3rd city battalion they were later merged into The Royal Warwickshire Regiment. These forces later went on to fight in the trenches of the first world war.</p>
<p>The Company's post-war programme included, for a short time, a range of aeroplanes.</p>
<p>The Austin Greyhound 2 seater fighter was one, and the Austin Ball single seater another. Then there was a single seater biplane with folding wings, which sold at £500, and a fourth called the Austin Whippet.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/r/Percussion_cap.html" title="Percussion cap">Percussion caps</a> were yearly sent from Brum in millions of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Gross.html" title="Gross">grosses</a>, the manufacture of the complete gun cartridge came later. The manufacture of the caps involved several dangerous processes, and Birmingham has had to mourn the loss of many of her children through accidents arising therefrom. The ammunition works of Messrs. Kynoch and Co., at <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witton.html" title="Witton">Witton</a>, covered over 20 acres (80,000 m²), and gave employment to several hundred people, the contrariness of human nature being exemplified in the fact that the death-dealing articles were mainly manufactured by females, the future mothers or wives perchance of men to be laid low by the use of such things. The plant was capable of turning out 500,000 cartridges per day, as was done during the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_War_of_Independence_f5eb.html" title="Turkish War of Independence">Turkish war</a>, and it took 50 tons of rolled brass, 100 tons of <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a>, and 20 tons of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> weekly to keep the factory fully going, all kinds of ammunition for <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifles</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a> being made on the premises.

<p>Over 2,000 women, children and elderly were killed and 3,000 more were seriously injured in the air raids, many of the attacks were aimed at the thousands of factories that manufactured weapons of war including the Castle Bromwich aeroplane factory that mass produced the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Spitfire</a> fighter aircraft.
