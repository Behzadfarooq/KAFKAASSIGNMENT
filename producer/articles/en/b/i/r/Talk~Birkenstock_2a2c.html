<p>About <b>euroWellness</b>: I see that they are sold by HSN, but I don't know who designs them. On HSN they don't say anything about them being by Birkenstock. Birkenstock doesn't say anything about euroWellness on their site either (as far as I can tell). So I would say that the euroWellness paragraph can be taken out, but the one about the other Birkenstock brands should stay in.</p>
<p>Dear 217.7.2.155: instead of reverting back and forth, let's talk about it in here, since that is what the talk page is designed for.</p>

<p>Can the person responsible for adding the following information please identify themselves?

<p>Sorry for the late response, I am new in Wikipedia and this was my first intervention in an Artikel.</p>
<p>For information of the different brands (TATAMI, Papillio, Birki´s, Betula, footprints, ...)find the following letter, we send to our wholesalers:</p>
<p>Subject: The accurate use of the BIRKENSTOCK ® Trademark A special relationship: our trademark Papillio® and the</p>
<pre>
           relationship to the BIRKENSTOCK®  trademark
</pre>
<p>Dear Ladies and Gentleman,</p>
<p>The companies Papillio and Birkenstock and their products are closely associated – this is well known. But these companies also compete for the favour of their customers. In short terms: The two companies have a special relationship with one and another.</p>
<p>We would like to explain this relationship by giving you some information over the Papillio® trademark, its beginning and its relationship to the BIRKENSTOCK® company and its trademark. You will see the importance of this background information, and you will be able to make your contributions to ensure that fair competition continues between the two companies for the benefit of their customers.</p>
<p>The Papillio-Schuh GmbH was established in 2004 by Christian Birkenstock. Prior to this, Papillio was a trademark of the Birkenstock company and run as a profit-center. Manifold designs and extraordinary material developments marked Papillio as “the colourful Birkenstock”. Papillio not only invested into new material developments but new models.</p>
<pre>
 To emphasize this independence and the uniqueness of the new products, the Papillio®           trademark was imported into an independent company.  
</pre>
<p>The company Papillio with its Papillio® trademark shows continued growth. A number of new developments and projects are up to enable Papillio® to settle in the market and to oppose the free competitive market and also the BIRKENSTOCK® trademark. Despite this independence, the products out of the Papillio company show distinct similarities to the products from the Birkenstock company.</p>
<pre>
    °   The prime interest of both companies is the market for comfortable footwear.
</pre>
<pre>
    °   The Birkenstock know-how, based on the more than 225 years history, is fully
         available to the Papillio company for the development and production of their
         product line.
</pre>
<pre>
    °   Both companies use the modern production facilities in St. Katharinen, Steinau, 
         Schoenbach or  Bernstadt to produce their products.
</pre>
<pre>
    °   Both companies use the excellent service from the L+L Lieferservice
         und Logistik GmbH.
</pre>
<p>At the same time, these quality factors have contributed to decades of building the good reputation of the BIRKENSTOCK® trademark. To emphasize this common product quality, the Birkenstock company has given us permission to use the BIRKENSTOCK® trademark . Of course there is strict limitations for using the trademark and there is reimbursement for the use of the trademark. When we or you use the BIRKENSTOCK® trademark close adherence to these limitations as described in a contract between the companies must be followed. This will insure that there is no conflict with the competition and marketing laws. For this reason we ask you to observe the following points, in your advertising, in your decorations and in your sales. This is for your protection, failure to do so could result in legal action from a competitor for misleading advertisement and unfair competition, because you are offering a Papillio product under the BIRKENSTOCK® trademark.</p>
<pre>
   The use of the trademark BIRKENSTOCK® serves as a smaller reference trademark, 
   ( e.g.    a Seal of  Approval or  additional information) for our main trademark, Papillio. 
   The use of the Birkenstock trademark is limited to the following expressions: 
   “Original BIRKENSTOCK® Footbed” or 
   “Licensed by     BIRKENSTOCK®”. 
   Any other expression with the trademark is not allowed. The sole use of  
   “BIRKENSTOCK®” is not allowed.
</pre>
<pre>
   The BIRKENSTOCK® trademark can only be used in combination with our main 
    trademark  when BIRKENSTOCK® is used it may be no greater than 10% of the area of   
    the main trademark, and the visual impression should not exceed this 10% limit.
    (Area =  the smallest rectangle that encloses the letters of the trademark, graphic elements
    and the registration symbol ® are not included in this area.)
   
    The 10% term “BIRKENSTOCK®”, must not be emphasized in any manner. All the letters
    in the trademark must be from the same type face, have the same type size, and be printed
    in black and/or blue.  Also when the allowed expressions mentioned above are used in
    promotion material, they may not be emphasized in any manner.
</pre>
<pre>
   The use of the BIRKENSTOCK® trademark in brochures, advertising etc, is limited to  
   released licensed items., and must be clearly separated from non – licensed items. Failure   
   to make a clear separation of the items  is a  violation of the trademark and competition  
   laws, and the company Birkenstock or a competitor could take legal action.
</pre>
<p>Each distributor for Papillio-Schuh GmbH has the duty to inform his customers of these rules.</p>
<p>We hope that this information has explained the special relationship between Papillio and Birkenstock. It is important that you observe the rules concerning the use of the two trademarks. In doing so you will comply with the contracts and avoid possible consequences from violating the competition- and trademark laws. This serves not only to the success of the two companies, it also satisfies our common customers.</p>
