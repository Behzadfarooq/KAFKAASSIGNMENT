	    <p>I have two questions regarding this entry:</p>
<p>1) When did it become a "U.S. tradition" that any child born to parents owing alligance to another country is an American citizen?</p>
<p>2) When did the United States choose to recognize Jus soli?</p>
<p>I am positive from my research that from 1791-1946 that allegiance to the Constitution is what defined American citizenship. Many of the the narrative stories of New York Italian, Irish and Polish immigrants from 1900-1930 speak of being born in NYC and gaining citizenship years later when their parents had become naturalized.</p>
<dl>
<dd>At least as far back as 1830, when the US Supreme Court decided Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor's Snug Harbour in City of New York, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 99 (1830) which tried to settle whether a child born in NYC in approximately 1776 was a US citizen, or a British citizen. If John Inglis was born with New York City while it was under US control, then he was a US citizen, if on the other hand he was born while the city was under British control, then he was a British citizen. Unfortunately there was no proof as to when Inglis was born, and the court could not find enough evidence to decide one way or the other. His father was a staunch Royalist, and removed Inglis to England when the British Troops abandoned the city. It was determined that his father had made a choice for him, and that he as an adult had never done anything to counteract that choice, and had spent his adult life living as a British citizen, thus he could not very well claim US citizenship. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 02:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me that the answer to #1 is that national allegiances owed by either or both parents (to whatever extent those allegiances might be known or knowable with certainty) do not bear under current U.S. legal tradition on the question of whether or not a child has a valid claim to U.S. citizenship. <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~becraft/Inglis.htm|" class="external text" title="http://home.hiwaay.net/~becraft/Inglis.htm|" rel="nofollow"><i>Inglis</i></a> does speak of parental allegiances, but that case involved a legal environment present within a critical timeframe during the U.S. revolutionary war. I think that the answer to #2 is July 9, 1868 -- the ratification date of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_74cf.html" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. -- <a href="../../../w/t/m/User%7EWtmitchell_bec3.html" title="User:Wtmitchell">Boracay Bill</a> 03:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._v._Wong_Kim_Ark_6e1c.html" title="U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark">U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark</a>, the Supreme Court said that <i>jus soli</i> in the U.S. had been inherited as part of English common law. The 14th Amendment entrenched <i>jus soli</i> but didn't start it. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichwales_1fa0.html" title="User:Richwales">Richwales</a> 05:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This revision added a block of text which had been moved from <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States_be7f.html" title="Illegal immigration to the United States">Illegal immigration to the United States</a> into the <b>Congressional actions</b> section of this page. The added text is not a good fit with the writing style elsewhere on this page, does not relate well to the section where it was placed, in some places repeats points made elsewhere on the page, in some places seems to conflict with points made elsewhere on the page, and in some places seems to make points which are at least implicitly POV (IMO, of course - See the diffs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Birthright_citizenship_in_the_United_States_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106707633" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Birthright_citizenship_in_the_United_States_of_America&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106707633" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Barring objection, I propose deletion of the text added by this revision. Comments? Objections? -- <a href="../../../w/t/m/User%7EWtmitchell_bec3.html" title="User:Wtmitchell">Boracay Bill</a></p>

<dd>I'm particularly concerned about the portion of the new text which talks about whether <i><a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._v._Wong_Kim_Ark_6e1c.html" title="U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark">U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark</a></i> does or doesn't apply to US-born children of illegal aliens. Although some do admittedly argue that the Supreme Court majority in <i>Wong Kim Ark</i> went out of their way to highlight his parents' status as legal US residents and did not intend their ruling to apply to children of illegal immigrants, an argument can be made that the court majority was simply trying to make it clear that Wong's parents were not diplomats or any other sort of official representative of the Chinese emperor, but were simply ordinary people (and thus unquestionably subject to US jurisdiction). The Supreme Court's later ruling in <i><a href="../../../p/l/y/Plyler_v._Doe_2d6c.html" title="Plyler v. Doe">Plyler v. Doe</a></i> seems to reinforce this interpretation. If the block of text in question is kept, I would feel a need to rework this portion for NPOV. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichwales_1fa0.html" title="User:Richwales">Richwales</a> 19:13, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
