<dd>Good point (although the "in any regard" seems overstated)! The validity of the comparison is not really the issue here, however. This assertion is so widely made that I think that it merits a mention if only to debunk it.

<dd>How about "Birmingham has a large number of waterways, and is often described as having 'more canals than <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>'. This is technically correct - however, the city is far larger than Venice, which has the highest concentration of waterways in the world."

<dd>Italicisaton is a form of emphasis, but less so than <b>emboldening</b>. I understand "dab" to mean a small change. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 17:30, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for the explanation. I can see why I was confused. I read "dab" as a contraction of "disambiguation".

<dd>Correct, in wikipedia, 'dab' is usually the shoirt form for disambiguation, usually with a link.

<p>Andy, I don't know exactly how the 3 revert rule works, so I won't report it, but you must be teetering on the edge of it now, I make it at least 4 times you've reverted that canals sentence, possibly 5, in the last 24 hours. I hid it with a note asking to please explain what 'The type of waterway is very different' means if you have to have it in there. A link to <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterway.html" title="Waterway">waterway</a> doesn't help. I still don't know what you mean when you say the canals are very different. A canal is a canal.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Punch Records</span></h2>
<p>Can I just say that I recently created an article on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punch_Records_9356.html" title="Punch Records">Punch Records</a> which is an excellent example of an urban workshop for street art at ground roots level which caters for people who would not otherwise get an oportunity to follow their chosen path of urban dance, art and music. I personally know several of the entertainers and they are definately unique in Brum, from dance to dj mixing, MC'ing and record producing, even the Council have picked up on what they offer. I couldn't help noticing that as soon as I had created the article user Andy Mabbett disputed the articles validity on wikipedia without even looking into what Punch is about. I filled in more detail and pointed out that Puch has remained in the eductaion section of Brum main page for months, I then went back to the main article and made live the link to Puch records. Needless to say that after I had pointed this out to Andy I notice that someone has now removed Puch Records from the education section, any clues anyone?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Music Comparisons</span></h2>
<p>Andy Mabbett is the only instigator in ensuring that the comparison to Liverpool and Manchester remains on the main popular music page. We have already seen an anonymous user add further Manchester related hype, as I predicted this is a target for vandalism, Manchester has had only one main music scene of any prominence named after it which resulted in bands such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Stone_Roses_19be.html" title="The Stone Roses">The Stone Roses</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Mondays_fd45.html" title="Happy Mondays">Happy Mondays</a> etc, Liverpool obviously had the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> and Birmingham had the Brum Beat which brought to light musicians like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Plant_39e6.html" title="Robert Plant">Robert Plant</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bonham_df1b.html" title="John Bonham">John Bonham</a> of <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Winwood_8b89.html" title="Stevie Winwood">Stevie Winwood</a> of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_%28band%29.html" title="Traffic (band)">Traffic</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_Davis_Group_b9b2.html" title="Spencer Davis Group">Spencer Davis Group</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Move_8060.html" title="The Move">The Move</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sabbath_9b9c.html" title="Black Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Light_Orchestra_bf45.html" title="Electric Light Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> and so on, why do we need any comparison to anywhere else? Does Leeds have a similar thing on their page? or Glasgow? and I also see that the Manchester article remains extremely hyped, would Andy Mabbett like to go and purify everything there? Birmingham has had many brilliant and successful bands and musicians just like Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol etc.. etc.. etc.. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 14:25, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Er… I too support/have supported the inclusion of a reference to Liverpool's Merseybeat here because that is the immediate inspiration of the Brumbeat tag. The <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> music section opens "Though not as prolific as its neighbours Manchester and Liverpool across the Pennines, or indeed Sheffield in South Yorkshire, Leeds has still produced some notable bands." The <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> article does not mention music in any detail. If you have a problem with the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> article, you should express that concern at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManchester_6d3e.html" title="Talk:Manchester">Talk:Manchester</a>.

<dd>I recently wrote an article for virtual brum <a href="http://www.virtualbrum.co.uk/music/" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualbrum.co.uk/music/" rel="nofollow">here</a> on the city's music scene, I know it's hyped and someone here could probably do a better job etc, anyway I did some research and the city had a large rock scene well before beatlemania, the two cities were evolving equally with many bands and musicians being inspired by the US rock &amp; roll scene, the fact that the Beatles stood out initially could be argued that they had the right marketing and backing which allowed them to later evolve into one of the most creative bands to date, thats just my opinion of course. When you look at it Brum has actually had many famous bands and musicians although during the past decade successful new brum bands have been thin on the ground, I can think only of Dodgy, Ocean Colour Scene, The streets and Jamelia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is what seemed to remain (roughly?) for some time - <i>"As with Liverpool and Manchester Birmingham has produced many notable bands and musicians."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or what about "Although the city is sometimes overlooked, Birmingham has produced many notable bands and musicians, as with Liverpool and Manchester."</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Led Zeppelin again</span></h2>
<p>Led Zeppelin originally consisted of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Plant_39e6.html" title="Robert Plant">Robert Plant</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bonham_df1b.html" title="John Bonham">John Bonham</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Dreja_1d44.html" title="Chris Dreja">Chris Dreja</a> (later to be replaced by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_Jones_%28musician%29_5f44.html" title="John Paul Jones (musician)">John Paul Jones</a>).</p>
<p>Robert Plant and John Bonham started off their musical carreers in local Birmingham bands, like for instance <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_of_Joy_d812.html" title="The Band of Joy">The Band of Joy</a>. They were recruited from the Birmingham scene by Page on the advice of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Reid_133e.html" title="Terry Reid">Terry Reid</a>, some reports suggest that the band first met in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walsall.html" title="Walsall">Walsall</a>. Page had also played in a BrumBeat band (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carter-Lewis_And_The_Southerners_82d1.html" title="Carter-Lewis And The Southerners">Carter-Lewis And The Southerners</a>) shortly before forming Led Zeppelin. So the reason for including Led Zeppelin reference is quite clear, half of the band formed out of the Brum Beat scene, personally I think that deserves a mention especially when you consider how many people cite Led Zeppelin as one of the greatest rock bands to walk this earth to date. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 14:25, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Andy: Before each of my posts on this subject I "read the preceeding discussion of this amtter, on this very page". I can find nothing pertinent in <a href="#Led_Zepellin" title="">#Led Zepellin</a> (where you made no comments). I then looked at <a href="#More_deletions" title="">#More deletions</a> where I found that you replied to Nick's request (at 5 July 2005 23:23 (UTC)) for an explanation of why you deleted his "inclusion of a new band and reference to Jimmy Page in his early years in a Brum band" with "For the reason stated in my edit summary. <b>If you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will, do not submit it.</b>." Your edit summary had read: "rv. too specifc for main page". When Nick put a less detailed mention of Led Zeppelin ("<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Plant_39e6.html" title="Robert Plant">Robert Plant</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bonham_df1b.html" title="John Bonham">John Bonham</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a> were all members of Birmingham Rock bands before forming <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>.") on the page you deleted it with the summary: "rm detail; restore cpomparson - see talk and edit summaries passim ad nauseum". I find it hard to see how the sentence can have less detail without becoming meaningless. You described "Three of the four members of <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> played in Birmingham rock bands." as "exagerated trivia". In the <a href="#More_deletions" title="">#More deletions</a> section above I asked you why "the Birmingham associations of Led Zep [are] any more trivial than [those of the Move, the Moody Blues, the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Light_Orchestra_bf45.html" title="Electric Light Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizzard.html" title="Wizzard">Wizzard</a>.] You replied that "The Move and Idle Race were Birmingham based, with all or nearly all members from Birmingham. ELO played up their Birmingham connections, writing songs about the City. The bands referred to in connection with Led Zep may have had some members from Birmingham, but there is no evidence that they were Birmingham-centric." We had already mentioned Band of Joy (which I understand to have been a Birmingham band); they are described as a Birmingham band in all the sources I can find about them. Nick then asked you "how do any of us know that Robert Plant and John Bonham were specifically not <i>Birmingham-centric</i>?" You did not reply. When Nick raised the issue again a month later you said "I'm still waiting for some evidence (as opposed to hearsay, from cut&amp;paste biographies or fan sites) that Led Zep had any noteworthy Birmingham roots." You have said that you seek evidence that Led Zep's members were "Birmingham-centric"; Again, I will answer that they played in Birmingham-based bands. I see this as adequate Birmingham-centricity. Since you appear to favour terse responses I repeat my yes/no question: Do you dispute that Band of Joy were a Birmingham band? —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 15:15, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All that I am suggesting is that Three of the members of Led Zeppelin performed in Brummie bands that were either formed in Brum or formed by Brummies, surely this must have had some impact on their musical styles (especially in Plant and Bonhams case) prior to their contributions to Zep. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 16:17, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy</a>, the discussion on the talk page above is in favour of retaining the <b>fact</b> that members of Led Zeppelin formerly played in 'Brum Beat' bands.</p>

<dd>It does not explicitly state that they were a Birmingham-based band. It is a book about rock/pop music in 1960s Birmingham. It describes Band of Joy playing in Birmingham. It does not mention them playing elsewhere, but that would be outside its scope. So, although one can reasonably infer that the band was Birmingham-based, it is not explicit and I deduce that you seek an unequivocal statement. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 17:19, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andy: I wish I could tell when/whether you are joking. I laughed aloud at this, thinking that you were just having a bit of fun. On reflection, however, I realise that you may be serious.

<p>Here is a great example of Robert Plant describing Birmingham as his home town:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"-During the last tour with Jimmy Page we played in exiting cities like Bucharest, Prague, Zagreb and Itanbul. But Bergen has, after what I am told, always been supportive to the good musical traditions. Besides, I have for a long time been a friend with the boys of Big Time Playboys, who come from my hometown Birmingham. They have been a lot to Bergen and have boasted of Ole Blues , says Plant on the telephone from Birmingham."</i> taken from <a href="http://pablo.pernot.free.fr/interview_plant27avril2000.php" class="external text" title="http://pablo.pernot.free.fr/interview_plant27avril2000.php" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Reid recommended Plant, who in turn suggested John Bonham, drummer for his old Birmingham group, Band of Joy."</i> taken from <a href="http://trublukris.tripod.com/inter/review.html" class="external text" title="http://trublukris.tripod.com/inter/review.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"His early influences included traditional blues artists such as Robert Johnson and Sonny Boy Williamson. As he became more involved in the Birmingham music scene he found many other sources of inspiration, such as jazz, soul and West Indian rhythms."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"Robert found a more settled home when he joined the Birmingham-based Band of Joy. The band went through several changes of personnel, but the best incarnation featured John Bonham on drums and Kevyn Gammond on guitar."</i> taken from <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~liden/rp_bio.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>"After hearing of Pages' intention of starting a new band, vocalist Terry Reid suggested he hear Robert Plant. When Page got a chance to check Plant out, Jimmy not only ended up liking his voice, but also his stage presence. Plant, in turn, suggested they recruit John Bonham, the drummer of his old Birmingham group, Band of Joy."</i> taken from <small><i>[link to copyvio website removed]</i></small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Despite their relative youth, Gift were regulars on the Birmingham circuit, playing on bills with all the best-known Brummie bands of the time, such as The Move, Idle Race, Trapeze, and Robert Plant’s Band Of Joy. In the latter’s case, Plant would slip them 20 quid for the loan of their far superior P.A. system, something the impoverished band were unlikely to knock back! Birmingham was a hotbed of musical talent, as Eddie related: "There were so many great musicians around the area at that time. The nights that we weren’t gigging, we would always go somewhere to watch a band, and most bands knew each other. It was a really good friendly atmosphere, not competitive at all."</i> Who the heck are <a href="http://www.blackfootsue.com/bfsbiog.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.blackfootsue.com/bfsbiog.htm" rel="nofollow">Blackfoot sue?</a></li>

Wikipedia is not a democracy,. and a small majority does not outweigh teh need for objectivity. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 11:42, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right, Andy. <s>Applying the same level of rigid scrutiny, please respond to my requests for evidence in the section below, or I will reluctantly - yet objectively - have to remove your unsubstantiated claims.</s> Additionally, while Wikipedia is indeed <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a democracy, an 80% consensus to retain this one piddling sentence is persuasive. I'm sure all editors here are trying to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on your part, but your <a href="../../../d/b/a/WP%7EDBAD_2716.html" title="WP:DBAD">attitude</a> is not helping. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 12:11, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hold on there, Proto! While I find it funny when you parody Andy's extreme behaviour, I do not think it appropriate for any of us to start acting as he does. Andy seems to be convinced of the righteousness of all his acts. I do not think that any of us can tell when he is joking and I think that we should all assume that he is dead serious all the time (not because this is likely to be true but because it is the least damaging way to deal with someone who has difficulty with amiguity and tolerance). Extreme behaviour like deleting his unsourced additions may only confirm his view that his similar actions are legitimate and it may distress him. Increasing the group's distress seems unconstructive to me. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 17:03, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I tactfully withdraw my request for Andy's additions to be sourced. I think I'll stay away from the Birmingham page for a while, as I don't want to get into anything non-constructive.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Providing evidence</span></h2>
<p>Hi Andy. I find it admirable that you require this amount of rigorous scrutiny of sources. With that in mind - please could you provide evidence, in the form of an official, recognised website and/or (preferably and) a print source for the following statements you have contributed to the article.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Although its music scene is not as renowned as those of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a></i>. Unsubstantiated. Please provide citations.</li>
<li><i>The city is at the centre of a large <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_area.html" title="Metropolitan area">metropolitan area</a>, defined by the government as the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28county%29_3cb5.html" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands county</a> (with a population of nearly 2,600,000), but in practice including parts of the surrounding counties of <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shropshire.html" title="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwickshire.html" title="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire.html" title="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>.</i> Is it? Provide official citations, please.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lodge_eb09.html" title="David Lodge">David Lodge</a></i>. IS he associated with Birmingham? Please substantiate this claim.</li>
<li><i>Birmingham's is also notable for its canal system</i>. Is it? Please substantiate this claim.</li>
<li><i>The type of <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterway.html" title="Waterway">waterway</a> is also very different, with those in Venice being the short reinforced channels of the islands on which it is built.</i>. Is this true? I'd like to see some verifiable sources before I believe it to be encyclopaedic.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are plenty more I'd like to see you substantiate with fully verifiable and official sources, as opposed to <i>hearsay, from cut&amp;paste biographies or fan sites</i>, but these will do for a start. Please provide substantial evidence for them all. Thanks Andy. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 16:14, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's unreasonable to ask a contributor to provide evidence for statements that are common knowledge or which can be verified with a basic Internet search. Items 1 and 4, at least, are common knowledge. A number of websites describe Birmingham as Britain's "canal city". <a href="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0017898.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0017898.html" rel="nofollow">Here is an encyclopedic one</a>. For 3 simply Google "David Lodge" and "Birmingham". For 5 see <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, though admittedly this description could be improved. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantavira_6f6b.html" title="User:Shantavira">Shantavira</a> 18:01, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Er…Proto was making a rhetorical point about Andy's own intensive request for sources. (Hey, Proto, do you feel bad about causing some innocent bystander to waste their time? Very big grin, indeed!). —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 19:36, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
