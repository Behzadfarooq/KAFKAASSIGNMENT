<p>First of all, allow me thank you for your support. I meant to write this earlier, but I was simply exhausted after dealing with all the bs (btw, someone is desperately wanting to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114795330" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114795330" rel="nofollow">fly up to the Sun</a>, a fact that, I hope, can only lead to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANick&amp;diff=114790835&amp;oldid=114788330" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANick&amp;diff=114790835&amp;oldid=114788330" rel="nofollow">tearing feathers</a>). I guess I should have picked up on evidence of <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumpen_proletariat.html" title="Lumpen proletariat">Bonapartism</a> when Hizkiah or whatever "his name" was lectured me on his years-long experience as a wikipedian, despite having his account created in December...</p>
<p>Also, no sweat on the Tâmpa issue - btw, much of it can be sourced from <a href="http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2001/current6/mi40.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2001/current6/mi40.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>As for your main topic: Exquisite Idea. I was pondering it back in the day when I was the only one who cared about such topics, but it seemed that I was reaching to high at that moment. Now we are just about ready to look into it closer. There are a few issues I would amend, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would use "labo[u]r movement in Romania" over "Romanian" (sometimes, vaguer is better)</li>
<li>I would not turn all those strikes into articles, at least for now - many of them may never get close to FA status, and we could detail them in the "Labor" article for starters (or, indeed, for ever). For example, Rakovsky's strikes, and even the Bucharest shinding in 1918 could easily form paragraphs in the new article (pending their own articles, or just sitting there). I would also not create a "Romania during the Depression", since that would be vague and would lead to clutter - instead, I would (in the future) focus on major events in the "Kingdom of Romania" or "Greater Romania" articles (we still haven't decided on how to relate those to the History series), and outline them in the "Labor" article. In the latter, I would divide the Depression period into two sections, and "mainarticle" one to Lupeni, the other to Griviţa (with overviews of additional events - and, yes, a clear need for expansion in the latter). I would also prefer topical articles on the unions themselves, if such a thing is feasible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff that I would add to your overview (not a complete review, just what I can think of right now), and stuff that we would need to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps a look into radical projects of the cărbunari, to see how much of them fits the topic of the article (as a "prehistory" - no, not under that title, but reflecting that idea)</li>
<li>early unionism (the really early ones - late 1800s) and details on ideological background (bound to be interesting, but likely undersourced)</li>
<li>the Potemkin episode and the claims made by Rakovsky in relation to its outcome (very interesting stuff)</li>
<li>the Transylvanian Soc Dems negotiating with the PNR over labor rights as a prerequisite for the Union (also investigation into the status of <a href="../../../i/o/a/Ioan_Fluera%C5%9F_393c.html" title="Ioan Flueraş">Ioan Flueraş</a> and Enea Grapini as labor activists during that time)</li>
<li>National Liberal repression (a term grossly misused by the communists, but still applicable) in the early 1900s and early 1920s</li>
<li>Galaction's testimonies about the early 1920s</li>
<li>Jewish affiliation to Labor Zionism</li>
<li>the PCR and PSDR spitting at each other during the interwar (Frunză also adds detail on the link between PSDR and labor)</li>
<li>precisely what the main trade unions of the interwar where and their history (Cristescu fits in there somehow), and the cool but friendly relations allegedly kept by Ghelerter/Popovici/Cristescu and the PCR during the strikes (flimsy material so far, but I'll see if I can find out more)</li>
<li>I'm quite surprised you missed these: Pancu's violent "alternative" to unionism, Corpul Muncitoresc Legionar, Stelescu's left turn, and Manoilescu's rants about corporatism (with their Legionary connections)</li>
<li>Carol's strict corporatism (with Flueraş as leader)</li>
<li>the PCR "uniting" unions (all the way to the UGSR)</li>
<li>SLOMR</li>
<li>Braşov Rebellion</li>
<li>the Civic Alliance in relation to the unions</li>
<li>Mineriads (or, at least, those that had labor aspects)</li>
<li>other post-1990 strikes</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I'd say we've got a long way to go, but it's feasible. Oh, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nicolae_Tonitza" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nicolae_Tonitza" rel="nofollow">some pictures</a> are available (though I'm guessing you've seen them). My collection of Magazin Istoric has an amazing number of PD socialist kitsch from the early labor movement (like the goddess of Liberty handing down a copy of Das Kapital to a bearded worker).

<p>Well, I say we put the Great Depression subarticle on hold (I don't object to it, but I want to see it fit in the overall history, and us concentrating on these things one at a time - or to let the format guide us, if you will). It is also a headache, because we have hundreds of articles to link it to, and we'd best start at some other point and move on from there - consolidation of the Greater Romania and Kingdom articles as a priority in this respect. On the main topic: I'll finish some stuff myself, and then I'll look into this a little bit more.

<p>I will write in romanian it's about small changes in that article where he put a text that has nothing to do with that context: Ai adaugat o fraza stearsa pentru care de câtva vreme mă tot lupt să o şterg. În primu rând contextul în care îi introdusă îi aiurea înainte era vorba de atestarea documentară a localităţii din 1276 după care se zice de o nouă perioadă în care apare pomenită localitatea în 1502, iar tu introduci textu despre Trianon din 1918 între. În plus că textul îi tendenţios, da se pare că ţie nu îţi pare, deşi dacă te uiţi la istoria modificarilor chiar şi maghiarii îs de aceaşi parere.

<p>I just nominated the Hungarians' article for DYK.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Next time we do this, I think we should pick similar topics to each other. (As soon as we magyarok started arguing about historical interpretations and rightful kings, I immediately thought "damn those crafty Romanians, they gave us a controversial article on purpose! They know us too well!" LOL) Anyway, what do you know about folk music? We don't have a satisfactory article on Hungarian folk music and I doubt there is one on Romanian folk music.....then afterwards we can all collaborate on Music of Transylvania.&#160;:))) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

Only you could <i>enjoy</i> seeing a crowd of drunken hooligans spoil the memory of 1848. And yes, as you have noticed, my Hungarian is absolutely atrocious. I had the misfortune of being born in the United States and nobody in my family speaks Hungarian anymore, so I've been starting from scratch. Teaching myself, by the way. I have never taken any language lessons or classes in Hungarian because there AREN'T any where I live.</p>
<p>Contests just between you and Alensha? Sure, go to it. Exclude the stupid little külföldi. I'm sorry if I'm a little grumpy right now but I'm having a terrible time in my language studies right now (i.e. I'm making absolutely zero progress) and every time I'm reminded that I cannot speak the language of the country that my heart burns for, I feel pretty rotten. (me and Franz Liszt...the poor guy.)</p>
<p>For future contests, actually, it might be better to have the focus be on article <i>creation</i>, rather than strict translation. The ends justifying the means and all that good stuff--it shouldn't really matter <i>how</i> the article gets on EnWiki, just that it <i>does</i>. I'd be happy to work on Kodály, whether for a contest or not. Let me know if you like my folk music idea, because if it's not going to be a contest, I'll probably just start the article on my own. I could save it for a contest if you want.</p>
<p>Anyway, now we just have to wait and see: who gets to watch the other team write something embarrassing on their user pages?! <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 21:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Chicago? I wish! I'm from a much smaller city on the edge of, shall we say, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Plains_5aee.html" title="Great Plains">American Puszta</a>. I have only met one other Hungarian here and I hardly ever see her. Thanks for your advice and the links, though. I'll be moving to a bigger city (don't know which one yet) in the fall when I enter conservatory, so I'll probably have better luck then.</p>
<p>OK, so maybe a <i>few</i> of the hooligans were actual Arrow Crossers, but I'm 100% sure that most of them were just your basic skinhead thugs and football hooligans--their leader is a guy called "Tomcat", for heaven's sake. <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

<p>LOL, nice work with the tiny yellow message.&#160;:) That is a good site! Looks like the English version is still under construction but between the lot of us we could mine the magyar version pretty thoroughly. I agree that our coverage of that period is pretty weak--I'm planning to focus more on 1848 for a while though. Actually I'm taking off for a few days, or at least will be contributing in reduced capacity, because I've somehow gotten into several very unpleasant exchanges over the last few days and I need a short break to get some perspective. (If I stick around and fight, I'll likely just blow my top and get blocked.) So szia later, ♠♣♥♦, be back soon.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

<p>Hi! Sorry for being so silent, but I have had a lot to do and I kind of just did what you asked without saying a word about it to you or anyone else. Fortunately you noticed the article on the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trial_of_the_149.html" title="Trial of the 149">Trial of the 149</a> yourself. Now I have done also the article on the insurgency of 1924, but it needs a lot of editing as I did it fairly quickly and I make a lot of mistakes in articles. So feel free to edit and correct my text any way you consider necessary. I noticed that Andres had also started to work on this article, so I tried to keep most of his text you had already edited and just to add what I had done.

<p>Haha, alright, Béla Lugosi, have your fun, you get to gloat for a week. Actually, although I'm none too fond of the exact way Trianon turned out and the nasty dealings leading up to it, I'm not really much of an irredentist--mind you, I wouldn't outright <i>refuse</i> a little sliver of south Slovakia and some of the more Hungarian parts of Erdély if they were offered on a golden platter, but I'm not losing sleep over it or anything.&#160;:) You already know I want some sort of autonomy for the Székely, but beyond that I think messing with the current borders would be WAY too much trouble for any potential gain. And of course I support the right of the Slovaks and whoever to have their own countries, I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Liberal_nationalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism#Liberal_nationalism" rel="nofollow">liberal nationalist</a> by philosophy anyway, it goes with the, erm, territory.&#160;:) They just did a terribly sloppy job of drawing the borders! <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

<p>Oh believe me, though I'm not especially religious, I have plenty of cheesy blood-and-soil, mystical, romantic, generally over-the-top 19th-century symphonic poem, Nemzeti dal, sword-of-Attila and turul-bird etc. kind of patriotic fervor as well.&#160;:) It's fun, and I've always had perhaps too much fondness for the various banners and trappings of overblown patriotism--no matter how liberal, pacifist and anti-fascist I may be, God knows I can't help but thrill at the sight of a regiment of hussars in full dress uniform riding ceremonially by, I get tears in my eyes when writing/reading about 1956 and the early days of 1848, I've always been big on national holidays, ceremonial commemorations, etc., I could go on and on but I'm sure you get the point.&#160;:) Last Thursday (March 15) I leaped out of bed much earlier than I can usually muster and proceeded to fervently recite the <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemzeti_dal.html" title="Nemzeti dal">Nemzeti dal</a> from the top of the stairs (by which I accomplished nothing but scaring the bejesus out of my cat.) So you and I may have more in common than we think, except the obvious glaring difference....&#160;;)</p>
<p>As for reading something in Romanian--I can already decipher some things in Romanian, given its similarity to Latin and French (neither of which I actually know but I've sort of absorbed them through the ambient culture.) I'll take a look at that article later and see if I can make heads or tails of it....<a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K.

<dd>Cioroianu actually has an entire chapter about his death, and he may mention it there (I think he was cremated as well, and I'm pretty sure he was the main attraction inside the Tineretului Park monument). I'd rather not check it now, if you don't mind - I'm pretty tired, and will rather just resume myself to more relaxing activities, such as talking to you. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Btw, the cremation article is quality. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:49, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great work on Labiş - I'll work on it from my side some time in the following days. Btw, this was a dilemma for me: most sources will indicate that he was a communist by convictions, and that he was on the left wing of opponents to the regime. I think he is due for inclusion in both the communists category and list (although I don't think he ever did join the party; he was nonetheless a rather prominent member of the UTC, and you may want to include him among the notable members in the UTC article). VT has some interesting insight on this. Anyways, something tells me you should expect someone else to come visit bearing tags... See you tomorrow. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 03:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I'm going to let you down: Cioroianu does not mention cremation, and merely uses vague words that could mean just anything ("înmormântat"). It's amazing that it is not indicated anywhere in a chapter on how he died, especially since part of it is almost reportage-like. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As if it wasn't complicated enough: as of today, Tăriceanu replaced Ungureanu as foreign minister. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The funniest thing is that I thought you emailed Cioroianu to ask him how he feels about Tăriceanu replacing Ungureanu&#160;:) - it only later dawned on me what you meant. (Btw, did you check out <a href="http://cioroianu.ro/index.html" class="external text" title="http://cioroianu.ro/index.html" rel="nofollow">his site</a>? It is rather amusing - all empty but for the weird personality cult.) Unfortunately, I haven't read Petreu, but I believe you when you say the book is good.</p>
<p>About the "relations": that style of articles seems like overkill to me, but I could live with and contribute to a series; nevertheless, at this stage in Romanian coverage they seem like luxury (plus, you know how much I hate stubs...).</p>
<p>An issue related to the Cabinet: should the PM/FM infoboxes list, under "political party", all parties the person was a member of, or just the one he belonged to while in office? (I would say "he or she", but we both know that is yet to happen...)</p>
<p>Rather than use the article on Malaxa, I would use the sources it uses (it anyway does seem to have been partly copy-pasted). But, yeah, it's something. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:32, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what I figured. I was also thinking that, if we were to go with more parties, the infobox on Argetoianu would have been destined to become its own article. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:13, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I meant to answer earlier, but did not have as much time time as I wanted to, and simply wondered aimlessly on wiki when I did have time.</p>
<p>On the peasantry issue: while it is hard not to mention at least some peasant revolts (due to their impact on organized labor), I think it would be a stretch to extend the article to them. Instead, I propose we focus on informing on the generic issues of the peasantry in three articles: the one on 1907, the one on Greater Romania, and a future one on Poporanism (I suppose more recent stuff can fit into "Economy of Romania" and its subordinates).</p>
<p>Oh, btw: my emphasis on reliable sources in relation to the Soviet occupation article was not aimed at either you or Turgidson, but some guys I had to deal with on related issues (well, you know...); hopefully, one will not have to deal with Gomaisms and Tricolorul. Now, since a certain someone is watching my every move, this may have sown the seed for the usual type of disruption on that page as well... <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:00, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. On your first comment, there is one more reason to go with your second over the first version: anybody can argue against the title, nobody could argue against the sources (also, I'm not actually sure if all sources would agree that it was a de facto occupation in, say, 1953-57, while they may all agree that it was one in 1944-19something). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed you invited a lot of people to the discussion. However some of them previously expressed some anti-russian sentiments while others are openly anti-communist (thus anti-sovietic). Don't you think you should invite some Russians too (as Russia received the Soviet Union's seat in the UN)&#160;? They could present the Soviet POV. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 20:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You've just attacked the entire Russian nation. Should i mention this to them when i invite them to the discussion?<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 20:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, the absolutist russia exploiting its peasants (better said serfs) and the few proletarians in its almost non-existent industry, not to mention non-ethnic russians... <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 20:32, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
