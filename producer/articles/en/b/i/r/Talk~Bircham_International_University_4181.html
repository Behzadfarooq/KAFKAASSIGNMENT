<p>I am enclosing the Help Desk Complaint AIS mentions above. Particularly given <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> concerns, I think it's important that we take a careful look at Bircham's arguments and try to address them in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> manner. From a quick read of the complaint, Bircham's CEO appears to be arguing:</p>
<ol>
<li>That while it is absolutely true that Bircham is "unaccredited," it is not a degree mill. (Or, to present it differently, that Bircham denies that it is a degree mill and has successfully convinced various reporters, such as Oregon, to remove it from the "degree mill" list and move it to the "unaccredited" list);</li>
<li>That under Spanish law, unaccredited schools and "non official degrees" are accepted without the stigma applied to those schools in the West.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know how valid those objections are at this time, but someone should certainly take a look at them. I will ask Mr. Miller for additional sources that meet <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, but in the meantime, if someone could make an effort to address Bircham's concerns as neutrally and fairly as possible, they'd be a superstar. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 19:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Message follows:</b></p>
<p>Dear Wikipedia,</p>
<p>We have recently found your definition about Bircham International University. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bircham_International_University" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bircham_International_University" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bircham_International_University</a> The definition currently posted is inaccurate, incomplete and misleading. I suggest that this definition is updated with a most accurate and precise content. First I will propose the definition and then I will provide the references and proofs in order to support the inaccurate leads detected. I thank you in advance for your time and I hope that you reconsider that this incorrect definition is quite damaging for our institution and it does not honor the commitment to accuracy and truth from an Encyclopedia</p>
<p>CORRECT DEFINITION ABOUT BIU:</p>
<p>Bircham International University is an independent institution of higher education that offers degree programs through distance learning for the adult professional student. BIU is a non accredited institution according to the USA accreditation standards (CHEA) and a provider of non formal higher education according to the Spanish Law. Its unaccredited degrees may not be acceptable to employers or other institutions, and the use of its degree titles may be restricted or illegal in some jurisdictions, such as the States of Oregon, Maine or Texas.</p>
<p><br />
INACCURATE DATA ARGUMENTS AND PROOFS</p>
<p>I also ask that any reference to Diploma Mill or Fraudulent school are taken away from the definition for the reasons, arguments and proofs provided below.</p>
<p>AACRAO AND SOME STATES CLASSIFICATION OF BIU</p>
<p>The Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization listed BIU as a degree mill in the past. BIU provided documentation and a review conducted by Alan Contreras from the Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization any negative definition of BIU was deleted. It is though listed correctly as not accredited school with no further comments, except an “F” which means Foreign institution. <a href="http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html" class="external free" title="http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html</a></p>
<p>AACRAO <a href="http://www.aacrao.org/international/consulting.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.aacrao.org/international/consulting.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacrao.org/international/consulting.cfm</a> conducted a simple review of BIU legal status that lead to the incorrect statement posted by the State of Maine and Texas. The Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization who required this evaluation from AACRAO did not post the statement “Bircham is not accredited and it not authorized by the Spanish government” because it was explained to them by BIU. After detecting the the Wikipedia definition, BIU has taken the actions to get the Maine and Texas sites corrected the same way the Oregon Office did. We do not know how long this will take. First we have presented the same documents and proofs provided in this email to AACRAO who is the institution used by different States organism to verify foreign institutions. I understand that posing an inaccurate question or addressing the incorrect department in Spain may have lead AACRAO to this conclusion. Allow me to clarify that there are two types of higher education in Spain:</p>
<p>1. Formal Education leading to officially recognized degrees is monitored by the corresponding departments of education that ensure that the programs curriculum meet the standards set forth by the Ministry of Education. Completion of such homologated programs leads to an official degree.</p>
<p>2. Non-Formal Education (Educación no reglada) leading to non officially recognized degrees is monitored by the corresponding departments of consumer affairs that ensure consumer protection and quality of instruction delivery. Non formal education programs do not follow the Ministry of Education programs curriculum standards. Non formal education provides much more freedom in the program curriculum. Degrees granted after completion of non formal programs leads to a non official degree.</p>
<p>Bircham International University is a provider of non formal education and as such no further authorization form the Ministry of Education is required. The Ministry and Departments of Consumer Affairs monitors that BIU programs clearly state the non formal nature of the programs offered and the quality of instruction delivered. In 2004 a law was specifically approved on this regard. Before this law there was a disperse collection of norms and directives that could have lead the person conducting the AACRAO evaluation to the inaccurate and false conclusions stated above.</p>
<p>The applicable law is Decreto 84/2004 de 13 de Mayo. Enseñanza General. Quoting the law. It applies to private institutions that offer non formal education leading to non official degrees (...“los centros privados que imparten enseñanzas no dirigidas a las obtención de un título con validez oficial”...) You may read this law directly from <a href="http://gestiona.madrid.org/wleg/servlet/Servidor?opcion=VerHtml&amp;idnorma=3480&amp;word=S&amp;wordperfect=N&amp;pdf=S" class="external free" title="http://gestiona.madrid.org/wleg/servlet/Servidor?opcion=VerHtml&amp;idnorma=3480&amp;word=S&amp;wordperfect=N&amp;pdf=S" rel="nofollow">http://gestiona.madrid.org/wleg/servlet/Servidor?opcion=VerHtml&amp;idnorma=3480&amp;word=S&amp;wordperfect=N&amp;pdf=S</a> You may also verify other related laws at: <a href="http://gestiona.madrid.org/wleg/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://gestiona.madrid.org/wleg/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gestiona.madrid.org/wleg/index.htm</a></p>
<p>Then you should download the PDF Documents called BIU Legal Docs and BIU Recognition on the top part of this link <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/</a> This should provide documentary proof that neither AACRAO nor the States of Maine or Texas ever looked at while the Oregon State did look at. <a href="http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html" class="external free" title="http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.html</a></p>
<p>The PDF called BIU Legal Docs provides copies of the following documents and much more:</p>
<p>- Copy of the Official Registrar of Companies authorizing the name Bircham International University College and the purpose of the company (objeto social): Higher education. - Copy of the Economic Activity License under paragraph 932.2 (Professional Education and Improvement) - Copy of the Office license for the activity Higher Professional Education - Copy of a certificate from the Spain National Distance Learning Association (ANCED) stating the european residents may legally work in Europe with a non official degree granted by BIU. - Copy of the Consumer Affairs Quality Seal granted by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs that guarantees that BIU meets the regulations set forth by the law Decreto 84/2004 de 13 de Mayo. Enseñanza General. mentioned above.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>BEING NOT ACCREDITED IS NOT EQAL TO BEING A DIPLOMA MILL</p>
<p>BIU may be listed as a non accredited school but this is not equivalent to be defined as a fraudulent institution or diploma mill. Quoting Wikipedia definition of unaccredited institutions “According to the United States Department of Education, it is possible for postsecondary educational institutions and programs to elect not to seek accreditation but nevertheless provide a quality postsecondary education” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_accreditation" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_accreditation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_accreditation</a></p>
<p>You are also welcome to visit BIU website at <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/</a> to gather for more information and find out if BIU meets the criteria to be classified as a diploma Mill. BIU is NOT a Diploma Mill. A diploma mill is an institution of higher education that grants degrees without ensuring that students are properly qualified. The following aspects will allow you to properly differentiate BIU from a Diploma Mill or any questionable school. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_mill" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_mill" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_mill</a></p>
<p>1. Legality: A diploma mill does not provide clear references about its legal status or authority to grant degrees. BIU does. Sometimes the school is based in countries that lack of any regulations in matter of education such as several Caribbean countries, some nations from Africa, or some States from the USA (Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Montana). A diploma mill often operates from another country through PO BOX addresses. Visit the About BIU section of BIU web for further explanations of BIU legal references. You may also download copies of BIU Legal Docs from the PDF Download area. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/aboutbiu/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/aboutbiu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/aboutbiu/</a></p>
<p>2. Contact offices: A diploma mill does not usually provide a physical or verifiable contact address or telephone. Any international structure is not real or just a group of commercial agents. There are no offices to visit or to call during office hours. BIU provides real addresses with real offices that may be visiet on working hours. Visit the BIU Offices to know worldwide contact details. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/contactabiu.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/contactabiu.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/contactabiu.html</a></p>
<p>3. Admission &amp; Fees. A diploma mill does not have a real admission process. Anybody is usually admitted into any degree program offered. Fees are negotiable and there is usually no criteria or regulations regarding any transfer of credits from previous education and professional experience. A diploma mill never offers a refund policy nor enforces any students rights or consumer protection. Visit the Admission section of BIU web to learn about our admission requirements, student rights and refund policy. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/adm.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/adm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/adm.html</a></p>
<p>4. Academic support. A diploma mill does not have a list of academics and staff. If there is a list, there will be no description of their educational qualifications. No detailed information about the content of the academic program is provided accurately or in detail. No learning methodology and teacher tutoring or counseling is available. There is never any academic feedback about any work submitted to the institution. Visit the Who We Are section of BIU web to know BIU Staff and academics. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/</a> You may also download the Study Guide from the PDF Download area. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/</a></p>
<p>5. Recognition. A diploma mill does not provide clear information about recognition and accreditation. Any reference to third party accreditors is misleading, not sound and not verifiable. There is never a consumer protection guarantee such as the one that BIU provides. Visit the About BIU section of this web for further explanations of BIU recognition. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/aboutbiu/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/aboutbiu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/aboutbiu/</a> You may also download copies of BIU Recognition from the PDF Download area. <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/pdfdownload/</a></p>
<p>BIU is NOT a Diploma Mill. BIU web provides clear arguments against these issues. If you wish to verify further about any issue do not hesitate to ask or request additional documents.</p>
<p><br />
CITYLINK ARTICLE “Bircham International University was referred to by a former DipScam federal agent as a degree mill.[2]” <a href="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" class="external free" title="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html</a></p>
<p>This article deals with several diploma mills and the whole business around it. It mentions BIU once through the opinion of one former BIU student. She was granted admission into BIU on 4/11/2003. She was assigned to do several reports on several textbooks that she never submitted. On 10/27/2003 she request to withdraw from the program. BIU sent the corresponding Refund Form according to the student rights and refund policy.She never submitted any academic work so she ca not provide an accurate opinion about BIU programs of study. The Citylink article then provides a comment about Deric Bircham without even bothering to verify if Deric Bircham credentials are good or not. Deric Bircham full and detailed Biodata is available upon request. A short summary of the academic part of his background (The honors are not included here) may be read at <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/</a> Academic Board</p>
<p>BIU lawyers have contacted Citylink magazine in the past in order to demand a correction of this references. The answer from Citylink magazine and Jim Di Paola the wirter is that the article only express an opinion. If Wikipedia considers that an article of opinion is a fact, then we also request that the following references about BIU are added to the definition of BIU provided by Wikipedia. This definitions are factual references and not mere opinions:</p>

<p>QUACKWATCH Lists BIU as questionable non-accredited school Wikipedia provides a very accurate definition of Quackwatch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackwatch" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackwatch" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackwatch</a> BIU presented a report with all the course contents of our Natural Health Sciences programs for their review and evaluation. It is true that there is a lot of quackery in the Health Sciences Business but it is also true that there are good professionals and schools. I just refer the related links provided above. Quoting the answer received from Stephen Barrett, M.D. should be enough to prove the partial and obsesive personal war of this person has against all Natural Health Sciences. The question then is why Wikipedia considers such references as valid references for the definition of an academic institution.</p>
<p>Stephen Barrett, M.D. Email received on 02/12/03:</p>
<p>“I have been to your Web site, which, by the way, is one of the most poorly functional sites I have ever seen. The fact that you have a PhD program that offers to convey expert knowledge of iridology, homeopathy, and several other pseudosciences is enough for me to conclude that you teach nonsense. Sorry, but that's how I feel.”</p>

<p><br />
Finally I want to thank you again for taking your time to get to the end of our request and kindly ask you to modify the definition of BIU as suggested. Do not hesitate to contact me at willy@bircham.edu if any additional information or dicuments are required. I have provided quick internet references to support BIU arguments but of course additional documents are available. I did not want though to overload this email with an excess of documents.</p>

<dd>Hello,</dd>
</dl>
<p>After reading the legislation and your complaint I do not understand what you object to. The article says it not accredited and it doesn't appear that is debatable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Feel free to add material to the article. Claims about academic quality should be sourced with independent material of the school itself. Note that a listing by the <i>American Association of Drugless Practitioners</i> does not validate anything. That group is not recognized by any government agency and has a lot of criticism for its questionable practices. Moreover, it is associated with dubious institutions like <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton_College_of_Natural_Health_4c32.html" title="Clayton College of Natural Health">Clayton College of Natural Health</a>.</li>
<li>According to the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/list_data/s-nw.html#Spain" class="external text" title="http://www.unesco.org/iau/onlinedatabases/list_data/s-nw.html#Spain" rel="nofollow">list</a> <a href="../../../i/a/u/IAU_Universities_List_8aaf.html" title="IAU Universities List">IAU Universities List</a> for Spain its not accredited.</li>
<li>The State of <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> says its not accredited nor can it issue Spanish degrees.<a href="http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> A federal agent says this a diploma mill. <b>Wikipedia is not making the claim</b> it is quoting an expert who is. I suggest you contact the person who made the claim. As of now it is a reliable source about the school and should be included.</li>
<li>Texas says Bircham has "No degree-granting authority from Spain (AACRAO evaluation".<a href="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/AAR/PrivateInstitutions/fraudnotx.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/AAR/PrivateInstitutions/fraudnotx.cfm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>According to <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> it is not accredited nor can it issue Spanish degrees.<a href="http://www.state.me.us/education/highered/Non-Accredited/an-bu.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.me.us/education/highered/Non-Accredited/an-bu.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, you have three US states saying it is not accredited, one former federal agent/education expert, and a international body confirming the article.</p>
<p>I suggest you contact those three states with proof of the ability to issue degrees. If they remove Bircham from their unaccredited/unacceptable lists so will wikipedia. Contact the magazine, if they amend their claims so will wikipeia.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 07:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>One of your claims must be addressed. Above you wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CITYLINK ARTICLE “Bircham International University was referred to by a former DipScam federal agent as a degree mill.[2]” <a href="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" class="external free" title="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html</a> This article deals with several diploma mills and the whole business around it. It mentions BIU once through the opinion of one former BIU student (Hullender). Michelle Moultrie Hullender was granted admission into BIU on 4/11/2003. She was assigned to do several reports on several textbooks that she never submitted. On 10/27/2003 she request to withdraw from the program. BIU sent the corresponding Refund Form according to the student rights and refund policy. Michelle Moultrie Hullender never submitted any academic work so she ca not provide an accurate opinion about BIU programs of study. The Citylink article then provides a comment about Deric Bircham without even bothering to verify if Deric Bircham credentials are good or not. Deric Bircham full and detailed Biodata is available upon request. A short summary of the academic part of his background (The honors are not included here) may be read at <a href="http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/" class="external free" title="http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bircham.edu/english/graduados/</a> Academic Board</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hullender isn't cited in the wikipedia article and I find your release of her personal information/attendence on wikipedia to be entirely inappropriate. The relevant portion is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<b>It’s pure hokum</b>,” says <b>Allen Ezell</b> with a laugh, <b>about Bircham</b>. An undetectably forged diploma in surgery from Harvard Medical School — down to the holographic seal — hangs above Ezell’s desk in his Tampa office. But Ezell is no fraud — the diploma is a memento from his years running the FBI’s diploma-mill task force, <a href="../../../d/i/p/DipScam_ff9d.html" title="DipScam">DipScam</a>. Although <b>he retired from the FBI in 1996</b>, Ezell has watched the number of diploma mills skyrocket, thanks to spam e-mailing. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded in November 2002 that selling substandard degrees is a $200 million industry. “Sometimes, it is the piece of paper that opens the door, not the actual knowledge,” Ezell says of the diploma mills’ clientele. “Fake degrees are being used everywhere.”<a href="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citylinkmagazine.com/archives/101503coverstory.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you feel the former FBI agent is incorrect about Bircham contact him. Wikipedia cannot change his words. On the other hand this expert should be cited in the article as he is familiar with the subject. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 07:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to John Bear, Bircham was founded in 1992 in the United Kingdom as Oxford International University. (Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning. Ten Speed Press. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-58008-431-1</a>. page 206, 207) If you have an amazon.com account you can preview that book, and search its pages for "Bircham" to see the reference. According to the State of Maine "Oxford International University" is a "Degree mill. No connection to legitimate Oxford University in Great Britain."<a href="http://www.maine.gov/education/highered/Non-Accredited/na-ox.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maine.gov/education/highered/Non-Accredited/na-ox.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 08:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have re-grouped the material, though not changed it--now the three US state references are together in a single paragraph.We would be glad to add one (or more) outside (3rd party) quotable statement from a published reliable source to balance the article; if you know of any, please add them to the article or to the talk page. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></p>

<p>as a previous editor stated, our concerns about use of names of living people extends to the talk pages. I have removed the name of one of the many subjects of the City Link Magazine's article, because there is inadequate basis for even saying she enrolled in this school without additional confirmation beyond a single newspaper report. She was not quoted in that article. Several other people were, but we wouldn't insert their names here either. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></p>

<dd>For example, you said they are approved by American Association of Drugless Practitioners. This group has no status with any accreditation/educational agency.
