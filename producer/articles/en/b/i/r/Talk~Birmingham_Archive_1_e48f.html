<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nick Drake</span></h2>
<p>Nick drake was not born in Birmingham, as this page says, but Burma! can this fact be removed? See <a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/tealeafer/biography.html" class="external free" title="http://www3.sympatico.ca/tealeafer/biography.html" rel="nofollow">http://www3.sympatico.ca/tealeafer/biography.html</a></p>
<p>I see what you are saying, i originally included Nick Drake not as being born in Bham as i already knew but as being brought up in between Redditch and Brum which is true, he spent time in the City but of course Tanworth isn't Birmingham. Birmingham is the closest recognisable place to Tanworth, and so people can use the city to geographically locate Tanworth in Arden, which in fairness is a much lesser known place. Why don't we rephrase it to say, 'Nick Drake grew up in Tanworth in Arden 4 miles south of Birmingham'? or keep it as is but remove the 'born' bit which is wrong!</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Birmingham is home to three professional football (soccer) teams: Aston Villa, Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>My 1995 Birmingham A-Z marks the Birmingham-Sandwell boundary as passing just east of The Hawthorns, putting the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C._795b.html" title="West Bromwich Albion F.C.">Baggies</a> just outside the formal limits of Birmingham. Is this still the case? Is Birmingham really home to WBA, or do they belong to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Country_1da1.html" title="Black Country">Black Country</a>? --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wolverhampton</span></h2>
<p>Speaking of boundaries, isn't Wolverhampton in the Black Country, thus making 'Birmingham along with the neighbo[u]ring city of Wolverhampton and the Black Country' a tautologous phrasing? majabl</p>
<p>I hate to point this out but Wolverhampton is a city in it's own right, and West Bromwich is a town in it's own right, and neither are a part of Birmingham. Thus the Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich albion links dont belong here. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 17:27 8 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's true, though to be fair it did say (my emphasis): "Birmingham <i>and its surrounding area</i> is home to five... " (and it still did after you'd taken Wolves, Baggies and Walsall out). --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Wolverhampton per se isn't part of the Black Country, although areas added to the city in 1966 are, such as Bilston.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More canals than...</span></h2>
<p>Re: more canals more parkland and more trees etc.</p>
<p>The usual litany goes something like: "more canals than <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, more parks than <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, more trees per head of population than <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Keynes_e083.html" title="Milton Keynes">Milton Keynes</a>; and the Number 50 is the most regular bus route in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>".</p>
<p>It is easily extended thus: "more <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Issue_d0d7.html" title="Big Issue">Big Issue</a> sellers than <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a>, more traffic circles than <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, more wrongly-convicted IRA bombers than <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guildford.html" title="Guildford">Guildford</a>".</p>

<dd>I was the one that originally included the inevitable Venice comment, at the time I found a webpage that some guy with plenty of time has put together which 'proved' the statement from OS maps... sadly it seems to have disappeared from google so I can't add it as a source.&#160;:( <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 08:51, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)

<dd>No sooner do I type that than think of a better search term and get a hit on the first page. The page was this one: <a href="http://jquarter.members.beeb.net/walk6x.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://jquarter.members.beeb.net/walk6x.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 08:54, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hate it when people say about there being more canals than venice in Brum, i never say this in fear of being ridiculed as it is a bit miss-leading but the canals in the city are extremely popular with tourists and i think that they are a valuble asset to the city seeing there is no large river.</p>

<p>Andy I dont want to fall out with you, you are a valuable contributor. I am not opposed to sub-headings I dont think that short one or two sentence paragraphs deserve their own sub-heading, there is such a thing as overuse of sub-headings.</p>

<li>Very much, thank you:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Headers also help make an article clearer and determine the table of contents, see Wikipedia:Section. Since headers are hierarchical, and some people set their user preferences to number them, you should start with ==Header== and follow it with ===Subheader===, ====Subsubheader====, and so forth. Yes, the ==Header== is awfully big in some browsers, but that can be fixed in the future with a style sheet more easily than a nonhierarchical article structure can be fixed.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the subheadings thing here: I have no objection to subheadings in general, they are very useful. But in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html#Transport" title="Birmingham">this particular case</a>, I think the text would flow nicely without subheadings, the contents page would be a bit more compact, and we could have a more open discussion of Birmingham's transport system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the "Transport" section does gets long enough to <i>require</i> subheadings, then we should split it up at that point. So how about this as a proposal to resolve this (admittedly trivial) conflict: We bring the transport section under the one header ("Transport") for now, and develop it as we see fit -- it will surely develop beyond what's there -- and then, in a month or so, we will see whether or not it requires subheadings. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Francis_c89a.html" title="User:Sam Francis">Sam</a> 23:17, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Transport section</span></h3>
<p>I suggest we try and move on from the debate about subheadings and focus on making the "transport" section of this article as good as it can be. It is currently lacking information about bus services, among other things.</p>
<p>Having looked at a number of other city articles (eg. <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>) and the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cities_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities</a> page (which makes no mention of transport), I think it's obvious there is no standard approach to transport sections of city articles yet. So maybe we can start here by suggesting a general structure: most of the good articles I looked at listed <i>Public transport</i> as a header, then some listed <i>Roads</i> etc. Another interesting one to note is the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> article, which, due to its unique transport situation, has a "transportation" section which mainly discusses the canals, then mentions an airport. Thoughts? And any comments on the structure I just introduced in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html#Transport" title="Birmingham">the article</a>? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Francis_c89a.html" title="User:Sam Francis">Sam</a> 18:39, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Birmingham is not the second-largest city in the UK; it is, I think, the largest - the city of London has only a few thousand people. That would be a pretty misleading thing to say, though. You could include Greater London but that would be bad on two counts; (a) It's factually inaccurate as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a> is not a city, and (b) If you're including Greater London, it would be arbitrary to exclude <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Manchester_23f4.html" title="Greater Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, which is larger than Birmingham.

<dd>I don't mind what figures we use as long as we use the same figures throughout the encyclopedia consistently.

<p>Apparently the 2001 census was a bit of a cock-up and has been widely criticised. Several cities have had their populations undercounted, on some occasions by tens of thousands. So the 2001 results for Birmingham are hard to believe.</p>

<dd>Cause' Birmingham in England is the largest and most linked to place called Birmingham, and it is wikipedia convention that the most well known place of a particular name should have the namespace to itself, and provide links to other places of that name. If we were to do as you say then we would have to do the same with <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> etc etc. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 00:55, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Beware the 70s, 80s and 90s! Follow the links and you will see that they are not the same as the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. --rbrwrˆ</p>

<p>I changed the bit about the fictitious characters in the Archers visiting Birmingham, to the fact that the actors themselves live in and around Birmingham. However, the original writer might have been trying to make a point that they visit Birmingham <i>in the story</i>, which would be reasonable, since it is set in the Midlands. However, it seems to me that either statement is quite unremarkable, not to say obvious, and this sentence could be dropped. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantavira_6f6b.html" title="User:Shantavira">Shantavira</a> 07:10, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>The term "Birmingham" is extremely important to it's inhabitants as it is part of the City's sense of pride.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure this makes sense. Why would the word be anything to do with a sense of pride?</dd>

<p><i>It is often said that "you can always tell a Brummie, but you can't tell him much". "You can never put a good Brummie down" these sayings probably originated from the trenches of the first world war.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think these phrases are well known enough to warrant being in the article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:34, Apr 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The Birmingham Triennial Music Festival took place from 1784 - 1912 and was considered the grandest of its kind throughout Britain. Music was written for the festival by Mendelssohn, Gounod, Sullivan, Dvorak, Bantock and most notably Elgar, who wrote four of his most famous choral pieces for Birmingham.</i></p>
<p>Erm, who was Bantock, since there doesn't seem to be an article for him? Is it supposed to be Bartok, by any chance? -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 23:10, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, you are right, now changed and indeed there is already an article on Bartok. Nick</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transport, History and Economy</span></h2>
<p>I think that a brief run down of Brum history could be kept on the main page with a link to the wider facts, the economy should be kept where it is and transport and most definately Government should have a seperate page, lets keep this interesting.</p>
