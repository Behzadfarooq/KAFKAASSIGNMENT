<td align="center"><b>Birthday Committee Bulletin Board</b></td>
<td align="left" width="100%">
<p>I just have a few general announcements for all BDC members.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I will be going on a Wikibreak from June 13 to Semptember 10. I really hate being gone for that long, and have to choose someone else to run the committee for those few months. I've asked <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Turcotte_9ec1.html" title="User:Mr. Turcotte">Mr. Turcotte</a>, and he agreed to it, and knows who to ask next if he changes his mind.</li>
<li>Second, I've decided to make some membership requirements. They're pretty easy to comply to, so pretty much anyone who asks will get in. New members now need 100 edits, to have not been blocked at all over the last 3 months, and to not have been blocked for anymore than 48 hours total since joining the site.</li>
<li>If you still haven't posted your birthday on the project page, please do so. There are still a few of you that haven't. It's not a huge priority, so don't worry about it if you can't.</li>
<li>Fourth, I've changed the rules for new birthday templates. You only need my approval if the template is drastically different from the ones already existing. (Just to be clear, <b>I realize I have no right to dictate which templates you can make and keep. However, only the ones I approve will appear on the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Wikipedia%7EBirthday_Committee_865c.html" title="Wikipedia:Birthday Committee">Wikipedia:Birthday Committee</a> page.</b></li>
<li>We have a new member: <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem">ConDem</a>.</li>
<li>I've noticed that while a lot of the people on the Esperanza calendar are getting messages from you guys, the people on the MediaWiki listing aren't getting a lot. Be sure to cover as many people as you can in one day, and remember that you can always write belated messages. (I'll get working on a belated birthday template, unless someone else wanted to.)</li>
<li>If you'd like, you may post on this bulletin board. It's found on <a href="../../../b/d/c/Template%7EBDC_Bulletin_1_3088.html" title="Template:BDC Bulletin 1">Template:BDC Bulletin 1</a>. You may use it to suggest new policy changes, or anything else you think is too important to only go on the talk page. Sign all announcements that you add.</li>
<li>Thank you to <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeMoney_583b.html" title="User:GeorgeMoney">GeorgeMoney</a> for helping out with all of the templates. (Which, I might add, were his idea in the first place.)</li>
<li>Happy Birthday to <a href="../../../t/d/x/User%7ETdxiang_efc6.html" title="User:Tdxiang">tdxiang!!</a></li>
<li>Be looking for birthday-related images. We need more than the few we're using.</li>
<li>The 5th Happy Birthday Template is now available.</li>
<li>Since the creation of the 1st template, 32 members have gotten birthday messages from us. That's not really a lot when you think about it, but it's a pretty good percentage of the people who have listed their birthdays on the listings that we search.</li>

<td align="left" width="100%"><b>I just have a few general announcements to make to all members of the <a href="../../../b/d/c/WP%7EBDC_1b71.html" title="WP:BDC">Birthday Commitee</a>:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>First, I will be going on a Wikibreak from June 13 to Semptember 10. I really hate being gone for that long, and have to choose someone else to run the committee for those few months. I've asked <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Turcotte_9ec1.html" title="User:Mr. Turcotte">Mr. Turcotte</a>, and he agreed to it, and knows who to ask next if he changes his mind.</b></li>
<li><b>Second, I've decided to make some membership requirements. They're pretty easy to comply to, so pretty much anyone who asks will get in. New members now need 100 edits, to have not been blocked at all over the last 3 months, and to not have been blocked for anymore than 48 hours total since joining the site.</b></li>
<li><b>Third, if you still haven't posted your birthday on the project page, please do so.</b></li>
<li>Fourth, if you'd like to make some new "Happy Birthday Templates," feel free to do so, but I'd like to see and approve/disapprove of all of them first. I'll probably say yes to all of them, though.</li>
<li>Fifth, the <a href="../../../b/d/c/WP%7EBDC_1b71.html" title="WP:BDC">WP:BDC</a> project page needs to be cleaned-up a little. I'll get working on that, but if anyone else has changes they want to make, feel free.</li>
<li>Finally, we need a new template to welcome new members with. If I have time, I'll do it. Please use the name "<a href="../../../b/i/r/Template%7EBirthday_Welcome_6300.html" title="Template:Birthday Welcome">Template:Birthday Welcome</a>" for it.</li>
