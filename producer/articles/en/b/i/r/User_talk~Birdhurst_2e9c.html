<p>Hello birdhurst, Thank you for picking up the Peninsula error (peninsular is the adjective of course). However, I would prefer that the fish lengths be left as centimetres. They are more understandable than the very high mm values. Most other fish lengths are in cms (sometimes metres for large ones) . Also, in your change for Hemerocoetes macrophthalmus you seem to have used a letter 'o' instead of a zero.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamBould_7835.html" title="User:GrahamBould">GrahamBould</a> 19:19, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Birdhurst. Thanks for your proofread of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Hauptbahnhof_fb4d.html" title="Berlin Hauptbahnhof">Berlin Hauptbahnhof</a>. However, please note that "mainline," rather than "main line" is correct in a railway context and is used in this manner elsewhere on Wikipedia, notably in <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_terminology.html" title="Rail terminology">Rail terminology</a>. Also, the question of the translation of <i>Hauptbahnhof</i> has already been discussed on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBerlin_Hauptbahnhof_fa65.html" title="Talk:Berlin Hauptbahnhof">Talk:Berlin Hauptbahnhof</a> itself. (While "Main Station" may be more literal, many translators prefer "Central Station," as it is a more common term in English, and we agreed to avoid the issue). It wouldn't hurt to have a look at the article discussion in future to see if your questions have been addressed.

<p>Hi—Saw your copy-editing of the O-Bahn article. Nice. And you're interested in music, too, with reference to the Brain article, I notice.</p>
<p>If you're inclined, the Featured Article Candidate room (<a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>) desperately needs good editors to critique the continual advance of poorly written articles into the ranks of the featured.</p>
<p>You'd be most welcome to drop in occasionally, or more often, to help to raise the standards; it's a hard battle at the moment.</p>

<p>Hello, I hear that you're quite the copyeditor. I was wondering if you could help out at the <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijani_people.html" title="Azerbaijani people">Azerbaijani people</a> page? It is very close to making it as a featured article (it's in the nomination phase) and could use one final copyedit. You'd be contributed to a good cause as I wrote it and editing my own work has been time consuming and isn't a substitute for a 2nd set of eyes. Anyway, hope to see you there.

<p>I'm really bemused by your edits here.

<p>You've turned mediocre prose into lousy prose. Moreover, there's places where you've taken text that was entirely accurate ("it opened in 1859") and added in unnecessary words ("it was opened in 1859") that really do make the text sound like it was written by an ESL student. Frankly, I'm not sure whether you're being careless, or whether you really don't know better. If it's the former, then please take more care in future, but if it's the latter, I really suggest you think twice about engaging in copyediting on the English project. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 10:19, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your copy-editing of this page was most welcome. Thank you. I have however changed one sentence. Your alteration of the last word in the sentence "The former northern terminus at King William Street tube station was problematic due to its lack of capacity, a difficult approach curve and its alignment making it impossible to extend the line north." has been altered by me to "...impossible to extend the line from this point."</p>
<p>Although the line was eventually extended to the north, this was not part of the original plan and an extension could have been proposed in any direction. The line was actually facing east and it may have made sense to have continued it in that direction. Unfortunately it was completely boxed in by buildings on two sides and the Monument on the other. This meant that an extension in any direction (not just north) was out of the question.</p>

<p>I've seen your so-called 'copyediting' before; you haven't improved many of the articles you've changed. Linking every date is not an improvement (you've linked '2006' repeatedly throughout the article), and neither is removing detail from the wording. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 05:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"an article that's clearly had a lot of time and energy devoted to it." The hours spent writing it are mine; I spent my time researching and writing that article. If you're going to 'copyedit', do not link every date and don't alter the meaning of the text. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 06:02, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Repeated linking of '2006' doesn't help; and, if I'm reading correctly, those are instructions on how dates are organised (February 17 rather than 17 February) rather than explicit linking instructions: the dates that are linked to are completely irrelevant to the article. 'L-shaped track' is correct; there are no rails, (such a term has not been used to describe the track in any of my sources) there are two peices of L-shaped track. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 06:23, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Birdhurst, I see in your copy editing of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrow_gauge.html" title="Narrow gauge">Narrow gauge</a> you have hyphenated most occurrences of the terms "narrow gauge", "standard gauge" and "broad gauge". I have reverted these. Virtually every reference book, including most of those cited in the article, do not hyphenate these terms and your hyphenation of the terms where used as Wikilinks broke those links. In general it is not a good idea to change the standard usage of terms like this in an article without first discussing the proposed change in the article's talk page.

<dd>Thanks, what you say makes sense. I think in this case the term "narrow gauge" should be used as a complete term as this is the common practice.

<p>Hi Birdhurst - ignoring our spat about dates for the moment, I see that you worked on the "next station" box - are you involved with the creation of this box, or did you just do a 'drive-by' tweaking?</p>
<p>If you are involved, does this mean that we can now delete the lower three boxes (who only duplicate the one gathered box, really)? Also, would it be possible so that the box is a) alignable to the right, and wraps text? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadMaxDog_2e4c.html" title="User:MadMaxDog">MadMaxDog</a> 11:31, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good work on this article. Thanks for the corrections. The article was interesting but was in need of style editing. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerimbau1_8dcd.html" title="User:Berimbau1">Berimbau1</a> 01:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
