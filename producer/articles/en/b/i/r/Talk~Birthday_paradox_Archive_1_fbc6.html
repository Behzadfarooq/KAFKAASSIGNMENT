<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old Discussion</span></h2>
<p>I think the birthday paradox is one of those problems where you have to be careful not to run into limited precision <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floating_point.html" title="Floating point">floating point</a> problems, but I'm not sure. Anyone know? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>
<p>The problem doesn't seem to be overly sensitive to limited precision. Here's a <a href="../../../b/c/_/Bc_%28Unix%29_ec41.html" title="Bc (Unix)">bc</a> program:</p>
<pre>
for (scale = 1; scale&lt;10; scale ++){
  prod = 1
  for (i=1; prod&gt;0.5; i++) {
    prod = prod*((365-i)/365)
  }
  print "scale=",scale," i=",i, " prod=", prod, "\n"
}
</pre>
<p>(in bc, the variable scale is the number of digits used after the decimal point). The output is</p>
<pre>
scale=1 i=6 prod=.5
scale=2 i=20 prod=.48
scale=3 i=23 prod=.481
scale=4 i=23 prod=.4915
scale=5 i=23 prod=.49260
scale=6 i=23 prod=.492690
scale=7 i=23 prod=.4927016
scale=8 i=23 prod=.49270264
scale=9 i=23 prod=.492702751
</pre>
<p>which means that the correct answer i=23 is produced already with three-decimal-digit precision. The results are even better if one uses prod*(1-i/365) instead of prod*((365-i)/365). <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 20:55, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The theory behind it was described in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1938 in Zoe Emily Schnabel's <i>The estimation of the total fish population of a lake</i>, under the name of capture-recapture statistics.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure what "the theory behind" the birthday paradox is, but I'm sure that people like Pascal, Fermat, maybe even Cardano knew the formula or could have derived it with ease. They would probably have considered questions like "you throw a fair die 3 times; how likely is it that you get three different numbers?" <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 20:11, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most people find the probability of a match surprisingly high. That's why it was given the (not quite correct) name <i>birthday paradox</i>. -- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 20:24, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I believe most people have two problems with this: underestimating the number of matches that don't include themselves, and underestimating the multiplicative growth of each additional person added to the total. I imagine the thinking is similar to this: 365/2 = ~180 people will give me 50% coverage of birthdates. They disregard the fact that 180 birthdates chosen randomly are likely to have many collisions. Clearly, for 50% probability, or 23 persons, 180 is incongruous.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as I can see, the series of inequalities on the bottom of the page is wrong. The wrong step is the inequality that goes form the sum to the integral. If you actually do compute the sum (which isn't <i>that</i> hard to do), you get <span class="texhtml">1 − (<i>n</i> − 1) / 730</span>; if you evaluate the integral you get <span class="texhtml">1 − <i>n</i> / 730</span>, but <span class="texhtml">1 − (<i>n</i> − 1) / 730 &gt; 1 − <i>n</i> / 730</span>, not the other way around!</p>
<p>So perhaps the editors should either remove this part from the article or replace the &lt; by ~ (approximately equal). (Or I could be wrong; it wouldn't be the first time.)</p>
<p>But if I'm actually right, then Paul Halmos has no right to be so smug about "tools that all students of mathematics have access to"...</p>
<p>Fun,</p>
<p>Sten</p>
<dl>
<dd>If one quotes from Halmos, one should quote exactly. If Halmos got the math wrong, a separate comment should say so. I think the reasoning can be fixed fairly easily, and I would not do it by saying "approximately equal"; I would use inequalities ("&lt;" or "≤"). Unfortunately I will have to wait until tomorrow to look at Halmos' book. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 18:04, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notations for logarithms</span></h2>
<p>I'm very surprised with the very last paragraph of the article. I have mathematical education, so I'm not a "non-mathematician". I don't know about logarithms in English tradition, but in Russian `ln' stands for natural logarithm only, `lg' stands for base 10 logarithm and `log' can be a general logarithm with arbitrary base (the base is specified as index; if it is missed then the base typically doesn't matter for instance in expressions like O(log n)).</p>
<p>I think it would be just to remove the reference to "non-mathemations" as offensive. I accept that `log' can mean natural logarithm in English tradition, but I think its fair to take into account that for some (mathematically educated) people it is exactly `ln' that stands for natural logarithm.</p>

<dd>Since it's not part of the Halmos quote I won't be militant about it. If the Halmos quote had gone on a bit longer one would have seen him using "log" to mean natural log. Nowadays both "ln" and "log" are commonly understood by mathematicians to mean natural log. When Halmos wrote his autobiography, only about 20 years ago, he expressed contempt for the practice of many non-mathematicians of using "ln" rather than "log" for natural log, and said no mathematician had ever done that. By 1984, the date of publication, his claim was exaggerated. Nonetheless, it is still not unusual today to find mathematicians using "log" for natural log. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 19:59, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Direct Solution</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone know how to derive a direct solution to the birthday paradox(i.e. the way it is done on the article, the probability that it is not true is derived; then, that is subracted from one; I want to see a method to get the probability of a match without solving for the other one first). I know that the article's method is correct, but would be intrigued by the alternative solution because I attempted(and failed) to solve it that way. If someone knew it, I'd appreciate it if they posted it in the article. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> 04:58, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This method of switching to the complement is really a pretty and quite powerful trick; it's next to impossible to solve the problem without it. You'd have to distinguish between and deal separately with numerous cases: exactly one matching pair, exactly two matching pairs, exactly three matching pairs, ..., exactly one matching triple, exactly two matching triples,..., one matching quadruple,..., exactly one matching pair and one matching triple, ... etc. (and each of those cases is harder than the single case you have to solve when you switch to the complement). In the end, you'd have to do superhuman algebra to simplify your huge sum down to our tiny little formula. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 03:50, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Leap Years</span></h2>
<p>The article states the for a number of 366 or more people, the probability is 100%. But what if someone was born in Feb 29th in a leap year? Should this need a correction? Plus, how should the probability for n=366 be affected because of the probability of 1 or more people be born on a leap year?</p>

<dd>Perhaps a section on the complexities introduced by considering <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leap_year.html" title="Leap year">leap year</a> would be informative.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to exclude Paul Halmos from this article</span></h2>
<p>The entire <b>An (non-fatal) error in Halmos' argument (whose general idea is right)</b> section (and if that explanation is needed, the entire section preceeding it with the argument) is really long-winded, almost seems like original research rather than something that really belongs in an article like this one. I'm very tempted to remove both sections or at least the latter...</p>
<p>I <b>did</b> remove the C program example, though. Completely superflous. Nice programming, perhaps, but just not needed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 08:54, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be unfortunate if the section on Halmos' argument were removed. The reason why that section is there is explained in that section; why don't you attempt to say what you disagree with in that? "Original research" would be things appearing for the first time here in this article, whereas Halmos' comments were published a couple of decades ago, and the article says so, so I find this "original research" comment absurd. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:10, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, at present, that section says "one guy said this; he was slightly wrong; here is what he should have said" whereas it would be better, I think, to jump to the conclusion and present the mathematical (as opposed to numerical) view, and then explain that the analysis follows that published Halmos, but that he was slightly wrong. It seems rather unbalancing to have such as large section of the article dedicated to such a seemingly unimportant part of the topic, but perhaps I underestimate its importance? Could you explain why it <i>is</i> important? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 11:42, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i><b>"A seemingly unimportant part of the topic"??</b></i> My initial reaction is that the whole topic is unimportant except because of that section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But OK, let's look at it from the point of view of those who've never seen it before; such people do exist. The topic does have pedagogical value apart from the section that mentions Halmos. But one does not remain in that early stage of learning forever; the point of Halmos' view is that there's more to this problem than what you learned in childhood when you first saw it; there <i>is</i> such a thing as thinking mathematically, and as Halmos says, the tools involved are things that every student of mathematics should know. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 18:51, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>After writing the above I looked at the article with a view toward making that section shorter, along the following lines: I would give the fully correct argument, stating that it was an adaptation of the one from Halmos' autobiography, and quote only those parts of Halmos that say why he considers that point of view important. But the quoted paragraph of Halmos is such a beautiful example of how to write that that would not be easy. Please read Halmos' words <b>CAREFULLY</b>. If after that you don't appreciate it, I'll just diagnose you as a vulgar caveman. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 19:09, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a nice quote, and it says some important things in a clear way, but it is less about the topic of this article (the birthday paradox) and more about mathematics in general.

<p>I also find the Halmos quote, even in this "dull" version, vastly redundant, fairly obfuscated and downright showy. (I didn't even bother reading the original version.) What I don't like about it is:</p>
<p>1. It's too high in the article. If we really have to live with it, it should be made an internal or external link, or at the very least pushed at the bottom, possibly in microscopic size, as a historical/anecdotal note.</p>
<p>2. The title, and the whole section to be honest, is misleading at the very least. "Numerical" can never be opposed to "mathematical". I could accept opposing "numerical" to "analytical", but even so the section does present numerical calculations.</p>
<p>3. The section does not make it clear whether the error in the original argument is the one explained at the bottom of the section, or it has been silently corrected in the derivation.</p>
<p>4. As the last sentence points out, the section is <i>not</i> an alternative derivation of results perviously obtained, which by the way are not "numerical", but perfectly analytical. It's not about having a different view on this problem, and even less a different approach to its solution, it's about picking this problem to illustrate a perhaps interesting, but unrelated concept.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this section be more relevant in Halmos' page?</p>
<p>As an aside, people are entitled to disagree, and calling them illiterates, cavemen, and vandals because of that is not what I expect from an admin. And by the way, it's now three against one. --<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 20:31, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to PizzaMargherita's criticisms: I've changed the title of the section. However:</p>

<li>There is no error explained at the bottom of the section. The article says nothing specific about what the error was. (As you can see for yourself.) In trying to guess what you think is an error explained at the bottom of the section, I can only speculate that you read the last paragraph: <i>Halmos' derivation shows only that</i> at most <i>23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; since we don't know how sharp the given inequalities are, the argument leaves open the possibility that</i> n<i> = 22 could also work.</i> It would not have occurred to me that anyone might think that this explains any error, unless it was because of the word "However". I've deleted that word.</li>
<li>No, it would not make more sense in the page on <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Halmos_7591.html" title="Paul Halmos">Paul Halmos</a>. It's obviously not among his most important writings, and the article about him is short as it stands. When more is added, this little thing should be a long way down the queue. However, don't you think this article is better if the reader finds out something beyond what he or she learned in high school -- that this isn't necessarily <i>only</i> a secondary-school-level topic? Why limit the whole article to things that any freshman who thinks the problem through would figure out?</li>

<dd>Because Wikipedia should be complete, but also minimal. I'm sure Paul Halmos has expressend his view on many other things, not only on how the solution of the birthday problem should be taught to students (dear me, I can't believe I just wrote that). He may also have voiced concerns about <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disk_algebra.html" title="Disk algebra">Disk algebra</a> and even the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishopric_of_Salzburg_6fac.html" title="Archbishopric of Salzburg">Archbishopric of Salzburg</a>, but you don't go around the Wikipedia littering those articles with his view, do you?</dd>
<dd>Conversely, I'm pretty sure that he was not the only eminent person to have said something vaguely related to this problem. But I can't see anybody else adding those people's 2 cents to this page, do you?</dd>
<dd>As you point out, not even Paul Halmo's page would welcome this section, so I stand corrected. I'm afraid its home, if anywhere on the web, is in your private website, where you are more than welcome to have an entire page bragging about how you (think you have) discovered a mistake in Paul Halmos' reasoning.--<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 23:49, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the quotation from Halmos is a nice piece of writing, and I strongly sympathise with his point of view, but I don't think it belongs in this article in its entirety. Definitely the mathematical argument should be retained, with appropriate attribution, and in fact I think it should be moved closer to the top of the article. The only part of the quotation which is really relevant is "the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer", and I think something along these lines is definitely worth mentioning. Perhaps "The significance of the following argument is that it enables one to estimate the cut-off point without needing to perform a whole series of multiplications" or something similar instead. <a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmharvey_69fb.html" title="User:Dmharvey">Dmharvey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser_dmharvey_sig.png_96c3.html" class="image" title="Image:User_dmharvey_sig.png"><img src="../../../upload/1/13/User_dmharvey_sig.png" alt="Image:User_dmharvey_sig.png" width="18" height="21" longdesc="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser_dmharvey_sig.png_96c3.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/m/h/User_talk%7EDmharvey_4b37.html" title="User talk:Dmharvey">Talk</a> 00:25, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is ridiculous!! No, one should not put every eminent person's opinion on every subject into every article. But that is irrelevant here. Halmos' idea was (obviously!) <b>not</b> included simply because he's an eminent person who said something about this. It's included because it's relevant; it's something the reader could be expected to be glad to know, NOT about Halmos, but about the birthday paradox. As I said, it's the only part of the article that takes the math beyond the point where any secondary-school student who thinks it through would take it.

<dd>Actually, not necessarily "unrelated", but more like "inappropriate".

For instance, the first incarnation of <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database_normalization.html" title="Database normalization">Database normalization</a> was a real pickle to read: all of it was formal definitions of each normal form. As the article progressed, these formal definitions where removed, and more "layman" term explanations where replaced. This article doesn't seem to have this problem: it appears to be clear enough to the ordinary person, but it comes down to the question is the formal proof too burdensome for the purposes of an encyclopedia? — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 02:17, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Well done for identifying the two separate issues.) I think that "We would be doing many of our readers a grave disservice by leaving out Halmos's discussion" is an overstatement. Ok, I don't rule out completely that there may be a little value in the mathematical argument, but it needs a lot of work for this value to be brought out. In that sense, the title and the opening sentence don't make it clear at all what the section is all about, and (sorry to repeat myself) why it's relevant there. Why would I read it? Why would I skip it? It all sounds insipid and bombastic at the same time.

<dd>I have mixed feelings about the value of including the argument in this article. I agree with Halmos that it is an opportunity to see some interesting and valuable mathematical techniques. For example, in computational complexity theory such methods are vital; likewise in analysis. My reservations concern whether this is an appropriate place to be doing that teaching. I lean in favor of retaining the material, because I don't think it will hurt the article for a general audience, and it may help some.</dd>
<dd>That said, the exposition was a mess. Especially troubling was the mix of equalities and inequalities, and the lack of almost any explanation of the substitutions. I have rewritten the section — at the cost of more length — to try to explain what we're doing, why it's worthwhile, and to do it more cleanly. I hope the mathematicians like it, and am especially interested in PizzaMargherita's response to the rewrite. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 21:09, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Later, Halmos' error was pointed out, and various attempts were made to correct it. Except for the error I like Halmos' version even more than mine, and prefer either one over most of the intervening "fixes", which are not so appealing. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 06:31, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have time to read the review (or should I call it "preemptive strike"? ;-)) carefully at the moment. Just a few comments.
<ol>
<li>The explaination is certainly clearer now. Though at times, I think it's excessive (e.g. (e^a)^b = e^(ab)). Some of you got the idea that I find the section too advanced. It's not that, the maths is not difficult. It was just badly exposed.</li>
<li>There is considerable overlapping with the previous sections. In particular:
<ul>
<li>"Calculating the probability" would do with a more explicit mention of the fact that p and <u style="text-decoration:overline">p</u> are probabilities of two complementary events, and this should not be repeated in Halmos' section. The same symbols are used, therefore what they refer to is understood.</li>
<li>"Calculating the probability" would also do with the "product" formula of the probability <u style="text-decoration:overline">p</u>, (i.e. a non-expanded version), which should be referred to in Halmos' section.</li>
<li>The sections above are generic in <i>d</i>, why should this section not? "Because Halmos..." I don't care what Halmos originally wrote. This is the WP, not his book, and <i>we</i> are writing it. Once we say that this section is <i>adapted</i> from such and such source (and this is all we should write about it IMO), we can write all we want. And by the way, for the same reason, we should use only one form of "log/ln" across the article, no, across the WP. By the way, which convention does WP adopt, if any?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm starting to think that the same result can be readily derived by the Taylor expansion approximation of <u style="text-decoration:overline">p</u> in the "Calculating the probability section" above. In other words, the fact that the e^-(n^2-n)/2d is an upper bound of <u style="text-decoration:overline">p</u> and not only an approximation, could possibly be derived directly by looking at Taylor's series.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Points 2a, 2b and 2c are done (since I didn't hear any objections). As for point 3, it actually applies. I don't know how it escaped me for so long, but the whole argument can be explained by the 1 − x &lt; e^{−x} inequality, given the explainations of the approximation that we have already given in the first section. I find this approach to the same result (the upper bound) more direct and linear than what we have atm. I appreciate that switching to this simpler argument would get rid of most of Halmos' stuff, so please voice your opinion.</dd>

<dd>Now, what part of "I strongly object" was not clear?! Why did you ask for opinions on your proposal if you were going to ignore them? Your edit flies directly in the face of my insistence that the point is <i>not</i> merely to derive a bound. (Whether we've done it or not is irrelevant.) I'm quite serious when I ask you to state your understanding, because your behavior indicates that we are not on common ground. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 02:11, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have stated my understanding in a concise way in the version that you have removed, as well as in this talk page. I ignored your objection (the only one) because it made it clear that you had completely missed the central mathematical argument - which you may find irrelevant (your missing the argument, not the argument itself), but I do not. So you're right, we were not on common ground, but you seem to have caught up. (Out of interest, was it thanks to my explainations?) I believe that the consensus is to drop the pedagogic part and concentrate on the mathematical contents. So why using an "important inequality" like the one about the arithmetic and geometric means, when it's clearly unnecessary?</dd>
<dd>A list of things that I don't like about the section as it stands:
<ol>
<li>The title "Implications of inequalities" is too vague. The expression "upprer bound" should appear in it.</li>
<li>The opening "For variations of the birthday scenario in broader contexts, a different flavor of argument is essential." is even more vague, and IMHO redundant, as it doesn't bring in any value.</li>
<li>"The general idea is..." to find an upper bound. "If our final expression..." Our writing should be concise.</li>
<li>As I said, the arithmetic/geometric inequality can go without affecting the mathematical argument</li>
<li>If we have to have 365 instead of <i>d</i>, then we should keep "2x365", as opposed to "730". We don't like numerical stuff, remember?</li>
<li>Several explainations are so verbose they are distracting, and so detailed they are patronising. Why don't we explain the meaning of "+" in every article?</li>
<li>Use of "log" vs "ln" is inconsistent with the rest of the article. Or vice versa.</li>

<dd>Concensus is not voting, but coming to a common understanding. <i>Ignoring</i> my objection is not concensus. And if we were voting, we would not count your vote as many times as you have stated your opinion; I count about half-a-dozen voices disagreeing with you throughout this discussion, often vehemently. Most voices <i>support</i> pedagogy; it's yours that persistently opposes it. We love mathematics, we teach it, we understand the importance of the inequalities and the flavor of argument using them. Yet for that view you show only contempt. You did not respect Michael Hardy when he said it, you did not respect several other mathematicians when they said it, and you ignore me when I say "I strongly object". And by the way, I suggest you read what's been said more carefully, because I was not asking about your understanding of the derivation of the bound; I asked "Please state <i>your</i> understanding of why <i>we</i> want this section", which is another matter altogether. The correct answer is, we want it <i>for the pedagogy</i>, which is exactly the opposite of your view of the concensus. Apparently you do not respect our view, so you ignore it and substitute your own. That's not how we like to do things at Wikipedia, nor for that matter in most of the real world.</dd>
<dd>If you are willing to accept pedagogy, rather than merely deriving a bound, as a goal of the section, then we can discuss refinements; otherwise, we are wasting our time talking at cross purposes. I suggest you accept, because, frankly, the only real justification for the entire article is pedagogy. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 05:27, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"<i>Ignoring</i> my objection is not concensus." You are right, it's not. And it's not even "consensus", for that matter. It's assuming that people who have actually understood what we have decided to write about (the mathematical argument, see the title of this subsection and the quotations below), and are therefore entitled to write about it, did not have any problems with my proposal.</dd>
<dd>"I count about half-a-dozen voices disagreeing with you throughout this discussion, often vehemently." See, if they don't type I have trouble seeing and hearing them from my workstation.</dd>
<dd>"Most voices <i>support</i> pedagogy; it's yours that persistently opposes it." Intresting point of view. Who said the following? (Hint: not me.)
<ul>
<li>"I don't see any reason that this particular article should discuss pedagogy in this level of generality where most of our mathematics articles do not."</li>
<li>"I agree that Halmos is talking about pedagogy, and to that extent it is out of place, here."</li>
<li>"[the whole Halmos section] seems like original research rather than something that really belongs in an article like this one."</li>
<li>"it would be better, I think, to jump to the conclusion and present the mathematical (as opposed to numerical) view"</li>
<li>"I encourage someone to replace [the section] with a more direct proof"</li>
<li>(my favourite) "My reservations concern whether this is an appropriate place to be doing that teaching."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Rest assured that when most poeple disagree with me, I am (unlike other people) capable of recognising it and accepting it (see generalisation section below).</dd>
<dd>"You did not respect Michael Hardy when he said it". Uhm, perhaps because he showed no respect to who was opposing his view? I refer you to the beginning of this talk section.</dd>
<dd>"If you are willing to accept pedagogy, rather than merely deriving a bound, as a goal of the section, then we can discuss refinements". Most refinements (my 7 point above) can be discussed even without an agreement in this sense.</dd>

<dd>8. Another thing that I think should be mentioned ("essential" for a broader-flavoured understanding with different blah-blah-contexts in variations of arguments, or something like that) is that the formula we end up with is the same as the approximation in the previous section, which therefore is not only an approximation, but also (guess what?) an upper bound.--<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 06:17, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that Halmos' quote is doing two things at once. I agree that Halmos is talking about pedagogy, and to that extent it is out of place, here. But at the same time he is also explaining how his argument helps to provide a fuller understanding of the birthday problem, and I think this latter point is wholly relevant here. I don't really see how we can get rid of the former and keep the latter. Perhaps It might be better to remove this quote to a note at the bottom. I will be bold and do this, and see what folks think.

<dd>As far as I'm concerned, the pedagogic part should go. The aspects that are not irrelevant are inappropriate. If we want to attribute the mathematical argument above to Halmos - fine, but I wouldn't spend more than one sentence (or perhaps just a mention of the name) on that. As I said, I'll give it a go.

I agree on that part, it's awkward to carry it around, and it's evident from the formula that <i>d</i> is a parameter.

<p>I strongly object to having <i>d</i> instead of 365 in the introduction. The introduction should be completely accessible to anyone who can multiply fractions.

<dd>The introduction has been that way for some time now... you mean the introduction of the article, right? In that case, I can see where you are coming from, as I agree that we shouldn't scare people away. We could give the first formula for 365 and right after state the more general result and carry on with <i>d</i>. What do you think? I'm sure those interested won't have a lot of trouble substituting <i>d</i> with 365... not any more than understanding Taylor series truncations or the probability of complementary events. And the importance and applications of this problem have nothing to do with birthdays. That's why I think that general <i>d</i>-results will be more useful to people who land here.--<a href="../../../p/i/z/User%7EPizzaMargherita_c94c.html" title="User:PizzaMargherita">PizzaMargherita</a> 12:24, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any competent mathematician can generalize the argument from 365 to "d" easily enough themselves. The point is that this article is about the <i>birthday</i> paradox, meaning that the focus should be on 365. If PizzaMargherita wants to write another article on generalizations of this approach and their applications, that is fine with me, but changing 365 to "d" here just adds another hurdle for the interested reader. - <a href="../../../g/a/u/User%7EGauge_3e29.html" title="User:Gauge">Gauge</a> 03:21, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not correct. Under standard order of operations, subtraction and addition are at the same level. That means the order of evaluation is left to right.

<p>365 − <i>n</i> + 1 means (365 − <i>n</i>) + 1, <b>not</b> 365 − (<i>n</i> + 1). That is universally standard. What in the world is "BIDMAS"?? A programming language?

<dd>Michael, BIDMAS = Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. That's how people are often taught to evaluate expressions (maybe it's restricted to the UK?), the mistake being that division and multiplication evaluate left to right together, followed by addition and subtraction evaluate left to right together.

<dd>I've taugh math at five different universities, including one where nearly all students were academically weak and also including <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_7abc.html" title="MIT">MIT</a>, the others being somewhere in between, and I've done quite a lot of private tutoring of both academically weak and fairly gifted students, and I've never hear of BIDMAS or PEMDAS. I have heard that some people use mnemonics in attempting to learn mathematics, but I've always ignored that. One confusion I fear might happen as a result of these rule is that people might think that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/4/a/04ad4c6cdb603f347a9a031b8187b4fd.png" alt="a^{b^c}" /> means <span class="texhtml">(<i>a</i><sup><i>b</i></sup>)<sup><i>c</i></sup></span>, whereas in fact <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/4/2/34289ad585e04ba4814d938cc11aaf08.png" alt="a^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}." /> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 18:17, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, just because someone originally learned with a mnemonic device doesn't mean they will never understand the fundamental concepts. PEMDAS was useful in introducing me to order of operations. I also disagree that it will cause the error described above. On the contrary, PEMDAS is perfectly correct even when taken literally with no thought. We first notice there are no parentheses. Then, we move on to exponents. The exponent of the first power moving left to right, is b^c. Hence, we evaluate that first, getting (b^c). We then see(moving left to right) another power, a^(b^c). We evaluate that, getting the right answer. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 04:13, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, on my browser, the <i>a</i> appears (below and) to the left of the <i>b</i>, and the <i>b</i> appears (below and) to the left of the <i>c</i>. And that's how I've always seen it written.

<dd>Of course it is. Just as 3 is the base of 3^5 because is below and to the left, a is the base of a^b^c because it is below and to the left. The base is evaluated after the exponent.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion for another table</span></h2>
<p>This article could address another very common curiosity: the expected range of birthday matches for certain group sizes. To phrase it another way: present a table showing group size X and the expected collision range N to M, where the odds are even that at least N and at most M birthdates will recur among those X people. Alternately, a link to a "birthday paradox calculator" applet including this feature (among others) would be similarly useful (this is different from the current link to a Mac-OS birthday grapher application). -- <a href="../../../m/k/c/User%7EMKC_7ddf.html" title="User:MKC">Mike</a> 17:15, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Increment numPeople before or after</span></h2>
<p>A while back User:205.170.235.246 changed the empirical test so that the increment would be performed after all operations, rather than before. I reverted the edit, on the grounds that: <i>revert with reluctance: I that the increment operator is supposed to before the logic. It's a bit weird, I agree</i>. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Birthday_paradox&amp;diff=37000684&amp;oldid=36808806" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Birthday_paradox&amp;diff=37000684&amp;oldid=36808806" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, the anon has done it again.</p>
<p>So, I hacked out a quick test using PHP this way:</p>
<pre>
// append ?alt to URL to use anon's method
$days = 365;
$numPeople = 1;
$prob = 0.0;
while ($prob &lt; .5) {
    if (!isset($_GET['alt'])) $numPeople++;
    $prob = 1 - (1-$prob) * (1-($numPeople-1) / $days);
    echo "Number of people: $numPeople&lt;br /&gt;";
    echo "Prob. of same birthday: $prob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;";
    if (isset($_GET['alt'])) $numPeople++;
}
</pre>
<p>and I determined that whether or not the increment was present didn't make a difference in the final result. However, when it was at the back (anon's method), a probability when there was 1 person was given (obviously 0).</p>
<p>The reason, however, why this is weird, is because in most cases, the increment is indeed performed <i>after</i> the loop, as this <code>for</code> statement illustrates:</p>
<pre>
$days = 365;
$prob = 0.0;
for ($numPeople = 1; $prob &lt; .5; $numPeople++) {
    $prob = 1 - (1-$prob) * (1-($numPeople-1) / $days);
    echo "Number of people: $numPeople&lt;br /&gt;";
    echo "Prob. of same birthday: $prob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;";
}
</pre>
<p>We can also alleviate the aforementioned concerns by beginning the loop with $numPeople = 2, starting with the first "logical" case.</p>
<p>In the end, I am more for a solution that uses <code>for</code> rather than <code>while</code>.

<p>Whose common intuition does it contraddict?

Both of them answered the latter. In addition, <i>nobody</i> on buying 23 trading cards of a set of 365 would expect them to be all different. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 21:04, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthday_paradox.html#Binomial_distribution" title="Birthday paradox">Birthday_paradox#Binomial_distribution</a> calculation is not valid at all. While it somehow approximates the real probability, it lacks the necessary rationality:</p>
<p>1. The paradox is talking about "at least two persons may have same birthday". This includes not only pairs, but also 3 persons groups, 4 persons groups and 23 persons as well. This calculation is just considering pairs. The cumulative distribution of B(X,253,1/265) equals 1 in X=253 while forgetting all other n-groups.</p>
<p>2. The binomial distribution is just valid for independent events. These 253 possible pairs are not independent. For example for people A, B, C, ... having same birthday for pair (A,B) and (B,C) means having same day for (A,C). For instance Pr(X=252) should equals Pr(X=253) in this context while formula doesn't so. --<a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENeshatian_75ac.html" title="User:Neshatian">Neshatian</a> 11:50, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
