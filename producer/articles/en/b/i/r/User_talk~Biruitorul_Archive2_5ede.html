<p>Sorry, I do not have outgoing email where I'm at, due to a problem that I haven't solved yet, and have to resort to answering here. (It's for the same reason that I check my email rarely, so it is just now that I saw it.) Nice to make you acquaintance.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think point one is largely solved (I don't know if there are any left, but we'll eventually bump into them - unless, since they were created with titles only he would ever use, some will be alive for ever and ever as duplicates, and no one will ever see them...)</li>
<li>For real on the family relations issue? That's pretty cool, I have to say. Yes, good edits, IMO. The ones you mention as problematic aren't really, IMO - noticed the one that may be read as revisionism, but didn't read it as such; the CAR other one is too generic and brief for worries in that department, but I think it could do with clearer citations. Both of them need and can easily receive monumental expansions - the scale of what can be done is actually what prevents me from working on them yet. About the third one: I agree, it is quite pointless.</li>
<li>Thanks, man. Shall I do it, or do you want to?</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi there; you may or may not be aware that there has been excessively extensive debate as to whether the correct spelling is "Goering" or "Göring"; also between "Goebbels" or "Göbbels". Whatever you like is fine by me; the community consensus was that both were equally correct.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 23:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, different German documents seem to use both spellings at different times, but, as I say both are fine with me. Thank you for the compliment.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 23:59, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes.. and if the Americans are smart they will try to secure a base to pressure the Persians. Undoubtedly, with the new administration, India, China, and Korea will want to ensure their investments.

<p>Hello Biruitorul. I have noticed you are very good in English. I am now rewriting/creating two larger articles. Would you mind if I'd ask you for help with copyediting, grammar etc.? Thank you. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 14:35, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello. It is <a href="../../../z/a/o/Zaolzie.html" title="Zaolzie">Zaolzie</a> article. I hope you will like it.&#160;:) I have spent literally whole day rewriting and expanding it. Next larger article I plan to start is "Polish minority in the Czech Republic". Firstly I will publish it in my sandbox before moving it to the main namespace. I will start writing it in few days, I must end it till 1 January, it is my New Year resolution&#160;:) and in January I have a huge amount of learning to university. Take care and again, thank you. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 00:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, and sorry for the delay - as well as for the fact that I did not express my holiday greetings in time (don't worry about reciprocity, if you were planning to - I'm not really observant myself). I was quite pissed off at some moves on wiki that I am required to deal with, and limited my time on wiki to some stuff I wanted and some stuff I needed to do. Got back just in time to notice your excellent article on the Bărăgan deportations - thank you, we're getting closer to the larger picture.</p>
<p>To answer your question: yes, I've tried, but success was minimal (one of my cousins may have made some minor edits on rowiki, but I'm not really sure). The mail problem is actually my net provider's (or rather, the net provider considered I had a problem) - since we're all on holiday, I couldn't unfortunately solve it whether I want to or not (otherwise, my connection is through Yahoo).</p>
<p>'Nyways, if we don't hear from each other until January 1st, let me wish you a the happiest of new years. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, and thank you.</dd>
<dd>I also believe that the specific example for the Canal was the White Sea-Baltic, but I did not find any references that would say that exactly. I fully agree on the Socor issue. Since he is the only one detailing the issues, I quickly glanced over what could be added on the spot, and thought I would leave geographical details et al to you (I'm not delegating, but it seems like you have the clearest idea about where details should fit to each other, since you are planning to review the entire repressive system in an article; for example, I left out mention of the camps, as I did not know what nomenclature you wish to adopt - in case you list them, I will adopt your nomenclature as a guideline, as all change in one place is likely to need replication in a rapidly expanding number of articles).</dd>
<dd>For the "List of Transylvanians", I think any inclusions could work. IMO, there is no way in which that list could get too big; sure, let them list all regional black metal singers if they want to - the criterion for the list itself is still tight enough (unlike the "Romanians" one, destined to go on for ever). Myself, I have stopped adding to the list, and concentrate on the category (the latter is also more objective, given that it implies people had to be born in the region). If anything, we could section the list by some criterion (county, profession, ethnicity... though I'd rather not pick "ethnicity", for several reasons).</dd>
<dd>Thank you for the FA vote and the kind words.Hopefully, I'll deal with the entries inconsistencies in the near future. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thank you very much for improving Zaolzie article. I have introduced basic explanation on <i>Volksliste</i> issue there. Answering to your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Better map wouldn't be provided in near future. There are some better but not copyright free. There are also a part of books (as the current one), so it would be problem the obtain them. The current one is good that it clearly shows the border changes. It can be also introduced that a part annexed in 1938 by Poland is de facto Zaolzie territory.</li>
<li>Yes, there are and were larger and important towns. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karvin%C3%A1.html" title="Karviná">Karviná</a>, Fryštát (then town itself, now a part of the former; article still missing), <a href="../../../t/%C5%99/i/T%C5%99inec.html" title="Třinec">Třinec</a>, <a href="../../../%C4%8D/e/s/%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD_T%C4%9B%C5%A1%C3%ADn_cbd8.html" title="Český Těšín">Český Těšín</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlov%C3%A1.html" title="Orlová">Orlová</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohum%C3%ADn.html" title="Bohumín">Bohumín</a>. The most populous town was built by the communists in 1955: <a href="../../../h/a/v/Hav%C3%AD%C5%99ov.html" title="Havířov">Havířov</a>.</li>
<li>As stated in the article, the territory was mainly industrial. The vast majority of population was employed in heavy industry.</li>
<li>To the repetetiveness of "the/this area", you are right. It is because this territory shouldn't be named "Zaolzie" regarding pre-1920 issues, as it was "created" in 1920.</li>
</ol>
<p>How about adding some current photos (towns and nature)&#160;?</p>

<p>Hello there. Regarding your president and VP templates, we should always encourage enthusiastic editors, and I am particularly like those who are enthusiastic about editing Indonesia-related articles. But, it is considered poor wiki form (wikiqette?) to simply re-revert your changes without explanation after someone has removed them. Actually, I don't think your templates are bad, they have do have some value but have you noticed that there are now two templates there? The advantage of yours compared to the other one is that (1) it is a complete list and (2) it looks a whole better - more slim. The disadvantage is that does not show the chronological order that the other does (but maybe this is OK) and it doesn't show the president at the time. Unfortunately, i don't think there is place for both. I will ask a few more INdonesia editors to comment here. kind regards <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 02:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess all i am saying is that the template is good, but we can't have both. We need to choose or somehow combine (which would take some intelligence to do smoothly and technical skill). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 02:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

The pages in question seem like a borderline case. Would be great if someone merged the best aspects of both templates into a single instance.

<p>Your templates are very useless, only to clutter article pages with unnecessary boxes!!

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I saw your post on KhoiKhoi's talk page. With out diving into to great detail, please consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible that your template is an un-intended criticism of an already existing template? If so, someone worked hard on it, and perhaps they're a little offended.</li>
<li>Thank you for being bold and creating this template. Did you <i>offer</i> it to anybody before you put it in an article?</li>
<li>Please consider that there are several <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiprojects.html" title="Wikiprojects">Wikiprojects</a>. Is there a Wikiproject for Indonesia?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just three of the ideas that I have. I believe there is also a procedure for templates. Perhaps try some links at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Help%7ETemplates_3bf7.html" title="Help:Templates">Help:templates</a>.

<dd>I see. I also see that you're very experienced with templates. Consider approaching <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Indonesia_ceb6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Indonesia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Indonesia</a> and offering your template for review. I would also suggest a heartfelt (or not:) ) apology for any miscommunication or toe-stepping.

<p>Hi, I see that you have asked <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a> and other administrator's talk page to discuss about the {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndonesianPresidents_be24.html" title="Template:IndonesianPresidents">IndonesianPresidents</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndonesianVPs_f4a8.html" title="Template:IndonesianVPs">IndonesianVPs</a>}} templates and my recent removals. Instead of gathering 3rd opinions, why don't we talk about it first? Honestly, I'm not against a template, I love templates, but they should give additional information, for instance, navigations (<a href="../../../n/a/v/WP%7ENAV_e439.html" title="WP:NAV">WP:NAV</a>) or a concise summary (<a href="../../../i/b/t/WP%7EIBT_6a7c.html" title="WP:IBT">WP:IBT</a>). Looking at the two templates you've created, I believe it is exactly equal with <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECAT_61dd.html" title="WP:CAT">category pages</a> or a <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">list article</a> (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Presidents_of_Indonesia_42fd.html" title="List of Presidents of Indonesia">List of Presidents of Indonesia</a>). The articles have used {{<a href="../../../s/u/c/Template%7ESuccession_box_83db.html" title="Template:Succession box">Succession box</a>}}, because they give ordering information who precede/suceed whom before/after the current article's subject. So, if you can convince me that the two templates give additional information, then I would be glad to put them back in the articles. For example, if you can put some kind of timeline bar in the template of how long somebody served as president/vice president, then it would be very very nice, because a reader can grab, for instance, that <a href="../../../s/o/e/Soeharto.html" title="Soeharto">Soeharto</a> has served 32 years, compared to <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habibie.html" title="Habibie">Habibie</a> for only 2 years. We can then eliminate the dull {{<a href="../../../s/u/c/Template%7ESuccession_box_83db.html" title="Template:Succession box">Succession box</a>}}.

<dd>The thing is that more and more people create templates that only cluttering an article. One example with <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> article, in which previously a lot of templates of any organizations that Indonesia has been involved with are included. Then somebody put templates of seas, oceans and continents of which Indonesia is geographically related with. Those templates are just a transformation from a category page that the only advantage is one-click closer, not more than that. I agree that your template looks nice, but I then would expect somebody else, who knows, might put other similar templates, such as IndonesianMinistries, IndonesianPoliticians, IndonesianGenerals, etc. To your questions that why do other countries allow it, but not Indonesia? Well, I don't know. I'm not an editor of the other countries. It is not in the WP guidelines/policies that if you succeeded to include a template in one article, then you can freely put similar templates to other articles. The sea templates, that I've told you previously, had been included in a lot of articles before Indonesia, but it was <a href="../../../t/f/d/WP%7ETFD_eab7.html" title="WP:TFD">TFD'ed</a> after, coincidently, Indonesia's editors and also New Zealand's were complaining about them. — <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndon_c50f.html" title="User:Indon">Indon</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/d/User_talk%7EIndon_22ba.html" title="User talk:Indon"><font color="green">reply</font></a>) — 01:06, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm... I don't think we are in great debate on contentious issues here that you need mediation. All right if you really insist to put all of those of your templates in all countries, then be my guest. However please remove redundancies, okay? When you insert them, eliminate the {{<a href="../../../s/u/c/Template%7ESuccession_box_83db.html" title="Template:Succession box">Succession box</a>}} also, so that you don't look like cluttering the article with similar templates.

<p>1. it was not my intention to indicate that I was in any way responsible for I was merely saying that I will not be <i>enjoying</i> collaboration with a person who takes such a a stand (since wikipedia is supposed to be fun, and since I wanted to let people know <i>precisely</i> that, no matter what the quality of their other edits is, I would be having a hard time encouraging them to contribute more - Holocaust revisionism/Holocaust denial is not an opinion I would tend to condone). Note that I was not speaking for anybody else, and I did not intend it as a warning (it was merely an explanation of just how I find such discussions troubling and in bad taste). Allow me to point out that, in between "No one is indispensable" and "we need all the contributors we can get", you are contradicting yourself - the nature of this contradiction leads me to believe that my original comment was not as obscure as you depicted it.</p>
<p>2. I do not believe that Lupu was vouched for by the Conference, and I do not believe that his status prevents his conclusions from being flawed (I doubt that the Conference either controlled him or prevented him from publicizing his "finds"). The final stage of the dispute is <a href="http://bucharest.usembassy.gov/US_Policy/2005_HRR_En.html" class="external text" title="http://bucharest.usembassy.gov/US_Policy/2005_HRR_En.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In March Corvin Lupu, a university professor in Sibiu, published an article denying the Holocaust. In August the Federation of Jewish Communities, MCA Romania, and the Association of Romania's Jewish Victims of the Holocaust filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office in Sibiu against Lupu for denying the Holocaust in the country, citing his violation of a 2002 decree forbidding such actions. In October the prosecutor's office decided against prosecuting Lupu on the grounds that his action could not be interpreted as a crime as defined by the government decree. An appeal filed by the organizations was also rejected in November.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evidences the scale of the action, and I believe that, if his status did not cover him against judicial complaint and almost universal criticism from his peers, it should not allow him to be used as "evidence" here.</p>
<p>3. I wholeheartedly reject the notion that Lupu's article is informative,or, for that matter, even logical. I would also like you to reconsider your verdict about criticism of Lupu's stand (Cornea asked for Lupu to face the implications of the law in place, as he interpreted it, and this not because it is the man's opinion, but because Lupu misuses an official capacity - and may possibly be misusing his status as an educator, which is indeed alarming). Also: while there may be no monopoly on historical truth, if there is but something very closely resembling it, then Corvin Lupu is almost as far away from it as possible. There is, clearly, a legitimacy in stating what the truth is, and I cannot think what would be more legitimate than the consensus of historians, a Commission invested with power by a state authority, various international committees of undeniable prestige, the vast majority of political forces in Romania, and several contemporary accounts (including, alas, Eichmann's comments). And, btw, one cannot ever say "x is wrong, therefore y is right", so much of the debate is not about how right Wiesel was, but about how wrong Corvin is - which is made painfully obvious by Lupu himself when he asks "how come as many as 400,000 were counted?", while he denies that <i>any</i> where ever killed unjustifiably and on purpose (which means that he is mixing two very different arguments, only one of which is yours).</p>
<p>Almost all of Lupu's arguments are untenable, from what I have seen (granted, I have not read all). Aside from the euphemisms he uses to hide behind when talking about the Holocaust in general, and aside from his borrowing of generic sophistry from the Holocaust denial pool, not one point I've seen him make is anything but speculation,and, as stated, most of them are not even logical speculation. From what I have seen, he talks about how criticism should be over because Jewish banks are richer than ever, about how virtually all Jews (including, supposedly, rabbis and children) are responsible for resisting Romanian presence (which, ahem, came from a state that had withdrawn their citizenship, had exposed them to violent persecution, had allied itself to the Nazis, had come together with the German army, and had adopted anti-Semitic propaganda as the norm) and the rest were necessarily criminals, about how all Jews were "saved" from retaliations through deportation, about how Jews were expected to resign to their fate and trust the good intentions of Antonescu, about how ghettos are justified for keeping children and adults together etc. As we have apparently agreed before, all comments about "what the Jews did" post-1945 are (I would also wager to say that Lupu's insistence on using them is an extra indication that his argument is largely motivated by a frustration I don't share - and don't want to share). It seems also superfluous to expand on another obvious facts: merely being a communist does not mean others are allowed to kill you. With some likely exceptions, neither does resisting what is, for all purposes involved, a foreign invasion.</p>
<p>Lupu would also like to have us believe that it is a Jewish initiative and scholarship which defines and insists on talking about the Holocaust (in Romania or elsewhere), when, in fact, the vast majority of historians not only agree with them, but also contribute to studying the matter (in Romania, where the topic is still sadly avoided, I can still cite Cioroianu, Pippidi, Oprea, and some others; it is imperative to note that, while the number of professionals directly involved in the debate is relatively small, the vast majority of professionals reject the very fabric of Lupu's arguments. This is, of course, an aside, because Lupu's implicit theory about the subjectivity of Jews is utter bullshit. Goma reproduces much of this flawed and ultimately insulting reasoning (btw, his questions are sterile, since he bases them on fallacies - answering Goma would be accepting his premises, the latter being a thing worth avoiding).</p>
<p>As stated by all those whom Lupu contests, the Transnistria issue was very obscured, from the moment of its occurrence and until this very day. "Why did this happen?", you ask. Well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let us first note that the outside world at large <i>had</i> spoken about it during the 50 years of Communism when we did not; admitting this, let us also give them the benefit of the doubt about not being able to approximate numbers,and about not having the details available. Let us also note that a lot of the evidence about the Holocaust itself was furnished by the German bureaucrats - this was unparalleled inside Romania, and, furthermore, with all that data, the margin of error in approximating at the Nazi German scale is enough to engulf the even most serious of estimates for Romania (which should stablish what an insufficient record may generate in data). On a TVR1 series exposing the Romanian Holocaust, I've heard several accounts of Romanian Army officers storming into villages, asking "who of you is a Bolshevik, and who is a Jew?", then shooting the people who were pointed out by the crowd. Who could ever do anything other than <i>roughly</i> estimate how many people were killed in this manner?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Communist Romania hid the past. Whether it was with casual indifference, whether with will to erase, it never bothered to check the data. Note that, just as Auschwitz was kept secret for a while after its discovery - since Stalin had presented Nazism as a tool of class conflict, and found himself faced with redefining the dogma. This mentality stuck with the Communists in the Eastern Bloc, and was for sure a contributing factor to the anti-Cosmopolitan campaign (ever wondered why a lot of Jewish Communists were <i>required</i> to change their names during the 40s and 50s?). Presenting it as a racial issue also made problematic the vicious campaign against Romanian Zionists, and allowed Jews, as a nation, to have some <i>merit</i>, as well as some identity <i>inside</i> and <i>outside</i> the Romanian nation. To speak about Stalin's anti-Semitism in this context is probably not that relevant, but it may be worthy to note that, in East Germany, the Soviets actually made use of a disestablished Nazi camp.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Add to this the fact that the PCR has tried to present itself as the cohesive representative of all society; it was not easy to do so, especially since, with the exception of Kishinevsky, <i>all</i> captured Jewish PCR members went straight to Transnistria (noteworthy that the death toll of ethnic Romanians imprisoned in Tg. Jiu et al was, well, <i>zero</i>). IMO, this should also cast aside all theory that Transnistria was merely another stage of repression of Communists - since, aside from the notorious fact that very few of those imprisoned were Communists, only a relatively small part of Communists, <i>all of them Jewish</i>, was sent to Transnistria. After the late 1970s, it also became imperative that Romania become the absolute good guy in a conflict with Hungary (tons of books spoke in detail about the Hungarian Holocaust, which they connected, spuriously, with the plight of Romanians in Northern Transylvania); <i>none</i> spoke about Transnistria.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the only pre-1989 mention I could find of a Transnistrian camp, namely Vapniarka, was in a <i>Magazin Istoric</i> of 1968 or 1970 (in relation to the defrost?), where it was dropped en passant as "one of places where our comrades were imprisoned" (the article was some Communist's memoir). It was never indicated that inmates were Jewish...</p>
<p>Let me add: all mention of national prestige leaves me cold. Even if it would not, I would still have to say that it was gone in this instance <i>the moment it was established that Romania took part in the Holocaust</i>, not the moment in which added numbers came to trouble some of us. Lupu is spuriously "adding" to his point by delving into that issue, and there is nothing scientific to be found in there. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 19:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi and thank you. On the Lupu topic: I certainly agree that all disagreements over debatable things (such as numbers) ought to be adequately presented, but Lupu's piece is merely unscientific and inflammatory. On the Băsescu issue, I'll answer on that page sometime soon (I'll present two proposals, and personally could accept either of them). About the Priests' Union: I remembered it from the link I found and forwarded to you back when we were discussing controversies involving the Church (you have archived it since, I think). I just looked over it at the time, but it seemed to be pretty substantial on this topic (there's also a bit about it in Cioroianu, but in a section I haven't looked through much - beyond what I used for <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicii_URSS_855c.html" title="Amicii URSS">Amicii URSS</a>). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 17:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, and thank you very much. On the issue at hand: both versions have problems (as far as I can tell, the original version was less problematic). You are obviously right about the template, and it needs a quicker seeing to. I cannot look into all of it now; in case you want to revert to the former version for now, I'll uphold your move (just tell me if you need me to, as I'm not watching that article). In case you don't, we could just let Anonimu enjoy himself until I pay that article a prolonged visit (and perhaps add some tags as to what the problems are). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 19:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have only recently started reading up on that period of history, so I cannot answer the question with full certainity.

<p>The reason I reverted the category "American humanists" was that James didn't identify himself as a humanist, and would likely have rejected any philosophical label as irrelevant to his work and too confining for an imaginative artist. James' work includes things like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Altar_of_the_Dead_b853.html" title="The Altar of the Dead">The Altar of the Dead</a></i> and <i>Is There a Life After Death?</i>, which would be very hard to fit into any non-trivial definition of humanism. And many of his ghost stories hardly show the kind of rational secularism typical of humanist thought.</p>
<p>James was far too flexible in his imaginative work to be pigeonholed into a philosophical category. The closest he ever came to such a classification, to my knowledge, was when he told his brother William that he broadly agreed with WJ's pragmatism. But that might well have been more brotherly courtesy than a serious philosophical commitment. HJ was always an artist first, and he seems to have distrusted all philosophical movements, including humanism or any other ism.</p>
<p>Also, the category "American humanists" seems like an overly broad group of people with little in common except American nationality. For these reasons, I believe the category is more misleading than illuminating when applied to James. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 14:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>James wasn't conventionally religious, but he certainly wasn't consistently anti-religious. In <i>The Altar of the Dead</i>, for instance, his hero meditates on the goodness of churches:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"It was a temple of the old persuasion, and there had evidently been a function--perhaps a service for the dead; the high altar was still a blaze of candles. This was an exhibition he always liked, and he dropped into a seat with relief. More than it had ever yet come home to him it struck him as good there should be churches."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Towards the end of the story, James' protagonist says to the woman who was previously estranged from him: "Then you COULD come? God sent you!...God sent me too, I think. I was ill when I came, but the sight of you does wonders."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, James was hardly always supportive of religion, or at least of the "old persuasion". The closing chapters of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_%28novel%29_775a.html" title="The American (novel)">The American</a></i>, for instance, are marked by Newman's sharp animus against Catholicism, which his creator seems to share to some extent. (Though James' view of Catholicism in <i>The Altar of the Dead</i> is far more positive.) The crucial point is that James wasn't consistently supportive or hostile when it came to philosophical/religious systems. That's why pegging him as a "humanist" - or an "idealist" or a "materialist" or any other variant of philosophical or religious belief - seems so far wide of the mark. James was always ready to use such beliefs as "local color" of a kind for his fiction, but he never professed adherence to any particular system of philosophy or religion, including humanism. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 20:57, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's already a comment in the article on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Altar_of_the_Dead_b853.html" title="The Altar of the Dead">The Altar of the Dead</a></i> about this cubject: "Although James was not religious in any conventional sense, the story shows a deep spirituality in its treatment of mortality and the transcendent power of unselfish love." This pretty much sums up James' "belief system", such as it was. Since <i>The Altar of the Dead</i> is normally rated very highly among his stories, I'll bring the lede paragraph into the "Shorter narratives" section of the main article, suitably edited to maintain the flow of the discussion.</dd>

<dd>As for the punctuation question, this was actually discussed on the talk page (now archived). My personal preference is to avoid extra punctuation whenever possible, which means not using the quotation marks for the tales, but only italics. Other editors have put in the quotation marks, though. It gets really complicated because few if any printed or web sources use quotation marks for the longer tales, like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Turn_of_the_Screw_fa55.html" title="The Turn of the Screw">The Turn of the Screw</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Aspern_Papers_eaf8.html" title="The Aspern Papers">The Aspern Papers</a></i>. If it were up to me, I'd get rid of the quotation marks for all the tales and just use italics. But others apparently disagree. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_Abell_07e4.html" title="User:Casey Abell">Casey Abell</a> 14:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for translating my Romanian article on student protests in 1956. I must confess that I am surprised by the speed of your reaction. I was not aware that it would generate much interest but thought that the struggle of that generation should not be forgotten. I am grateful for your translation which makes this information available also to English speeking audiences.</p>
<p>I took the liberty of changing the tags on the pictures. They are from police files and therefore not subject to copyright. I have made some corrections to the Romanian version. They are not essential, however there are some correction in the names of the students and to the Universities where they were attending courses. I will transfer these corrections to the English version.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>

<dd>Kewl. I'm putting it on hold for the moment though, as I am about to hand the world an article on the 1946 elections (which I remember promising a long time ago). At first glance, I have some doubts about Mrs. Filotti's picture being copyrightless, and I think the guys' pictures need to clarify their source (not just "from police files", but "where I found them"). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Right on both. About the name: as I have said, I'll go with the nomenclature you guys decide upon, but I'll start it under the tile I had unwittingly imposed - I suppose I should not create a redirect to it from "Romanian legislative election, 1946", right? (It will make it much harder to move to there in case we decide to do so.) <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, I'm pretty much sure they did not ever have separate elections for Chamber and Senate (the terms vary only because cabinets would rush in to call them when they were sure they could win...). What I can tell you for sure is that, in 1946, there was no longer a Senate to vote for (they had discovered it was "reactionary"). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hm. Interesting. Unfortunately, a large part of that appears to disregard copyright legislation. But it's worth a look into.

<p>Yes, I saw that. And, of course, you noted the distinction between Băsescu, the Private Citizen who summoned the private Parliament to address them as a private citizen, drawing conclusions from the Private Citizen's Commission Report in front of a lot of private citizens, all of them on holiday, and Băsescu, the President.

<p>I changed the initial picture of Mrs. Filotti because it did not fit with the article and actually it was taken at a different date than when the events took place. And at that time she was definitely not laughing, she had a nervous breakdown. As far as the other pictures are concernet they were taken from the issue of the România liberă which is mentioned in the bibliography. However the article shows clearly that they are from the police files. I am not sure if Dahn wants additional information on the pictures to be posted. As far as Mrs. Filotti's picture is concerned, I had the privilege of knowing her personally and took the pictures myself. So in this case there should be no doubts about the copyright.</p>
<p>I would have liked to post more pictures of the students, but unfortunately I did not find any. I can only hope that if people read the article they will add some more.</p>
<p>The special number of the Romania liberă I quoted also has some information on the students in Timişoara and Cluj. If you are interested I can send you a copy. I can scan the articles and I can post them on this site (I hope it works) or otherwise send them if this site does not accept them. Finalizing the corrections might take a day or two.</p>
<p>There is a single issue on which I disagree with you, and that is the independence of Hawaii. But I don't think this can evolve into a dispute. And I understand your point: as a monarchist, it is to be expected that you support the restauration of monarchy in Hawaii. I am also a supporter of the restauration of the Brazilian empire. They would be far better off than with their present president.</p>
<p>So keep me posted if you need the information.</p>

<p>Thanks. I have added the name of the legislature, and thanks for pointing that out (it was already alluded to in a Groza quote, but I didn't put two and two together). I couldn't tell you what the system was for sure: the only electoral info I gathered and added was about discarding the majority bonus. There are more photos in Dosarele Istoriei, but I still haven't managed to get to a scan (it's on my to do list). I didn't ad the percentages because, frankly, I could not compute them...

<p>Kia ora - I noted that you proposed a entry I created for deletion due to non-notable advertising. I'm interested in finding out how to rectify this. The organisation I am discussing is significant because it provides alternative, web-based (eNewsletter) information and news coverage to an indigenous (Maori) audience. It provides an indigenous Maori perspective relevant to indigenous Maori issues. In New Zealand this is rare, in fact TangataWhenua.com is the only web-based media organisation that is doing this.</p>
<p>In an environment that promotes Trusts and NGOs (as opposed to companies and partnerships) the development of an indigenous business framework in this context is to be commended, and is therefore note-worthy. What more can I do to ensure this entry continues? Looking forward to your commments (hopefully you have time)&#160;:) Atutahi 09:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you may have missed the significance of such an organisation. A digital newsletter, created by Maori for Maori is one step (of many) in the journey towards self-determination. Information that is sourced, researched, written and developed by Maori is more valuable, relevant and useful to the Maori community itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Take for instance West Papua, having news and information created and developed by West Papuans themselves is infinitely more valuable then content that is created by Indonesians FOR West Papuas. Considering also that Maori communities are only beginning to have access to the internet is another reason why organisation such as TangataWhenua.com and AoCafe for example are so important and necessary to the overall development of Maoridom in a digital age, I think that this type of attitude underestimates the value of this medium in terms of indigenous self-determination... What are your thoughts? Atutahi 10:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless, I thank you for not proposing a speedy deletion and giving me the time to improve the entry (assuming I can develop a more robust rational). Atutahi 10:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just thought I'd make one final point, which a friend highlighted - The name TangataWhenua.com may indeed create confusion in that it could lead one to think that the focal point is wholly commercial. "However to the trained eye - i.e. one who has an understanding of indigenous development it is worth it's entry on the grounds of special consideration in terms of indigenous self-determination and self-expression." Atutahi 13:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC) Kia ora me ki roto i kotahitanga (be well, in unity).</dd>

<dd>Having looked at it, I definitely don't think the article qualifies for <i>speedy</i> deletion anymore (the old version was basically a cut &amp; paste of part of their web page). If you want to try AfD, of course, feel free. However, if this really is a pioneering venture of the Maori, I think it's something noteworthy and should probably be kept. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:02, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rulers.org isn't bad, it's just unreferenced. It's a good place to start looking, certainly. I remember when Hassanali became president. I don't recall if there was a period between Clarke leaving office and Hassanali being installed. It wasn't something that drew much attention, not like 2003 when they had to extend Robinson's term. There was controversy, coming close to a constitutional crisis, when Clarke made appointments on his own just before leaving office (the President is required to "consult" with the Prime Minister, but the constitution never said he had to <i>listen</i> to what the PM advised, although that had always been the assumption...the courts ruled in favour of the President). Anyway, I found a newspaper commentary which <i>seems</i> to be saying that Clarke made one of these appointments the day before Hassanali was installed, which would suggest he was still in office until the transition, but the sentance isn't very clear.</p>
<p>What's more important is that no one in Trinidad seems to consider Williams as part of the sequence of Presidents, so I don't think we should. If we start counting Acting Presidents it gets really messy. I don't feel comfortable doing so. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:45, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually the President of the Senate is appointed Acting President whenever the President leaves the country. For example, Hassanali was in England in 1990 during the <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaat_al_Muslimeen_coup_attempt_7702.html" title="Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt">Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt</a>, and Emmanuel Carter was acting President and declared the State of Emergency, etc. IIRC, Ganace Ramdial acted as President while Robinson was ill for an extended period. Every President of the Senate since 1976 has acted as President - Wahid Ali, Michael J. Williams, Emmanuel Carter, Ganace Ramdial and Linda Baboolal, probably at least once a year. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 13:34, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I think ultimately, in parallel to the various ordinal U.S. Congress pages, it is worthwhile to have similar ordinal state legislature pages with complete listings of its members. A corollary to your argument about lists being distracting, is that the list of legislators on <a href="../../../1/1/0/110th_United_States_Congress_8e76.html" title="110th United States Congress">110th_United_States_Congress</a> should be dropped because it is distracting there, which I think you'd probably agree is not desirable. Consider the state legislature pages transitional pages to future improvement. Because of article histories, the recent listings for the Massachusetts General Court won't be lost, if the history does not end up in a strange place because of page name changes and splits, so it is recoverable. I am agnostic about whether there should be RED names for all of the legislators without biographies, or simply black-type listings, and I don't think a RED listing needs to imply that an article will ever be written, but rather an invitation to the interested editor to write one. I think it is worth having the detailed listing, and it's a challenging set of information to track down, and hence worth making accessible--over time--in wikipedia. Remember that nearly every famous politician was once a humble town officer, or state legislator, and it is usefull to understand who his/her peers were in legislative chambers. -- <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowdesk_4361.html" title="User:Yellowdesk">Yellowdesk</a> 14:51, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your point is well taken. Yes, "Ordinal General Court" pages are desirable. And have "Current General Court" redirect to the presently-in-office-Ordinal General Court page. I would be inclined not to split off the list of legislators, for the near term, until several Ordinal General Court pages/lists exist--how about 10 years of lists? In general, I think it's a good Idea. Let me check the Georgia example again, and possibly give more comments. -- <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowdesk_4361.html" title="User:Yellowdesk">Yellowdesk</a> 13:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. Separate data aren't unfortunately available&#160;:(. The point is that after "coal fever" thousands of gastarbeiters from Bohemia and Slovakia arrived to the area and thus local Polish minority had dropped percentually. Assimilation, Czechization from 1920 to 1938 and Germanization during the war also contributed negatively to drop not only in percents but also in numbers. I am supposed to borrow a book covering the numbers of all Censuses from 1920 to 1991 in all municipalities. I have seen it already one time and it is quite interesting and sad. Also history of this small part of Europe is very complicated. Take the village of Hrčava as a nice example. Until 1920 it was a part of the Polish village of Jaworzynka. Exactly all citizens of Hrčava were Poles. After 1920 division of area between CS and PL, Hrčava fell to Czechoslovavkia and in 1921 CS Census a vast majority of citizens declared Czech nationality&#160;:). In 1939 Census almost all citizens (same people) declared Silesian nationality&#160;:) and many of them were sent to Wehrmacht later. Today almost all citizens of Hrčava declare Czech nationality but majority of them bear Polish surnames.&#160;:) - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 23:00, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello and thank you for your response. All three articles you created are of very high quality, I especially like that Soviet case and John T. Ford but I would suggest you all to nominate for DYK&#160;:). Btw I have expanded my Polish minority GA article of section concerning education, maybe you would like to check that. Currently I work on expanding somehow articles about towns and villages in Zaolzie and also on creating short articles about great persons of our region, still many many to go. I must also thank you for creating that Slovak navigational template, it is very fine, there was nothing to repair. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 10:01, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, we should blank it and use "4 Devils" as a redirect, by all means. I didn't notice the other article until my little stub was up, of course. For a moment there, when you said that "Four Devils has existed since October," I thought the film had been found until I realized what you meant. I was mesmerized by the silent-to-sound transitional films with Gaynor at the huge Janet Gaynor retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art a few months ago. I emerged with the realization that Peter Bogdanovich is right that cinema's height wasn't 1939, as most people think, but that period from 1927 to 1929 when the silents (an utterly different art form, needless to say) reached their pinnacle. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoryliner_f8c1.html" title="User:Storyliner">Storyliner</a> 19:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I have made some changes to that Czechoslovak PMs template. Good work. Anyway, I am a student of political science and european studies, so I guess I will get back to that constitutions etc. sooner or later&#160;:).<br />
You are absolutely right, as for Roma people, it is same problem here, officially a few thousands, real number more than 200,000. Serious problem is that in many towns ghettoes slowly but surely appear. As for Us, well today it is unstoppable process. Our community is the second oldest in average in the country (after Germans), high intermarriage rate, low birth rate etc. I think we are masters in assimilation. In the interwar period it was quite obvious when you take the politics of "democratic Czechoslovak government". Most of Poles were workers, miners and metallurgists, and when they fire you from work cause of your ethnicity, you supply the family of five, you will declare Czech nationality and send your kids to Czech school to get your job back... Sad truth is (but I've heard this applies everywhere), most nationalist and chauvinist Czechs are ... ... local Czechs with Polish ancestry&#160;:(. That guys with Polish surname and ideas like "Why these fu**ers talk here Polish, we are in the Czech Republic, goddamit!" and there goes his liberal friend and say, "Wassup Martin. You attended Polish school, so shut the fu** up."&#160;:) I have always admired Hungarians in Slovakia, they are able to work and live close together and to "keep it in the community". Some people say our chance is migration from Poland after EU join but truth is, Poles-immigrants assimilate even quicker. You talk with them Polish, they even can't talk Czech but try by any means.<br />
As for Romania, I always defended you when it came to joining the EU. You know, some of my colleagues at the university studies are right wing, and it is quite sad when you hear at the university something like "oh god, Romanian filth is joining us, another fu**ing Gypsies". Btw we can talk about Czech nationalists (perfectly hidden in the society)&#160;:). How about Romanian nationalists?

<p>Hi, and thank you for your message. I have just now checked my mail (I had some internet problems, and still have no outgoing service).</p>
<p>To be honest, I did consider leaving for good: what did it was being called a communist, being asked to apologize for things I never said, being told I was incoherent and losing contact with reality, as well as a danger to the wikipedia community (I took time to review my posts on the debated subjects, and I found nothing in there that would have justified any such argument). I also got very bitter when I noticed that some mudslinging aimed at me in the past had left deeper marks than I ever imagined (specifically, a noob trolled after being convinced by some established user that I was anti-Moldavian - you may know who that user is, and what he resorted to in order to provoke that perception; I hope you will see my point when I tell you could never apologize for having called him a troll on the basis of this).</p>
<p>That was only part of the reason, though. I did make a conscious choice to stay away at least for a while, and it coincided with my leaving the city for a couple of days. In any case, if and when I would have left, I would have made sure to let you know, and to thank you for making this project interesting, fair, and, well, workable. Not to mention that your message (and another one I received from Khoikhoi) would have very likely persuaded me to return. I recently read what (a pre-Stalinist) Breton wrote to Tzara when he was asking him to join the Paris group: "it is our differences which unite us". Not only could this statement work as a template for wikipedian behavior, not only does it contrast with what I have to deal with before taking my break, but it is also the attitude I have attempted to instill in others and have always refreshingly found in your contributions and comments (which, as you probably know, obliges me to rank you among my favorite wikipedians).</p>
<p>All in all, I could not stay put. So much more needed to be done, and I was itching to do it. So, yeah, I'm back in business - except that I'm taking my time returning to the disputed article (which I can only hope is kept cleanish).

<p>Hi Biru! Good to be back. I must say though, dear, are you deliberately needling me with that stuff about Orbán, Székelyföld and "Romanians, masters for the ages"?&#160;:) LOL Well, you have your deranged nationalist moments and I have mine. Freedom for Székelyföld, freedom for the Székely!! (see <a href="http://www.hunsor.se/avitus/szekelymanifest060316.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hunsor.se/avitus/szekelymanifest060316.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>--also rather stirring). Anyway, thanks for the other 56 stuff, I'll take a look at it in a little while. We proud Hungarians are just starting to work on an article about the 1848 Hungarian revolution (there wasn't one before!! can you believe that?!) with the same eventual goal as with the 56 one--FA, main page, etc.&#160;:) A Romanian perspective might be a valuable addition, if you're interested. Anyway, once again thanks for the welcome back. Have a good day...Birui<i>turul</i>.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K.

<p>Haven't the time to reply to all your points, but must mention the Székely. Why should they have to be loyal Romanians? They are not Romanians, they never chose to live in Romania, their language is not Romanian and their culture is not Romanian. It is nothing more than an accident of history that they live within the current borders of Romania, and it is well known that many of them wish for a certain degree of autonomy for their distinct people and culture. It's really no different from the issue of the independent Kurdistan you and I both favor. (also I <i>seriously</i> doubt their calls for autonomy are a plot by Budapest--Gyurcsi doesn't care one bit about the Hungarian minorities abroad--but that's a separate issue.) Oh, and please, Transylvania is a hugely significant part of Romanian AND Hungarian history/culture. We both have legitimate claims to it--only wish it could somehow belong to both countries (but yikes, wouldn't that be hard to work out the specifics...)</p>
<p>I must say I do enjoy these friendly jousting matches of ours--you're officially my favorite deranged nationalist.&#160;:) Cheers! <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 19:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Whew! Not sure I can poke too many holes in that--but I'm still keeping my "this user supports Székely autonomy" userbox.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Actually, the main reason I choose NOT to enable wikimail was precisely to avoid the kind of "real derangement" you mention; I'm not worried that <i>you</i> would ever be cruel or obnoxious over email, but there are others here with whom I've gotten into some very unpleasant wars.....</p>
<p>Oh, and don't hold your breath for Viki Orbán coming back into power..there's a big surge of support for Fidesz these days, in the aftermath of certain events of last year, but Orban himself is just making a bigger and bigger oaf of himself. No, methinks his days of glory are at an end--apologies to the Greater Romania Party.&#160;;) ♠♣♥♦!! (Yes, I <i>do</i> get the urge to push those buttons...)</p>
<p>PS are you still hoping to become an admin one of these days? <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 21:19, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
What, the army of football hooligans with Arpad flags storming the TV headquarters last September didn't do it for you?&#160;:) There have indeed been fascist/Arrow Cross/football thug/generally nasty elements in the demonstrations, but they've honestly been just a small (but loud) minority. You'd better NOT really be hoping for a new Szalasi, you know as well as I do that the Arrow Cross years were among the darkest in Hungarian history. Frankly, I wish László Solyom would be the new PM, he's frequently been the lone voice of reason in the whole mess.</p>
<p>I have to admit though, when the protests/riots/weird little revolution started last fall, the first thing that popped into my mind was "All RIGHT! Finally! Something fun and dramatic to get all worked into a frenzy about!" You see, my dear, human nature never changes, even Hungarian idealists and Romanian nationalists are the same.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K.

Yeah--the least European of Europeans, but sometimes also the very definition of Mitteleuropa. Being from the distant steppes has given us all a weird isolation complex, btw--but yes, one can always count on the wild, hot-blooded, Asiatic-tempered Huns to spice things up when it gets too routine. Talpra magyar!!

Thanks, that's rather amusing.&#160;:) Yes, I'm sure the Hungarian videos are even funnier when one actually understands what is being said (remember I'm a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreigner.html" title="Foreigner">külföldi</a>, my Hungarian is almost as bad as yours, so I'm missing a lot of jokes too) but that second one needs no language--that was the hardest I've laughed in weeks, when that guy in the background started randomly attacking inanimate objects (funny enough in itself) and then when the monotone manifesto-reader didn't even notice! Ah well, there's the strange magyar sense of humor for you...</p>
<p>I've thoroughly enjoyed our conversations today, I must say. Unfortunately I won't have any more spare time for additional random musings for a while again now; I'll still be around the wiki, just not so much time to chat aimlessly. Seeing as it is now after midnight where I am (and I have finally finished typing my paper for class tomorrow, barely avoided an all-nighter!) I need to get some sleep. ♠♣♥♦ and good night, see you around!&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K.

<dd><a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_calendar.html" title="Romanian calendar">Romanian calendar</a> definitevely sounds familiar, with rapciune for september. But how can I put a reference to Moldova, add to category Moldovan culture? BTW, I don't like <i>Moldovan culture</i> - I prefer <i>Culture of Moldova</i>. Similarly (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Moldova" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Moldova" rel="nofollow">the existing categories</a>), I prefer <i>Media of Moldova</i> and <i>People of Moldova</i>. Can we make this changes? Where do I post for others to know that I would like to change them? <b>Reason:</b> <i>Moldovan people</i> to a person from Moldova means <i>ethnic Moldovans, i.e. ethnic Romanians</i>, it would automatically exclude Russians, Ukrainians, Gagauz. The current name is more strange, as inside it we have subcategory <i>People from Transnistria</i> with <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Antyufeyev_eb56.html" title="Vladimir Antyufeyev">Vladimir Antyufeyev</a>, who is simply a Russian that at some point lived in Latvia (Riga OMON tells you something?), and now stopped in Transnistria on his way home. I understand to keep <i>Moldovan society</i> and <i>Moldovan law</i>, since there can be no ethnical meaning here. But where there can be an ethnic meaning, <i>... of Moldova</i> sounds better to me.</dd>

<p>Man, I sure have been abusing your patience. In my defense: I had written a draft of an answer when my connection started acting up, so I needed to postpone it. Yet again, I apologize.</p>
<p>I very much liked the proposals for policies: let your reign of terror begin!&#160;:) Seriously though, very constructive and logical stuff (if you're planning to open a discussion on them and you need my input/support at any given time, link it to me and I'll be there).</p>
<p>Couldn't find an exact answer for the UTC stuff - works I use are not strictly related to the issues, and I would have to explore them in the texts (Cioroianu's doesn't even have an index, which has been a source for constant annoyance for me; other books only have one for persons). At first glance, I'm not sure if they were in power themselves after 1944/45, although a titular minister was probably a member of both the UTC and the PCR, if I remember correctly). Will have to look those details up, but only after I'm done with the PCR article, which I left hanging for now.</p>
<p>Cool stuff on the 1907 thing - although the persistent reflexions about similarities with the present-day situation are rather idiotic, and bring to mind the fact that the PC is no longer in power...;). Anyways, I too have bumped into <a href="http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/cernea/cuprins.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.unibuc.ro/eBooks/istorie/cernea/cuprins.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> (I would have to say it is deeply Marxist, but valuable). Incidentally, there is some stuff on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Rakovsky_de9a.html" title="Christian Rakovsky">Christian Rakovsky</a> which could be explored further. You're right about March moving out of focus (doh, Dahn!), but we may still gat a hold of some symbolics by going with "still, we FAed it in 2007".</p>
<p>I suppose your chronology on the N.Leg.State is correct (I myself have no memory for dates), so we should begin making corrections. Generally, I leave stubs to the bottom of my priority list, unless I'm sure I can (and want to) seriously expand them in the process (I still have the beginning of a draft version among my text documents). I also stayed away from the Antonescu article - perhaps, in the future, I will add and/or correct stuff in there, but for now I'm taking it easy in regard to that.</p>
<p>Great idea on the squads; myself, I was preparing for an article on each, but this is by far better. I don't know of any others (in fact, I had not even heard of the name "Razbunatorii" until you mentioned it). Also good stuff on the 1940 massacre (I had contemplated the thought) - I have sources for this, including a list of all people killed, so I'll be watching over your shoulder in case you want to start it before I do.</p>
<p>The main problem with using Levy is a paradox: we cannot use all of it. I have used it as a reference in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corneliu_Coposu_2a48.html" title="Corneliu Coposu">Corneliu Coposu</a>, but I fidget when I have to make limited references to a text that I cannot use in its entirety. This arguably gues for the article on Luci (I still have to get myself to consider using more from VT's book - either change the references to the Ro edition or check the latter against the English version index), and seems painfully obvious in the article on Pauker (where the text not available for reading bound to be equally important).</p>
<p>Again, sorry for the delay and the vague answers. I promise I'll look closer into each of those subjects. Btw, if you are still planning contributions on the BOR: I found <a href="http://www.ilregno.it/it/archivio_articolo.php?CODICE=34673" class="external text" title="http://www.ilregno.it/it/archivio_articolo.php?CODICE=34673" rel="nofollow">this Italian-language and Catholic summary</a>, which could serve as both a reference and a template for what you may want to add. (I see you don't rate Italian as one of your languages, but, as Romanians, we all have some grasp of it; hope it's useful).</p>
<p>Keep up the good work. Cheers, <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:15, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry to keep you waiting, but I can only make a quick note for now: <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_21.shtml" class="external text" title="http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_21.shtml" rel="nofollow">this</a> indicates that there were Romanian elections in 1916 (and I remember you asking about this stuff). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:56, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Left-wing deviationism"? I liked that: hopefully, I'll not have to formally admit my mistakes&#160;;).</p>
<p>Anyways. Great news on the Levy issue - he would make a great addition to our traveling circus.</p>
<p>I hope you're holding on to those BOR links, though. In between the two of us, we have gathered a nice bibliography.</p>
<p>Also great news on the map. My family has what could well be another, slightly newer, version of the same Atlas - it's called "Handatlas", but it's damn huge (a page is as big as a full grown man's torso). If we are talking about the same type of book, I have to bow in front of Olahus: he either spent a week scanning it or has a really big scanner (in either case, he must be very patient).</p>
<p>We do have stuff on verification in the PCR article, though it is not as specific as you would want it (because such were the sources). I don't plan to use <i>Stalinism pentru eternitate...</i> in that article as well, at least not for now, since it would take just too much time to quote properly a book that massive on such a large topic. However, there is his English-language work I have used on <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valter_Roman_de20.html" title="Valter Roman">Valter Roman</a> (and, for now, advertised on the PCR article) - it could reveal more details on this (I notice it is very detailed). So, keep your fingers crossed.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Interesting stuff on Pătrăşcanu. Could I perchance ask you to go through other things in that book about him specifically? (Perhaps look through the index.) We could expand the article significantly with yet another source (whoever of us is actually going to edit it in). This seems much easier than using the book for the article on Pauker (plus, it could help you in the future, because you would already have gathered details that you can later glue together). I've checked out the index, and most of it seems to gravitate around page 145 - if you could peak into other sections and add detail or back up presently-used citations, it would be peachy. I don't want to impose on you, just in case you have the time and will.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot do much for the numbers just yet. I have more context for the 1937 elections, but not more numbers (I'm surprised you managed to find out that many...); congrats on that article, though, it came as a complete and pleasant surprise. For the deportations, I'm equally confused myself, and so are many historians; I don't have any source that would actually list the numbers nearby, but I do remember a Magazin Istoric which had a lengthy article on German deportations - will have to look it up, though. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 00:07, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message about my <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_Caine_20c9.html" title="Hall Caine">Hall Caine</a> article; it's good to get feedback. As you noticed, my references were very limited - to one person in fact, Allen's book and her article in the DNB, so it's good to be provided with more. I shall add sections on Caine's family and his religion - but not yet as I have nominated it for Good Article asssessment (mainly to get more feedback and advice) and for that it is supposed to be "stable".

<dd>Thanks for your message. Of course, I understand the Moldova-Moldavian distinction in English, so strictly speaking Moldovan culture and Culture of Moldova are the same (similarly Moldovan Media). However, many articles in other languages usually start with translations from English, and no other language has the Moldovan/Moldavian distinction. (Was it BBC who coind the term <i>Moldovan</i> in 1992? I remeber because I was still learning English at that time, but I am not sure who actually did.) Anyway, if you believe the acategory names are better as are, that's fine with me.</dd>
<dd>I knew about <a href="../../../f/-/2/F-23.html" title="F-23">F-23</a>, but I did not know it was called F-23. Yes, if Mihai would have done something similar, I would have had a different oppinion about him. Comparison with the kings of Bulgaria and Serbia is not the best thing to convince me, b/c the fact that he is not the only mediocre person does not speak much in his favour in my eyes. The problem with people at top is they are obliged to perform, or otherwise they are at best called incompetent, and generaly called malicious if not worse. There is no middle, neutral. The only way not to be called malicious is to actually do extraordinary things. Well, Mihai just survived and did not do any big stupidity (perhaps 90% in his place would have done) - but that's <i>not sufficient</i>. He is not applying for a increase in salary or a CEO job. He wants to be the chief of the state, and irrevocably. Even if that does not carry too much power under normal circumstances, that's not something i am prepared to hand on a plate just because he has not done any visible damage. You see, I consider inactivity a damage. And knowing who his father was... How did he wash his father's sins? Just by not producing others? On the contrary, if he would have led an anti-communist insurection, and preferably died in the attempt, his daughter would be surely queen now. Modern kings and queens forget something - 500 and 1000 years ago someone had the autority that people would immediately kneel before, and follow into water and fire b/c that someone would not hesitate to act in a 1:20 inferiority. I am a superficially religious person, but I remember many years ago, a portion I read once from the Old Testament, something that supposedly have happened about 3000 years ago: an attack by Saul's son Johnatan and his arm-bearer on a 20-strong military outpost. That is what I would call royal blood, dispite his father being also a disaster.</dd>
<dd>Maybe the reason I haven't heard about Mihai's visit is I am very little physically in Moldova, mostly people tell me what happens and I read, I try to follow everything, but...:<a href="../../../d/c/7/User%7EDc76_d1f8.html" title="User:Dc76">Dc76</a> 22:49, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Salut. Am observat şi eu acelaşi lucru. Multe articole conţin estimări mai mult sau mai puţin dubioase referitoare la diverşi indicatori statistici (populaţia fiind unul dintre ei). Ca regulă generală, dacă nu există o altă sursă oficială (de ex., pentru unele localităţi din judeţul Constanţa am găsit indicatori din 2004 sau chiar 2006 pe site-ul Consiliului Judeţean), mi se pare o idee bună să se utilizeze datele de la ultimul recensământ.

<dd>Even though the city was not part of the M(A)SSR, I view that section as listing spellings that have some relevance (first-rank or second-rank) to the area - that is why Gagauz, Hebrew, Polish, and Bulgarian are also present.

I never viewed this as POV-pushing for Moldovenism since, well, it gives it as a variant for the Romanian-language name... if you know what I mean&#160;;).

<dd>Dahn, I couldn't but notice the discussion above, and I guess you are talking about Cetatea Alba (from the link you give). I am surprized that article got into edit waring (as I can see from its history). There were so many ways any "side" could have compromise. It only just shows that people put pricipiality (for an insignificant detail!) above result. Please, tell me if any of these do not sound logical to you:
<ul>
<li>The name Cetatea Alba was used also before 1503. The article does not mention it. It appears from the article that the name was invented in 1918.</li>
<li>The name Cetatea Alba with cyrillic letters was never used officialy, because before 1940 the city was in Romania (not in MASSR), and after - in Ukrainian SSR. During 1945-1989, in Moldova you could see it with cyryllic script only in books about Stefan cel Mare, etc, or in history maps, for example in schools in history classes before 1989. But only in classes in Moldovan (Romanian), which was not the official language at the time. The official maps of USSR and Ukrainian SSR were in Russian, and the name was <i>Белгород-Днестровский Belgorod-Dnestrovkii</i>. (Only MSSR, USSR, Europe, and world maps were found in cyrillic Moldavian (Romanian). Maps of UkSSR - in Russian, not even in Ukrainian.) I don't know why noone gave 10 seconds of thought to this, and move the sentence 2 paragraphs below, where one talks about the names in never-official languages (Bulagian, Polish, etc). That would be the best solution in my oppinion. What do you think?:<a href="../../../d/c/7/User%7EDc76_d1f8.html" title="User:Dc76">Dc76</a> 23:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The name "Cetatea Albă" was not used before 1503, and I'm pretty sure it was not used for long after that date (I cannot find any references that the name <i>in Romanian</i> was recorded anywhere around that time). I personally can agree on principle to moving it one paragraph down. I am perfectly aware of what the political situation was, as you may note from my reply to Biruitorul. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:37, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, so I take you agree to my second point. Good. Of course, I don't mind if you refrase it there etc. whatever.</dd>
<dd>I am not blaming you of not knowing something, I was just showing on what exactly I based my rationale.</dd>
<dd>As for the first point, let me ask you this: what name was used during Stefan cel Mare's time? If you say there are no written sourses in Romanian at that time, then I would disagree this is a viable motive, because then we can not use any French name before the edict of Strasbourg for sure, and until the rule of Charles Valois most probably (the switch from latin to french in official documents), no Enlgish name - for even much longer, and for all ancient languages except Latin, Greek, Aramaic, Hebrew, Caldean, Sanskrit and Chinese. So, no Decebal, but Decebalus, no Arab names before 7th century, no Maya names, no Percian names until very later, etc, etc. I believe it doesn't make sense to start pointless disputes about the name of the city in 1392-1503. Before Renaissance, writting was by far not an important activity, kings have died without ever writting anything, and they were quite official. I think we should use the standards of the times to which we refer. Do you really think that's worth, arguing about this? I believe there are many more useful things to do. I wrote this here, not on the talk page, because it is a very small issue, but if I would have written it there, a couple users would have seen it, and it would have been more escalation. But so, you can use it as an example that you are not uncompromizing with details, and ask them to be more reasonable as well. In every dispute out of control the more intelligent person gives up first (because that person knows that there are more ways than brute force).:<a href="../../../d/c/7/User%7EDc76_d1f8.html" title="User:Dc76">Dc76</a> 00:46, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is no indication of the name to have been used. In general, French names are not used for the Roman-to-Frankish period, as opposed to their Latin equivalents. I don't know how "Decebal" came to be, but it's a strictly Romanian thing (I suppose it came through the tendency of French to turn Latin names into non "-us" forms, and that Romanians went with the pronunciation of that hybrid). Persian names are extremely old. Mayan names, recorded in some form or another quite early, are likely used in retrospect for unrecorded names because they have no equivalent in any other language except Spanish, and that retrospect is comparatively short. A large number of European languages were recorded before the Renaissance - Romanian is a late bloomer under any criterion used for the chronology of recorded languages.</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, the name in this form is a modern rendition. It is very probable that Moldavians themselves used a form of the foreign names in use - Belgorod is an equally likely variant (considering that the "so very Latin in name" Alba Iulia was known to Romanians as "Bălgrad").

<dd>Grigore Ureche, Miron Costin, and Ion Nistor write Cetatea Alba. They are not contemporaries (Grigore Ureche was born in 1590, the others in 17th century), but they were supposed to know. You see, as long as these 3 cronics write one way, and you will insist on no, and suppositions that Moldavians were using a different name (tell that to more Moldavians and they will just overload you with insults), in my oppinion that's not constructive. Do you actually see this as such a big issue? I do not like Whigs, in pre-1860 US I sympathize with <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/aj7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/aj7.html" rel="nofollow">Democratic Republicans</a>:<a href="../../../d/c/7/User%7EDc76_d1f8.html" title="User:Dc76">Dc76</a> 03:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For the first time - from you, today - I hear that Cetatea Alba was some kind of nationalist wishful thinking term. Give it a brake, please, it's just a historical name, as translated from Italian (from Genoese) and Greek (from Bizantenes). To pick to insist on such an issue, there is a Russian saying, I am sure Illythr or someone else will be very glad to explain it to you, or maybe you'l be curious to find out for yourself Не солидно.&#160;:<a href="../../../d/c/7/User%7EDc76_d1f8.html" title="User:Dc76">Dc76</a> 03:31, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dc76, I have very little taste for discussing how why I feel about things the way I feel, for engaging in clever repartees in languages I do not speak, and for making note of "how many Moldavians would overload me with insults". This is a boundary I have set myself, based on what i consider a civilized conversation to be, and based on what this project is about.</dd>
<dd>In all honesty, you cannot present a record of the name having been used that far back in time. I can understand what your reasoning is, I am not sure why it is relevant as long as the conclusion is pure speculation. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:29, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nope, they were Soviet Socialist Republics all the way until the 1990s. The sovereignty was preserved according to the Constitution, and the Russian Wikipedia mentions that. However I don't think TSFSR should be mentioned in the template even if it's historically accurate. It makes the template look confusing and redundant.

<p>♠♣♥♦! My favorite deranged nationalist is back!&#160;:)</p>
<p>I like the translation idea a bit better than the other, because it seems to me that if we're really going to do an all-out Romania vs. Hungary thing, full of patriotism and national pride (as it always should be), we should write on topics related to Romania and Hungary.&#160;:) Probably we can eventually do both, since I hope the contest will not be just a one-time thing. It's fun for us and good for the Wiki! Why not make it a tradition? One caveat though--I would prefer that the rules do NOT restrict the articles to translation only, we should be able to add our own material to what we translate from Ro- and Hu-Wiki.</p>
<p>We should also, all in good fun and the spirit of healthy rivalry, offer some really good, slightly twisted and delightfully mischievous prizes to the winners. I was going to propose that the winners get full claim to Transylvania for a week, but once I thought about it some more I realized it doesn't really make sense (and let's leave it at that...). My latest thought is the losers have to all write rhapsodic odes to the winners' country and put them on their user pages for a few days, or a week, or until the next competition.&#160;:) Thoughts?</p>

Oh yeah--and we'll have to settle on how exactly to decide the winner. Ideas? <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 02:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oooh, those prizes are evil!&#160;:) I like it! How about five days for DYK? Three days seems a little skimpy. Or split the difference and go for four days? <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 15:38, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Starting on Friday or ending on Friday? BTW, my userpage is going to look rather different on Thursday, the 15th...&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 17:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excellent. It's up on the magyar noticeboard.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/2E/_/User%7EK._Lastochka_8064.html" title="User:K. Lastochka">K. Lásztocska</a> 00:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Definitely. It's one of those things that could be absolutely terrific...or it could backfire stupendously.

<dd>Hi (it's on the same topic, so I'll keep to the header). For clarity and per VT on p.172 (Romanian edition), I would rephrase that as "to ensure Soviet control". If you don't mind, I will have a closer look in the near future (I'll add more references and connect it to info in other articles).</dd>
<dd>Btw,how do you feel about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valter_Roman&amp;diff=114490562&amp;oldid=114354212" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valter_Roman&amp;diff=114490562&amp;oldid=114354212" rel="nofollow">such stuff</a>?

<dd>I was rather vague in my message. What I meant to say was in relation to his goals, not to his status as Soviet agent - I suppose the issue was what he used his spy status for ("infiltrating" works better if you specify that his job was to ensure obedience to Moscow or something like that). Interestingly, I think we were looking at the same page in VT...</dd>
<dd>Oh, and thanks for weighing in on the other issue. Your opinion means a lot to me. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 12:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Still, could you please comment on it? There is a full offensive going on, and, as you may see, a newly-intervened editor has begun to use reverse psychology. Part of what was simply erased because of that user's POV is actually your contribution (indirectly). I cannot continue to argue for common sense on my very own: please formulate an opinion and help clear my name, because this is simply ridiculous. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 16:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I claim that this editor pushes his agenda against all other editors, by enlisting the help of unsuspecting editors like <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">User:Khoikhoi</a> or simply people willing to help in exchange for similar repayment. This is easy to see from the discussion and history pages. There has been plenty of discussion so far. I revert to what is consensus versions for everyone - except for Dahn, that is, who objects in bad faith to everything different from his versions. To give you just one example, he want to call Nicolschi a Romanian communist activist. This is misleading as noted by everyone, since Nicolschi was a NKVD colonel, later a general. NKVD colonel is evidently more significant than "Romanian activist". It is as if he wanted to call all people of dubious reputation "Romanians", which is misleading and unfair.

<p>Salut. După părerea mea, cred că ar trebui menţinate toate sursele şi în articolul despre Valea Jiului. Din păcate nu am nici o sursă în bibliotecă referitoare la greva din Lupeni&#160;:( Ţin minte că am citit un articol în "Magazin istoric" parcă în care se spunea că greva a fost provocată de NKVD şi Comintern (după modelul celei de la Tatar-bunar, vezi şi articolul din Ziua: <a href="http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=1999-08-08&amp;id=29346&amp;ziua=38a9daf3f06b30b8731a310e1ab51ffc" class="external free" title="http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=1999-08-08&amp;id=29346&amp;ziua=38a9daf3f06b30b8731a310e1ab51ffc" rel="nofollow">http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=1999-08-08&amp;id=29346&amp;ziua=38a9daf3f06b30b8731a310e1ab51ffc</a>).
