<dd>Thank you for your reply. Rosser does not quite count as notable on her own steam; this has been discussed on WP before; the reference you provide is to a polemical website, which is not permissible per policy; and the sole reference to Bidwai is that he is one of the people who writes for a media distribution organisation that Rosser says also sent out anti-IDRF literature. Nowhere near good enough, on those several grounds.</dd>
<dd>I confess I had not heard of Bhatnagar's periodical; a closer look at it suggests that it is an online periodical; in addition, I looked through a few articles and I find it hard to classify as anything but a 'partisan website'. Finally, it merely mentions Bidwai in passing as one of a group of people who used the term 'genocide' for Gujarat. I really don't think that that counts as 'spreading misinformation' rather than holding a disputable opinion about the scale and nature of the events.</dd>
<dd>Sourcing criticism of Bidwai that meets wp:blp should not be difficult; surely someone in outlook or india today has criticised him.</dd>
<dd>Finally, if you have doubts about any of this, please seek another opinion on the BLP noticeboard. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A second look at Bhatnagar's website reminds me: wp:blp, as I quote above, says 'material used in self-published website should never be used'. Bhatnagar's website counts as such. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please don't use the word 'ban'. I don't want to ban anything, but wp policy enjoins on all of us to determine what meets the bar for inclusion.</dd>
<dd>Rosser's discussion is on a website called letindiadevelop.com. This is a fairly clear partisan website. Also, as I said, the reference to Bidwai is that he write for SACW, nothing else. This does not meet the bar.</dd>
<dd>(You raise an interesting point about Fox. Fox News may be partisan, but it doesnt quite qualify as a 'partisan website'. crooksandliars.com or its equivalent on the right might. Fox News is a large news corporation with editorial oversight.)</dd>
<dd>Partisan groups can be quoted, if their opinions are reported in multiple reliable sources. So if several reliable sources say "Bidwai is an ass, or at least the BJP say so", please include it.</dd>
<dd>Goldberg wrote a highly notable book that, IIRC, topped the NYT bestseller list. This is automatically notable. (Sadly, that means even Ann Coulter and Moore are notable.)</dd>
<dd>michaelmoorehatesamerica.com is the website of a notable film.</dd>
<dd>Finally, please note that if you find somethinig else that is a violation of policy, that is not a justification. In fact, you should remove that&#160;:).</dd>
<dd>Very simply, the onus is on you to find major criticisms that tackle him by name and directly, and are in multiple reliable sources. If Bidwai can get published in RS, then surely his critics can. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 09:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Taking your points one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bidwai has made some heavily incendiary remarks against Hindus, targeted at Hindus in a broad sense, that have encouraged violence against Hindus and encouraged discrimination against Hindus. These remarks border on hate speech. That much is clear</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Possibly, but you'd have to source that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Those remarks have provoked a response from certain parties who have been bold enough not to be intimidated by Marxist threats and intimidation tactics</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right. But those responses would have to be reported on in reliable sources.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>For the sake of balance in the article, those responses need to be stated on the grounds of quotability and notability. Since Rosser has academic qualifications her criticism is certainly notable enough for mention.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We are not interested in balance per se, which could be subjective. We are interested in the balance of reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>Several individuals have academic qualifications. That does not make them automatic experts on everything. If Rosser was a tenured academic in South Asian Political Science, or if she was writing in a peer-reviewed journal, then her words would be given due weight.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Rosser does not make ad-hominem attacks against Bidwai, so libel issues don't apply. She is not defaming him, merely criticizing his position.We can talk about Bhatnagar separately (he is, in fact,a prolific contributor to multiple periodicals, and heads io, which is more than an "online publication").<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdsmight_81ba.html" title="User:Birdsmight">Birdsmight</a> 09:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It does not matter if you feel that the attacks are not ad hominem. The problem is that they are not in a reliable source. They are in a partisan website. Simply put, that is not allowable in this biography. There's no way around it.</dd>
<dd>I don't see this Bhatnagar website as anything but a self-published website, and a partisan one at that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>wrt your statement "If Bidwai can get published in RS, then surely his critics can". In an ersatz-democracy like India, that is not the case.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately we on wikipedia can't do anything about that. There are multiple reliable sources outside India to choose from as well, even if you believe that India does not have a free press.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I think that your case has not been made. If you are concerned, take it to the BLP noticeboard. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 09:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of the content of this, it is not sufficiently well sourced, and must go. WP:BLP is not negotiable. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 09:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You say:<i>BLP is not being violated here as there is no defamation of character..</i></dd>
<dd>No. BLP is a policy applying to all articles. We do not judge if there is defamation. The policy applies to all articles, whether or not you or I think that defamation is occurring. I have pointed out to you above the multiple way in which your sources violate BLP, regardless of whether you think they are defamatory or not. I must ask you to remove them now, pending finding alternatives. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 09:59, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr Birdsmight, with due respect i have full right to edit and diplay what is factually correct with respect to Chittisinghpura massacre. And why are u so much worried.....?</p>
<p>Chill man, learn to accept the truth.Even u know who did it? dont u?</p>
<p>Dude, where am I showing hatred or disrespect to Hindus? I respect Hindus and Hinduism. But the fact the Hindu millitants/terrorists carried out the Chiitisinghpura massacre is very much true. So if u attribute some acts of violents to Muslim or Sikh Millitants, that doesnt make u Anti-Muslim or Anti_sikh. The problem is U cannot digest the fact those terrorists were Hindus.....the whole world knows that.Man u cannot accept the fact even Hindus can be terrorists. Even Bajrang Dal is a Hindu terrorist org....isnt it my dear. i am willing to make the article a bit neutral....but u cannot attribute the acts to Islamic millitants .....when theres die hard evidence by Mr Clinton and the New York Times that Hindu terrorists were behind the attack. And perhaps u wud be knowing better than me if u r part of that ideology</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently, Gstar4 has not scrolled down and read the bottom part of the article. It says there that Clinton made an error. Also, if Gstar4 reverts one more time at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chittisinghpura_massacre.html" title="Chittisinghpura massacre">Chittisinghpura massacre</a> or makes a personal attack, I will block him. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 18:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had checked out the situation before I came to your talk page. I was referring to the fact that he made 3 reverts in the past 24 hours to that article. Another revert, and he's blocked. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 18:30, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Birdsmight,</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that I appreciate your efforts on this article. Something else you might want to look at is the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalistan_movement.html" title="Khalistan movement">Khalistan movement</a> article. I originally rewrote both these articles about two years ago. But after that I was deployed to Iraq and I wasn't really able to keep an eye on the article from there. The <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalistan_movement.html" title="Khalistan movement">Khalistan movement</a> article still needs more work. I was wondering if you could keep an eye on it as well? We could perhaps work on both of these articles together; keeping an eye out for POV and such. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivin_8731.html" title="User:Vivin">vi5in</a><sup><a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivin_12b2.html" title="User talk:Vivin"><font color="green">[talk]</font></a></sup> 16:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
