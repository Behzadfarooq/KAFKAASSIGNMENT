<li>Sorry about that, my mistake. A whole bunch of anonymous IP editors have been adding spam links to the page recently, so I mistakenly assumed that this was another one. Anyways, I readded the link, it's a good article.

<li>No worries! Spam links? That's crazy! Like the usual viagra stuff? Or spam from trip providers? I thought the jewlicious link was good because they blogged about the trips they led. I went on one and now I live in Israel (joining the IDF in November!) so maybe I'm biased, who knows.</li>

<p>My edits were removed on the grounds of "blogs are not verifiable sources." If that were the case, then all those articles citing boingboing and slashdot would be "unverifiable." Anonymous blogs, if they are well-written and compiled and cite <i>their sources</i>, are verifiable. Especially if their information has multiple independent attestations.</p>
<p>In this case, the blog I cited explains exactly what happened, and what the participant felt (among others). I am the author of the website in question (note: the website began when I specifically did NOT have an axe to grind with Zionism), and the website qualifies as a <b>primary source</b>. Furthermore, the source website is factually accurate on other posts, and it refelcts commonly-held sentiments that Taglit-birthright organization wishes to ignore.</p>
<p>Participants of even mild intelligence comes to similar conclusions. The blog is a primary source, and it accurately reflects certain criticisms particpants have.</p>
<p>Now, I know this makes it hard for Taglit to advertise its indoctrination methods online, but that's the way things work in a democracy with free speech. When someone disagrees with you based on facts, the criticism sticks.</p>
<p><br />
One last argument, most of the people who look at this article are likely to be prospective participants. If that's the case, why hide the criticism from them? Do you think your indoctrination won't be as effective if they know going in the caveats to the trip? What does Birthright have to hide from a little criticism? --Behemoth101 19:12, 8 December 2006 (UTC)Behemoth101</p>

<p>I should also add that this is not an NPOV dispute because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>-the author of the survey (I) entered into the Birthright trip with an open mind, and did not have a particular grudge against Israel (hence the acceptance to go on the trip). The participant's (my) disappointment is not "biased" because the participant (I) grew up in a conservative Jewish household, and attended regular Judaic/Hebrew instruction and was Bar Mitzvah'ed. The author is a Jew who clearly knows about Judaism and clearly is interested in religious/spiritual reflection and not Israel-centric political ideologies.</p>
<p>-the author speaks for several other members of the same trip who did not publish their opinions out of fear or lack of motivation.</p>
<p>-"Samuel G. Freedman is a journalist and currently a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

He has also won the National Jewish Book Award in 2000 in the Non-Fiction category for Jew vs. Jew, and The Inheritance was a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize." (from Wikipedia article) --Behemoth101 19:13, 8 December 2006 (UTC)Behemoth101</p>
<p>Just because the source "entered... with an open mind" doesn't mean it's not in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Your edits, as currently framed, were clearly in violation of that rule. Without a doubt, a lot of what you're trying to stay has some basis in fact. the very name of trip, "<b>Birthright</b> Israel" implies a Zionist slant to the trip. That being said, you've framed the argument as a condemnation rather than as an observation. If you can clean up the language so that it is neutral, it would certainly be acceptable. -- <b><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChabuk_81ec.html" title="User:Chabuk">Chabuk</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChabuk_849e.html" title="User talk:Chabuk">T</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chabuk_38b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chabuk">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 22:04, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Forgive the apparent "language slip-up," but there is nothing about the term "birthright Israel" (which is frequently and casually used by trip organizers) that suggests a POV bias. However, I listen to what you say on that issue so long as the rest of the section remains. I have also adjusted some of the language to fit more closely to your concept of neutrality.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe the User: Chabuk is truly concerned about presenting a balanced article about Taglit-birthright given his/her repeated exclusion of ALL critcisms of the program. If anyone is concerned with the veracity or "framing" of the criticisms, then he or she may research them him/herself and edit them as he/she sees fit. There is no rule against making something clearly labeled as a "criticism" a condemnation so long as it adheres to the facts. The criticisms don't come from thin-air, they are real. Simply eliminating any mention of them does not solve the problem of article neutrality. If someone wishes to refute the criticisms, then by all means, add a "controversy" section to the article, and we can work from there.--129.119.162.40 22:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)Behemoth101</p>

<dd>I agree with chabuk. There certainly are problems with birthright Israel, but this is not the place for our personal thoughts on the experience. Using shadowy language of "some critcisize" for "I cirticize" doesn't make it less of a personal opinion. It's a fine line between opinionated condemnation and factual destription. For example to call the KKK racist/white supremacist *is* condemnatory, but also not a violation of NPOV. What's at issue isn't the bias of the trip, to say that taglit has a secular zionist agenda is totally true and fair, however a launch into an essay of "why taglit is evil" is a fish of a different color. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishJew_f584.html" title="User:IrishJew">Avraham</a> 10:36, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate the surprising effort to compromise. I will make my edits in the next day or so.</p>
<p>However, I must say, you left out a lot of the important concerns. You are right that these criticisms are PROBABLY not representative of the MAJORITY of participant views, but since when should the majority viewpoint have exclusive authorship privelages in an encyclopedia? The majority of Encyclopedia Britannica contributors in centuries past wrote about how Africans adults were all "impure, culture-less savages" and psychologically "child-like". You should not equivocate majority opinion with truth, although the two do have a correlation with scholarly sources (that is, once we get past the issue of "who is a scholar?"). One might argue that most Birthright participants are not mature enough to reflect a scholarly consensus about the program. I would bet that most are not old enough to resist peer pressure to conform, and therefore they are being brainwashed to think what they are instructed about Taglit-birthright's program, Zionism, and Israel.</p>
<p>Your proposed are also correct in assuming that secular (nationalistic qua idolatrous) ideologies are rejecting and replacing religious Judaism, but you cleverly omit the provocative, controversial things (such as the IDF soldiers acting as salaried courtesans). BTW, my email survey has been quoted on a number of websites, and it qualifies as a germane, verifiable source. There is no reason why the Salon.com article or the Freedman quotes post should be struck from the page as well.--129.119.162.40 01:33, 9 December 2006 (UTC)Behemoth101</p>

<p>The birthright trip has been criticized by some participants as misrepresenting its goals in order to promote a biased propaganda message soliciting secular Jewish support for the State of Israel (See also: <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bait_and_switch.html" title="Bait and switch">bait and switch</a> advertising method). Evidence for the various critcisms stem from first-hand participant accounts and the trip program's administration and financial support.</p>
<p>One particularly controversial variant of the criticism is the trip's reported subordination of Jewish religious, spiritual, and ethical issues in favor of promoting a secular, political Zionist agenda. According to at least one source, trip organizers are specifically instructed to create top of mind awareness of Israel when participants think about Judaism, by any coercive pressuring means necessary.[1] Further support for this claim stems from the trip's main financial contributors' secularist leanings and documented involvement of The Jewish Agency of Israel, an organization that facilitates immigration to Israel[2][3]. It should be noted that secularist ideas in Judaism, particularly those ideas asserting: "Jews need not be observant to be considered good Jews so long as they support 'Jewish causes'" are widespread phenomena in many western states.</p>
<p>A common criticism of the trip involves allegations of trip organizers advocating Jewish-supremacy, separatism, and promotion of <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbara.html" title="Hasbara">Hasbara</a> within participants' countries of residence.[4]</p>
<p>Another criticism of the program is the program, despite its goal to establish "Jewish identity" and awareness of Jewish concerns, avoids discussions of salient, problematic identity issues concerning Jews in Israel (particularly along Palestinian topics such as the Palestinian <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_of_return.html" title="Right of return">right of return</a>). Critics allege that many speakers and leaders on the trip take an anti-intellectual or reductionistic stance on fundamental mid-East policy, encouraging deference to western Jewish political leaders instead of individual consideration of issues. A related critcism is that the birthright trip is unconcerned with balanced discussion, rather with "just showing Jewish kids a good time." Taglit-birthright supporters argue that the inclusion of intense discussions problematizing such issues would compromise the trip's stated objectives.[4][5]</p>
<p>Others claim Taglit-birthright inadvertently employs speakers who espouse factual errors and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>A final controversial criticism is one source's documented claim that many <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Defense_Force_4a4e.html" title="Israeli Defense Force">Israeli Defense Force</a> soldiers assigned to mingle with participants along the trip admitted to having been "briefed" or "encouraged" to indulge in lascivious activities with the participants in order to make the experience more "memorable." Taglit-birthright's official policy is that IDF soldiers are included along the trip to socialize with participants and answer their questions about Israel.[5]</p>
<p>Most, if not, all of these criticisms reflect the negative view that Taglit-birthright is used by Zionist proponents as an unscrupulous, deceptive tool for imposing secular, political beliefs on impressionable Jewish youths. As such, much of the program experience is predictably offensive to individuals who refuse to consider themselves <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist.html" title="Zionist">Zionists</a> or those who oppose the principles of Zionism. Non-secular and secular <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanist.html" title="Humanist">humanist</a> Jews have published their disapproval of Jewish organizations' de-emphasizing or even rejection of traditional Jewish ethics/values and subsequent super-ordination of Zionist political values developed over the last century.[6]</p>
<p>It is important to note that these criticisms have received little to no public mention from proponents of the program.</p>

Chabuk, I knew I had you pinned. You obviously are not concerned with the structure of the article, because I used an unbiased format. Even if I did, Wiki verifiability rules state that you may omit "unverifiable sections" and tag them in the comments for discussion, which you haven't done. You have eliminated THE ENTIRE SECTION, your blatant and uncompromising domineering on this subject leads me to make one conclusion: your biased intersts have gotten the better of you. The structure of my argument is not the part that you see as not belonging - since you obviously haven't cited anything in the rest of your article. You are concerned with the content.

<p>Even the section Chabuk approved has now been deleted. This act demonstrates how there is an uttler lack of good faith on the part of the other contributors. The goal with your edits has been unabashed political propaganda.</p>
<p>There is no question that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. However, this article is flawed because it misrepresents Birthright Israel's agenda. Proponents and adminstrators of the program have themselves admitted to a hidden agenda. This problem must be addressed for the description of Birthright Israel to be objective. --66.69.211.12 09:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)Behemoth101</p>

<dd>Total outsider's view - that criticism section seems ridiculous. Just because someone on a blog has criticised something, doesn't mean that has to be incorporated in the article. For example, every major politican will be subject to criticisms by bloggers or individuals in letters to newspapers etc. We don't reference such trivial matters in their biography. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 21:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>5-1. I don't see why this was taken seriously at any point. Blogs of this type are clearly <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. To suggest that one person's disappointment with his trip is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notable</a> is ridiculous, especially when he has an entry on his blog entitled "<i>Biased Wikipedia article - CALL TO ARMS!</i>"<a href="http://kampfeblog.blogspot.com/2006/12/biased-wikipedia-article-call-to-arms.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://kampfeblog.blogspot.com/2006/12/biased-wikipedia-article-call-to-arms.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> wherein he solicits readers to create one-use Wikipedia accounts solely to back him on this issue. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbratton_1026.html" title="User:Dbratton">Dbratton</a> 18:23, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>While I agree the past criticisms sections here have been crappy, it's not like criticisms of Taglit are lunatic-fringe material. There definitely needs to be <i>some</i> discussion of the controversies surrounding Taglit. —<a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a><sub><small><i><a href="../../../r/u/a/User_talk%7ERuakh_024e.html" title="User talk:Ruakh">TALK</a></i></small></sub> 03:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BTW, I myself have been on Taglit, loved it greatly, and have encouraged many others to go. I'm not trying to push an anti-Taglit POV; I just think that a balanced article needs to note the existence of controversy, as it's really not a minor point. —<a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a><sub><small><i><a href="../../../r/u/a/User_talk%7ERuakh_024e.html" title="User talk:Ruakh">TALK</a></i></small></sub> 03:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well said, Ruakh. You have exercised considerable NPOV in this discussion. Can I please ask that you spearhead this new criticism section? It's nothing new that people of mild intelligence find flaws in the Birthright campaign, and it's certainly not a huge leap to make to argue that Birthright is principally concerned with Israel (Zionist) political advocacy. --71.42.119.67 12:45, 3 January 2007 (UTC)Behemoth101</dd>

<dd>I would definitely agree that a criticism section would not be out of place, under the assumption that reliable sources can be found.

<dd>It seems dead to me: the pro-Criticism-section people seem to have given up on inserting an unsourced or unreliably sourced section, and the anti-Criticism-section people will presumably accept a reliably sourced Criticism section (assuming it's not ridiculously long) once one is provided. —<a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuakh_eb74.html" title="User:Ruakh">Ruakh</a><sub><small><i><a href="../../../r/u/a/User_talk%7ERuakh_024e.html" title="User talk:Ruakh">TALK</a></i></small></sub> 02:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
