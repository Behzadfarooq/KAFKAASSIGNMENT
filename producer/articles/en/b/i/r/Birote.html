<p>The site of Birote was previously called Bermang, meaning "very beautiful place". Another name was Danna, which means "high place".</p>
<p>There are several theories for the origin of the word <i>Birote</i>. One holds that it is derived from two words: <i>beer</i> (wrestler) and <i>wet</i> (place). These eventually evolved to become <i>Bi+rote</i> or <i>bee+rote</i>. In the past Birote was famous for wrestling and related sports. Another explanation is that Birote is a combination of two other words: <i>bee</i> (twenty) and <i>rote</i> (bread).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
