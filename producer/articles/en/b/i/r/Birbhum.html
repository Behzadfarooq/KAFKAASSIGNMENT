Birbhum district in West Bengal</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Birbhum</b> (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_language.html" title="Bengali language">Bengali</a>: বীরভূম) is a district in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bengal_be5b.html" title="West Bengal">West Bengal</a> state of India. It lies at the middle of the western border of West Bengal right below the narrow waist of the state_name. Birbhum is the northernmost district of "Bardhaman Division" -one of the three administrative divisions of the state_name. Called by the name of "The land of red soil" Birbhum is famous for its topography and cultural heritage which is unique and is somewhat different from that of the other districts in West Bengal.</p>
<p>Birbhum has a dual blend of bushy plateau (<a href="../../../c/h/h/Chhotanagpur.html" title="Chhotanagpur">Chhotanagpur</a>) terrain from the west with its partly migratory tribal (<a href="../../../s/a/n/Santhal.html" title="Santhal">Santhal</a>) anthropological components, that gradually merges with the alluvial plainland terrain with stable farmer communities towards the east, and is cyclically dried and flooded by the rain-fed rivers like Ajay and Mor. Ridden with this geo-anthropological diversity this land has given birth to many cultural and religious movements in history. As a single district it harbours the largest number of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti_Peethas_e1ad.html" title="Shakti Peethas">shakti peethas</a> exemplified particularly by <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakreshwar.html" title="Bakreshwar">Bakreshwar</a> and Tarapeeth. <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visva_Bharati_University_381e.html" title="Visva Bharati University">Visva Bharati University</a> at <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiniketan.html" title="Santiniketan">Santiniketan</a>, established by <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabindranath_Tagore_9e00.html" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, is one of the places Birbhum is internationally renowned for. The star attraction of many of the famous festivals of this district, including <i>Pous mela</i>, are the safron clad <a href="../../../b/a/u/Baul.html" title="Baul">bauls</a> singing their deep philosophical songs in the local dialect along with playing their folk music typified by the indigenous instrument called <a href="../../../e/k/t/Ektara.html" title="Ektara">ektara</a>.</p>

<p>The name Birbhum comes probably from the Land ("Bhumi") of the Brave ("Bir"). Some have opined that the district bears the name of Bir kings who ruled in the area. "Bir" in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Mundari_language.html" title="Mundari language">Mundari language</a> means <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forests.html" title="Forests">forests</a>. Therefore, it could also mean a land of forests.</p>

<p>The area now known as Birbhum was inhabited from pre-historic times. Some of the archaeological sites related to Pandu Rajar Dhibi of chalcolithic remains are located in Birbhum.<a href="http://banglapedia.org/HT/A_0068.htm/" class="external autonumber" title="http://banglapedia.org/HT/A_0068.htm/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Stone age implements have been found at several places in the district. According to Acharanga Sutra, the old <a href="../../../j/a/i/Jainism.html" title="Jainism">Jain</a> book, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahavira.html" title="Mahavira">Mahavira</a>, the last (24th) great <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirthankara.html" title="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>, had wandered through this land ("pathless country of <i>Ladha</i> (<a href="../../../r/a/r/Rarh_region.html" title="Rarh region">Rarh</a>) in Vajjabhumi and Subbhabhumi") in the 5th Century, B.C. According to some historians, the spread of the Jain religion in the Rarh region was synonymous with the Aryanisation of the area. <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautam_Buddha_308a.html" title="Gautam Buddha">Gautam Buddha</a> probably traversed this area to go to Pundrabardhan and Samatat (inferred by Dr Atul Sur, based on <i>Divyabdan</i> - a Buddhist text).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rarh_region.html" title="Rarh region">Rarh region</a> was part of the <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurya_empire.html" title="Maurya empire">Maurya empire</a>. It was subsequently included in the empire of the imperial Guptas, of Shashanka and of Harshavardhana. After dismemberment of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harshavardhana.html" title="Harshavardhana">Harshavardhana</a>’s empire, the region was ruled by the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pala.html" title="Pala">Palas</a> till 12th century AD, when overlordship of the area passed into the hands of the Senas. During the rule of the Pala dynasty Buddhism, particularly the Vajrayana cult, flourished here. In 7th Century A.D., the Chinese traveller, Wang Chuang, described some of the monasteries he visited.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Senas were staunch Hindus and ensured the dominance of the religion in Bengal.</p>
<p>The 13th century witnessed the advent of Muslim rule in the region. They destroyed most of the remaining Buddhist monasteries. However, Muslim control over the western parts of the district appears to have been nominal, and the area was ruled by the local Hindu chiefs, known as the Bir Rajas. The three towns of Hetampur, Birsingpur and Rajnagar contain their relics.</p>
<p>Minhaj i Siraj, the author of the <i>Tabaqat-i-Nasiri</i> mentions about Lakhnur, the headquarters or <i>thanah</i> of the Rarh <i>wing</i> of the Muslim rule and an important frontier post. The location of Lakhnur, though still not exactly identified, falls in Birbhum.</p>
<p>Mythologically the forests of Bajrabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities. According to historian Dr. Atul Sur, the solitude of the less populated jungles of Bajrabhumi made it an ideal place for sacred rituals.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some old authors have called Birbhum by the name Kamkoti which relates to its tantric heritage. Bhandirban was the ashram (hermitage) of Bibhandak Muni (sage). Rishasringya Muni lived in Siyan, and Shitalgram was the place of Sandipan, Garga and Durbasa.</p>
<p>Tantrics (including the <a href="../../../v/a/j/Vajrayana.html" title="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a> Buddhists and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaktas.html" title="Shaktas">Shaktas</a>) established many temples for <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantra.html" title="Tantra">tantra</a> sadhana rituals and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti.html" title="Shakti">Shakti</a> worship. Birbhum has many <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti_Peethas_e1ad.html" title="Shakti Peethas">Shakti Peethas</a> such as Bakreshwar, Tarapith, Kankalitala, Lavpur, Fulberia and Nalhati. Prior to 1856 AD <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baidyanathdham.html" title="Baidyanathdham">Baidyanathdham</a> / <a href="../../../d/e/o/Deoghar.html" title="Deoghar">Deoghar</a> was within Birbhum.</p>
<p>Out of the numerous <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti_Peetha_c5b0.html" title="Shakti Peetha">Shakti Peethas</a>, Tarapith/ Siddhapith is the most famous. One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was Bamdev, popularly known as Bama Khyapa. The actual stone idol, which is kept hidden at Tarapith, is decapitated, probably bearing the signs of rave of the Muslim rulers.</p>
<p>During the time of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> there was no existence of any administrative unit by the name Birbhum till 1787, and this area was administratively a part of <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murshidabad.html" title="Murshidabad">Murshidabad</a> district. In 1787 when the official designation "District Beerbhoom" started the District was much bigger and included "Bishenpore" or <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishnupur%2C_West_Bengal_99f8.html" title="Bishnupur, West Bengal">Bishnupur</a> (now part of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankura_District_afaa.html" title="Bankura District">Bankura district</a>) till 1793. Till <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_rebellion_of_1857.html" title="Indian rebellion of 1857">1857 Sepoy Mutiny</a> Santhal Pargana was also part of Birbhum, the district thus sprawled up to <a href="../../../d/e/o/Deoghar.html" title="Deoghar">Deoghar</a> in the west. The immediate reason then for separating the western tribal majority areas was the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santhal_rebellion.html" title="Santhal rebellion">Santhal rebellion</a> of 1855-56, which was quelled with the martyrdom of Sidhu and Kanu in Birbhum.</p>

This area lies at the north eastern end of the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chota_Nagpur_Plateau_ef6f.html" title="Chota Nagpur Plateau">Chota Nagpur plateau</a>, as it slopes down and merges with the alluvial plains of the Ganges. The western portion of the district is historically known as Vajjabhumi or Bajrabhumi from <i>bajra</i> meaning thunderbolt or strong and <i>bhumi</i> meaning land. It is an undulating, generally barren, upland. The comparatively more fertile eastern portion, constituting the northeastern Rarh region, merges with the Gangetic plain. Vajjabhumi is also included in the Rarh region, and rest of Rarh is called Sumha to differentiate it from Vajjabhumi.</p>

<p>Important geographical features in Birbhum are the <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khoai.html" title="Khoai">khoai</a> (eroded undulated patches of barren area), the red, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Laterite.html" title="Laterite">laterite soil</a> (<i>ranga mati</i>), with palm trees visible from a long distance and multiple protected forested areas on the western side.</p>
<p>Although the majority of Birbhum is rural, in recent times, it has been the site of many development projects such as condominiums and gated communities for people from numerous urban centres in West Bengal. This has raised many issues. Some fear that these projects do not take into account the lives of the local people and that this will threaten the natural environment for which Birbhum is so renowned for.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birbhum.html" title="Edit section: Rivers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rivers</span></h3>
<p>The rivers of Birbhum are: Ajay, Mor (<a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayurakshi_river.html" title="Mayurakshi river">Mayurakshi</a>), Bakreswar, Kopai, Dvarka, Brahmani, Hinglo, Chapala, Bansloi, Pagla etc. A project on the Mayurakshi (Mor, a tributary of Ganges), that includes the Tilpara Barrage (near Siuri), provides irrigation for about 600,000 ac (2400 km²).Almost all the rivers originate higher up on the Chota Nagpur plateau and flow across Birbhum in a west-east direction. These river are furious during the monsoons but shrink during the dry summer months. The cyclical rotation of drought and floods of the rivers destroy lives and property, and adds to the cruelty of life in the region.</p>
<dl>
<dd>“The Mayurakshi is famous for its strong current. For seven or eight months in the year the river is a desert – sands stretching from shore to shore for a mile and a half. But when the rains come, she is terrible, demoniac. She races along, four to five miles wide, her deep grey water swamping everything within reach. Then comes once in a while the Harpa flood, when the water, six to seven cubits deep, rushes into villages nearby and washes away homes and granaries and all else in its way. This does not happen very often though. The last time was about twenty years ago.”</dd>

<p>The climate on the western side is dry and extreme, but is relatively milder on the eastern side. In summer temperatures can shoot above 40 degrees celsius and in winters it can drop to around 10 degrees Celsius. It receives annual rainfall of around 1,300 mm, mostly in the monsoon months (June to September). The dry plateau feature makes the land in the west less fertile compared to the plains in the east. Agriculture is dependent upon the rains in monsoon or has to be supplemented with irrigation in other seasons.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the geology of Birbhum stems from the gradient of red soil.</p>
<p>If one looks at the soil map of India one will notice that actually the Rarh region has laterite soil (type 28 in the map), and the Vajjabhumi has a different kind of sandy hard red soil of the <i>alfisoil</i> type (type 21 in the map).</p>
<p>Birbhum has some mineral reserves that are relatively unimportant in the national context but are important locally. Coal, China clay, low grade iron-ore and granite are mined in west Birbhum.</p>

<p>The red soil and the shallow serpentine rivers ridden with sand islands have inspired the poets from this land. Many poets of Vaishnav and Shakta Padavali fame were born in this land, as for example, Jaydeb, the celebrated author of <i>Geetagovinda</i>, and Chandidas (Rami).</p>
<p>The folk culture of Birbhum is specially enriched with the contribution of <a href="../../../b/a/u/Baul.html" title="Baul">bauls</a>, their philosophy and their songs. Baulism is a religiously liberal philosophy and lifestyle which might have some links to Sahajiya movement of 16th Century A.D. (derived from Sahajyan, a form of Vajrayana Buddhism, influenced also by Vaishnavism and Sufism). Chandidas and many other poets were part of the Sahajiya movement. The Bauls earn their living by singing and collecting alms. They accommodate people from any caste and creed. Rabindranath Tagore was inspired by their philosophy and patronized them actively. Birbhum has also been home to famous kabiyals, kirtaniyas and other folk culture groups.</p>
<p>The many fairs of Birbhum starts with <i>Pous Mela</i> (from 7th <i>Pous</i> onwards) at Santiniketan and follows through the Bengali month of <i>Pous</i> (spread across December and January) till <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makar_Sankranti_a2b4.html" title="Makar Sankranti">Makar Sankranti</a>. Particulalrly lively is the fair at Kendubillo, with the participation of bauls, the itinerant singers, in large numbers. Birbhum has a number of other major attractions. The temple and hot spring at <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakreshwar.html" title="Bakreshwar">Bakreshwar</a> is famous and draws in pilgrims from far and near. Tarapith attracts pilgrims throughout the year. It has many old temples with delicate decorative tiles made of terracotta (burnt clay).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birbhum.html" title="Edit section: Gramdevta">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gramdevta</span></h3>
<p>In addition to being a confluence of Vaishnav, Shakta and Saiva cultures, Birbhum villages also observe prehistoric customs like worship of gramdevta (<i>gram</i> means village and <i>devta</i> means deity) in many forms at different places.</p>
<p>One form of gramdevta is Dharma Thakur, symbolized by a stone, worshipped mainly by Bauri, Bagdi, Hari, Dom etc. castes. According to the Dharmapuran, even kings worshipped Dharma Thakur. In some places there are festivals called Dharmer Gajan. According to some authorities, these are transformed old deities and <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totems.html" title="Totems">totems</a> which continued even after these castes accepted Buddhism as a result of the oppression by the higher castes. Later on these old deities were equated to either Shiva or Buddha.</p>
<p>Another Gramdevta is Manasa who might have been a transformation of the feminine snake totem to a form more acceptable to later society. Vajrayana Buddhists had an equivalent of Manasa named <i>Janguli</i>. In <i>Manasamangal</i>, the house made for Lakhinder was on top of Santhal Pargana mountains, which is historical part of Birbhum.</p>

<p>One of the most popular village outdoor sports in this area used to be "danguli" or guli-danda (literal meaning "ball and stick") which is somewhat equivalent of "goli danda" in North India but doesn't involve a "guli" i.e. ball, instead a spindle shaped wood (small stick with two ends sharpened) is used as a ball. The spindle shaped small stick is kept on an uneven surface and is tumbled off ground by hitting with a long handled stick (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danda.html" title="Danda">danda</a>) and then hitting again a second time to pitch it to a long distance. However, in recent times <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> has replaced some of the popularity of this game, partly because danguli used to create eye injury as the most frequent sports accident. Another sport that can be played both outdoors and indoor, and still popular among children here is "marble", which involves projecting a striker bead with fingers to hit an ensemble of black or green glass beads. It is a kind of an aerial version of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrom.html" title="Carrom">carrom</a>, which itself is a locally popular indoor game. In addition to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> the other most popular outdoor sport of this district are <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabadi.html" title="Kabadi">kabadi</a>.</p>
<p>One traditional village level religious team sport of Birbhum is "baich khela" which is a competition of taking the whole idol of goddess <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga.html" title="Durga">Durga</a> and her companion icons on bamboo supports and carrying it around with lots of lightings ("hajak lights"), dhak (drum) beat and fanfare all around the village.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/a/n/Santhals.html" title="Santhals">Santhals</a> living in and around Birbhum are good archers too and have many a time reached the national level of all India-archery competitions.</p>
