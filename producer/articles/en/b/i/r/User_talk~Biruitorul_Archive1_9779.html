<p>Hello! I`ve got one request for you. I collect words in various languages. Now I`m looking for word "sugar" in other languages, but I can`t find an Aromanian dictionary. I`ve got counterparts of word "sugar" in Japanese, Ahmaric, Thai, Georgian and Chinese, so can you write me what is "sugar" in Aromanian language? I`ve got this word in 298 languages and dialects of many regions and countries in the world so it is very important for me! Thank you very much! <b><a href="../../../../pl/s/z/o/Wikipedysta%7ESzoltys_f433.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Wikipedysta:Szoltys">Szoltys</a></b> <i><a href="../../../../pl/s/z/o/Dyskusja_Wikipedysty%7ESzoltys_2425.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Dyskusja_Wikipedysty:Szoltys">&lt;talk&gt;</a></i></p>

<p>Yes, thanks for doing this. A lot of the texts that "disambiguated" to names without diacritics predated the switch over to Unicode.

Buna,</p>
<p>A inceput un vot pentru stergerea <i>"Wikipediei Moldovenesti",</i> o creatie a unui Evreu-American, cu origini suspecte in Basarabia si care nu vorbeste limba wikipediei la care pretinde a fi sysop. Il cheama <i>Node ue</i> si pentru a crea impresia ca lumea doreste aceasta wikipedie, a apelat la toti utilizatorii rusi care au venit sa voteze de partea lui desi nu cunosc bine subiectul si li s-a spus ca <i>voteaza pentru supravietuirea alfabetului chirilic</i>. Asa a ajuns ca votul sa fie 31 pentru stergerea Mo wiki, si 42 impotriva stergerii - deci in alte cuvinte pentru pastrarea wikipediei in limba <i>"moldoveneasca"</i>. Vino si voteaza aici<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects#Closure_of_Moldovan_Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects#Closure_of_Moldovan_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> , ca sa sergem acesta creatura cu miros bolshevic, care insulta toti romanii de pe ambele maluri ale Prutului. Node ue le-a spus rusilor sa traduca mesajul lui in limba rusa si sa-l transmita mai departe. Trimite si tu mesajul acesta la toti utilizatorii romani-unionisti sau romani-moldoveni unionisti pe care-i cunosti pe en.wiki sau ro.wiki. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConstantzeanu_48f0.html" title="User:Constantzeanu">Dapiks</a> 23:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a long time past so I suppose my remarks will be irrelevant but:
<ol>
<li>Yes, this is an accurate description of Node and his conduct.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, specifically contacting people you expect to be on one side of a debate is not appropriate conduct, even when the other side has already done this. It's perfectly appropriate to try to reach all interested parties. It's not appropriate to try to stack the discussion. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 23:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Dear Biruitorul,</p>
<p>The First Consul Napoleon was ambiguous in creating an order that was not an order... The Legion of honour. Now should we regard this a body of man and write " The first awards <b>in</b> the <i>L√©gion d'Honneur</i> .. " or should we regard it as an order of knighthood or even a cross and write " The first awards <b>of</b> the <i>L√©gion d'Honneur</i> on 16 August 1804 at the camp of Boulogne"? It is the consul, that great political wizzard, that created this dillema. I have thought about it, considered it, and concluded that a man was appointed into this body of men. Maybe the Dutch language where people are made knights IN an order of knighthood inspired me.</p>
<p>I can live with your intervention but how do we phrase he French "Chevalier de la" in English?</p>

<p>I think those were good edits you made and I see no reason to revert. Thank you. What do you think of the article as it stands now? The <i>Jurnalul Na≈£ional</i> article linked to at the bottom has a couple of good images, but those are probably copyright. Other than that, if you know of any way to improve it, please do so. Eventually, an article on the WWI bombing should also be written.</p>
<p>On an unrelated point: I posted a version of this message to <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a>'s talk page but he appears otherwise engaged at the moment, so perhaps you could offer some advice:</p>

<dd>On the Bombing: why is it called <i>Bombing of Bucharest‚Ä¶</i> when it's really <i>Bombing of Romania</i>? Other than that, I think it's a good start. We could probably go into more detail about what was lost (wasn't this when the National Theatre was damaged beyond repair?); we could certainly say more about how this fit into the war tactically and strategically; there is a lot more to be said from the Allied side; and there's a question I put on the talk page, but I think you have gotten this off to a really good start. We should get this one onto <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a>, if we can find a good "hook". - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, and sorry for not replying sooner. I am going to get to doing that in the coming hours, but I was wondering if we have covered all info on bombings over Romania: do we have info on Soviet bombings and their frequency as well? (All I have in the way of that is the colloquial and rather absurdist story my grandma told me on how American planes she saw were cool-looking silver arrows, while the Soviet ones were winged tractors...) I can also add some info on Axis bombings, which I have referenced in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bucharest_55d5.html" title="History of Bucharest">History of Bucharest</a>. I'll let you and Jmabel know when I'm done.</p>
<p>I'm also due with a reply on the noticeboard, but, since we seem to agree with the spirit of future edits, it is only a minor suggestion that I'll add here. You suggested referencing 1990 to "See also", which may, however, still induce that the two are intimately connected; what I propose instead is adding a short reference to them inside the body of text, in the section reserved for summarizing the Revolution (which we are bound to have), as a paragraph indicating what the demonstrators considered themselves to be fighting against. That should please all sides. As for the pre-1947 situation: I think mention of resistance against the Groza gvt will, in fact, "write itself", as, if the regime was not established, opposition was (so, yes, a comprehensive section to the resistance's "prehistory" is a very good idea - perhaps as "Opposition to the Groza government" or some other such title).</p>
<p>A minor request, Biruitorul: when replying to me in Romanian, please use the informal "tu". I believe I have been only too informal for me to deserve a "dumneavoastra". Cheers. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 17:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, tagging that as a minor edit was a late-night mistake on my part- sorry about that. I'm glad that my edit helped to balance the section, which frankly was, to speak euphemistically, a bit rose-tinted previously. Whether the people of Romania were largely in support of the Allies I cannot say- but the fact is that that country was providing massive (and <i>enthusiastic</i>) support to Nazi Germany in terms of troops, war materials and most disgracefully, by their active participation in the Holocaust (cf., for example, Italy). Bucharest was a very fair target (if one can argue that deliberately bombing civilians can ever be considered "fair"- the practice is inherently disgraceful, but that is a separate point).

<p>Hi and sorry for the late reply. I did some minor edits on the article (including removing the reference to <i>Magazin Istoric</i>, which I believe should be more specific - article, year, month). For the titles: we have them on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Romanian_ranks_and_titles_d69b.html" title="Historical Romanian ranks and titles">Historical Romanian ranks and titles</a> (I took the liberty of removing the equivalents given on Mircea's page, since they show up in the list or will show up in the article; some of those need merging with their Slavic or Greek equivalents - I have kept <i>logofat</i> as an individual link, which may or may not redirect to <i>logothetes</i> - I personally think it should redirect). For the number: I support the view that numbers be assigned only to those rulers who do not have a differntiating particle (such as "Ciobanul"), since numeral usage is, IMO, highly unorthodox for the local context; that said, I would either not count Ciobanul, but only those Mirceas whom we cannot otherwise tell apart, or count all but not assign Ciobanul a numeral (as in school when learning arithmetic, I would "keep it in mind"&#160;:)).

Still, when the time comes, I'll gladly support you, and the fact that our politics couldn't be much farther apart should presumably make my support count for something. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:54, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Biruitorul</p>
<p>I have resized the flags so they should now have the same size (the right one is effectively 20px + two borders of 1 px each so I resized the left one to 22px). I agree that the template looks better if all four presidents are located on the same line, but all four articles already look this way on my screen. If you feel there are any more problems feel free to mail me again.

<p>√én 17 septembrie va fi referendum √Æn Transnistria legat de independen≈£a regiunii. Cu aceastƒÉ ocazie probabil multƒÉ lume va cƒÉuta pe Wikipedia informa≈£ii despre Transnistria. Am √Æncercat sƒÉ adaug √Æn articol ni≈üte informa≈£ii legate de acest referendum, anume:</p>
<p>- faptul cƒÉ mai multe organiza≈£ii antiseparatiste au lansat un apel la boicotare, consider√Ænd referendumul "farsƒÉ"</p>
<p>- faptul cƒÉ din 46 de ≈£ƒÉri membre ale Consiliului Europei, 45 s√Ænt √Æmpotriva recunoa≈üterii referendumului, numai RUsia are altƒÉ pƒÉrere</p>
<p>- faptul cƒÉ datele Comisiei Electorale Centrale din Tiraspol au fost schimbate √Æn mod ciudat, anume numƒÉrul total de alegƒÉtori s-a mic≈üorat cu 7% fa≈£ƒÉ de 2005, ceea ce ridicƒÉ suspiciuni asupra unei √ÆncercƒÉri de cre≈ütere artificialƒÉ a prezen≈£ei la vot prin raportarea unui numƒÉr mai mic de alegƒÉtori √Ænregistra≈£i.</p>
<p>Totdeauna am dat lincurile care dovedesc cele scrise de mine, n-am nƒÉscocit nimic din burtƒÉ.</p>
<p>Userul William Mauco, care pare fan Tiraspol, mereu mi-a ≈üters adƒÉugirile. (vezi istoria paginii)</p>
<p>Pute≈£i vedea la pagina de discu≈£ii Transnistria ce argumente a adus. Anume: ƒÉia care cer boicotarea referendumului din Transnistria s√Ænt fo≈üti KGB-i≈üti, cƒÉ a≈üa zice o organiza≈£ie ruseascƒÉ de analizƒÉ (a dat un linc pentru asta). √ént√Æi a spus cƒÉ respectivii nici nu s√Ænt din Transnistria, ci doar din Basarabia, dar i-am dovedit cƒÉ unii dintre semnatarii apelului la boicot s√Ænt transnistreni. Am fost √ÆmpƒÉciuitor, i-am zis cƒÉ n-are dec√Æt sƒÉ adauge pƒÉrerea organiza≈£iei ruse≈üti cƒÉ antiseparati≈ütii s√Ænt fo≈üti KGBi≈üti, cƒÉ n-are dec√Æt sƒÉ-i considere pe cei care vor boicotarea referendumului drept bƒÉie≈£i rƒÉi, dar faptul √Æn sine, cƒÉ s-a cerut boicotarea referendumului, trebuie men≈£ionat. Degeaba, mereu mi s-au ≈üters adƒÉugirile - pentru celelalte 2 fapte nici n-a adus argumente.</p>
<p>A mai fost o adƒÉugire care a ≈üters-o, despre arestarea a 4 persoane din Transnistria care s√Ænt √Æmpotriva separatismului (√Æntre timp li s-a dat drumul). √én cazul ƒÉsta am renun≈£at eu sƒÉ mai insist pentru includerea informa≈£iei √Æn articol (de≈üi informa≈£ia e incontestabilƒÉ), tocmai fiindcƒÉ n-am vrut sƒÉ mƒÉ cert prea mult.</p>
<p>√én perioada asta c√Ænd agen≈£iile de ≈ütiri vor men≈£iona referendumul de la Tiraspol, se va citi articolul Transnistria √Æn Wikipedia poate mai mult dec√Æt √Æntr-un an √Æntreg. De aia acum e nevoie sƒÉ existe √Æn articol informa≈£ii despre contestarea corectitudinii referendumului. Nu cer sƒÉ se men≈£ioneze ca adevƒÉr absolut faptul cƒÉ referendumul e incorect, ci doar cƒÉ existƒÉ unii (OSCE, 45 din 46 ≈£ƒÉri ale Consiliului Europei, unele organiza≈£ii din zonƒÉ ≈üi din Basarabia) care considerƒÉ asta. VƒÉ cer de aceea sprijinul ca sƒÉ interveni≈£i pe pagina de discu≈£ii Transnistria pentru a sus≈£ine rƒÉm√Ænerea informa≈£iei √Æn paginƒÉ ≈üi sƒÉ repune≈£i informa≈£ia atunci c√Ænd Mauco o ≈üterge (eu nu pot sƒÉ verific chiar 24 de ore din 24). Evita≈£i atacurile suburbane, pƒÉstra≈£i ton civilizat. mul≈£umesc.</p>
<p>Who is William Mauco Here is an article about a Wikipedia celebrity, William Mauco, and his relations with the International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS), an organisation "which seems to be a front organisation for a Kremlin-backed rogue statelet called Transdniestria" (quote from the article) <a href="http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D" class="external free" title="http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D" rel="nofollow">http://0.bypass-filter.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2Vkd2FyZGx1Y2FzLmJsb2dzcG90LmNvbS8yMDA2LzA4L2dvdGNoYS0yLmh0bWw%3D</a></p>
<p>Edward Lucas wrote about Mauco: "The other lead is William Mauco. He has an extensive record of posting intelligent and fairly neutral entries on Wikipedia, not only about TD but about other unrecognised statelets. Crucially, these predate ICDISS's birthday of January 2006. And he also claims to have been at their conference in Mexico City in April of this year. I have written to him asking to get in touch, and had a friendly email in reply. I am planning to follow up this research in an article in European Voice at the end of August, so watch this space!"--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariusM_97ae.html" title="User:MariusM">MariusM</a> 09:47, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great stuff. I will add them in. I notice you added some&#160;?? after confusing words: I suppose by "Hitler's terror in Romania" they mean the National Legionary State (which the Allies tended to dismiss strictly as Nazi puppeteering); the M. in front of his name I guess stands for "mister" (I recently got hold of some issue of <i>Viata Romaneasca</i>, and they use "D." instead of "Domnul").

<dd>Hi. Well, I had thought of a way to put the mention about his industry serving the Nazis in one way or another (since the accusation was launched at him in this way), without excluding the possibility that he was forced to do so. The article you cite is pretty sketchy, and does not exclude, for example, the possibility of him having ceded part of the ownership (like Krupp and others did in the context of German corporatism-partnership). In fact, I think we have an even more intriguing possibilty: note the fact that he was prosecuted for his part in the rebellion, and that no mention is made of whatever happened with that (while other articles seem to indicate that nothing happened); I'm ready to assume that the Germans said "awright, guys, we're taking over the case, you go about your business" (he still had a faboulous fortune at the end of it, apparently).</dd>
<dd>The mention of his fortune's size is certainly to be included, and I'm sorry for not having done it already (it's just that I got lost in all the details).</dd>
<dd>On a sidenote: I believe that the widespread perception of the Iron Guard as a Nazi puppet unwittingly offered a moral getaway for a lot of Romania's contribution to the history of murder. What is really frustrating is that, since this was usually a "progressive" thesis, a lot of people have chosen to abide by it blindly - which allowed a lot of original crap in Romanian politics to be excused by alleged foreign influence. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:16, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Man, you're fast: I duck out for a piece of cheese and you've fixed my typos before I can look for them. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. I hope the cheese was to your liking. If I may bring up a couple of unrelated points, though: first, thank you for including the <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Neruda_61c3.html" title="Pablo Neruda">Neruda</a> death citations. However, I wonder to what extent, if any, we should mention possible regime implication in his death. The three sources I found became progressively more sinister, so to speak, with the third claiming up-front that the doctors had been ordered to stop his treatment. I wonder if there's a more absolutely authoritative work on this, or if the cause of his death remains a matter of speculation to some extent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed the implication. Since I didn't have the books at hand, and frankly don't know a ton about Neruda other than his poetry and a broad outline of his life (the article certainly says far more than I knew before I started working with others on the article, and I haven't done any real research) I wasn't going to try to expand on this. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:25, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The other matter has to do with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_I_of_Romania_d8e1.html" title="Michael I of Romania">King Michael's</a> title. If we take <a href="http://dhost.info/webtips/bani/1914-1940.htm" class="external text" title="http://dhost.info/webtips/bani/1914-1940.htm" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="http://dhost.info/webtips/bani/1940-1947.htm" class="external text" title="http://dhost.info/webtips/bani/1940-1947.htm" rel="nofollow">coins</a> as accurate, then it would appear that he (and possibly his predecessors) was King of Romania until 1930, and that his father changed the title to King of the Romanians when he came to power, which Michael kept when he was restored. I suppose the article should reflect that, but I'll wait for your opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBiruitorul_cab6.html" title="User:Biruitorul">Biruitorul</a> 03:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll admit to being relatively uninterested in the distinction. As long as it's cited. I know Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French rather than "of France" and of course there are historical titles like "King of the Germans", but in this case it seems to be a purely verbal distinction. In Napoleon's case, clearly there was an intent to declare the French to be a single people, whereas pre-revolutionary France had been more decentralized, and a Breton, for example, might not have called himself "French"; I don't see any parallel change in the construction of Romanian nationality at this particular time, but I suppose I could be missing something. It seems rather arbitrary. Did it have any significance that you can see? (Somehow, I doubt he‚Äîor the regents‚Äîdid it just to annoy ethnic minorities.) - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:25, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good points (I had originally changed it to "Sadoveanu year" because I did not know in what precise sense it was used - "the year Sadoveanu was most productive" vs. "the year when Sadoveanu was most celebrated" - and this seemed to me to cover both senses). That article is actually on my to do list (part of the content now needs rephrasing and expanding, and much more detail needs to be added - fortunately, I have the sources for it). If you have access to Calinescu, you could perhaps add more on Sadoveanu's oevre (I only have the utterly stupid compendium at home, and the original memorial plate-sized book is an awkward thing to borrow); the article as it was when I reviwed it used only third-rate criticism. As I have mentioned, I could references from <i>Viata Romaneasca</i>, but that is a massive task and would take me a while.

<p>I think it is probably the best one possible. The article does need some work (such as being placed in context), but it's good overall.

<dd>Absolutely. I have made the same point at the since-deleted-template discussion. (Add to this that Romanian, albeit "official", is not a working language for the Latin Union... so it is roughly equivalent to the official status of French in the Yukon and the official status of Swedish in Karelia). I'm afraid that if I go ind delete it, all I get is the aggravation I got on the "templates for discussion" page, so I'd rather support a move by you than apply it myself for now. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:44, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi.

The IP cites the existence of quoted sources: however, none of those edits deals with sources. I do not want to turn that article into a battleground: I had enough troble removing a certain Romanian POV; I want that article to be trully neutral, and a coalition of users with an agenda has been formed against me. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:56, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you.</dd>
<dd>On the People's Tribunal issue: I have little familiarity with the topic, but in case I find something, I'll add it there. I am currently going to do major work on the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_Communist_Party_0a21.html" title="Romanian Communist Party">Romanian Communist Party</a> article, and may find some information to add to other articles.</dd>
<dd>You are definately right about Codreanu's charisma, and probably right about the personal conflict between him and the king. However, I have two sources saying that Carol was ready to collaborate with Codreanu, and that, up to a certain measure, so was Codreanu (which would make the conflict weigh much less than the American journalist leads us to believe); not only that, but Carol left the Guard all alone and fine at a crucial moment in the early 30s (almost like telling them "if you kill a prime minister in this country, you'll never be bothered again"). The matter is much more complicated than that, and the journalist's testimony is also questionable for having been written in 1942 (when the info from inside Romania was distorted, and when Western opinion of Carol was unfair). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:17, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the parties' issue: I hadn't actually seen that discussion - I had edited the Parties' List at around the same time without knowledge of the fact. I'm glad I could help, and I want to help in the future, so, in case this expands on other pages, keep me posted. I figure that the list now covers all parties that survived for more than one day between 1859 and 1989 (except for some obscure Popular Fronts the PCR created itself in the 1930s, which I could not keep track of and are likely to be irrelevant). In any case, I plan to turn many the red links into blue in the future.</p>
<p>On the Codreanu topic: I agree with the way you present things. My point was minor in relation to that - even if this was the background, they continued to try and find common ground until Codreanu made himself useless (btw, sources show that, in 1937, the Guard's appeal was much reduced). In fact (and the Guard will never admit to this), Sima and Carol got along just well in in 1940, until just before the Diktat - after negotiations, there were Legionnares in the government. The competing solutions while Codreanu was alive were: a. the king as leader of the legion, Codreanu as leader of the government; b. the king as father figure, Codreanu as doer. Carol rejected a), Codreanu rejected b). This certainly indicates a personal conflict, but I think the American journalist is a bit harsh and quite inaccurate (as he should have been, having reduced information on the matter); I also have some reservations about sourcing that publication (I do not reject sourcing it on principle - I'd just rather look for something reaching the same conclusion). However, writers such as Nagy-Talavera do support something along those lines: the thing about Talavera is that I only have access to the Ro version of his book (and I would feel like a putz referencing it on en wiki). I will look for more sourcable information on the matter, and, in case you come accross it first, feel free to include it.</p>
<p>Man, I'm really happy that you contribute to wikipedia. You are a paradigm of fairness, respect, and competence in editing. We obviously have some major differences in personal political opinions, but it is hard to find people with as much dedication to NPOV as you (and, hopefully, I myself have not let my political views shape my edits). Interesting that we are to edit topics related to the Peasants' Party: if you'll permit me the comparison, we are wikipedia's Mihalache (me) and Maniu (you)&#160;:). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 22:27, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry I took so long to reply. I agree that the infobox does not really belong with defunct parties (except, perhaps, one reduced in size to mark the essentials alongside the party's symbols). On the original questions raised in connection with the PNT and the PNTCD, I really don't know what to say: I could go either way, except the lazy me wants to say "merge" (because to delete is easier than to rephrase, cut and paste, and switch around).</dd>

<dd>I too think the Dutch model is best (I especially like the "per ideology" aspect of it - although, god help me, I don't know where to place several inter-war parties... consider the PNT or the PND...).

I have alluded to the humanitarian ventures in the Codreanu article (one use of this was to write down the exact references for this,so that I may revisit them and add detail to the party article). On the other hand, I'm not sure what sort of relation the PNC had with the Church (except for the name and pompous ceremonies attended by prelates and everybody else).</dd>

<dd>Sorry to have abused your patience again.</dd>
<dd>The mainn problem I see with the PNT issue is that the PNTCD article currently looks like crap, so we may eventually be called on by some editor to do something about it. The point you make about the PNL is good indeed, and I have used the same tactic for the <a href="../../../p/s/d/PSDR_d526.html" title="PSDR">PSDR</a>; I don't know, however, what title the PNT page should have (do you favour PNT over PNTCD, with PNTCD as a title for a section of the article? I tend to do so, but I'm not married to the concept in case you object).</dd>
<dd>Geat work on the template. If any, what icon would you use for the defunct parties template?</dd>
<dd>I was thinking the same about the PCR members. The problem, though (aside from looking into what the law says), is to find and coin an explicit, short, and objective title for the category if we are to apply that principle (from my experience, mentioning, in a header for the category, the criteria applied is usually not enough for those users who are either not paying attention or not agreeing to the criteria used - so the title should be self-explanatory if possible).</dd>
<dd>I have changed the sentence in the Codreanu article: thanks for pointing it out. As for the PNC: I don't know if the notice is really stringent. Having "Christian" in the name does not imply a relation with the BOR (it has, I guess more to do with - on one hand - Cuza's mix of racialism and his brand of Christian traditonalism in defining Jews, and - on the other - the pure need of the two parties to contribute each a word to the new party's title - National Agrarian gave National, Christian Defense gave Christian). I don't know if I'm correct in assuming that you consider mentioning the lack of PNC-BOR links to prevent people from wrongly guessing that the PNC was a representative of clerical fascism (I saw you additons on that article, and I agree with them). That would be a good reason in itself, but the fact is that "Christian" added to a party's name was already omnipresent in all sort of politics by then, without those groups being related to any church (including other fascist parties who were not clerico-fascist - while many to most clerico-fascist parties would not call themselves "Christian"). And, after all, who knows? perhaps the PNC did strive for some sort of a relation with the BOR, and a mention that specific would wrongly dismiss the possibility of that. There is little detail anyone knows about that party: I have tried to find some relevant information on the <i>LƒÉncieri</i> for some time now, and never could; I have even asked people who, although young, are supposed to have seen them around back in the day - all they have answered is "who?". Hopefully, in time, we will fill some gaps.</dd>
<dd>Interestingly, my family has had no pro-PNT members that I would know of. One great-grandfather I know of was a Poporanist, but voted for Gh. Bratianu and eventually, like all [the many] Poporanists who survived, turned communist. One grandfather was an unusually supportive of the Ploughmen's Front as a youth, then lived the communist illusion for a couple of years. His wife supports the PNL, and so did her entire family from 1923 onwards. The other grandfather probably supported the Iron Guard, but was then the first peasant to join the collective farm... (being poorer than the standard set by collectivization to begin with, he could only benefit from it).</dd>
<dd>In case you're visiting articles that relate to Straja Tarii somehow, could you please drop a link for it in them? It is currently an isolated article. Many thanks. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 18:10, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We agree completely on the PNT issue. I am preparing myself to begin adding information from the other end (working up from 1926), but I want to clarify related articles first (Mihalache, Madgearu, Averescu) - hence, I'll get to do something for the Carol article in time.</dd>
<dd>For the template: there is one more problem with chronological criteria. If you were to only list parties by when they surfaced, then the template would fail to list relevant parties in their most relevant period (for exampple, the PNL would only go in the 1870s etc); its value as an information source for the unfamiliar reader would thus be diminished. We either have the alphabet or listing them by moment of establishment without separating them into periods.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for providing the criteria. Hopefully, no one will contribute article on persons who were editors of <i>Femeia</i> or for the chiefs of Militia inspectorates (we would have to prioritize including them over including, say, Istrati). With this exception, the criteria work fine (though I'm still ambivalent about the title - picture someone creating the "members of..." category to include "activists", and us wasting time at the Articles fo discussion page asking Anglo-Saxons with short attention span to mind the particular developments inside Romania).</dd>
<dd>"If only Wikipedia had been around in the 1930s." - Don't say that. It would make us and our edits useless. (Although it could have probably prevented Stalinism...)</dd>
<dd>Interesting family story. I have something to match: my grandfather, who, despite being a communist, was not a politruk (he does not seem to be covered by the law) told me stories on the communist greats, which he met on several occassions. If I am to believe him, he was present at the round table when Dimitrov visited Romania, and heard his speech proposing (again) that Romania and Bulgaria unite. He also says that he happened to be present at a CC meeting (where he was sent to report on some task) the day Dej was investiganting reports that Ceau≈üescu had fired a pistol against a crowd protesting around Slatina (he says that he witnessed the whole debate, and saw several leading politicians suggesting that Ceau≈üescu be demoted - only for Dej to stand up for him).</dd>

<p>The latest related issue: since the list at the bottom of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_Communist_Party_0a21.html" title="Romanian Communist Party">Romanian Communist Party</a> was clogging the article,I expanded and rationalized the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Romanian_communists_0462.html" title="List of Romanian communists">List of Romanian communists</a>, partly using the criteria you so kindly furnished. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotop_3508.html" title="User:Dpotop">User:Dpotop</a> added Emil Constantinescu back in; I find the additon irrelvant myself, but would comply with it if the law were to apply to him as well. The quotation you provided ends in an "etc" - is there a chance that he is included in the "etc", in those after "etc", or [in case I failed to notice] even before the "etc"?

<p>Hi. I have worked out my draft and willpost it on the sandbox. The modifications I have made:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single template for 1856-1947 (part of the reason is having dropped several party links, as explained below - thus making the 1856-1918 template list only two distinct parties)</li>
<li>removing parties - as per links in list; you see, it is highly improbable that we will get accurate and in-depth info (or in some cases coherent and credible sources) about those parties that are not links in the list (and, even if we do, most of them can adequately fit in the articles for the parties they split from or in those for the persons who started them); in case I'm wrong about some, they can always be added; also, these are not in fact all the parties founded during the period(s) - I found only the most skematic info about parties such as a <i>Partidul Arian</i>, a <i>Partidul CetƒÉ≈£enesc Durostor</i>, <i>Partidul OstƒÉ≈üesc</i> etc., which I don't think we would/should ever be having articles on. Granted, some just as minor parties do have articles now, such as the "Italo-Romanian..." sausage - but I've bumped into them when I started contributing here, and only tweaked them to include info from an article in <i>Jurnalul</i> (only o bump into minuscule references about them in Veiga, which actually claim very different stats for the groups)</li>
<li>tweaking ideologies - turned "fascist" into "fascist, corporatist, and far right" (a broader definition, which allowed me to include the FRN under there, as well as to cover the POV of those who say that the Guard was not exactly fascist etc); used "socialist et al." only for the explicitly socialist groups (I've moved the FP and the PTS to "agrarian", using the same main attribute criteria you seem to have used for keeping MADOSZ and the German Party under "ethnic minority"); I've moved the League of Patriots (this is the title under which we should have the link) to "other", mainly because the only proper ideological category for them would be "incoherent self-seekers".</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope I haven't forgotten something. In any case,I willpost it there and we'll be discussing it when you have the time. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, one more thing: I have removed the PNR from "agrarian" (it not being agrarian was in fact the main problem the PNT was to have); sources are divided as to whether it was "liberal" (in the true sense, not in the Romanian "through us ourselves" paranthesis) or "conservative" - I thought about its main and original purpose,and moved it under "nationalist". <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:10, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the "socialist" thing was just an experiment: we could describe all of them as "socialist" of some kind or another, but I guess your idea is better. The reason I did not use bold was that some categories featured no boldable party; I preferred to leave the main, previously bolded, party in each as the first one mentioned (come to think of it, I wanted to switch them all around at some point, and I think I did that in some categories...). I think we can get that point across through another method: I'll edit in the template, and you tell me what you think. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 20:26, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's ok: if people are looking for specific information about the party, they can find it in the article. <s>One minor request: I notice that the templates are supposed to go at the very bottom of the page (after notes et al).

<dd>Cool. I was just wondering why the Portuguese article would be more comprehensive. I cannot help, unfortunately: I'm struggling with the PCR article and I plan to add an article on the 1946 elections (I've even made a cool map) - perhaps then Anonimu will stoop adding citneeded tags... I know, I promise a lot; but,since I'm focused on related topics, I'm moving towards expanding and improving the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Romania_7664.html" title="Kingdom of Romania">Kingdom of Romania</a> article as well (as part of the planned series of major edits on "Romania in..." articles). I'm going to ask for your input on some matters: it may eventually prove necessary to divide the "Kingdom of Romania" article along some lines ("main article" style), and I'm going to pick your brain on this and other issues. What say? (Sometime in the probably distant future) <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:43, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! It's really a very interesting and informative article and a very curious topic indeed! What I think can be improved are the two very short sections Magnitude and Deportation, which should either be expanded or their content should be merged with the rest in a different section of some sort. Indeed, more sources (and inline citations) would be fine, although I can't suggest a particular one, and of course additional details are always nice.</p>
<p>As for the Belene Island camp, the material I've used from the Bulgarian Wikipedia (<a href="../../../../bg/%D0%B1/%D0%B5/%D0%BB/%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5_%28%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%29.html" class="extiw" title="bg:–ë–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ_(–∫–æ–Ω—Ü–ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä)">bg:–ë–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ (–∫–æ–Ω—Ü–ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä)</a>) doesn't seem to be sourced, so yours seems a lot more trustworthy. I don't see anything wrong with the title: the article may well cover a little more than what it implies, but a good article should include background and additional information, so I think it's fine.</p>

<p>Hi. I first need to apologize for something: I had not seen your post on my page on October 16 (I think aqnother dit came right after yours, and I failed to register how much had been added).</p>
<p>Thanks for the invite to the debate: I've been checking it for a while, but I'm a bit too tired to grab a topic in there and chew on it. Perhaps later, if it continues.</p>
<p>The 1907 article is a good project indeed. I have little specialized sources to contribute, but I'll give it my best shot. Also, allow me to point out that wikisource currently hosts the verdicts of <a href="http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/1907_din_prim%C4%83var%C4%83_p%C3%A2n%C4%83%27n_toamn%C4%83" class="external text" title="http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/1907_din_prim%C4%83var%C4%83_p%C3%A2n%C4%83%27n_toamn%C4%83" rel="nofollow">Caragiale</a> and <a href="http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Neoiob%C4%83gia" class="external text" title="http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Neoiob%C4%83gia" rel="nofollow">Dobrogeanu-Gherea</a> (worth combing over, and good primary sources). I'm afraid there is nothing I can contribute on the topic of pre-1920s territorial divisions, or at least not unless I serendipously bump into some specific information (I was really pissed off some time ago when I noticed that no source mentioning x county in 18th century Wallachia will indicate how much it correponded with a county of the same name in 19th century Romania).</p>
<p>Thanks for the input on the Emil issue. Would you support removing him from the list pending more accurate criteria?</p>
<p>I see the said user removed some unsourced but specific info from Elena's page (I didn't look into it much, but I instantly agreed with him that at least the mention of how she forged "ALL her degrees" [sic] needed to be at least rephrased). That article needs serious copyedit, but, since I have always found topics involving that woman very disturbing, I'd hope you'll allow me to move it to the bottom of my priority list. His edit on Nicolae referred to a newer edit, which I guess he removed for being unreferenced and for adding no value to the text (and so it was). In any case, I've had the Nicolae page on my watchlist for a while now.</p>

<p>Cool. I guess it is settled about the date (we have two saying 23, not connected with each other). I'll make the change, but I'll add info from the other links later today (thanks, btw: I had bumped into some of them before, byt not into the interesting ones). I'd have to say that, with the template used for photos of such people as <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_Antonescu_4145.html" title="Ion Antonescu">Ion Antonescu</a>, that portrait would also qualify (but probably not for the <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a> proposal I made). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 05:30, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>the new constitution has a preamble which describes Kosovo as the part of Serbia. The new constitution has been modernized and is generally regarded as a good one. The current constitution was adopted in 1990 and therefore mentions Serbia as republic within SFRY. The new constitution has been postponed since 2003 and Serbian and Montenegrin Constitutional Charter. There is no mention of monarchy and there are low chances for this to happen especially with the current Crown Prince who doesn`t enjoy a very good image among Serbs and most probably among all minorities. New constitution also says that Serbia is a country of Serbian people and other citizens. The referendum will last for two days - 28 and 29 October.</p>
<p>Unfortunately constitution I can not find a translation of the new constitution. On the website of Government there is only a Serbian version&#160;: <a href="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/pages/article.php?id=56753" class="external free" title="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/pages/article.php?id=56753" rel="nofollow">http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/pages/article.php?id=56753</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Nu cred ca trebuie articole diferite referitoare la rev de la 1848 ptr ca toate cartile de istorie pe care le-am citit trateaza evenimentele sub numele de "Revolutia romana de la 1848" si in acest sens iti recomand cartea: "Revolutia romana de la 1848" de Apostol Stan unde sunt evidentiate si legaturile dintre revolutionarii romani din cele 3 provincii si unde se mai arata ca aveau ca scop comune: independenta si chiar unirea asa cum au cerut-o cei din Moldova.</li>
<li>De la prima enciclopedie romaneasca, Enciclopedia Cugetarea scrisa intre 1936-1939, "Istoria romanilor" de Constantin C. Giurescu , toate articolele de pe internet si cartile de istorie de la scoala, toate acestea trateaza Revolutia de la 1848 in ceea ce-i priveste pe romani in acelasi loc si nu separat.</li>
<li>Eu nu am inventat nimic nou ci doar am redat ideile exprimate de istorici.</li>
<li>Mai faci o mare greseala: revolutia din cele 3 provincii au avut legaturi foarte importane intre ele. Se vede ca nu ai citit nicio carte pe aceasta tema. Iti recomand ca un scurt exemplu articolul despre <a href="../../../../ro/i/o/a/Ioan_Buteanu_f52d.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Ioan_Buteanu">Ioan Buteanu</a> in care o sa vezi ca au existat legaturi intre revolutii. Te rog sa te documentezi mai mult si o sa vezi ca am dreptate.</li>

<dd>Forma actualƒÉ a articolului reflectƒÉ niste stereotipii romantice, conform carora daca asa a trebuit sa fie, asa a si fost. Constructia unei istorii nationale si ignorarea faptelor sunt procedee revolute. In aceeasi ordine de idei, mi s-a parut nostim sa-l vad pe Christian Tell (sas din Brasov) trecut ca unul din liderii revolutiei "rom√¢ne". Chestiunea este urmƒÉtoarea: unii au subscris idealurilor nationale burgheze si s-au alaturat proiectelor unor state nationale (indiferent daca apartineau etnic natiunii respective, ex. sasul Christian Tell, devenit revolutionar rom√¢n, generalul polonez <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Bem_f4f8.html" title="Josef Bem">Josef Bem</a>, aprig luptƒÉtor pentru cauza maghiarƒÉ etc.), iar altii n-au aderat la proiectul liberal de construire a unei natiuni civice, de cetateni egali, ci au dorit sa ramana in continuare ceea ce sunt - croati, romani, sasi etc. Mi se pare interesant ca si in prezent cei care bat moneda pe caracterul national al statului neaga celorlalte etnii drepturi specifice, la fel cum revolutionarii de la 1848 negau etniilor drepturi specifice. Conceptul iacobin de "egalitate" a fost si este interpretat in sens omogenizator, unificator, de stergere a oricaror particularitati si de "nation-building", chiar cu ajutorul aparatului de stat - prin maghiarizare, rom√¢nizare etc. - fenomene identice, doar cu sens opus. Cu alte cuvinte, cei mai aprigi demascatori ai maghiarizƒÉrii, sunt cei mai mari adepti ai rom√¢nizƒÉrii si invers. Cam atat despre miscarile revolutionare nationale. Pana la urma s-a ajuns tot la un proiect politic european (supranational), din pacate dupa ce in secolul al XX-lea niste capete infierbantate au incercat sa duca pana la capat conceptul national, prin epurari etnice, pogromuri si alte grozavii impotriva umanitatii. --<a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihai_Andrei_848b.html" title="User:Mihai Andrei">Mihai Andrei</a> 15:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I think the new stadtholder templates look excellent, apart from one consideration, which I will state below. I will make some minor corrections to start with, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've listed Philip I of Castile as Stadtholder of Guelders (I saw you added him on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stadtholder.html" title="Stadtholder">Stadtholder</a> page as well), This person should however be Philip of Burgundy (1465-1524), who in 1517 became <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Utrecht_efde.html" title="Bishop of Utrecht">bishop of Utrecht</a>.</li>
<li>In the template on the Stadtholders of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, I've added the link to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_of_Praet_5cbf.html" title="Louis of Praet">Louis of Flanders</a>.</li>
<li>From the list of Stadtholders of Overijssel, I removed <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Silent_7502.html" title="William the Silent">William I of Orange</a>, as he was never stadtholder there, as far as I know.</li>
<li>On the template on stadtholders of Groningen, I replaced <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Duke_of_Guelders_4828.html" title="Charles, Duke of Guelders">Charles, Duke of Guelders</a> with Karel van Gelre, who was not the duke himself but his (bastard) son.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one minor consideration is that the templates do not show what kind of Stadtholder we're dealing with. In the extreme consideration of Groningen, it shows subsequently stadtholders from the Duke of <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guelders.html" title="Guelders">Guelders</a>, the <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburgs</a> and the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_Republic_6e56.html" title="Dutch Republic">Dutch Republic</a>. The others show stadtholders from the Habsburgs and from the Dutch Republic. As some provinces even had two stadtholders at the same time during the early stages of the Dutch Revolt (a Habsburg and a rebel one), it might be interesting to show who is which. Do you think there might be a good way of showing this (and do you agree it is worth showing)? Anyway, good work! <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Antonius_63ae.html" title="User:Thomas Antonius">Tom</a> 11:00, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Biruitorul, Thank you for your confidence. I'm a bit busy lately, so making larger edits takes me a while. I have however made an attempt at changing some of the templates. I'm not very experienced with this, so there might be some things that look bad (I'm particularly not sure about the flags and the orange colour). Would you mind looking at them? <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Antonius_Sandbox_f5b6.html" title="User:Thomas Antonius/Sandbox">You can find them here</a>. These three contain most of the greater differences in design between all the templates. I would value your opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Antonius_63ae.html" title="User:Thomas Antonius">Tom</a> 16:35, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cool. The thing is that they expect direct references (notes) for a DYK article. I don't have more to contribute to that article,unless you mean to say that the references have some more detail that deserves to be added (I did not look through them); I don't think I have any material available on him (I may bump into some by sheer coincidence). I tried to find whether a text by Zamfirescu on him is available online (there may have been one, since the man wrote a lot of memoirs); couldn't find one, but I bumped into <a href="http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/cercet/Chindris/memoriale/83cartan.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/cercet/Chindris/memoriale/83cartan.pdf" rel="nofollow">this (biased) text</a> - check out the picture.

<dd>I'll also see if I can find something. You are obviously right about the in-line thing, but I'm guessing that's because the admins don't live up to their own standards... no, wait... I think I'm going to be a little more subjective and say that they let those two pass through without proper citations because the topics are <i>American-related</i> (whereas if you say that Badea C√¢r≈£an was actually a human and alive at some point in the 19th century, you'll have to be able to prove that claim - since these exotic things happened somewhere other than in America).

<dd>What I really can't understand is the superficiality of cliches: people are actually ready to believe that some laws of nature tend not to apply the farther one stands from Michigan or Sussex. They are ready to believe anything about Romania, and tend to fade away when the banality of events is being shed light on. There is much to say here: for example, in the battle for attention between Hungarian and Romanian nationalists, despite the fact that nothing would have happened in Transylvania were it not for President Wilson's poetry samples, and despite the fact that most Americans indicate that poetry to still occupies a central position in their patrimony, the Hungarians will tend to win because they have a more Romantic and more suicidal saga to tell. Romanians in fact play along: whenever a Romanian argues that Vlad was actually a hero (because Eminescu, Codreanu and Ceau≈üescu told him so), an angel loses its wings - aside from the fact that the point is lacking, the average Westerner isn't even going to see anything other than a confirmation of a prejudice (ie: a weirdo ranting about another weirdo, cause what else can they be doing out there).</dd>
<dd>What is really discouraging is that I've copyedited the entire Vlad article twice, only for two parties to battle their fantasies throughout it again and again. What was left untouched is apparently a large piece of plagiarism; somebody claimed at some point that he or she had approval to copy the text from idontknowwhatsite.com, but I feel I should ask that person "so what?!" (it's basically an indication that we are to reserve the basic researching and composing a piece of original writing for the colourful templates and the maniacal talk pages - and, if it's indeed ok to copypaste articles of the internet, a network that they share with wikipedia, why copy them at all?). I saw what you were reverting in the article: that was the second tv-based edit there, and it is just as stupid as the first one (that one was something a guy saw on some Sky documentary...). But, in case you want to see a bucketfull, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basarab_Laiot%C4%83_cel_B%C4%83tr%C3%A2n&amp;diff=51187740&amp;oldid=43707750" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basarab_Laiot%C4%83_cel_B%C4%83tr%C3%A2n&amp;diff=51187740&amp;oldid=43707750" rel="nofollow">check this out</a>.

<p>Thanks for the kind words. The good thing about expanding an article with referenced stuff is that you get yourself material for other articles as well. For example, the expansion of Barbu Stirbey (which is, indeed, a more than reasonable demand) has some material covered on <a href="../../../g/h/e/Gheorghe_T%C4%83t%C4%83rescu_c95e.html#World_War" title="Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu">Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu#World War</a>; as you noticed, I generally focus on improving one article at a time (or thereabouts), and Stirbey is a lot of work - I promise I'll give it a go in the future with what's available around the net and around chez moi.</p>
<p>The <i>Ziua</i> issue is indeed interesting, but we don't know yet if the phenomenon is noticeable enough (I didn't see any definite number on people returning); a more relevant part of the article would be the reclamation of property, but I cannot myself decide whether it is relevant enough for the community as a whole (I tend to stay away from contributing text on very recent developments).</p>
<p>Our original topic (sorry for the delay): the average Romanian also has no or a very distorted image of what is supposed to be his own history - an inner exoticism which makes the outer one understandable. Aside from the descendants of the Dacians on wikipedia, other utterly insane distortions to very simple facts abund among reasonably cultured people, to a point where I have to pine for the Dracula cliche. Just two examples, both from my recent history of tv watching, both (incidentally) on B1 and around the same topics (the Szekelyland and autonomy). One was a well-known journalist who said "the Hungarians are trying to steal everything,including our Iancu" - I was thinking "didn't they 'steal him' when he was alive, by making him their military leader and regent?". The other one involved the lawyer Pavelescu, who started ranting against a historian who, when addressing the issue of Romanian arrogance in the context of relations in Transylvania, told him that, among others, the Br√¢ncoveanu "resistance to conversion" is speculation based on misinterpretation - Pavelescu insisted that "Romanians need their myths" (which, although meant as collectivist patriotism, is in effect painfully condescending on the very people it "defends"). And think about how much presumpton and invention was always involved in creating and recreating our history - we used it to prove a point, not to record a fact (for one, the Dracula choice has to be between a vampire and a defender of the West - when it looks to me like the one verdict possible is "a demented walker-on who got very lucky for a very short while"). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 15:39, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hm. I just checked out your DYK on C√¢r≈£an: the thing is, I don't tink anyone actually took him for a stone-made Dacian, so you could perhaps rephrase that to "compared to" (or even something on the lines of <s>"hailed as"</s> "jokingly referred to as"). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 15:59, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. His wife's maiden name was Greenberg. Thank you for catching that mistake. 2. Her death was considered "tragic" in her husband's eyes in his autobiography <i>Appetite for Life</i> because she had died while they were vacationing in Paris in 1990.

<p>Sir, I must once again state my disagreement with your removal of a second mention of Menzies from the template. While I see your point, my own argument is based on consistency.

<dd>I don't really mind about those other templates, but it just happens that this is the way all of the Australian templates have been done for a long time (cf {{<a href="../../../v/i/c/Template%7EVictoriaPremiers_c971.html" title="Template:VictoriaPremiers">VictoriaPremiers</a>}}), and I think it works better. If you mentioned Menzies' second term, you'd have to mention Deakin's second and third terms, and Fisher's second and third terms, plus Hughes' second and third terms, which would get very complicated since they were consecutive, but are actually separate terms since he was leading three different parties.</dd>
<dd>It seems much easier to keep all that information at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Australia_3aa3.html#List_of_Prime_Ministers" title="Prime Minister of Australia">Prime Minister of Australia#List of Prime Ministers</a>, where there's space to fit it all in, and keep the template as a simple list. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 01:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excellent point. I will look into why that is (my current guess is that it was a gradual move, and sources may focus on either its beginning or its end).</p>
<p>Sorry for not replying on the rest of the topics. I believe they deserved a fuller answer, and was about to start writing it, but other issues kept coming up (and we seemed to bump into each other on countless pages). It is an interesting chat, and I promise I'll pick it up at some point.</p>
<p>Btw, thanks for redirects such as "<a href="../../../p/n/l/PNL-Bratianu_03db.html" title="PNL-Bratianu">PNL-Bratianu</a>": you halved the effort put into what is otherwise a dreary job. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 13:32, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm. For the Chamber leader vs. Prime Minister issue, you could go with <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_precedence_in_Romania_3c4c.html" title="Order of precedence in Romania">Order of precedence in Romania</a> (which implicitly indicates that the former is above the latter). I would favour PM always above FM myself, but I'm not married to the concept. In fact, perhaps we should consider moving FM data to an infobox or a succession box - eventually, we're bound to have more data on lists of various Romanian ministers, and infoboxes like that for <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ionel_Br%C4%83tianu_5b31.html" title="Ionel BrƒÉtianu">Ionel BrƒÉtianu</a> would become immense. Either that or draw a line after FMs (no Interior or Finance or Tourism). What say you? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 17:25, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if the order of precedence is short, I guess it is because, besides them having to call elections sometime before the PM steps in after all others get assassinated, all the ministers are inferior to the PM - and I guess that, if need be, we could just use the alphabet after PMs. Of course, for limiting the latter, the Offices of State proposal is an excellent parallel. Btw, it's not clear to me: where you in favour of the Head of the Chamber above PM per Order of Precedence, or were you proposing PM first?</dd>
<dd>For a bug in every system, I have to return to the Ionel paradigm: that man held <i>every</i> office, each of them <i>twice</i> at least... we could just make an infobox for an "everything"&#160;:).</dd>
<dd>The infoboxes... oh, man... the infoboxes... For the communists, I'm guessing they go with the "but not Jewish/Judaeo-Freemason/Zionist" cliche - and who better than GicƒÉ (who, as a bonus, also reaches out to the both Ceau≈üescu fans and haters)? Sure, they could have gone with Ilie Pintilie or RoaitƒÉ... but at least they didn't pick Ple≈üi≈£ƒÉ. It is perplexing that Maniu is a Christian Democrat and that Codreanu aims to represent <i>all</i> nationalists (except the non-radicals, if you noticed that blue infobox - I'd replace the "rad" symbol with a picture of Iorga or Take Ionescu, if I were them - thousands of Romanian conservatives would object to the latter being "one of them"). For Codreanu, it is almost like having a picture of Codreanu for "this user is a Romanian Orthodox" (or a picture of Charles Manson for "this user is a hippie"). Let us also note that Emperor Ionel stands for Liberals - although he only had the party name to back it... On the other hand, I find the infobox for socialist kinda heart-warming - we so often forget that very interesting dude and what he did.</dd>
<dd>The one infobox I am praying for on wikipedia and elsewhere is "this user abides by the principles of Titu Maiorescu". We need that as much as Americans need oil. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 23:55, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good point. To speculate, it may be that the two orders are the same in Romania (and probably extend further?). I cannot begin to find out where I should look this up, though.</dd>
<dd>Btw, since we are on the subject, I'm glad that at least they thought of moving <a href="../../../c/%C4%83/l/C%C4%83lin_Popescu-T%C4%83riceanu_Cabinet_e48b.html" title="CƒÉlin Popescu-TƒÉriceanu Cabinet">CƒÉlin Popescu-TƒÉriceanu Cabinet</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanian_Cabinet_1cbc.html" title="Romanian Cabinet">Romanian Cabinet</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 00:41, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I was involved in a quarell with ES Vic, as you may know, after having redirected it to the article on TƒÉriceanu - as in the <a href="../../../l/%C3%A9/o/L%C3%A9on_Blum_3d52.html#Blum.27s_First_Government.2C_4_June_1936_-_22_June_1937" title="L√©on Blum">L√©on Blum#Blum's First Government, 4 June 1936 - 22 June 1937</a> example, which I find particularly informative, better structured, and more easily accessible for the casual reader (if the casual reader who needs the particular info knows anything to begin with, that has to be the PM's name). Your example could do as well, I guess, but it is a bit more complicated, and we are missing a lot of relevant info for pre-1989 cabinets to create separate lists.</dd>
<dd>Alas, is in numerous other cases, ES Vic did not look before he lept, and too many Romanian users tend to believe themselves free from the constraints of common sense. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:03, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hallo Biruitorul! Te contactez referitor la articolul legat de pictorul George Stefanescu, tatal meu. Dupa ce am facut propriul lui site in Romania am descoperit Wikipedia pe care o consider un proiect superb. Am scris articolul despre tatal meu in romana dupa care am inceput incetul cu incetul sa descopar diversitatea uriasa de conexiuni si posibilitati ale Wikipediei. Traind in Romania in perioada anilor 60 - 70 am cunoscut personal oameni de cultura, am amintiri din acea perioada si o arhiva fotografica interesanta (vezi de pilda fotografia bisericii Ienei pe care am inserat-o in articolul referitor la cutremurul din 1977 - unde am inceput un articol referitor la monumentele arhitectonice care au disparut in urma cutremurului). Am inceput articole despre colectionari de arta romani, muzee din Bucuresti, pictori romani, localitati din Germania, etc. care au legatura cu articolul meu de baza. Al doilea pas a fost traducerea articolului in germana unde m-am descurcat pana acum bine avand la dispozitie o arhiva in limba germana si traind in doua lumi (Romania si Germania). Dupa care, pe baza experientei acumulate cu Wikipedia romana si cea germana am folosit o traducere din germana in engleza facuta de un traducator (asa zis specializat!!!) german din orasul in care traim in Germania. Nefiind un bun cunoscator al limbii engleze nu am putut sa fac mari corecturi. Asa ca te rog, ajuta-ma sa pun in ordine articolul (drag mie). Deasemenea poate ma indrumi ce sa fac ca sa raspund cerintei lui Jmabel care spune "a lengthy quote should be explicity attributed, not just footnoted+a few copy edits". Am la dispozitie o arhiva documentara suficient de mare pentru a face un articol suficient de corect, numai ca nu stiu inca toate cerintele din Wikipedia engleza. Citind toate articolele legate de cum sa scrii articole dureaza foarte mult pana cand gasesti exact ce te intereseaza. Este ca atunci cand inveti sa canti la pian; intai notele si dupa mult timp poti canta. Am incercat sa ma descurc cu Wikipedia in cele trei limbi prin metoda cautarii articolelor de calitate despre pictori si adaptarea informatiilor pe care le am dupa modelul respectiv. Sa stii ca sunt bine intentionat si ma straduiesc sa scriu articole cat mai bune, dar am nevoie de sustinerea unor specialisti in Wikipedia. Am vazut ca esti vorbitor nativ al celor doua limbi (romana si engleza) si ca te intereseaza proiectele legate de Romania. De aceea mi-am permis sa iti cer sprijinul. Cu multumiri Radustefanescugross 09:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Multumesc pentru frumosul raspuns. Mi-ar face placere sa-mi spui Radu pentru ca altfel ma simt prea in varsta pentru frumosul vostru proiect. Cunosc foarte bine lucrarile maestrului Bunescu. Pot spune ca am crescut cu ele. Tatal meu a avut si are o mare afectiune pentru trei maestri ai picturi romane; pentru Darascu care i-a fost profesor si prieten si pentru Bunescu si Ghiata. Lucrarile lor au fost intotdeauna "pe sufletul lui". Iti multumesc de ajutor si poate putem sa facem impreuna anumite proiecte. Eu am documentatie legata de pictura romaneasca si putin din lumea teatrului. Cred ca mai usor putem comunica pe mail. Eu folosesc doua adrese si anume la birou&#160;: radustefanescu@wsconsult.ro si acasa radustefanescu@gmx.de. Daca imi dai adresa ta de mail iti pot trimete datele care le consideri tu necesare pentru articolul despre tatal meu. Radustefanescugross 10:42, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While it's quite interesting that the prayer has been translated into this many languages, I think a simple note of that fact (the Jesus Prayer has been translated into over X languages...) would probably be more appropriate then a large list of full-text translations. Of course, these translations being available, you may wish to ask if some of the other language Wikis would be interested-if they're trying to write an article on this or translate this one it would probably be quite helpful to them! However, I do agree that such a list is probably a bit too long and cumbersome to belong in the article proper. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 05:18, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apparently, we have some misunderstanding here. The Bulgarian article says that the members of the 331-seat Senate (not the 331 members of the Senate) ratified it and notes that the Communists abstained. It doesn't discuss the number and the absent senators. I searched using Google for "–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—è —Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–∞", but none of the news articles I could find discusses the exact number, so tbe Romanian article sounds more reliable. <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Todor</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">‚Üí</a><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">Bozhinov</a></i> 12:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay. As it is those articles appear to have been created with a purpose in mind, and I'm not sure I agree with their relevancy to an encyclopaedia (their tone appears to be reserved - with or without Mikkalai's edits: perhaps one could reference the more subjective claims). I have tried to look into them, but did not have the time; and then, I noticed articles such as <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Romanians_in_Ukraine_41b0.html" title="History of the Romanians in Ukraine">this one</a>, and decided to give up altogether&#160;:). Perhaps at another time (you're doing a great job keeping them neat, btw).</p>
<p>On other topics: I cannot seem to find much on the 1907 rebellion, or, rather, I cannot find something that would bridge the gap between the sides, just various people who support some allegation or another. That is to say, we may get to expand on the legacy way more than on the actual events... Hopefully, something will come along. I know I also owe you research on topics such as the anti-communist resistance, but I was not able to look through <i>Memoria</i> (btw, we could use the online versions of their newer issues, although they appear to have since become ridiculously diversified and vague). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 15:39, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Sorry that I answer late. Thank you very much for your work in the article. Your observations are logical and I agree that we should decide on how to deal with this. I will try to summarize how I see one possible solution (of course I am open to any suggestions and modifications, that's exactly why I am telling you):</p>
<ul>
<li>merge <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathian_Ruthenia_89b3.html" title="Carpathian Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpatho-Ukraine_7b58.html" title="Carpatho-Ukraine">Carpatho-Ukraine</a>. They deal with the same thing: the area inhabitted by Rusins/Ukrainians/Boiko/Lemko/Hutsul on the inner slopes of the Carpathians. I see this article as containing (among other things) everything about their history up to 1945, as well as explanations of what Rusins/Ukrainians/Boiko/Lemko/Hutsul are. I don't see the reason for the existance of a separe article <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpatho-Ukraine_7b58.html" title="Carpatho-Ukraine">Carpatho-Ukraine</a>, because that formation existed only 1 day (15-16 March 1939), and its article is in fact practically a copy of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathian_Ruthenia_89b3.html" title="Carpathian Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a>. Of course, if someone writes a specific article about 15-16 March 1939, that would make sense. But noone hinders one to do this in the future. A separate article is desearved by the Subcarpathian Rus, the name of the autonomuous region of Czechoslovakia in 1920-1939, but again, someone would have to write a specific article about 1920-1939 politics/economy/events/population etc - that subject is covered very superficially so far on wikipedia, and again one can start such an article in the future. We can leave a note in the "See also" section of the merged article: <i>"If you have additional info, and want to create separate articles about the political entities of 1920-1939, 15-16 March 1939, please do, but when talking about info prior to 1920, link to this article (<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathian_Ruthenia_89b3.html" title="Carpathian Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a>) in order to avoid content forking."</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a> is a legitimate article that deals with the political entity: region of Ukrainian SSR, and later of Ukraine, so it should cover everything after 1945, and geography/economy/politics/etc, but not go too far into history, rather link to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathian_Ruthenia_89b3.html" title="Carpathian Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a> for that.</li>
<li>My impression is that the article <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a> would in time become bigger, so subthemes would be derived from it. I see the article <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Maramure%C5%9F_3e25.html" title="Northern Maramure≈ü">Northern Maramure≈ü</a> as one such theme. (Other such themes could be the Boiko region, the region inhabitted by Hungarians, themes about ecology and Carpathian mountains, themes for differnt cities, and obviously links to the pages of the historic counties Ung, Bereg and Ugocsa (the other 3)). When talking about history, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Maramure%C5%9F_3e25.html" title="Northern Maramure≈ü">Northern Maramure≈ü</a> will not focuss only on Ruthenians (ethnic group), but on Maramure≈ü (geographical region). In fact, you can talk about Ukrainians in Maramures only from 16th centruy on, unlike the rest of <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a>, so we are forced to talk about the region, not about an ethnic group. When talking about geography, population, economy, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Maramure%C5%9F_3e25.html" title="Northern Maramure≈ü">Northern Maramure≈ü</a> will only mention local stuff that is not mentioned in <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a>, and basics that are necessary for understanding, but when talking about historic monuments, some ecological parks, local traditions, it seems to me logical to do this in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Maramure%C5%9F_3e25.html" title="Northern Maramure≈ü">Northern Maramure≈ü</a>, not in <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a>. This will only enhance the richness of the culture of <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Maramure%C5%9F_County_3086.html" title="Maramure≈ü County">Maramure≈ü County</a> has the same legitimacy as <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a>, so again, events after 1920 go here, and everything about population/economy/modern politics etc</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/M%C3%A1ramaros.html" title="M√°ramaros">M√°ramaros</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maramure%C5%9F.html" title="Maramure≈ü">Maramure≈ü</a> I see as an article dealing with the region prior to 1918-1920, especially when it is about history. So, it is like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathian_Ruthenia_89b3.html" title="Carpathian Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a>, only it's geographical, not ethnical. I have not included yet history in the article <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Maramure%C5%9F_3e25.html" title="Northern Maramure≈ü">Northern Maramure≈ü</a> - if we create this article <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/M%C3%A1ramaros.html" title="M√°ramaros">M√°ramaros</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maramure%C5%9F.html" title="Maramure≈ü">Maramure≈ü</a>, then most of history prior to 1918 should go here, while <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Maramure%C5%9F_3e25.html" title="Northern Maramure≈ü">Northern Maramure≈ü</a> should contain only later events, and only short reference to older ones with direct link to the other article. The problem that arises here, is whether <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/M%C3%A1ramaros.html" title="M√°ramaros">M√°ramaros</a> was meant to be an article about the region (county, voevodate, and before) in general, or only about the county <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/M%C3%A1ramaros.html" title="M√°ramaros">M√°ramaros</a> in 1870-1918. We should ask the main editors of that article what was/is their intention. If 1870-1918, then ok, then just add that events prior to 1870 go to another article called simply <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maramure%C5%9F.html" title="Maramure≈ü">Maramure≈ü</a>, and those after 1918 - to <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakarpattia_Oblast_d430.html" title="Zakarpattia Oblast">Zakarpattia Oblast</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maramure%C5%9F_County_3086.html" title="Maramure≈ü County">Maramure≈ü County</a>. Also, I see the name Maramure≈ü as perfectly neutral, provided we say immmediately that in Hungarian is M√°ramaros, in German is..., in Ukrainian... The preferred English name happens to come from the Romanian, so what? Just like Ugocsa and Ung, the English names happen to come from Hungarian, not from the Romanian Ugocea and Unguras, or Transylavania happens not to come from Romanian either - I don't see any problem. We have to use the name that is more often used in English, or established as the standard form in English.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Maramure%C5%9F_%28historical_region%29.html" title="Maramure≈ü (historical region)">Maramure≈ü (historical region)</a> - honestly, I suggest to delete this article; here is why: only after 1965 the name Maramures was extended (and only informally, and not evryone accepted or understood this) not only over Maramures county, but also over Satu Mare county. There is no official region Maramures (in the sence or "region" being something bigger than "county", something contianing several counties). The name is only used unofficially by a very limitted amount of people. I rather see "Northern Transylvania(historical and statistical region)", containing 6 counties: Maramures, Satu Mare, Salaj, Oradea, Cluj and Bistrita-Nasaud. I do not confuse it with "Northern Transylvania(1940-1944)", which does not contain all of the former, and contains also something extra from the Southern Transylvania (parts of Mures, Harghita and Covasna). I see legitimate for Crisana to have a separate article as a historic region, because it containes 3 counties: Arad, Oradea and Satu Mare, but I don't understand why some want to artificially create a region Maramures just because they do not want to see the combination of words "Crisana and Maramures" as 3+1 counties, but prefer 2+2 counties. It is like playing with geographical names.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now, that does not mean that Tara Oasului, Almasul Salajan, Ciceu, etc are not close culturally with Maramures - they are, but they are close to Bistrita or Salaj in the same degree, and there are also important local specificities. Being situated in a territory which is rich in culture, they desearve (in time) separate articles. So what if that refers to small regions of 100,000 or 200,000 people? If there is something interesting and specific - by all means, they will have articles of their own, obviously linked to the articles about bigger regions (counties, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisana.html" title="Crisana">Crisana</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a>, etc)</dd>

<p>I am sorry because I did not have time to answer you before. Regarding these sounds, I do not have time to add Serbian sounds into article, but since Montenegrin language is 100% identical to Ijekavian dialect of Serbian spoken in Montenegro, then if you want to post Serbian names there, you can simply copy Montenegrin names and write that those names are Serbian. I checked the article, and these sounds are same even in my own Ekavian dialect of Serbian, so you will not mistake if you simply copy Montenegrin names. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 02:13, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Man, I sooo need to apologize for the delay. I kept prioritizing various confrontations with various users - one peachy one on Romanian wiki (the talk page for the ro equivalent of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians_in_Romania_3694.html" title="Armenians in Romania">Armenians in Romania</a>), and you have probably seen the rest.</p>
<p>Having witnessed your activities, I feel that voting in favor was my moral duty. I hope you win.</p>
<p>To answer your first query: I think that the x-American templates is pretty much ok, considering some of the alternatives. The unwritten rule on wikipedia seems to be to apply the present-day [supposed or not] links between state and ethnicity backwards, and the practice has resulted in a weird equilibrium. When talking about Ruthenians et al, we have the pattern wherby Ukrainians "take over" - probably weird, and certainly problematic, but as habitual as calling early Transylvanian Romanian emigrants "Romanian-", and not "Austrian-", "Hungarian-", and "Austro-Hungarian-Americans". (Although it seems that the latter ethnicity was paradoxically becoming a more and more valid choice for the state's subjects just after 1900 - with the "hypocritical" definition of Aurel Popovici as Romanian over the impossibility of defining Anton Durcovici as anything really. A thing to ponder for the future is creating and advertising ethnic categories for citizens of Austria-Hungary, and place them under "Cat:Austro-Hungarian people"; however, even though it seems to be a necessary research tool, there are some immense problems to consider before we do it.) On the other hand, such articles could rely solely on self-reference for more modern entries (in any case, they would actually have to find a notorious Moldovan American), A bigger problem than the ones you mention is the incompetent tendency to ascribe a Moldovan to pre-1940 natives of Bessarabia (interestingly, to natives of the <i>entire</i> Bessarabia). As I have said, the equilibrium is uneasy, but the template appears to be workable (even if the tendencies may need to be checked and combed through for ever... and ever... and ever...)</p>
<p>You make a fine point about Rimaru vs. Pirvulescu (only because the latter dies before 1993). I have to rant, though. It bothers me that so many of us keep advertising ours as a non-peripheral culture etc, and then fail to notice that, due only to our accumulated indifference, other languages would basically have to establish transliterations for what is, in effect, a Latin alphabet; that sound is one of the most frequent ones in Romanian, yet we are in the process of establishing what it should be written down as, like some Papuan dialect. Thank you so much, incompetent Academic institutions! Anyway, I don't think that we'll ever find an expert on this matter, but we may set our own rule in time (which may turn Parvulescu into Pirvulescu, or Rimaru back into Ramaru).</p>
<p>If I see more articles like <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medgidia.html" title="Medgidia">Medgidia</a>, I'm gonna be up for brain surgery. People who write that much crap should be thrown potatoes, because they force me to take an interest in their articles, and I cannot even place that town on a map of Dobruja.&#160;:)</p>
<p>I found a two-sentence long article on Mr. Fulga in the 1978 encyclopedia. It basically cites his birthplace (which is... Fulga, Prahova County) and the titles of his main writings, none of which rings a bell. According to them, he wrote "nuvele cu implicatii fantastice (Straniul paradis; Doamna straina)", "romane de evocare a anilor razboiului si a dramelor de constiinta (Eroica; Alexandra si infernul; Moartea lui Orfeu)" and "piese de teatru"). That's about it.</p>
<p>About the cabinets: don't get your hopes up. Alas, they are copypasted off of some Rompres site I myself bumped into a while back, and data does not reach beyond 1944.

<p>Looks like we will not get consensus on you being an admin at this time. No really active opposition, just people who seem to think you need to be more involved in the quasi-administrative tasks like warning vandals, participating in *FD, etc., first. Interesting: 2-1/2 years ago when I was up for this, no one raised this sort of concerns (which would have been equally apt about me at that time), but I guess the community standards have changed. You'll just have to decide whether this is stuff you want to do, or if you'd rather not be an admin.</p>

I think that it should be moved back to the neutral and traditional Englishified form "Alexander Soutzos", per "<a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Mourousis_27e2.html" title="Alexander Mourousis">Alexander Mourousis</a>", "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_Mavrocordatos_8495.html" title="Constantine Mavrocordatos">Constantine Mavrocordatos</a>" etc. We are going to need an admin's tools to perform the change, so here's hoping&#160;;). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to tell you, I really despise such distractions coming from users with original ideas and who feel they are unaccountable (this especially since all the articles created have been stubs of stubs, and well written like crap). Check out this interesting fact of life: I notice that a newbie, User:Alvac, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Alvac" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Alvac" rel="nofollow">engaged</a> in creating articles without diacritics, with arbitrary titles, in some cases duplicate of other articles, and that he is intervening in articles already present with some absurd edits. I also notice that he is cranky to say the least, and that his use of English is unmistakably original. We have a little exchange, then he apparently ceases editing altogether. Out of the blue cometh <a href="../../../o/b/r/User%7EObRoy_0a03.html" title="User:ObRoy">User:ObRoy</a>, who appears to have followed all this debate, reproaches me some imaginary deeds in unmistakably original English, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=ObRoy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=ObRoy" rel="nofollow">starts work</a> on articles that seem to pick up precisely where Alvac has left off... Now, I care only too little about the allegations and insults aimed at me in the process (as counter-productive as that may be, you know that I have tended to grab the bull by the horns when faced with that type of response), What I do care about is this apparent "confederation of erudite editors" - since the more careless of admins and stewards not see the lips moving when one editor sits on the other's knees.</dd>
<dd>I would contribute relevant things to wikipedia rather than to babysit (I keep bumping into interesting things as of late, and I want to get to finish the promised changes on the PCR page). Yet again, I have to admire your patience: one of the many reasons I expect you to come out of that ordeal as a biruitor.</dd>

<dd>About the links... er... <i>Rost</i>... and a post in some forum... you're kidding... right? I mean, they are severely biased (some of <i>Rost'</i>s content even makes me want to propose blacklisting it). You can find all the adequate info in scholarly works,without the propaganda. I gravitate around three or four books and an article that deal with such topics - briefly or at length -, and I know of at least one collection of essays that looks at the heart of Orthodoxy-State relations in Romania. Alas, I don't own all of them, and I don't take as much interest in the topic. But when an article starts with the assumption that the state was controlled by the Freemasons, it has neutrality issues at its core. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 05:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely. I could even accept the theory that a large number of politicians were Masons, but my response to this is similar to the view I have about Jews in communism (which you have probably seen me post a couple of hours ago): it's basically resumed by the question "and?" (the full point I was making on that page implied, of course, the verifiable notion that most Romanian communists were never, in fact, Jews, and that the spectacular growth of the party poses people such as those writing for <i>Rost</i> with an actual problem). In the future, when I'll start the promised edits for the Iron Guard article, I'll at least be hinting to Church-Politics relations for that period, and, with your help reference beyond for those articles you want to work on. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 06:03, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the main problem is that they have been identified by neutral sources as nationalist in discourse and Legionary apologetics. They may deny Legionary links, but they are still a very problematic source (imagine Anonimu making use of PƒÉunescu when referencing info about Communist Romania - on the basis of PƒÉunescu having denied being a communist...). Now, the matter is indeed one of discourse and what one may read into it, and never of explicit connections: but allow me to speculate that journalists would be much more open about Legionary connections if they wouldn't know that (a) they would discredit themselves and (b) they would risk paying fines through their noses. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 06:12, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My argument about <i>Rost</i> was actually a correlation of the two: the source has been doubted for being crypto-Legionary (them being allegedly "crypto"-, I don't know how you expect them to confirm it), <i>as well</i> as being manifestly nationalist in discourse. I respect a nationalist discourse (as long as it that does not rely on fallacies), but: I could never call a self-declared and self-promoting nationalist discourse "neutral" or "objective" (none of which exclude the possibility that it is right), just as I'd rather not build an article on Stalin around references from Trotsky (even though I personally think Trotsky's view of Stalin was right, I cannot think it was objective). It is equivalent to referencing RoMare articles by Gheorghe Buzatu - the man is a licensed professional, his article's content may be surprisingly objective (although I'm yet to se such a writing by Buzatu), but do we really want to use RoMare as a reference for anything other than "what RoMare is known to have alleged"?</dd>

<dd>Btw, Vosganian claims that the <i>Rost</i> issue is slander, given that they republished articles he had sent elsewhere (this is just to clarify a loose end).</dd>
<dd>About the Jewish - Communist connection: to your excellent points (aside from innate intelligence, where I keep my reserves due to my quite different views on race and ethnicity), I would like to add the Romanian particularities, which should be made clear to those anti-Semites who still blow that old horn. Aside from the fact that, once you are rejected by an entire system (and most vocally by its left-wing branches - from radicals in the PNL to Iorga to some Poporanists), you will naturally head for the margin, where you are protected. If every political mood had acquired an insurrectional aspect after WWI in between fascism and Leninism, the urban class was naturally gravitating towards the latter - which means that the ethnic Romanian would-be-revolutionaries, not as radical in approach (because they were not as close to the periphery), were present in the same percentages, but not in urban Leninism (after the 1907 scandal, their leaders tended to occupy that mi-chemin between city and countryside - be they the Peasantists or the Iron Guard). And, of course,we are talking numbers: I am ever so stunned to hear a person talk about the "Communism of Jews" and then insist on how the PCdR was a fringe party; now, I may be wrong, but I think 1,000 people do not represent anything among 15 million, and that all conclusion about Romanian society based on that number is grossly exaggerated. But, even so, we know for sure that, starting ca. 1930, Stalin Romanianized the party. I have no idea about percentages of membership 1n 1922-1930, but I know that in the 1930s Jews were about a third of members, and they were always below the number of Romanians. None of this mattered in 1947, when the party "somehow" rose to 710,000 members (how many of those newly-arrived were Jewish?). Based on that, I would also tend to think that the impression about the over-abundance of Jews among activists during 1947-1957, although possibly accurate, is also irrelevant: the party structure, was still small in comparison with the number of arrivals, reflected what the party had been (a minuscule head over a giant); those newer cadres that were added to the minuscule head had to have "credentials" of some sort (they were probably pushed forward by acquaintance, preference, status as victims etc, not under any circumstance by "shared ethnicity").</dd>
<dd>I knew about Leonte (and his wife Hermina), have heard TismƒÉneanu talk about them, and I had, alas, seen the dreaded article on ro:wiki. The issue with TismƒÉneanu was actually whether he specifically said that his parents were Jewish (I think he did, but I could not reference it, and had to rely on finding neutral sources). Incidentally, I also bumped into information about Leonte when I was looking for sources on <a href="../../../i/o/r/Iorgu_Iordan_ecb7.html" title="Iorgu Iordan">Iorgu Iordan</a> (turns out that he was one of those who voted to have Goma expelled - one of the many problematic parts in Goma's recent attack is that the man, unlike Iordan, did not vote in favor of turning him over to the Securitate! in fact, he also admits someplace else that a third person, also Jewish, voted against any sort of punishment...). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 11:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have recently today moved plenty of pages (biographies of Moldavian and Wallachian monarchs) to names which are contradictory to what is instructed at Naming Conventions for rulers. You cannot keep your naming habit in one corner of Wikipedia which goes against valid Naming Conventions. Cease those moves immediately.

<p>Is located at: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a></p>
<p>There are several instructions. Two of the most pertinent appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>European monarchs whose rank was below that of King (e.g., Grand Dukes, Electors, Dukes, Princes), should be at the location "{Monarch's first name and ordinal}, {Title} of {Country}". Examples: <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian_I%2C_Elector_of_Bavaria_500d.html" title="Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria">Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean%2C_Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg_de5a.html" title="Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(yet examples: Ilia Alexander, Prince of Wallachia, and so forth - not "Ilia Alexandru" without any context - every reader of English Wikipedia is not a Romanian nor it is clear from the outset that a non-contextualized name happens to refer to a Romianian monarch)</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a monarch has <b>reigned over a number of states,</b> use the most commonly associated ones. For example, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a>, not <i>Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland;</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I%2C_German_Emperor_1c3c.html" title="William I, German Emperor">William I, German Emperor</a>, not <i>William I of Prussia,</i> although there should be redirects from these locations. When several states are so associated, it is proper and often desirable to give the others compensating prominence in the intro when one gets the name of the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>(AND, if two states are so equal that there is no particular "association" more to one of them, then solution has been like <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_II_of_Hungary_and_Bohemia_71c4.html" title="Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia">Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louise%2C_Princess_Royal_and_Duchess_of_Fife_9e22.html" title="Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife">Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife</a> - so it may possibly be "XX, Prince of Moldavia, Prince of Wallachia").</p>
<p>Observe that I have not moved any page related to this discussion, and am going to retain my uninvolvement.

<p>I'm not gonna pester you about <i>Rost</i>, although I think you should at least indicate the POV issue if you want to reference it (and I stand by my point that non-problematic references could be found for all of that). Btw, two points of their answer jumped at me: first, they talk about "G√¢ndirism" as if it some great uncorruptible theory, when, in fact, it was the frustrated little brother of the Iron Guard (some would say that it was even more morally objectionable than the Guard overall); secondly, they seem to have a theory about Junimea and what is supported that would make a good section of prominent Junimists roll in their graves (it is also be the first instance where somebody would claim that Junimea and G√¢ndirism would have anything in common. On the whole, I'd say their official attitude is to go as far as the law will permit them. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:20, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All of that can be dealt with,including images (some <i>Magazine Istorice</i> of the 1970s published political cartoons from the 1920s - I wanted to scan a very elloquent image of him a while back, but forgot which issue it was, and didn't bother looking for it afterwards + I don't own a scanner, but i can use one from time to time). Thanks for the positive words on the text, but I'm sure it has weaknesses there - when and if you feel like reviewing the article further, perhaps you'll find more bugs that it should get rid of.</dd>
<dd>So we agree to keep writing fƒÉrƒÉ Rost, then&#160;:). Although I suppose Anonimu would tell me I suffer from a childhood disease of communism, I have to say that I agree with your point about free expression on such matters (even if I think that Holocaust deniers should at least pay fines - not the case with Rost and even the Legionary press, who simply refuses to talk about this matter). However, I don't think that the law has as much effect as it could: what newspapers like Rost aim for is respectability, and they seem to want to drag more of the Legionary past into respectability (in other words, they have a biased version of the facts, but that is because they are trying to avoid the unavoidable truths about the Iron Guard, and they will always be moderates in comparison to their very models); on the other hand, the underclass of neo-nazis (Antonescans, Simists, those Codrenists who don't strive to appear like some sort of benign Francoist Scouts, as well as other groups) and/or national-Stalinists will always marginally produce their offensive, choppy, and pornographic pulp, with no intent for reaching into the mainstream ‚Äî where the arm of the law could not afford to ignore them. It is also possible that the Rost-like situation itself encourages its initiators to avoid clear terms: aside from the fact that, in New Right-manner, they have to know by now that they are factually more complex than their idols (and so, they are "something else", whether they want to or not), they know they could probably scare off a lot of customers by stating all their views out load and proud (those conservatives who fear radicalism, even though they sympathize with the message; those people who don't want to get involved into something problematic; those stiff nationalists who obsess over classic nationalist figures to the point of picking Iorga over Codreanu; army officers who salute you if you say the word "Antonescu"; rigid nationalists who think that, once "Romanianized", Communism has done its share of good and is an important part of the national patrimony - which leads them to view the Iron Guard as agents of disorder etc). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congress has never been independent, least of all under a Peronist president, ever. What Menem didn't want, Congress didn't pass, and conversely, what Menem wanted, the Congress always gave (the opposition either sheepishly agreed, or was outnumbered). But yes, you make a valid point; we should find references that indicate which measures were passed as presidential decrees, which were sent to Congress by the Executive, and which were original Congress initiatives. ‚Äî<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<p>In reply to your question: why the scare quotes around the words "massacres" and "betrayals"? You seem to refer to "the massacre" and "the betrayal", while Piotrus has a tendency to present the whole Polish history as a chain of massacres and betrayals. According to him, there were massacres of Poles (e.g., <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_Praga_5c69.html" title="Massacre of Praga">Massacre of Praga</a>) during all Russo-Polish conflicts, and each Russian victory in such a conflict is explained by a "Western betrayal". As for the rest of your comments, I'm not surprized at your ready sympathy for Polish historical traumas (we all sympathize with them); I'm concerned at your lack of understanding of admin abuse, which is the subject of RfC. You say that you collaborate productively with Ukrainian, Hunagrian editors, etc. So do I. I enjoy working with Turkish, Swedish, Finnish, Ukrainian and even Lithuanian editors, but not with Piotrus. Don't you find it strange that the RfC was started by a Russian and a Lithuanian? Has Lithuania suffered from Russia less than Poland or what? --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-—Ç—Ä—ë–ø-</font></a></sup> 17:36, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although you steer the discussion to content disputes, I have neither time nor opportunity to examine the whole sum of Polish-Russian (Lithuanian/German) grievances, as my participation in such disputes is actually very small. I don't want Piotr to be punished (that's not the purpose of RfCs), but I want the community to decry his abuse, so that it would stop. So far, I get only increase of it all, with Piotr running from one user talk page to another with messages more suitable for my kids: "Mum, Mum, look what Michael did!" --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-—Ç—Ä—ë–ø-</font></a></sup> 18:15, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On second thoughts, I decided to take my time and explain my position on Katyn, as you have found it prudent to raise the issue in your comment. Since I take no interest in 20th-century and modern politics, I have not examined the issue in detail, but I insisted that we should include into "external links" a link to www.katyn.ru, a website which presents some evidence that the crime was perpetrated by Nazis rather than Soviets. This is based on the ArbCom opinion that every fringe theory should be presented <i>appropriately</i> in the text of the article. If there are different opinions on the guilt (not the fact), they should be mentioned in the text, rather than suppressed. The coverage of 9/11 includes mention of conspiracy theories that the event was engineered by CIA. The same principle is valid for Chechen bombings in Moscow, and for every other such controversial event, but apparently not for Katyn. Needless to say, I was summarily reverted by Piotrus and Halibutt, and there is neither link nor basic information about other opinions in the article. I had neither time nor energy to chat or fight with scores of meatpuppets that were recruited by Piotrus on the Polish noticeboard, therefore I moved on to other issues and there the matter ended. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-—Ç—Ä—ë–ø-</font></a></sup> 22:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for writing the Irimescu article in the first place. I had glanced on the MAN page before, and I noticed the hat, but that's about all contact I had with the man - btw, you'd think a general in the most modern branch of the armed forces would not be wearing the most outdated hat (although I guess it's getter than a ceremonial leather cap and goggles). Same thing happened to me with <a href="../../../i/o/r/Iorgu_Iordan_ecb7.html" title="Iorgu Iordan">Iorgu Iordan</a> - I had to pick if I was going to write about him or some other commie mentioned in the source; it was then that I remembered reading that Iordan was Bulgarian, which was interesting enough and was going to help me file a new addition for the cat I created back when I needed to "bridge" information on Rakovski and Nicolae Vogoride - so I said "if I can find it mentioned in this source, I'll write an article on him"... and what do you know, it was.</p>
<p>I don't know why Anonimu enjoys wild goose hunts so much, but he's getting repetitive and tiring me. There are two things that annoy me to death in wiki bureaucratic habits: one is using the "this article is based on its x-language equivalent" (as if we couldn't just call for sources etc.) and the absurdity of referencing the same thing on millions of pages (especially when referencing a link, which is basically indicating that we expect people not to click link). But that's me, and I have devised ways not to have to deal with criticism over that. In the Ceau≈üescu family case, I suggest to either duplicate the references to that page (never mind the sophistry on the talk page about "not being to source alcoholism, nepotism, and abuse", supposedly because they would "always be subjective"; for some reason, Anonimu always thinks that it is not possible to source that two brothers had the same name...) or to reduce the text for the family to brief mentions and leave it to other articles to explain Andru≈£ƒÉ's behavior et al. Btw: there is a major problem which you should consider - what is the family article to <a href="../../../c/e/a/Ceau%C5%9Fescu_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Ceau≈üescu (disambiguation)">this</a>? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:01, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was infuriating and sinister. I wanted to say what the man is, and my version goes beyond "madman", but he is not worth the seconds it would take me to type it (never mind the "bettering through Holocaust" shit, the man does not even ponder that Antonescu also "made better citizens" of his Iron Guardists, and probably of his relatives, but sending them on a cruise to the Urals). Just how much damage has that man caused by now? Why is he still allowed to operate over there? These are the questions Romanian wikipedians need to ask themselves.</dd>
<dd>The statistic is untenable, as it does not specify what it relies on. There are estimates that I've seen (and a statistic in TismƒÉneanu, that I did not memorize, which relied on self-definition and showed a group of "Moldovans"). What I do know is that: the statistic provided in that piece of crap, especially since it may be an <i>overall</i> estimate for 1921-1944, is cropped to suit a taste (22% may just as well be, and likely is, the <i>largest</i> single ethnic group); Jews were probably the absolute majority <i>before</i> 1933, i.e. before Stalin ordered Romanians to be recruited en masse (unlike most of the Jew and other minority early members, those Romanians did not take refuge to the USSR and were not decimated there...); in the late 1940s, the PCR's ranks rose 710 times (for real!), and, of course, not "with Jews" (but, as we know, largely with Legionaries and, in parallel, with PSD members). I wouldn't even know where to begin removing that poison, but I would recommend wikipedians there to ban and revert on sight. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:48, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess you're right about the banning utopia. What's really sad is that I see a user like Arie Inbar, whom I presume id Jewish (he adds interwikis for Hebrew articles) who makes small edits on the texts without noticing or without attempting to intervene against their main and most insulting problems (for one, that the "sources" quoted are disgusting propaganda pieces).</p>
<p>I have a better source mentioning the rhyme,and it provides an interesting context (apparently, the rhyme actually surfaced <i>with</i> the Iron Guard, or at least the Securitate thought so); I was thinking of including it as well in the PCR article - but then decided that it is a tad too specific (the entire article would provide just one reference in th article), and I'm trying to limit information to the very relevant (and to sources that provide detail on more than one sentence). On the other hand, that article and perhaps your source will come in handy at the Iron Guard article, which we should expand and reference in the future (feel free to add your source there already, in case you want to - I shall be visiting bearing many lovely gifts in due time). In any case, do hold on to that source - it is valuable on a number of articles.</p>
<p>Sorry, I owed you a reply on the Argetoianu issue (I still owe you replies on other issues, but perhaps they'll come up again in conversation). For the date used: it is reliable enough, IMO (in the sense that I see no reason why it shouldn't be - note that it gave a date for the arrest that was backed by another source, while the other source did not deal with the detention in depth enough for more to come up etc). The infoboxes: yes, I admit, the question marks are a bit annoying (consider that more potentates of the Ancient World have definite dates than articles on 20th cent. Ro politicians...); on the other hand, let's consider more templates in the future. I say keep variants in the sandbox - if I bump into info, I'll add it there and we'll eventually fill in the/more blanks. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 02:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, and sorry for the delay (I had some loose ends in some articles to deal with, as you may have noticed). I wish I had seen the expansion on the elections article earlier - I kept writing about elections in article, and didn't know that they were planned as separate articles. Couldn't tell you about the terminology: I noticed the preferred term for the 1946 elections was "general", and, in my mind, this means that they also elected mayors and councils (I never did bump into any result or even interest for that side of the elections, but what else could have been up for election?); now, I have absolutely no idea about whether other elections were superimposed on each other, or even if that counted in any way before 1938... In any event, we could redirect the 1946 reference to "general election" to "legislative election", if I turn out to be wrong, and keep the latter as the norm in naming. This brings up an interesting subject: I see no reason for the presidential elections to be separate from the parliamentary ones, in case we'll get data on those (at least, we should try). So, if or when we do, I suggest renaming 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004 to "general".</p>
<p>Don't worry about not insulting my intelligence: you'd be surprised how many times God forgets me, and, if I did know that detail, it was only because you showed it to me before (not per se: you gave me a link to a google search were you had done this thing, and I figured out what happened, although I never remembered to use it).</p>
<p>Thanks for the link: as I have said, I'd like not to link one-time sources to there, especially if they are unrelated to the main topic. As it is, the reference in the text is limited to 1964, which was the climax, and to political prisoners. I plan to chew through <i>Pe umerii lui Marx</i>, then add detail from the other sources. I'll tweak the sentence for now. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 03:34, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess you are right about the terminology. But don't you think we should have post-89 elections that coincided on th same page, under "general" (which is what they also were)? I cannot imagine any problem with fusing them, but i can see a lot of advantages.</dd>
<dd>We needn't do anything about the 1946 name in articles as it is. If we create it under a different title, we'll make all the redirects anyway (if anyone wants to take the trouble to make various mentions in articles coincide with the article title, as I have seen people do, fine by me - but I consider it superfluous except for some cases____well, I do have my own quirks in this area, so I shouldn't comment - consider that, when I mask a linked word, I always begin the part to the left of the "|" with a majuscule, although I know that I do not need to... but then again, there are those who edit an article solely to replace the majuscule with a minuscule to the left of the "|").</dd>
<dd>On the prisons issue, that is precisely what I was thinking. One of the reasons I am taking so much care in referencing the PCR article is to form a "bank" of details that would prove helpful in many other articles (but I'm guessing you know the process - I've seen you using it on Anonimu when he started spraying citneeded tags in there and you copypasted the reference from the <a href="../../../p/l/o/Ploughmen%27s_Front_7e95.html" title="Ploughmen's Front">Ploughmen's Front</a> article). <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd tend to go with the former. And, likesay, if we have cats for "legislative" and "presidential" to reflect present-day changes, we can just include fused articles for 1992-2004 in both. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:42, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the kind words. I used to live in the area as a kid, and played in its courtyard once or twice.</p>
<p>I fully agree with the format for the article. I wanted to have a terminology available: what you think the article title should be out of those possible (I could go with any), so that we may start [orange]linking in articles. This makes the creation of a category easier. (It is also easier, in an article like that, to work on individual articles first - all we'd have to do afterwards is summarize them,which would also ensure that the info is not contradicted elsewhere.)</p>
<p>The Calciu thing is a misunderstanding. I knew he was a Legionary; the source was there to cite that he had been in Pite≈üti, and not that he had been a Legionary. (It is like a source talking about, say, "Romania's Gheorghiu-Dej" without mentioning that he was a communist - one would not be prevented from paraphrasing into "a communist leader", since the info would not be controversial). Also, since I have created a link for him, that detail will pop up in there. So, it shouldn't be a problem. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 01:01, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see. I like the idea, but I guess my main concern is to make it bullet-proof - do you think that such a wide range would: a) successfully resist various takes on what repression is and what it is not (bearing in mind that I personally agree with you on this matter); b) clear the matter for murkier inclusions (the Antonescus and the rest of Transnistria criminals; the Ioanid Gang - where we may yet see a scandal over "nobody being able to prove that they were not bank robbers"; the ground between Vasile Luca, rotting in jail, and Ana Pauker, who escaped by sheer luck; if we ever reach that deep, those Iron Guard members who were already in jail in 1944 - many of whom I would not venture to call "politically repressed" for their initial time in jail, although I certainly don't approve of what either of the two regimes did to them).</dd>
<dd>Thanks for pointing out that "Human rights" article. Myself, I would break ground and "attack" all other periods - I'd say that I and Anonimu both have a justifiable bone to pick with Mr. BrƒÉtianu and Mr. Averescu. But this is the kind of thing you mostly build from leftovers (there is little neutral [ie: post-PCR] material that would deal with this specific topic through Romanian history, and I would picture most of it being very schematic; to get the details lined up and observe the weight due to each period, one would have to selectively go through many more sources). I suppose that you're considering the planned article on Communist Roamnia a "main article" section and link in that one - I would agree 100%. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 04:49, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
