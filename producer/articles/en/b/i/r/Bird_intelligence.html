Traditionally, birds have been considered inferior in intelligence to <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, and derogatory terms such as <i>bird brains</i> have been used colloquially in some cultures.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>It is everywhere recognized that birds possess highly complex instinctive endowments and that their intelligence is very limited.</p>
<p style="line-height:1em;text-align:left;padding-left:2em;"><small>—<cite style="font-style:normal;">Herrick, 1924<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></cite></small></p>

<p>Such perceptions are no longer considered valid. Intelligence, being difficult to define or measure, makes the subject difficult for scientific study. Anatomically, birds have a relatively large brain compared to head size. The visual and auditory senses are well developed in most species, while tactile and olfactory senses are well developed only in a few groups. Locomotion is achieved through flight and use of the legs in most species. The beak and feet are used to manipulate food and other objects. Birds can communicate using visual signals as well as through the use of calls and song. The testing of intelligence is therefore based on studying the responses to sensory stimuli.</p>

<p>Bird intelligence has been studied through several attributes and abilities. Many of these studies have been on birds such as quail, domestic fowl and pigeons kept under captive conditions. It has, however, been noted that field studies have been limited, unlike those of the apes. Birds such as the corvids and psittacines have been shown to live social lives, have long developmental periods and large forebrains, and these may be expected to have greater cognitive abilities.<sup id="_ref-emery_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emery" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird_intelligence.html" title="Edit section: Counting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Counting</span></h3>
<p>Counting has been considered an ability that shows intelligence. Early bird photographers used hides to take pictures of birds at nest. They noticed that some species are alarmed by human presence and wait for the human to leave the hide before approaching. Some photographers tried a technique to fool the birds by having two people enter the hide and having only one leave it. Many birds failed to see the trick and returned to their nests assuming that the human had left. However, crows were found to be able to keep count and a figure of 7 was found to be the limit of their counting ability.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Cormorants used by Chinese fishermen that were given every eighth fish as a reward were found to be able to keep count up to eight.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many birds are also able to detect changes in the number of eggs in their nest and brood parasitic cuckoos are often known to remove one of the host eggs before laying their own.</p>

<p>Visual or auditory signals and their association with food and other rewards have been well studied and birds have been trained to recognize and distinguish complex shapes. This is probably an important ability that aids their survival.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>A common test of intelligence is the detour test. Here a glass barrier between the bird and an item such as food is used in the setup. Most mammals discover that the objective is reached by first going away from the target. Domestic fowl fail on this test.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> Cats fail this too; however many <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvidae.html" title="Corvidae">corvids</a> were found to readily solve the problem.</p>
<p>Large fruit-eating birds in tropical forests depend on trees which fruit at different times of the year. Many species, such as pigeons and hornbills, have been shown to be able to decide upon foraging areas according to the time of the year. Birds that show food caching behaviour have also shown the ability to recollect the locations of food caches.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup> Nectarivorous birds such as hummingbirds also optimize their foraging by keeping track of the locations of good and bad flowers.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many birds follow strict time schedules in their activities. These are often dependent upon environmental cues. Birds also are sensitive to daylight length, and this awareness is especially important as a cue for migratory species. The ability to orient themselves during migrations is attributed to birds' superior sensory abilities, rather than to intelligence.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird_intelligence.html" title="Edit section: Tool using">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tool using</span></h3>
<p>Many birds have been shown capable of using tools. The definition of a tool has been debated. Tool use has been defined as</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p><i>the use of physical objects other than the animal's own body or appendages as a means to extend the physical influence realized by the animal</i></p>
<p style="line-height:1em;text-align:left;padding-left:2em;"><small>—<cite style="font-style:normal;">Jones and Kamil, 1973<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></cite></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this definition, an Egyptian vulture dropping a bone on a rock would not be using a tool since the rock cannot be seen as an extension of the body. However the use of a rock manipulated using the beak to crack an ostrich egg would qualify the Egyptian vulture as a tool user. Many other species, including parrots, corvids and a range of passerines, have been noted as tool users.<sup id="_ref-emery_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emery" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Caledonian_Crow_61b6.html" title="New Caledonian Crow">New Caledonian Crows</a> have been observed in the wild to use stick tools with their beaks to extract insects from logs. While young birds in the wild normally learn this technique from elders, a laboratory crow named "Betty" improvised a hooked tool from a wire with no prior experience.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> The woodpecker finch from the Galapagos Islands also uses simple stick tools to assist it in obtaining food. In captivity, a young cactus finch learned to imitate this behaviour by watching a woodpecker finch in an adjacent <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birdcage.html" title="Birdcage">cage</a>. Crows in urban <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> have innovated a technique to crack hard-shelled nuts by dropping them onto crosswalks and letting them be run over and cracked by cars. They then retrieved the cracked nuts when the cars were stopped at the red light. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striated_Heron_33c3.html" title="Striated Heron">Striated Herons</a> (<i>Butorides striatus</i>) use bait to catch fish.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird_intelligence.html" title="Edit section: Brain anatomy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brain anatomy</span></h3>
<p>One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebral_cortex.html" title="Cerebral cortex">cerebral cortex</a>, which is the part of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, it seems that birds use a different part of their brain, the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale, as the seat of their intelligence, and the brain-to-body size ratio of psittacines and corvines is actually comparable to that of higher primates.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Studies with captive birds have given insight into which birds are the most intelligent. While <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parrot.html" title="Parrot">parrots</a> have the distinction of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Grey_Parrot_9209.html" title="African Grey Parrot">African Grey Parrot</a> have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_%28parrot%29.html" title="Alex (parrot)">Alex</a>). Along with parrots, the crows, ravens, and jays (family <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corvidae.html" title="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>) are perhaps the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest hyperstriata. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_San_Diego_00bc.html" title="University of California, San Diego">UCSD</a> who has studied the physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains are similar to those of humans.</p>
<p><a name="Social_behaviour" id="Social_behaviour"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird_intelligence.html" title="Edit section: Social behaviour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social behaviour</span></h3>
<p>Social life has been considered to be a driving force for the evolution of intelligence. Many birds have social organizations, and loose aggregations are common. Many corvid species separate into small family groups (or "clans") for activities such as nesting and territorial defense. The birds then congregate in massive flocks made up of several different species for migratory purposes. Some birds use teamwork while hunting. Predatory birds hunting in pairs have been observed using a "bait and switch" technique, whereby one bird will distract the prey while the other swoops in for the kill.</p>
<p>Social behaviour requires individual identification, and most birds appear to be capable of recognizing mates, siblings and young. Other behaviours such as play and cooperative breeding are also considered indicators of intelligence.</p>
<p>When crows are caching food, they appear to be sensitive to note who is watching them hide the food. They also steal food cached by others.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>While birds have no form of spoken language, they do communicate with their flockmates through song, calls, and body language. Studies have shown that the intricate territorial songs of some birds must be learned at an early age, and that the memory of the song will serve the bird for the rest of its life. Some bird species are able to communicate in a variety of dialects. For example, the New Zealand saddleback will learn the different song "dialects" of clans of its own species, much as human beings might learn diverse regional dialects. When a territory-owning male of the species dies, a young male will immediately take his place, singing to prospective mates in the dialect appropriate to the territory he is in.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that some birds may have an ability to understand grammatical structures.</p>
<p>A controversial study conducted by Ryan B. Reynolds has suggested that budgerigars are able to form simple, meaningful sentences. The evidence consists so far only of audio files, but has yet to be either proved or disproved. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Evidence that birds can form abstract concepts such as <i>same–different</i> has been proved by <i>Alex</i>, the African grey parrot. Alex was trained to vocally label more than 100 objects of different colours and shapes and which are made from different materials. Alex can also request or refuse these objects ('I want X') and quantify numbers of them.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Macaws in the rain forest of Peru have been noted to eat fruits that are poisonous during certain seasons. They later feed on clay at avian <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay.html" title="Clay">clay</a> licks. These appear to bind the toxins in the food and prevent sickness in the birds.
