<p>Ok, as far as I am aware the copyright material was sourced from Virtualbrum.co.uk, the webmaster has cleared the use of this material himself see <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_military_history.html" title="Birmingham military history">Birmingham military history</a> discussion, this also mitigates <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_Quarter_2be6.html" title="Gun Quarter">Gun Quarter</a>, if anyone can provide evidence that we <b>cannot</b> use this text because of copyright control then we can simply delete the offending passage as opposed to the entire article, a heck of a lot of work has gone into these pages from many wikipedians. 195.92.67.75 22:28, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's difficult to know where to begin to rescue this article. Half-sentences, large chunks of text which seem to have been ripped out of a Victorian work without any consideration of relevance or context, irrelevant material. And due to an administrative oversight this (and a couple of other Birmingham-related pages) were removed from the copyright violation list without being dealt with - I'm going to re-list them. I'm also going to comment out most of the text of the page, so it can be restored in a form which is both logical, and suitable for an encyclopedia. In fact, looking at some of the text, it seems to be from a fairly modern source, and given the history of copyright violation on this page it seems safer not to restore anything until it has been sourced. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 10:10, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps it would be better to simply add the relevant facts to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Birmingham_024d.html" title="History of Birmingham">History of Birmingham</a> and do away with this strange page? <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 10:34, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Absolutely not, this page does need restructuring but the military history of the city is extensive and there is more to come yet hence it definately needs it's own page/article. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.92.67.65.html" title="User:195.92.67.65">195.92.67.65</a> 18:20, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's an interesting topic, but it would really need writing from scratch with rigorous documentation of what goes in, *as* it goes in (and none of the tenuous connections of the - I caricature - "Birmingham made choclate and lots of WW2 soldiers ate chocolate so chocolate comes under military history" type). The Victorian material appears to come from Showell's directory. (PS Isn't it bliss?). <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 10:55, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is an interesting topic Ray and rather making arrogant and condesending comments why don't you actually put some work into the article instead of critisizing. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.92.67.65.html" title="User:195.92.67.65">195.92.67.65</a> 18:20, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there are several possible locations for what used to be here, and given the large amount of duplication in Birmingham articles, most of it is probably already also in these places:

<li><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Birmingham_024d.html" title="History of Birmingham">History of Birmingham</a></li>

<dd>I suggest the article is deleted once anything which isn't in those articles has been moved there.

<p>I've removed most of the obvious nonsense, duplications from other articles (that I could find) and irrelevant material. What we're left with seems to be a small amount of trivia, some huge and not entirely relevant chunks of Victoriana, and some potentially interesting stuff about arms production (which should probably go into an article about Birmingham's industrial history, rather than here). --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 13:07, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've restored the article to how it was after the copyright violations were removed, deleting this article or filtering it away will be down right vandalism, there is much more to come yet and instead of talking about how we can get rid of it why don't you actually help wikipedia by structuring the article, It would be nice to see it listed in chronological order. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.92.67.65.html" title="User:195.92.67.65">195.92.67.65</a> 18:20, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Brumburger that it's not salvageable without vastly more work than writing it from scratch.

I will grant it that I do become frustrated with Andy Mabbett stalking my every move here (of which I must say is rather flatering considering your/his low opinion of my work) I think that it is enlightening to watch my many contributions edited down and formulated into professional looking articles, great well done, just don't delete it, by the way I have edited under different ip addresses due to my P.C. and to be perfectly honest I am not after the kudos of associating my user name with any firsts like for instance <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_research.html" title="Cancer research">cancer research</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Parkes_6202.html" title="Alexander Parkes">Alexander Parkes</a> if I create something that blossoms then I am happy, I just add for fun and out of enjoyment. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 20:32, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>some of it is irrelevant (the alleged invention of the fire detector - Darby's design worked by a block of butter melting, and it's extremely unlikely that it was used in military vehicles), some of it is patently untrue (HMS Birmingham sunk a U-boat in 1920?). I edited out most of the rubbish and left the remainder in comments, awaiting restoration in a form more suitable for here (there's a large paragraph starting "The official natal day..." which is lifted verbatim from a Victorian work with no indication as to what the subject or the source is). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">User:Nick Boulevard</a> will be the subject of an RfC over the next couple of days - there are dozens of Birmingham-related articles which he has filled with unsourced material much of which turns out to be either untrue or copyright violation (some of the remaining paragraphs seem to be modern and too well-written to be Nick's own work).</dd>

<dd>Strongly seconded. Basically, the problem is that none of it can trusted. It's a whole mess of unattributed material written by a user who has repeatedly failed to cite sources, writes with a permanent pro-Birmingham slant, and persistently reverts edits to remove irrelevancies, reasoned corrections of errors, edits toward NPOV, and reorganise in a way that makes sense. He has also complained to an admin previously, if that's what brought you here. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 12:01, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a matter of fact, the first HMS Birmingham did sink U-15 in August 1914. The Birmingham Loyal Association was formed in 1797 and The Loyal Birmingham Volunteers in 1803. In short, the claim that none of this can be trusted seems to rest on ignorance, though it does I admit contain some unverifiable claims, at least one of which (military applications of Darby's fire alarm) has been identified. The wording is often archaic in places, and yes it's rather confusing--this means it needs cleanup. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:25, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest when I started writing this article I think I did probably take some bits'n'bobs from an ancient online book from the 1800's which is out of copyright, there is a link to it on the main Brum page.

<dd>That's coming up when I get the time (there's a <i>lot</i> of stuff to be collated because his behaviour on this particular article is the tip of the iceberg, and he often doesn't log on so it's difficult to track his edits accurately - the four or five anonymous edits to this page from different dialup IP numbers are actually by the same person). The original article gave two conflicting dates for the Volunteer corps, and Nick kept reverting to include both dates (and the obviously wrong one for the U-boat sinking) - as Ray says, that's typical. Most of it may be right, but if he doesn't cite sources, there's no way to check, and enough of what he has added has been proven wrong for suspicion of everything to be justified in the absence of references. People have been trying to discuss things rationally with him for months, and usually they just get a lot of personal abuse in return. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrumburger_66fb.html" title="User:Brumburger">Brumburger</a> 13:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seemed to be no serious disagreement with my suggestion that the subject matter (but not the badly- compiled content) be merged into the generic Birmingham history article. Some of the subject matter is of no real relevance to the city (HMS Birmingham?!?), and other parts are only relevant in a wider historical context (and vice versa). <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 14:44, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I seriously dissagree, this article is extensive and is growing and should not be merged and lost in the general history section where it will be easy for you to vandalise Andy&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 20:59, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to let you all know, Andy Mabbett and Brumburger are one and the same and although RayGirvan seems to be someone completely different I still would not put it past Andy to create him (I apologise Ray if you are who you claim), Andy does seem to go to great lengths to delete everything I write It's just that I really cannot be bothered to list it all as nothing ever changes. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Boulevard_f817.html" title="User:Nick Boulevard">Nick Boulevard</a> 20:59, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First we see a large edit and addition to the Celluloid article by the cumbersome Nick Boulevard then moments after Nicks departure the greater speckled AndyMabbett creeps from his hidey hole immediately pecking away in a blind panic at the recent additions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celluloid&amp;diff=14765430&amp;oldid=14764258" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celluloid&amp;diff=14765430&amp;oldid=14764258" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Celluloid&amp;diff=14765430&amp;oldid=14764258</a></dd>

<dd>That is not the issue. The question was about whether Wikipedia breached his copyright or vice versa. Given that the similar texts were on his site before they were on Wikipedia, the latter is moot and his confirmation of consent addresses the former. If you now wish to identify breaches of other copyrights in Wikipedia material, then that is up to you.—<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 30 June 2005 19:07 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen that. I am unable to tell from that which elements of the Virtual Brum page are copied from the plaque. I have suggested that User:Vbrum indicates on his website which elements are reproduced from other sources with permission. If you can show that specific elements breach a copyright, then we can address those. We may need to ask Birminham City Council if they have put the plaque text into the public domain. Or we can use the form: "a plaque reads:" if it is enough of a selection to be fair use. Assuming that you are local, maybe you can check the plaque.—<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 30 June 2005 19:52 (UTC)</dd>
