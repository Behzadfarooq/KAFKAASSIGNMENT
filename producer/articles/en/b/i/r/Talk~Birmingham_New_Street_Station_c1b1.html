<p>Under naming policy, this should be at its most common name, i.e. <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_3505.html" title="Birmingham New Street">Birmingham New Street</a>. This also applies to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Euston_aeb5.html" title="London Euston">London Euston</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Picadilly_d86c.html" title="Manchester Picadilly">Manchester Picadilly</a> etc. Also, if a station's name is duplicated by something else, it should be capitalised because it refers to a specific station, e.g. Derby Station, not <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby_station.html" title="Derby station">Derby station</a>. I appreciate the work you've done on the list of British railway stations, it still needs tidying. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 19:47, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Birmingham New Street is also the name of a major street in Birmingham. So removing the "station" may well be a recipe for confusion, especially amongst Brummies. Likewise <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Piccadilly_0e7d.html" title="Manchester Piccadilly">Manchester Piccadilly</a> may be confused with the Piccadilly area of central Manchester, so I dont think removing the "station" is very wise their either. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 19:54, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>er, no. The name of the street in Birmingham is "New Street", and an article on it would be entitled <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Street%2C_Birmingham_0caf.html" title="New Street, Birmingham">New Street, Birmingham</a> to distinguish it from other New Streets. Likewise <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picadilly.html" title="Picadilly">Picadilly</a> deserves its own article, but not as. Anyway, now you've really screwed it up by turning <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_3505.html" title="Birmingham New Street">Birmingham New Street</a> into an article on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Street%2C_Birmingham_0caf.html" title="New Street, Birmingham">New Street, Birmingham</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 21:54, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You claim that "Birmingham New Street" is the common name: Do you have any proof of this?, I would say that "New Street Station" is just as common, that is certainly how brummies refer to it. Besides Birmingham New Street station is a station so leaving the "station" off the end is quite patently daft. I dont know why you have suddenly decided to move this page, it has been sitting quite happily at 'Birmingham New Street station' for well over a year and no-one has complained about it. Unless you can provide proof that "Birmingham New Street" is the common name. I will move it back and turn the latter into a disambig. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 19:31, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>A google search excluding several railway related terms still only generates links about the station <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street%22+-station+-rail+-train+-trains+-railway+-railways+-%22Network+Rail%22+-Virgin+-+%22Central+Trains%22" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street%22+-station+-rail+-train+-trains+-railway+-railways+-%22Network+Rail%22+-Virgin+-+%22Central+Trains%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street%22+-station+-rail+-train+-trains+-railway+-railways+-%22Network+Rail%22+-Virgin+-+%22Central+Trains%22</a> Conversely, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street+station%22&amp;spell=1" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street+station%22&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street+station%22&amp;spell=1</a> brings up Wikipedia mirrors, whereas "Birmingham New Street" has 17,200 hits, less the 3,930 for "Birmingham New Street station" still gives 13270 hits for Birmingham New Street against 3,930 for "Birmingham New Street station". There is no problem with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Street%2C_Birmingham_0caf.html" title="New Street, Birmingham">New Street, Birmingham</a> being confused with <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_3505.html" title="Birmingham New Street">Birmingham New Street</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 19:43, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes practically all of those are train timetables which are abbreviated, so that doesn't prove anything. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 19:57, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But that's the point; there is *nothing* about <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Street%2C_Birmingham_0caf.html" title="New Street, Birmingham">New Street, Birmingham</a> that could ever confuse it with <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_3505.html" title="Birmingham New Street">Birmingham New Street</a>. Similarly, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Paddington_e307.html" title="London Paddington">London Paddington</a> isn't going to be confused with <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddington.html" title="Paddington">Paddington</a>. or <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester_City_594b.html" title="Leicester City">Leicester City</a> with <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester.html" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>, or for that why don't we start naming things Empire State Building Skyscraper, or Burton-on-Trent Town? No. Because it violates <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">☺</a> 20:25, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you actually seen where the examples you've just given actually link to. <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester_City_594b.html" title="Leicester City">Leicester City</a> re-directs to <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester_City_F.C_1acd.html" title="Leicester City F.C">Leicester City F.C</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Paddington_e307.html" title="London Paddington">London Paddington</a> re-directs to <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddington_Station_6cb1.html" title="Paddington Station">Paddington Station</a>.</dd>

<dd>The example you've given of the Empire-State Building invalidates your own argument, have you not noticed the "Building" at the end of the name. It would be rather silly if it was called the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_State_9334.html" title="Empire State">Empire State</a> now wouldn't it. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 20:34, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One problem is that local usage and international usage probably differ here. In <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Station_%28London%29_30f4.html" title="Victoria Station (London)">Victoria Station (London)</a> is commonly simply called [[Victoria]], but please don't move that article there! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 11:45, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you will have no doubt noticed, all 17 stations controlled by <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Rail_3734.html" title="Network Rail">Network Rail</a> have been given their own little logo. I have uploaded all the thumbnail images, but none of the articles for non-London stations have a suitable template with which to incorporate them. Thus I have just left it right at the beginning as this is exactly how the station board reads:</p>

Only articles which cover both the railway station and a tube station should have the "station" format. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 21:44, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I've removed Newcastle; I forgot it had a metro station. Tram stops are not generally referred to as stations. The official names of the tram stops (as shown on the relevant route maps) are "Piccadilly", "Victoria", "Birmingham Snow Hill" and "Sheffield Station/Sheffield Hallam University". So I can't see that omitting "railway" from the articles titles will make them any more relevant to the tram services. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 02:55, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - if tram stations are not to be included, then this would be a change from the custom which already seems to be in place for London; see <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Croydon_station_8ef1.html" title="East Croydon station">East Croydon station</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Croydon_station_eeab.html" title="West Croydon station">West Croydon station</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitcham_Junction_station_32bd.html" title="Mitcham Junction station">Mitcham Junction station</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/c/Beckenham_Junction_station_cf02.html" title="Beckenham Junction station">Beckenham Junction station</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birkbeck_station.html" title="Birkbeck station">Birkbeck station</a>. Since the major purpose of many of these tram stations is to provide a railway interchange (linking Piccadilly and Victoria stations was one of Metrolink’s major goals), it seems logical to me that they be covered along with the railway station in the same way as railway/metro interchanges in London and Newcastle. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 16:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Sheffield Midland Station article concerns both the railway station (which by all mean shouldn't have the word railway in it anyway) and the Sheffield Supertram stop of the same name as stated by David Arthur. If need be, redirect Sheffield Midland railway station to sheffield Midland station (as it currently is) since there is no other object or place in the world with that name, adding railway is both long and vaguely significant. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet">Captain scarlet</a> 03:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Euston is probably split from its tube station because the railway terminus interchanges with the tube not only at Euston tube, but also at Euston Square tube. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 17:36, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have never, <i>ever</i> met someone who lives in London and seriously considers Euston Square to have an interchange with Euston Station. It's as far from Euston as Marylebone is from Baker Street, and further than Liecester Square from Covent Garden (in terms of time to travel on foot between them, at least). The proper Wikipedia manner in which to split the article is to have "Euston station" as the parent article, mentioning both, with "Euston railway station" and "Eustion tube station" as sub-articles with greater depth. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 13:16, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Er excuse me but I dont think that this move has been properly discussed. This move appears to violate the principle of using common names. And I can find no evidence that "railway" is included in the title of the station. Looking up google hits we find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Birmingham New Street Station" <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street+Station%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=%22Birmingham+New+Street+Station%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">gets 46,200 hits</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Therefore I contend that this move is in violation of the common naming principle. "Birmingham New Street railway station" appears to be a wikipedia neologism. Somebody above stated that this was the correct name, I can find no evidence of this. It appears to be incorrect, Network Rail's website calls it Birmingham New Street Station <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/BirminghamNewStreet/Default.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/BirminghamNewStreet/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man"><font color="blue">G-Man</font></a> <a href="../../../g/-/m/User_talk%7EG-Man_c9d1.html" title="User talk:G-Man">*</a> 21:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I agree. Similarly: Glasgow Central Station - 48,000 Google hits Central Station, Glasgow - 875 Glasgow Central Railway Station - 501 86.144.36.159 11:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem of simply using "Birmingham New Street" is that to the general public, this could mean "New Street in Birmingham" or the station. There are several reasons for adding the "railway station" to the end:
<ul>
<li>Avoid any ambiguity what-so-ever</li>
<li>Consistency of naming of all station articles. If say "Cheltenham Spa railway station" was renamed to just "Cheltenham Spa", would this mean the town or the station?</li>
<li>By having a naming convention it is supposed to prevent arguments like this one!</li>

<dd>My point is that it is not wrong. If I said "Chestefield railway station" you would know exactly what I meant, without any possible ambiguity. The whole point of an encyclopedia is to make navigation easy without having lots of articles that use the same name. Taking things to the extreme, "Chesterfield Station" could mean the bus station, the railway station, the fire station, etc... The other advantage of adding "railway" to the article name is it easily allows the identification of different forms of transport, e.g. tram, railway, metro. At the end of the day, I personally don't mind which system is used, so long as just one system is used. Should you choose the "X Station" convention, there will be an awful lot of articles that need changing (since most were created under the present convention). <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOur_Phellap_7982.html" title="User:Our Phellap">Our Phellap</a> 17:10, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see your point but, well when one mentions station it is by default a train station. A particular station such as a fire staiton is always mentionned with the extension. As an encyclopedia the articles must have an appropriate name, the body of the article is there to explain what it is, almost all the articles have this intro "<b>blah blah</b> is a <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_station.html" title="Railway station">railway station</a> in blah blah town". Then in almost most articles need a link name as well as the link to X Station, by simplifying naming it will make all our lives easier when editing articles.

<dd>Your comment illustrates why "station" is ambiguous. What the introduction says is largely irrelevant to what the article title is, as it is the title that gets linked to not the introduction. The defacto standard is "x railway station" so that is what the links point to, removing ambiguity in the article and removing the need to hunt for what the article is called. Capitalising the S goes against the Wikipedia principle of unnecessary capitalisaion (i.e. using sentence case), as I've mentioned before. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 02:56, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever man, you're just fighting losing battle trying to hang on to your project that is unlikely to see the light. wikipedia principle of unnecessary capitalisation is irrelevant here as the capitalised S is part of the stations' names as I've mentioned before. just like <b>T</b>ower of <b>L</b>ondon/ Railway station is not and has never been the (defacto?) standard, it is only in your mind. Just let it go. Removing 'railway' from the stations' articles removes the need to hunt for the article. How funny would it be to have station articles named (example) <i>Nottingham Victoria Station railway station</i>...<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_scarlet_6377.html" title="User:Captain scarlet">Captain scarlet</a> 06:29, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> has already suggested, the names on the signs outside the stations should be used. If anyone, then the owners should decide what their stations are called. I regularly use Queen Street station in Glasgow, where the signs say "Welcome to Queen Street Station" and the equivilent in Gaelic (which I can't remember). Similarly, the signs all over Central Station carry the same naming convention, e.g. see photo on <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Station%2C_Glasgow_a09b.html" title="Central Station, Glasgow">Central Station</a>. 86.142.209.78 13:00, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.networkrail.co.uk" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> lists the stations as X station, not X railway station. This has clearly been suggested just as another argument on wiki. It seems that people are always requesting to change naming conventions although things are fine the way they are. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.142.209.78 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.142.209.78_921c.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.142.209.78">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>But then, Network Rail only deal with railway stations, so there’s no possibility of confusion or overlap, whereas there are all sorts of stations which might be suitable for inclusion on Wikipedia.

Use the names used on location not <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>'s scheme&#160;! Plus if anyone wants to log off and post comments the user could at least using an IP that has not got his/her only contributions in this very talk page! It is an accepted convention in the real world where actual people speak to each that a <i>Station</i> is where trains go, <i>Firestation</i> is were firemen work, <i>Bus station</i> is where buses go to.

<p>The article has been cut and paste moved, meaning the edit history was split between <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_3505.html" title="Birmingham New Street">Birmingham New Street</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_railway_station_35c5.html" title="Birmingham New Street railway station">Birmingham New Street railway station</a>. I have now fixed this. It was VERY BAD FORM to move the article in the middle of an ogoing discussion where there was no consensus for any move and especially not to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_3505.html" title="Birmingham New Street">Birmingham New Street</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 07:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which is why i reverted the article to user Duncharris' version since there was no justification to the move as the <i>dscussion</i> if you want to call it is ongoing. I am not endorsing this BNS article naming either since it is against what I have been saying for god knows how long but I felt that the move was unjustified and unappropriate.

<dd>I thought everyone agreed it should end with <i>-station</i> at the very least. Even <i>Captain Scarlet</i> (look at his comments above). Or are some people arguing for the sake of it? I'm not fussed if it gains a <i>-station</i> or <i>-railway station</i> suffix. But it definitely needs to end with one or the other as the current naming is absurd; it is a station, not a street! Railway seems to cause some offence so maybe it should move to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_New_Street_station_a84e.html" title="Birmingham New Street station">Birmingham New Street station</a>?

<dd>There are only two reasons to move this page. (1) Its current name is causing confusion. I don't buy that argument. I think even before I added the disambig notices to the top of both pages that it was very unlikely that people would seriously be confused for any length of time. Now that we have a disambig notice at the top of both pages the chance of any confusion is even more unlikely. (2) People actually refer to the station as something else. I don't know how we determine this accurately, but a Google Search backs up the name "Birmingham New Street station" (more than 45 THOUSAND results) as opposed to "Birmingham New Street railway station" (less than 5 HUNDRED). Doing a search for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22birmingham+new+street%22+-%22birmingham+new+street+station%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22birmingham+new+street%22+-%22birmingham+new+street+station%22" rel="nofollow">"birmingham new street" -"birmingham new street station"</a> brings up over 100 THOUSAND results and from a quick glance the results on the first few pages most (if not all) seem to be about the station and not the street. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 22:23, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While a case can be made for treating such examples as Birmingham New Street Station (a proper name in its own right) differently – and I am not necessarily opposed to that case – the evidence of signage ought not to dictate the naming of Wikipedia articles about railway stations in general.</dd>

<dd>I believe that it is entirely reasonable and in line with Wikipedia guidelines to entitle, for example, an article about the railway station at Mallaig "Mallaig railway station" – and one about the lifeboat station there "Mallaig lifeboat station", etc. This is, and has been, the practice for nearly all British railway station articles in Wp, and I think, a few exceptions apart, it should remain so. -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 10:44, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
