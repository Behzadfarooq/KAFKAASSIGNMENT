<dd>Thank you for the clarification - a quick review of articles led me to belive only a difference in how fertile time assessed, rather than what is then done.

<dd>I've moved FA out from being exclusively NFP, but the remaining items to the right seem more associated with NFP although not exclusively. Is this now more approprate (as all things NFP are acceptable to Natural Birth Control, but clearly not all things NBC ar eacceptable to NFP) as my brain tends to classify things into sets and sub-sets, but do let me know if this is still poorly structured and we can revert back to the plain list&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 17:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's better, but FA includes those things too. I don't know if your categorization implies that. NFP basically <i>is</i> FA, but with further restrictions.

<dd>Yes, and also... The table sets out in a structured way a summary of available options (Fertility awareness also lists some of the specific methods listed but is a useful distiguishing term that might be sought by the reader). Also I suspect that the sterilisation article is quite long and in need of splitting - ie issues of sterilisation and consent from partner being or not being required - Also issues if existing child dies, partner widowed or partnership split and later new relationship may all result in requests for reversal of proceedure are appropriate to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterilisation.html" title="Sterilisation">Sterilisation</a>; the specific methods then in their own article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:28, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Infanticide</span></h2>
<p>I know this is a controversial topic, which is why I'm opening the discussion on the talk page, not by changing the template!</p>
<p>From the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infanticide.html" title="Infanticide">infanticide</a> article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In sociology and biology, infanticide is the practice of intentionally causing the death of an infant of a given species, by members of the same species. In many past societies, certain forms of infanticide were considered permissible, whereas in most modern societies the practice is considered immoral and criminal. Nonetheless, it still takes place â€” in the Western world usually because of the parent's mental illness or violent behavior, and in some poor countries because of tacit societal acceptance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As this clearly shows, although infanticide <i>should</i> not be used as birth control, it sometimes is, and definitely has been. I therefore suggest that infanticide be listed in the template. Comments? --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlashme_49c3.html" title="User:Slashme">Slashme</a> 08:34, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Disagree</b> - infantacide is merely killing of a child for any reason (if due to parent's mental illness or violent behaviour then it is not a deliberate attempt at limitation of family size). I agree that infanticide specifically for purpose limiting number children has occured in past and probably occurs in some countries to this day (especially where daughters are seen as a burded compared to boys), but I do not think it should be included - it is not a routine practice, it totally fails to meet the topic in question (ie 'Birth control' vs 'Limiting family size' as birth is not controlled nor prevented - the child is still born and infanticide occurs afterwards). Similarly enforced sterilisation of those thought incapable/unworthy of having children (handicaped in some societies &amp; in the past) does not warrant separate inclusion in the table. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 12:13, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sterilization naming</span></h2>
<p>In response to the recent edit attempting to make Essure its own listing: I, personally, think of "tubal ligation" as physically disconnecting the tubes, whether through cutting or cauterizing or clamping.

<dd>Good call. I've tweaked the vertical spacing of the lines by moving each item coded on a sepearate line into single lists. I'm a bit dubious about classifying anti-oetrogens as "non-hormonal" as they work on a hormonal system, albeit as antagonists (opposers) rather than agonists - similar oestrogen in the combined pill is obvious oestrogenic in effects, yet is not its contraceptive effect in part that teh exogenous supply suppresses the normal pituitary-ovarian axis&#160;? I think just terming Ormeloxifene as "anti-estrogenic" is simpler, and also far shorter&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I would like to do is have some sort of ordering of reversible/natural through to more interventional hormonal, to postcoital to abortion and sterilisation sequence; currently seems a little jumbled. Also I think Post-coital measues have a sequence of EC to abortion - would also compact down the template by one line. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 02:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the sterilization - should we really includ hysterectomy and castration as birth control options? I know they result in sterility, but does anyone (human) actually go through those procedures for the primary purpose of preventing pregnancy? Similarly with <a href="../../../o/o/p/Oophorectomy.html" title="Oophorectomy">oophorectomy</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penectomy.html" title="Penectomy">penectomy</a> - those procedures result in sterility, but are not used for the primary purpose of birth control, and so in my opinion should also not be in this list. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 03:10, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Likewise for younger women requring hysterectomy, the issue of resulting infertility can be huge issue (e.g. cancer, or in catastrophic haemorrhaging following miscarriage or birth) - but we're not including the sterilisation effects of chemotherapy here either <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 04:53, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of Celibacy</span></h2>
<p>The logic used in removing hysterectomy and castration from the list was that birth control is a side effect of these operations. In accordance with this logic, I have removed <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">Celibacy</a> from this list, leaving <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abstinence.html" title="Sexual abstinence">Sexual abstinence</a>. Certainly, some people might maintain sexual abstinence primarily for birth control. However, if you look at the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">Celibacy</a> main article, birth control is not listed as one of the primary reasons for maintaining celibacy. The state of celibacy is associated with deep religious, social, or personal convictions which are unrelated to birth control. As in the case of hysterectomy or castration, birth control seems to be a side effect of celibacy. Sexual abstinence is a more accurate description of the behavior of those who abstain from sex primarily for birth control, and it remains in the list. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 19:33, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Behavioral vs. Physical</span></h2>
<p>I see there being a major distinction between physical and behavioral methods of birth control, a distinction supported in the listing of methods in the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_Control_8308.html" title="Birth Control">Birth Control</a> main article. Physical birth control methods work to physically interfere with fertility, fertilization or conception. Behavioral (including "natural") birth control methods make no change to fertility, but require users to manage or halt their sexual behavior in order to avoid conception. This distinction is currently reflected by placing the Behavioral methods at bottom. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 18:15, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As explained by DavidRuben (<a href="#Formatting" title="">above</a>), there is logic in listing the methods with most invasive/permanent at one end and least invasive/most reversible at the other. I don't care which one is on top vs. bottom, but I do not understand why all the other classes would be listed one direction (barrier - minimally invasive/rapidly reverisible -&gt; sterilization - irreversible), and the behavoiral methods (least invasive of all/just as reversible as barrier) would be listed out of order. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 22:51, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the reasons I set them apart is that I don't think it's possible to determine empirically how "invasive" a behavioral method is. Consider that some <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertility_awareness.html" title="Fertility awareness">fertility awareness</a> users choose abstinence during the fertile period. While these people may find it natural and comfortable to abstain from intercourse for over a week out of every month, others may find that proposal to be so 'invasive' as to be impossible. Another example: I would guess that most sexually active adults would find maintaining abstinence to be enormously "invasive", when compared to the use of the birth control pill. Yet your proposed ordering would label abstinence less invasive than the Pill.</dd>
<dd>Determining how invasive the physical methods are is fairly straightforward. However, the extent to which a behavioral method is considered 'invasive' is entirely dependent on the individual. Opinions vary too widely to categorize behavioral methods this way.</dd>
<dd>Also, importantly, the fact that these methods are immediately reversible does not mean that they are 'less invasive' than other methods. The required modifications to behavior will seem minimally invasive to some and hugely invasive to others. This is another reason that I prefer to see the behavioral methods set apart in a separate section. I am learning more about coding templates and hopefully will soon be able to make this distinction more visibly clear. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 00:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no opinion on them behavoiral methods being set apart. I don't see any benefit to isolating them further than just on their own line, but don't see any harm in it, either. I also have no opinion on whether they are on top or bottom of the infobox. But if the rest of the list is ordered with respect to physical invasiveness and reversibility, putting behavoiral methods next to sterilization looks odd and is something I oppose. If the rest of the list is ordered in a different way (alphabetically?) then my opinion might be different.</p>
<p>Psychological "invasiveness", a.k.a. acceptability of a method to a particular couple, varies widely - and this is not only true of behavoiral methods, but of physical methods as well. But physical invasiveness is easy to measure. While many couples may find sterilization, for example, less invasive to their sex life than barrier methods, we seem to have agreed that, physically, surgery is more invasive than barriers, and ordered the list appropriately. Behavoiral methods are most similar to barriers with respect to reversibility - every sex act has the choice of whether to use the method or not. Unlike systemic methods, and to a greater extent IUDs, and ultimately sterilization. Because they are most similar to barriers both in terms of reversibility and physical invasiveness, behavoiral methods should be placed next to barriers, not sterilization, in the list. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 00:37, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see behavioral methods as an entirely separate class of birth control methods than the physical methods. Behavioral methods require making changes to sexual behavior or abstaining from it entirely. I realize that the current formatting does not clearly visibly reflect this, but I feel the physical distinction is important. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 13:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently, people have no objection to the distinction between Physical and Behavioral methods in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html#Methods" title="Birth control">the Birth Control main article</a>. It is useful to distinguish those methods which physically interfere with fertility or pregnancy, and those that require fertile people to change their sexual behavior in order to work around their existing fertility. Judging by sheer numbers, it seems that most sexually active people find the requirements of behavioral methods to be incompatible with their lifestyle. I think most people can readily make a distinction between methods that involve a chemical, device, or surgical procedure, and methods that involve a set of behavioral controls. I think that that maintaining this distinction is quite useful, especially, as you stated below (under header "Natural"), if people may use this infobox to view and select a method that they can use. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 18:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are classes of methods in this list listed in a particular order? Is there a reason for barrier methods to be near one end, hormonal methods in the middle, and sterilization at the other end?</dd>
<dd>I believe the current ordering of the list tries to reflect the physical invasiveness, side effect levels, and reversibility of the different classes of methods. Methods with similar levels of such characteristics are listed next to each other (hormonal, centchroman, IUS can all have systemic effects; barrier and hormonal can be discontinued at user discretion; IUD, IUS, abortion, sterilization all involve inserting things into the uterus, etc.) Except for behavoiral methods, which are currently listed next to sterilization.</dd>
<dd>If the list is ordered as I described above, I do not understand why behavoiral methods should be listed next to sterilization. If it is not so ordered, then I propose we rearrange the methods to make it clear that similarities between methods are not implied by the ordering of the list. A possible order would be Intra-uterine, barrier, anti-estrogen, post-intercourse, sterilization, hormonal, behavoiral. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 00:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your labeling. "<a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_birth_control.html" title="Natural birth control">Natural birth control</a>" is a term which generally refers to birth control methods which do not involve the use of chemicals or devices. The main article for that term is explicitly clear in stating that "proponents of the Catholic concept of natural family planning define 'natural' somewhat differently...". This differentiation of the various usages of the term supports the usage of the phrase "natural birth control" outside of the more specific Catholic definition. To put it more clearly, using the word "natural" does not necessarily specifically refer to the Catholic definition. Therefore, this usage does not create license for labeling everything else "unnatural". <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 22:17, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that the distinction is not useful. The link to natural birth control provides additional information about herbs which may be useful, also experimental heat-based contraception, as well as information which clarifies the Catholic usage of the word "natural".

The fact that you take offense with the label or the concept does not mean that it should be stricken from this list. I agree that the experimental methods should not be listed in the infobox, but I do not agree that the link should be removed. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 18:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the context of the article, the neutral definition is clear - there is an entire article's worth of text explaining how the term is being used. In the context of a listing in this template, users will bring their own POV when interpreting what it means. Some users will legitimately see the less common definitions of natural's opposite, "artificial". So there is a minor POV in listing the "natural birth control" article.</dd>
<dd>Because this is not a major POV (the most common definition of "artificial" <i>is</i> neutral), the benefits of the listing can be weighed against the number of users that will see the POV. I see no benefits in having the "natural" listing. With no benefits, and a minor POV, the decision should be to remove it. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 00:37, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed these specific types of FA because Fertility Awareness is the term used to describe these methods, and a link is provided to this article. I agree that these methods should be given attention, but I feel that the Fertility Awareness main page is a better place to do so. I have requested, on that Talk page, that Lyrl or other knowledgeable users will help to make the FA article a centralized location where the various FA methods are compared and contrasted. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 14:10, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is desire to avoid pregnancy a primary motivation for anal sex, oral sex, or masturbation? Also, these methods may also be included within the topic of outercourse, as <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control/outercourse.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control/outercourse.htm" rel="nofollow">Planned Parenthood does</a>. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 01:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is held that some people choose to maintain abstinence, avoiding all sexual activity for the purpose of birth control. <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html#Avoiding_vaginal_intercourse" title="Birth control">The main article</a> supports that some people may avoid only certain kinds of sexual activity for the purpose of birth control, as does the above Planned Parenthood link that you provided.</dd>
<dd>Your second concern: <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outercourse.html" title="Outercourse">Wikipedia's definition of outercourse</a> differs from Planned Parenthood's; stating that outercourse refers to sex without vaginal or anal penetration, with oral sex debated as to whether it is outercourse or intercourse. Legally, forced oral sex, vaginal sex and anal sex are all considered rape, meaning that in a legal context, oral sex is considered to be a form of intercourse. <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outercourse.html" title="Outercourse">Solo masturbation is not listed as a form of outercourse</a>, as outercourse is generally considered to be conducted with a partner. Like abstinence, solo masturbation does not involve a partner, but may be considered a form of birth control if practiced instead of intercourse. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 18:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main concern is that there are bound to be people offended by the listing of these terms. Especially the anal sex. I consider myself to be pretty open about sexuality, but I was taken aback by seeing anal sex in the template. Other sources do not list these methods as primary level descriptions - they are not listed in the table of contents of the Wikipedia birth control article, and they are not listed individually in the Planned Parenthood link. Both places discuss the methods, but under sub-headings. I'm seeking to make sure there are no such alternative, less in-your-face ways of including these activities - that the shock value for readers is justified.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The articles on anal sex, oral sex, or masturbation do not really address the use of these methods for avoiding pregnancy. They mention that some people use it for that reason, and leave it at that. I'm not sure that these articles should be expanded in that direction, either - I don't believe the desire to avoid pregnancy is the primary motivation of most people engaging in these activities. So I'm not sure the links to these article are useful, from a birth-control standpoint.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Back to the first point, Wikipedia's definitions are mutable. The abstinence article already has several mentions of the debate over whether "abstinence" means avoiding all sexual activity, or only penile-vaginal sex. Even in the opening line it says <i>"...refraining from <b>some</b> or all aspects of sexual activity."</i> The possibility that rises in alternative sexual activities are driven by abstinence-only propaganda is discussed. The Wikipedia article currently focuses on oral sex, but there are certainly <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2126643/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2126643/" rel="nofollow">sources discussing anal sex</a> from which more material could be added. There are sources that consider solo masturbation possibly consistent with being abstinent <a href="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/?article=activity&amp;refid=024" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/?article=activity&amp;refid=024" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which could also be added to the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Similar inclusiveness can be put in the outercourse article. Anal sex (per PP, above) and mutual masturbation (<a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/youth/health/contraceptives/outercourse.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/youth/health/contraceptives/outercourse.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) can easily be added to the list, with similar disclaimers as are currently there for oral sex.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not currently convinced that the direct links to the anal sex, oral sex, and masturbation articles are necessary or beneficial to this template. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 01:41, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I already pared it down as much as I could. The items you listed cannot be put under "outercourse" -- anal sex is intercourse, not outercourse. Outercourse is conducted with a partner, making it separate from masturbation. Most definitions of outercourse exclude oral sex, due to the disease risk.</dd>
<dd>Listing certain sexual practices as an alternative to vaginal intercourse is not inherently any more offensive than listing that fertile adults may choose to refrain from acting on their desire for sexual contact. <a href="../../../j/o/i/User%7EJoie_de_Vivre_996f.html" title="User:Joie de Vivre">Joie de Vivre</a> 20:10, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia article <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> only covers penile-vaginal intercourse. It does not cover anal sex. The conflict between definitions can certainly be <i>discussed</i> in the outercourse article. Describing forms of sexual activity is inherently more graphic than describing a lack of sexual activity. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">C</a></sub> 21:14, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
