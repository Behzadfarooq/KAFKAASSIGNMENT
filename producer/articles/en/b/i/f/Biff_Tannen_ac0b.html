He is the great-grandson of <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buford__Mad_Dog__Tannen_8673.html" title="Buford &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen">Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen</a> and the grandfather of <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griff_Tannen_d0b2.html" title="Griff Tannen">Griff Tannen</a>. He is not very bright and only got through <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> by bullying <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_McFly_7edf.html" title="George McFly">George McFly</a> to do his homework for him. Biff is feared by most of his schoolmates. He is less brave when he is without his gang (<a href="../../../o/t/h/Other_Characters_in_Back_to_the_Future_703a.html#Match.2C_Skinhead.2C_and_3-D" title="Other Characters in Back to the Future">Match, Skinhead, and 3-D</a>). He also has a crush on <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine_Baines_McFly_838e.html" title="Lorraine Baines McFly">Lorraine Baines</a> and constantly refers to her as "my girl." Lorraine does not return the sentiments.</p>
<p>By 1985, Biff's marital status is unknown – no mention of a wife or children was ever made in the trilogy, although Biff has a grandson <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griff_Tannen_d0b2.html" title="Griff Tannen">Griff</a> by 2015, suggesting that Biff had at least one child by 1985. The animated series reveals that Biff has a son, Biff, Jr., (who, according to an early script for <i><a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II_2200.html" title="Back to the Future Part II">Back to the Future Part II</a></i>, owns the <a href="../../../c/a/f/Cafe_80%27s.html" title="Cafe 80's">Cafe 80's</a>), although this is not taken as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> by many fans. A draft script reveals that his middle initial is "H" for "Howard", although his middle name was never mentioned in the trilogy. Also, a BTTF comic showed a "Mugsy Tannen" living in 1920's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>-era <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> as a gang boss, probably Mad Dog's son.</p>
<p>Biff is noted for mangling <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simile.html" title="Simile">similes</a>: for example, he says "make like a tree and <i>get out of here</i>" instead of "make like a tree and <i><a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaf.html" title="Leaf">leave</a></i>" on more than one occasion. He also once says "That's about as funny as a screen door on a <i>battleship</i>" instead of <i>submarine</i>. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Back_to_the_Future%7E_The_Ride_a34d.html" title="Back to the Future: The Ride">Back to the Future: The Ride</a></i>, he says "Have a nice trip, see you next <i>winter</i>" instead of <i>fall</i>. He is also known for calling people "butthead". When someone says something foolish, he knocks on their head with his fist (or a fist-shaped cane in his old age) saying "Hello? Hello? Anybody home?" His attitude is to do something rather than think things over, and he has no problems with using his fists to get what he wants. Biff will try and get out of paying for things if he has to and is looking for a nice easy life where everyone else will do things for him. He also likes cars and ends up with a career waxing and cleaning them with his auto-detailing business. Biff is still a bully, but can be nice and/or charming when he needs to be, usually to get out of trouble.</p>

<p>Although we have some vague details of Biff's life before <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, exact details are not known. What is known is that he has been living with his grandma, Gertrude Tannen, at 1809 Mason Street for some time by November 1955. The whereabouts of his parents are not known, although some theories suggest that one or both of them might be dead or in prison. The absence of his parents may attribute to his negative attitude and hostile demeanor. He also had to repeat a year of school (explaining why, despite being a year older than George and Lorraine, he is in the same <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade_%28education%29.html" title="Grade (education)">grade</a> as them), although it is not known exactly when he was "kept behind" – this was probably some years prior to 1955, as Biff appears to have been bullying George for some time before this date.</p>
<p>In several draft scripts of the films, he was born on Elm Street, and he was a fantastic asset to the high school football team, which is given as the reason why he was kept to do his senior year twice.</p>

Biff, age 18, in 1955</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the original timeline, Biff started bullying George McFly when they were kids and never stopped. Over the next 30 years, Biff would continue to bully and intimidate George, as they both ended up working for the same company where Biff became George's supervisor (due to George doing all Biff's work for him to get promoted). Biff's crush on Lorraine never died either, although Lorraine had married George and presumably Biff had married as well.</p>
<p>However, things changed when the events of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_d4da.html" title="Back to the Future">first movie</a> begin to unfold. The McFlys' youngest son, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_McFly_1425.html" title="Marty McFly">Marty McFly</a>, accidentally traveled back through time to <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, interfering with his parents' first meeting. Marty, using the anachronistic name "<a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Klein_0a34.html" title="Calvin Klein">Calvin Klein</a>," also managed to get on the wrong side of Biff by standing up to him, something which Biff was not used to. Marty was also indirectly responsible for causing Biff to crash his car into a manure truck, and this led to Biff finding Marty and Lorraine on the night of the school dance (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, 1955). Biff's gang trapped Marty in the trunk of another car, and Biff tried to get his way with Lorraine. George came along, as part of the plan he and Marty had made where George would find Marty "parking" with Lorraine, but soon realized that the pretend rescue was now a real one. For the first time, George stood up to Biff to stop him from raping Lorraine. He responded by attempting to break George's arm. Lorraine, trying to pull Biff away from George, was knocked to the ground. This enraged George, who subsequently knocked out Biff with one punch.</p>
<p>This punch led to a much more confident George, and Biff no longer had a victim to pick on. He may have found someone else to bully, but some theories suggest that as the supposed weakest kid in school had successfully stood up to and punched Biff, nobody else would let him bully them anymore. Since Biff no longer had George to do his work for him, he now had to do things for himself. He started up his auto-detailing business, which he owns and runs himself, and by 1985 it seems to be quite popular. The McFlys are among his most loyal customers, and Biff's subservient attitude is demonstrated by addressing George as "Mr. McFly". George seems amused at Biff's efforts to get away with as little work as possible, though he and Lorraine privately credit him with unwittingly helping them get together, and they appear to have become friends, or are at least on amicable terms. Biff is nice to his customers to their faces, but can still be mean if he has to be.</p>

Biff, age 78, in 2015</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the start of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II_2200.html" title="Back to the Future Part II">second film</a>, Marty, Doc, and Marty's girlfriend <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Parker_ca36.html" title="Jennifer Parker">Jennifer Parker</a> travelled forward in time from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/1/2015.html" title="2015">2015</a> – unaware that their departure had been witnessed by Biff. Over the next 30 years, he remembers seeing the flying DeLorean taking off.</p>
<p>Biff, seemingly bitter and resentful at this point in his life, is still waxing cars by <a href="../../../2/0/1/2015.html" title="2015">2015</a>, at the age of 78, and is pushed around by his grandson Griff. Despite being over the age of retirement, Biff does not appear to have retired – he may just be doing his grandson a favor by waxing his car, or he may have hit on hard times and been forced to continue working. Biff still seems to like bullying people, including Marty (who he thinks is Marty's future son, Marty, Jr.), and the handle on his walking cane is in the shape of a closed fist – although he remains cautious and apprehensive around George McFly. Biff's crush on Lorraine still lingers as indicated with his line, "Hey kid. Say hello to your grandma for me".</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">October 21</a>, 2015, Biff saw the time machine from 1985 in the street and realized that Doc Brown had invented a time machine. He picked up a sports <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almanac.html" title="Almanac">almanac</a> that Doc had thrown in the trash and stole the DeLorean while Doc and Marty were rescuing Jennifer from her future home. Biff headed back to November 12, 1955, with the almanac to give to his younger self. However, upon returning to 2015 Biff became the victim of a time paradox: his giving the almanac to his younger self had changed the timeline, resulting in his nonexistence. A deleted scene shows him slumped behind a garbage bin fading into nothingness as the DeLorean flies away. The top part of Biff's cane remained in the DeLorean after he accidentally broke it when returning, and Doc showed it to Marty as an indication that old Biff was there.</p>

Biff, age 48, in the Alternate 1985</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Young Biff used the sports almanac to bet on the results of sporting events, since he now knew the results. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, age 21, Biff soon became very rich and powerful, spending his money on women and cars. He also started up his toxic waste company, Biffco, soon becoming one of the richest and most powerful men in America. Biff built a casino hotel in Hill Valley (at least 27 stories high), named "<i>Biff's Pleasure Palace</i>", on the site of the former Courthouse, upon legalized gambling in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. He also helped <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> remain <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> until at least <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> (while seeking a fifth consecutive term). Biff's effects on history affected the whole world – in this version of history, the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> was also still ongoing by May, 1983. Though he was recognized as one of America's heroes, his enormous casino hotel, complete authority over the local law enforcement, and money driven power, drove Hill Valley into a breeding ground for <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corruption.html" title="Corruption">corruption</a>, and <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang_warfare.html" title="Gang warfare">gang warfare</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all this, Biff did not have the girl he wanted. In this version of history, he was married at least three times, presumably the first wife was the woman he would have married in the normal timeline and the mother of his child(ren). On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, Biff shot and <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murdered</a> George McFly, though Lorraine is unaware of this. He married her not long afterwards, possibly by offering financial support to the young widow and her 3 children, but the money and power had gone to his head, and he treated her horribly, and among other things, forced her to get <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implants.html" title="Breast implants">breast implants</a>. This went on until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> when Lorraine finally shot Biff—this was never implied in the finished film, but <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Zemeckis_65e4.html" title="Robert Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Gale_8708.html" title="Bob Gale">Bob Gale</a> have suggested the "Lorraine shot Biff" theory as an explanation for Biff's fading away in the afore-mentioned deleted scene. There is another possibility; having created an alternate timeline by giving his younger self the almanac, the old Biff from 2015 no longer exists, now that 2015 will become part of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985A_ebdf.html" title="1985A">1985A</a> timeline.</p>
<p>This version of reality was erased when Marty and Doc went back to 1955 and got the almanac from Biff before he could use it, causing Biff to crash into the very same manure truck a second time. The timeline went back to how it was at the end of the first film, where Biff was running his auto-detailing business.</p>

<p>Biff has a major role in the Back to the Future ride film. The ride reveals that in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> Doc established the Institute of Future Technology (IFT). On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, (also the day the ride opened), time travel volunteers from the IFT went back to 1955 to make sure that the timeline was back to normal following the events of the films. In 1955, 18 year-old Biff stowed away in the time machine, and, once in 1991, caused havok in the institute before stealing the time machine and blasting through time. Doc, with the help of the audience, followed Biff through time in the new 8-seater DeLorean. Biff visited <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2015.html" title="2015">2015</a> (almost the 30th anniversary of the first time travel experiment), the Ice Age, and the Late Cretaceous period, where he nearly perishes in what he dubs a "lava-fall" before being bumped in the back by the eight-passenger DeLorean at 88 MPH and heading back to 1991. Biff was then taken back to 1955, where he belonged, by Doc.</p>
<p>The ride is not taken as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> by many fans, so Biff's adventures above are often ignored.</p>

<p>Biff was the present day villain of the series, although most episodes featured one of his numerous ancestors or descendants instead, so frequently that Marty once rhetorically questioned if there was a "Biff" in every time and place they visited. The series established that Biff has a son, Biff, Jr., who is about 8 years old by 1991. No mention of a wife is made, and it appears that Biff is a single father. In the episode, <i>The Money Tree</i>, he is shown driving a tow truck, which means in the 6 years between the movies and the series, he still has his automotive detailing business. (He drove a "Biff's"-branded tow truck in 1985 in the movies).</p>
<p>The series has a few episodes centered around Biff. It revealed that in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> he saw the Comet Kablooey and thought it was an alien ship, and that in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> he tried claiming Jennifer Parker's grandparents' ranch after finding a deed saying the Tannen family owned it. However, Marty, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Jules_Brown_cb16.html" title="Jules Brown">Jules</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verne_Brown_a401.html" title="Verne Brown">Verne</a> went back to <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a> to make sure that the Tannens never got the deed.</p>
<p>One episode in the second season which took place in 1944 introduced a military character named Frank Tannen who lived in Hill Valley and was in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>.</p>
<p>The first season of the cartoon featured a segment after the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_credits.html" title="End credits">end credits</a> in which Biff would break the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> and tell the audience a joke which related to the theme of the episode.</p>
