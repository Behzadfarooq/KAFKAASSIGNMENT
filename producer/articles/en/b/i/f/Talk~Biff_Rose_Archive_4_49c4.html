<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
<p>We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Officially Released</li>
<li>Self Released</li>
<li>Singles</li>
<li>Out of Print Compilations</li>
<li>In Print Compilations</li>
</ul>
<p>Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue). Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 14:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do wonder at the designations of "self-released" vs. "officially released." At what point does one become the other? "Bone Again" and "Elizabethan Period" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine. "Roast Beef" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold. "Hamburger Blues" was an "official" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases. "Uncle Jesus" was a major label album that is harder to find than "Roast Beef." "The Pickwick album was an "offical" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases. The whole issue of "in print" vs. "out of print" is a bit difficult to assess as well. If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still "in print"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort. If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made. For example, see <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Ra_2947.html#Partial_Discography" title="Sun Ra">Sun_Ra</a>. A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones. It is a vague and misleading designation. Why not go for straight chronology?</dd>

<dd>And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit. Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't? --<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 19:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallawe_b035.html" title="User:Wallawe">Wallawe</a></p>

<li>Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the "released on cdr" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put "Full length releases" and combine them? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 22:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In most of these cases "cdr" is not an accurate designation. Some of them were glass-mastered CDs. But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway. --<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 23:25, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dd>The first paragraph was one sentence long and went: <i>"Judiasm is targeted" is a really problematic phrase.</i></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Then, as I had an additional comment on a different topic, I skipped a line, kept the same indent, and continued. I assumed that someone with a minimal level of intelligence would understand that these were part of the same entry, and that only one signature would be necessary.</dd>

<p>What the anonymous user/Jonah is doing is not disagreeing. You are deleting large part of an article and calling this a difference of opinion. What you are doing is vandalism through and through. Perhaps we can get a member of the Arbitration Committee to mediate? I somehow don't think that they would sympathize with your side of things. My offer still stands, if you recuse yourself (including ALL your sockpuppets and IPs) from this article so will I. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 04:28, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the record, my silence can be bought, but only for three years of my salary up front. And then I'd probably still find sneaky ways around it, like getting friends or <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indentured_servants.html" title="Indentured servants">indentured servants</a> to do my bidding, or at least vote their conscience around here....which would make it a not very good deal, I suppose. Plus, anyone paying such sums would have to reveal their core identity, which may mean they would have to find it. All interested parties would also have to stop calling me at 1:40 am, and would certainly have to stop leaving death threats for the subject of the article (had they ever started such practices, of course).

<dd>Contrary to the note left on <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a>'s page, Rose was not "banned from playing the Echo." He did, however, cancel a recently scheduled appearance in LA....a scheduled appearance that one of the "IP editors" had been writing to Biff about in a very threatening manner. I believe Rose cancelled for other reasons, but it's worth noting that this drama extends beyond this bio.</dd>

<p>Yeah, but there is no career, jsut like there really isn't a tv writing career, he did both things for a half an hour, and Christgau reports he found him funny, that doesn't give him a comedy career.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 20:01, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If this guy puts a line in aboiut every review he digs up about rose, then we're sort of magnifiying the importance of Rose. Better to link it, and leave the piece as it is. If Sojambi had his way the article would be a 5 stars out of 5 review praising rose and ignoring any of the more mercurial aspects of his life. i think it's best to als okeep in mind that Rose's Academy Award winning former songwriting partner <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Williams_4fc0.html" title="Paul Williams">Paul Williams</a> has a less actual sentences written about him in his entry, it's longer than the wki entry for one of rolling stone's 100 greatest guitar players of all time, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Kramer_27af.html" title="Wayne Kramer">Wayne Kramer</a>, and is a bigger entry than one of the record labels he recorded for, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddah_Records_b1f3.html" title="Buddah Records">Buddah Records</a>. By allowing his entry to gain such size and space we're denigrating these other extremely important people and things... rose has a value, it's just not on the par of these others, and so curtailing the article to the size of his influence and the scope of his work seems to be the best way to handle this, instead of heaping lavish praise on the man, let's write a succinct and honest article.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 01:24, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a starvation mentality. The denigration is in your own head. Not all things good are big, not all things good are small.

<p>this isn't vandalism- it's editing. Biff Rose wrote a melody to song that feautred lyrics and music by Paul Williams, who graciously allowed Rose to have credit on the song. This is precisely why Wiki fails, because if a group of people decide to believe one version of a story, they band together and label any alternative version as false, including factually backed up events, by doing so, they- the dominant group- can mislead the world. Hence- Wikipedia is not allowed to be cited for official documents or for scholastic endeavors. This is because those who have been granted administratorship, like Will Be Back have differing levels of morality, and often abuse their power. Since the current model of Wiki has been in effect literally thousands of administrators have been bounced fro mtheir duties, another very telling detail about the process of wikipedia. It's important to note that Biff Rose has been called racist and anti semitic, and by viable sources. It is also important to note that Rose has disavowed every single one of the people he has worked with in the past, presenting all of them, from management to agent, to label head honchos in very unfavorable light on his website message board, and other times in his songs. To label anyone who tries to represent this information as a vandal is totally ridiculous. I'm not Jonah Ayers anymore than I'm Walter, labelled thusly by biff's mouthpiece on here, Steve, er Sojambi Pinola. I'm actually a resident of New Orleans who has served mr. rose a number of the drinks he's sucked down since the early 90's. It's time to actually allow the other side of the story to be presented. a quick look at Rose's websites and messageboard will present the details of his mercurial albeit infinitesimal career. my goodness.Willy B.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Trouble with an editor</span></h2>
<p>For over a year and a half I have been harrassed by the editor formerly known as Willmcw, who now goes by the rather dubious sobriquet of Will beback. IT is the same person. HE's been involved in numerous spats with people online- some to be fair ae noble, but for the most part he hunts down and antagonizes anyone who does not agree with him. An article about someone who appears to be his father keeps disappearing from the online wikipedia. He then puts a block on whoever created it. This is clearly a design to keep information off of wikipedia. The article doens't mention his identity on here, I happen to be familiar enough with the facts to know, but I haven't spread the information. It has become clear that if willmcw/will beback disagrees with you he exhibits a strong force- one that goes against the rules of being a mediator on wikipedia, which he is- and tries to force the individual he hasa disagreement with off of the site. What's more, he curries favor with other individuals who also bend the rules at their every whim, so an alliance of sort is established. Kate0fan was one of these, and in her particular case she was forced off of wikipedia because of the disinformation she was forcing on others and the website, once it became clear that she was an actual journalist, and was in jeopardy of losing her job. SOjambi Pinola is another, he swears he is not the subject of the article Biff Rose, yet every time Biff Rose mentions his desires as to how the wiki article should read, this sojambi character then carries those instructions out. That is a sure case of sock puppetry. More important to that case, several bits of information are downright false, and other bits are erased, even though they have satisfactory documentation by wikipedia standards. It is known that Rose has been called an Anti Semite and a Racist by magazines ranging from Offbeat, to LA Alternative Weekly, to the SF weekly- though this last one minced words and did a string of double talk sentences so as not to most fully offend Rose. On Wikipedia, when these instances are cited, they are immediately withdrawn by a certain will beback, and the poster is blocked summarily, for a week or even for indefiinite periods, or Sojambi Pinola starts a revert war, for which he has yet to serve any blockage of time. Because some other people took the matter of Rose into their own hands, and wrote some unfavorable and also untrue things about Rose and a supposed arrest for sexual misconduct with a minor, anyone who disagrees with Rose and rose sockpuppet Sojambi Pinola are then accused of creating fallacies. This is how wikipedia runs now. Untruths, and undocumented bits of info are accepted if presented to the right bully. And citeable information is refused on the basis of being suspect, although it is not so. In the instance of Biff Rose, and a host of other articles this has been left to the devices of Willmcw/Will be back, KeteOfan, and someone known as Slimvirgin. These people have formed an alliance and supported each other in every battle the other has gotten into, and proposed each other for promotion to administration roles on the site. It is this most vicious sort of Nepotistic behavior that is clouding the very outlook of wikipedia, which deems to keep its good eye shut to this behavior. I imagine that even this posting will be erased by Wilmcw/Will beback. I will then repost it, and a circle will be established until finally willmcw/will beback will then block me from posting or editing for an indefinite period of time. This is most certainly harrassment. What's more, Willmcw/will beback then searches out any edits the people he dislikes, and manhandles them, or erases them regardless of their virtue. In some few cases he has been right to do so, but with most, he has simply turned editing into a more severe form of bullying anyone with a dissenting point of view. Case in point is the Fleetwood Mac articel where some soldi edits and rewrites were undertaken to clarify points. But because the name of the editor was that of someone Willmcw/will beback had already done battle with, he then erased all of the edits, reverting the article back to an almost unreadable an nonsnsical state. This has happened at a myriad of articles. It is a tragedy.<a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvy_Hezza_90cd.html" title="User:Ivy Hezza">Ivy Hezza</a> 17:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
