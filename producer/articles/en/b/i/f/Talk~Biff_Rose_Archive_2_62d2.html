<dd>Here are the two versions:
<ul>
<li><i>Rose's newer recordings are more controversial. His later songs make occasional use of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotype.html" title="Ethnic stereotype">ethnic stereotypes</a> and contain <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitic.html" title="Anti-semitic">anti-semitic</a> language in their lyrics.</i></li>

<dd>Apologies, Marcuse and everyone. I was fed up with Mr. Multiname's lack of working with the rest of us. The main reason the sentence is there, in any form, is because of this character's insistence on it, which I don't put much stock in at this point due to his generally inappropriate behavior. Obviously, my solution was not very effective, either. I flew off the handle, and I am sorry.</dd>

<dd>The proposed version I had the least problem with was yours, Marcuse, as posted earlier on the board:</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Rose's later work differs from his early recordings. There is strong language in his lyrics, and he makes controversial use of racial stereotypes.</i></dd>
</dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What do people make of this one? I don't think it was ever actually posted. It feels like a decent compromise for now. Would you like to do the honors, Marcuse?- <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 23:43, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't agree with that at all. That sentence waters down the sentiment completely. I've rewritten it, and posted my version, which explains the matter in one sentence.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.115.53.html" title="User:216.175.115.53">216.175.115.53</a> 20:35, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not about sentiment. It's not how you feel about Rose's lyrics, it's what's in them. Please give one, concrete example where he uses something which most people will agree is anti-semitic language in his song <i>lyrics</i>. One example. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 22:20, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is right it isn't about sentmiment, so where rose's language is inappropriate I have pointed it out. Websites are where it is anti semetic. Steve Espinola aka Sojombi Pinola is the one who has attached sentiment and POV to his postings about rose, becoming completely unable to separate a freindship with the man from a NPOV account of the man and his work<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.115.53.html" title="User:216.175.115.53">216.175.115.53</a> 17:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Edit Wars again</p>
<p>I see that this article is the subject of content disputes. I see that there have been too many reverts that use as an edit summary that they are reverting vandalism. Removal of content that is the subject of a dispute as to whether it is correct or encyclopedic is not vandalism. Claims of vandalism, when there is a real content dispute, are personal attacks.</p>
<p>Can we please try to summarize what the content issues are?</p>
<p>I see one content issue, which is that the statement that recent Biff Rose songs have racist content is a POV. A statmenet that a writer has claimed that they have racist content is NPOV. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 11:53, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, I think that is the real issue. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.126.203.html" title="User:216.175.126.203">User:216.175.126.203</a> is making an assessment in the new version that Biff's web writings are anti-semitic. Biff claims, on the other hand, that he is "pro-Jewish and anti-Zionist." By the rules of Wikipedia, you are supposed to find outside criticism if you are going to make such claims of anti-semitism. So, in other words, a correct sentence would be more like...."<i>Critics have accused Biff of making Anti-semitic comments on his website. He contends that he is pro-Jewish and anti-Zionist."</i> That would be NPOV. Problem is, you have not yet found outside criticism making that claim. Find that, and that sentence as I wrote it would be factual and NPOV. -<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 06:32, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know what Steve, if I wrote that I'd tell you. I'm not Walter, and I'm not a non new orleanian. I live in post Katrina New orleans, and I'm writing what is certainly true about Biff. You can say that I wrote all the htings on the web you want to, but that doesn't stop the fact that you are imbecilic in pointing out things I did not write. You question my stylistic merit, I've been writing for Offbeat for years, my ex wife writes for it too. I also write for a small music magazine called Spin. Jesus, you really area fruit. A total nut. Phone calls... how in the world do you know who called you? Phone calls, supposedly similar articles that when read prove not to resemble a damned thing I've written on here. You want my name so bad?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Throw the book at me</span></h2>
<p>It is apparent that I'm bein g singled out by a corrupt administrator, and a sock puppet of rose. Look at <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a>'s page and see how the official wikipedians ruled against him. also note on Biff Rose's own website the dialogue established between <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">User:Sojambi Pinola</a> and Rose himself. The POV that has been developed in the article is relentless and I've edited it out. There is no need for all the links that double and triple prove rose was on carson, so I have taken them down. I noted that there are more links from Rose's entry than for Jimi Hendrix's entry, and this is absolutely ridiculous. It is time to realize that rose is a minor artist of very little note who only found his way on here because someone chose to write negative POV about him that proved to be untrue. If that first negative article was not written, Rose would not be on Wikipedia. In light of the recent mishaps in the editorial process in general, and those of <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a> in particular, it is time for Willmcw to recuse himself from this entry. And Sojambi pinola should no longer edit the entry as he is basically the voice of rose, which violates the wikipedia rules against autobiography- and as Sojambi Pinola is working in conjunction with Biff rose, as seen on the biffrose.com messageboard then he should no longer be allowed to edit here in any way.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a></p>

The claims under username <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> are serious enough, as well.</dd>

<dd>It would be NORMAL for any living artist to be somewhat concerned that such libel about him is being posted at Wikipedia mirror sites all over the web. Hence, I don't think it's strange that Rose has written about it on his message board. Rose has had no direct input on the actual content of anything I have written. He did, however, express reasonable positivity AFTER a specific item was re-worded in a less libelous matter. I don't think that's so ominous. This is real writing about a real person in the real world, and these writings have real consequences. Wikipedia isn't a playpen; people actually read this. If similar claims were printed about a living artist in a newspaper, it would be reasonable for the artist to demand a retraction from the paper....and get it.</dd>

<dd>Wow, I can't believe this is still going on. Jonah, you are entirely mistaken about whether Sojambi can edit given connections to Biff. Biff Rose <i>himself</i> would be welcome to edit this article. If you go over to the arbitration page WP:RFAr, you will see that two cases were recently settled in favor of editors working on pages about themselves ... and the arbcom even took into account how unusually stressful it must have been for those editors. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 19:05, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Moved from above Derex's post to a chronological location:</i></p>
<p>I agree real writing, not lame kiss me's from some fan boy bent on on telling one side of his hero's story? Real like taking interest in Biff's "controversial" use of words and phrases such as "stupid nigguh" and "Dirty kike", both of which you know appeared on his website messageboard, as well as the frequent and derogatory usage of the word "nigger" in his later lyrics. You're absolutely right. He should be accountable for the thingss he wrote, and not things about him that aren't true. Those things are true, and he can't use you to avoid the truth that he's written and and recorded. The more rose's sycophants try to pigeonhole him into "Controversial artist" categories the more they deny the true implications of the racist and anti semitic actualities of Rose's work. If you can call it work. I call it hate fueled bile. But as an editor on here I avoid landing my opinion of his worth on the artist, and just include the sentence that seems to cause so much consternation with the one person here, that one person being sojambi pinola. Rose is using anti-semitic language in a negative fashion, as well as racist terminology. This is not merely 'Strong Language' this is beyond that. Well beyond that. And real people should read real writing that addresses rea linstances of racism and anti semiticism. Really.</p>
<p>As for your baseless 'Circumstantial Evidence' where is it? When? How? Are you sure you have the right person here? From looking at your own posts, you've dug up a whole website dedicated to not liking Biff Rose. maybe one of the members over there is to blame for these wrongs you claim have been written about your dear kind hearted Biff rose. for that matter why? Because far as I see it, Rose's own words enact the phrase give em enough rope pretty damn well... or if you're a bit thick- he incriminates himself so much no one needs to make up stories about him. You accuse me, yet you show no proof, and that is very fascist and republican of you. For a fan of an ex hippie, you certainly seem more at home firing off loose conjecture that you can't back up. You're a disgrace to wikipedia when you behave as such, and so I implore you to stop these false allegations. I write one simple sentence about Rose- he's written racist and anti semitic lyrics and in the screeds he posts on his website message board. Don't pin your own misanthropic take on the world on me. AS far as Rose being able to demand a retraction, he wouldn't get one, the words nigger and kike appear in derogatory nature throughout his website and his later lyrics. It's very clear. Retractions come when the point the article made was untrue, and the point the article about Rose makes is that he writes racist and anti-semitic lyrics and websites. That is true. The real deal, so to speak. Thanks for reading Stevie. Now, my little manchurian candidate, work your mojo.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.114.219.html" title="User:216.175.114.219">216.175.114.219</a> 07:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accuse "you" yet I "show no proof"? Please explain: Which "you" are we talking about here? Gently stated, perhaps you would help your case by logging in and signing a name to your writings (which is what I do on the rare occasions that I post something accidently as an anon IP). "Someone" around here <i>seems</i> to be creating multiple identities to get their agenda across. (The evidence of <i>that</i> appears obvious to at least five administrators who have gotten involved.) Is that "someone" "you"? Or a different writer around here? The situation invites exactly the sort of guesswork that I took part in, above. If it ain't <i>you,</i> then I am talking about a different writer or writers, and you can move on and let it pass. I did not name names (though there aren't even names to name today). You will notice that I said "make your own conclusions." I make no claim that I am correct. Hey, maybe you are right and Rose has somehow inspired <i>several</i> groups of people to behave in exactly the same way, using the same internet tactics, against him.</dd>

<dd>Moving on to more important matters: If you can find <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> outside criticism, with citations, stating <i>others</i> finding his writings controversial, there is a place for that in the article. But your sentence <i>as it stands</i> is POV. On this discussion page you talk about "frequent and derogatory usage of the word 'nigger' in his later lyrics," but you have still not provided a single recorded lyric to begin to back that up. ("Frequent" implies usage in several songs, as well.) I'm sure you have listened to Rose's CDs, but I wonder which ones they are. It would improve the quality of our discussion if you could be more specific about recorded lyrics.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Rose is very specific and careful, in some of his writings, to distinguish between "nigger" and "niggah"/"nigguh". My understanding of his take on it: the first word is the word of the outsider/oppressor. The second word, either spelling, is the version reclaimed by the wearer of the word....the word AS USED BY African Americans in rap songs to address themselves and each other....in other words, the word AS USED by people who self-identify as black....Which Rose sometimes does. He has a lyric in a song called "Chicago" that goes "thank God I'm Black inside." His take on Judaism is similarly complex. When Jesus went into a temple and kicked things around, was he anti-semitic? No, he was a Jew shaking up the Jews. Biff's talk of "kicking asses" is <i>possibly</i> to be taken in this light, as there is an ongoing thread in Rose's work exploring walking Jesus' walk. Do <i>I</i> agree with it? Do <i>you</i> disagree with it? Not important issues <i>here</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether you agree with Rose's take on it is not the point. That would be <i>your</i> criticism and interpretation of it. His take on these things is <i>complex</i> and <i>unusual</i> at the very least, and your sentence does not begin to reflect that complexity. It is a POV and an <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original</a> criticism, which you are stating as a fact. That does not follow the rules of Wikipedia. The sentence you have repeatedly inserted is not "one simple sentence," contrary to your above statement. It's loaded, and it is a serious charge.</dd>

<p>Look you can use the apologiust theory all you wish, and quote and cite references all you want... the cold hard facts of the matter are that Rose uses language that is racist, and no matter how you spell nigger/nigguh/niggah when a white person calls a black person nigger, szadly it leaves a lasting impression. Ask Rose if he would sing those songs in the desire projects... I think not,. you might come up with one or two black people that think he's harmless but the vast majority, like oprah, would ask that he refrain from using the word, let alone use it in a derogatory sense as he does on numerous poists and in his lyrics. Yo ucan write all the long winded chimes that you want, iuf you carefully read my post, it does not personally attakc you, it simply urges you from using behavior that would imply idiocy, I urge you to continue your efforts, but to try to make them more enlightened, as you say your leftist, I would like to see you try to understand this point of view.

Your biggest asset here, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a> has been severely upbraided and almost suspended by the wiki admins, so stuff the whole superiority spiel.

<dd>Marcuse, the links don't work too well in the most recent version, and are less specific than before in your earlier revisions of today. I still contend that the reference to Anti-Semitism is POV. I don't consider Jonah's actions bickering. Whoever posted under that IP, directly above, is harrassing me with their references to my other edits. I don't think "appeasing" this person is really the way to go.

<li>OK, the refs should work now. As far as the antisemitism, Jewmanity.com speaks for itself, it is obviously offensive to some, and it obviously has alientated fans. That to me seems accurate.

It's not obvious to me that Jewmanity.com has alienated "fans," though it has alienated you. But you are co-writing the article. Perhaps there is a way to work that in, but it's gotta be NPOV. I was checking out the NPOV page, or one of the related pages that I included links to not too far up above, and it offered some possible ways out of our quagmire.

<dd>I think sojombi's work is disengenuous, i do think marcuse's edits are workign to a finer point, and anyone who thinks that the hwole of jewmanity wouldn't be offensive to someone is definitely a bit skewed. But I'm gonna try and be nice, because I respect the work that's being done here. Now, as for the recordings I think it would be important if <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojombi_Pinola_ed48.html" title="User:Sojombi Pinola">User:Sojombi Pinola</a> could wheedle down the list to 'important' records and not non album singles that are wholly lost. whittle it down to his major works, and not list ones that even Rose is on record as disavowing...<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.0.13.html" title="User:216.244.0.13">216.244.0.13</a> 00:38, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, it is important to not that most people regard the word "nigger" in whatever spelling or pronunciation when used by whites to describe blacks to be an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slur</a> rather than merely racial stereotypes. So I will want to make the article read about Rose's usage of the ethnic slur rather than stereotyping.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.0.13.html" title="User:216.244.0.13">216.244.0.13</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Jonah and Steve- First off, nobody's edits here are <i>disingenuous</i>, unless of course you are not editing in good faith. Which nobody here is, right? Second, culling the list of recordings is not necessary, why not have a complete article? Third, Rose's use of "nigguh" is ironic, much like the word "nigger" is used in the movie <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazing_Saddles_d431.html" title="Blazing Saddles">Blazing Saddles</a>, and I don't think anyone would call Mel Brooks a racist. As far as Jewmanity.com goes, I really do think it is somewhat offensive to Jews, not just "anti-zionist" as Rose claims, but I guess that's my opinion. As I said before, I don't really care much either way. If you want to reword it give it a shot. If you read the articles in the SF bay guardian, the author does agree that his material may be somewhat alienating, which is why I included the reference. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 00:58, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do think the edits are disingenuous, as Sojombi erases anything he did not write, which is extraordinarily calculating... as well as his uninformed view of Rose's usage of racist terminology being hurtful to others- both of those make his work here disingenuous. As far as "culling" the list, the very addition of self released and undocumented recordings is unwarranted. Are all bootlegs included for The Grateful Dead, no, but ones that are mindful of their excellence are. The inclusion of the recording in one take is superfluous, and does not make for a better article. It would be better suited for a mike nesmith piece. What is happening here isn't merely an argument over anti semiticism is that this article has been taken over by Sojombi Pinola who has a direct relation to Rose, and appears to be subverting the wiki rule of self editing by using the rose message board and other means of direct communication to vent rose's ovwn bias on into the article.

<p>Listen for the word nigger on his recordings, it's their, you have them, try and explain it away all you want. I'm not the only one, and it's been recoutned by revieweres. Look at his websites, and the wordplay of the title of one of his last recordings which includes racist wordplay. It's apparent that your edits have been "Fascist" of nature because you only let edits survive if they've been written by you. That's very fascistic. You can be as smarmy as you like, but you attempt to author something solely when the nature of wikipedia is to share authorship. not to mention your inability to be honest and deal with your relationship with biff and working as his mouthpiece. I am now going to put the previous message back into record here for rebuttal to your response which skips over the message... I do think the edits are disingenuous, as Sojombi erases anything he did not write, which is extraordinarily calculating... as well as his uninformed view of Rose's usage of racist terminology being hurtful to others- both of those make his work here disingenuous. As far as "culling" the list, the very addition of self released and undocumented recordings is unwarranted. Are all bootlegs included for The Grateful Dead, no, but ones that are mindful of their excellence are. The inclusion of the recording in one take is superfluous, and does not make for a better article. It would be better suited for a mike nesmith piece. What is happening here isn't merely an argument over anti semiticism is that this article has been taken over by Sojombi Pinola who has a direct relation to Rose, and appears to be subverting the wiki rule of self editing by using the rose message board and other means of direct communication to vent rose's ovwn bias on into the article. I find it strange that this isn't addressed and more severely dealt with. Why must we be forced Sojombi's edits? They always negate the one thing that most other editors, including <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">User:Willmcw</a> and yourself, grudgingly agree, that Rose is possesing a background of using lyrics and wording on his websites that is Anti Semitic and Racist.

<li>Jonah, Self-released albums are a legit form of body of work. So, yes we must list them. Stop deleting material. Now, Sojambi, as far as the article in the SFBG, you are correct there is no mention of the word alienating. So, fine leave your edit as is. Now, as I asked before, please explain why you think Jewmanity.com is not easily interpreted as antisemitic? I pose this question, would you sit down with your Jewish grandmother and browse Jewmanity.com? Please answer this honestly. Most likely you would say no. Why? Because she might get offended, as would a bunch of other people. So why is it wrong to say his websites are antisemitic? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 02:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't know what my Jewish grandmother would have made of Mel Brooks' <i>The Producers</i>, or <i>Hogan's Heroes,</i> let alone Jewmanity.com.

<li>To say it is not anti-semitic because he is not against semites is ridiculous. The term "anti-semitism" in its current usage in the US refers to animosity towards Jews. There is nothing in Jewmanity.com that states he is against the state of Israel or Zionism but really is in favor of Jews. What I see in the site is a bunch of pages using Hebrew scripture and fake pictures of Hitler in New Orleans. The subtext reads along very familiar lines of Jews wanting to take over humanity and such. In much of his postings he uses the same subtext. No mater what you say, the subtext is there. In 1964 Supreme Court Justiice Potter Stewart tried to explain "hard-core" pornography, or what is obscene, by saying, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced . . . [b]ut I know it when I see it . . . ". As with antisemitism one does not need to say "I dislike Jews" to make a statement anti-semitic. And to say this is not adding a specific POV. I really want to see the irony in Jewmanity.com, but no matter how I see it I always come to the same conclusion, even when I don't take it at face value. I re-worded the statement to say that some material is potentially anti-semitic, to leave it open. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 16:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I find Judge Stewart's 41-year old ruling to be problematic, and if I recall, the ACLU does, too. I personally find our currently elected officials' voting records and policies --and the last few State of the Union addresses-- to be far more obscene and pornographic than some movie of a group of consenting adults making the beast with five backs or whatever. Which is to say that what is offensive is highly subjective.</dd>
<dd>Let's actually look at Jewmanity.com and see if there is any reference to "Jews wanting to take over humanity and such."</dd>
<dd>Here's the "taking over" that I see:</dd>
<dd>"Hitler thinks about taking over the jukebox (AC/DC)"</dd>
<dd>"Hitler decides to take over Lucky's bar."</dd>
<dd>"Biff explains to Hitler who plays drums that he can't be taking over country after country. Only country band after country band."</dd>
<dd>"Hitler takes over Romano cheese."</dd>
<dd>There is no reference to Jews taking over anything. Not even implied. Hitler is portrayed as the personification of evil, yet is shown to be fallible, petty ("Hitler hits on chicks"), perhaps pitiable, and is mocked. The edgiest moment, "Hitler designs the new Reichtag Synagogue", is still no more tasteless than the moment in <i>The Producers</i> when Jews walk out of "Springtime for Hitler" while Zero Mostel cackles. It is NOT straightforward, and it is not obvious NPOV. More later. --<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 18:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you want we can email the guy and have him confirm that he is the source of the post. Would that do? As far as the review found by Jonah, I also think it is a valid online magazine.

<dd>Toland's review doesn't mention anything about racism, etc. Instead he says that the reviewed album will seem to some like the "height of wit" while it will "irritate the fuck out of others". I'd hardly call that "lambasting".

<dd>That said, Jonah, can you explain your tendency towards making sure we know which releases are "small"? Water Records has pretty significant distribution, actually. The comp was reviewed in Entertainment Weekly and is being carried in Collector's Choice, a high-profile reissue catalogue. Your organization of the discography seems designed to diminish the artist's work; and that, in turn, makes it appear that you have an axe to grind. Why do you hate Mr. Rose so?</dd>

<dd>I tell you what. If you stop breaking the 3RR wiki standard maybe you wouldn't incur such radical edits. As it stands, the view will be a strong opinion of a respected music reviewer. It is difficult to take you seriously when you cna't seem to offer others the same appreciation. If you would simply allow another view in this article, other than your own, there would be none of this problem. I don't hate Biff Rose. on the contrary i enjoy some of his early material, though it is obviously lifted from other styles. What irritates me and offends me so dramtically is your almost fascist- almost Isaid, so don't take it personally as an attack because it isn't one- stance that only your wording of something can be the correct one. I do suggest you grow a pair. that's a joke, not an attack. But really, the dang it will line is a little much for a discussion, it's like your a child who has been slapped on the wrists, or didn't get his way. This is a shared project sojombi, not your own personal playground. i've stopped trying to reword other sentences without a group approval. What you want to change about small is typical, there is no way that water or collector's choice could be called large record labels, or even large indie's especially in today's market where many 'independent' labels ship hundred of thousands of records each month. the labels that biff is associated with, from the beginning to the later era of his career are small indies. That is in no way a slight against the man. many excellent bands have come from small independent labels, one of which, a little band from aberdeen washington called nirvana, changed the course of music forever, and opened the door for larger independent record companies. so, to regroup, grow apair, and laugh a little. biff isn't as wonderful as you might think. but he's certianly not all bad. it's the violence of his anger that is of note, how he changed from hippie oriented singer songwriter, to angry anti semitic and racist lyricist that should be noted in the article. It's of note. Please try and refrain from abusing the 3RR rule as well.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 07:44, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">pair</span></h2>
<p>one more thing. I haven't got an axe to grind, as you say, with rose. nor have I implied anything by correctly categorizing his releases. many of his works are out of print, and many of them are self released, and therefore hard to get. it is important to note that, as fans and intereste dpeople alike should know about what is easiest to attain. You can't punch in the urban folk record on amazon. but you can get the water reissues. as for being a high profile label, Colelctors choice is hardly high profile. A high profile label today, sad to say, is one of the majors. not even hep indies like matador and merge and alternative tentacles can claim high profile. not when the majors, and the large independents are dealing with millions of records a year. millions, my friend, millions. By trying to call me an enemy of rose you to oare attempting to influence the opinoon of others. But i must say this I do not hate Rose's work. I hate the incessant attempts at trying to gloss over a very real part of his recorded work, his hatred of jews and blacks, and other minority groups, including women and hispanics. if you would like the article to include only his earlier work, where these themes did not pop up, I would be willing to only allude to his websites, which should be noted because fans might be shocked when they enter into these realms. look around the world wide web, there are hundred of reviews about rose's later works, in blogs, which shouldn't be used as source for the article, but still adrotily and matter of factly call rose out on his hunristic racism and genreally angry sense in his later works. This is not merely my opinon, but that of many others, on line, which tends to lead most people to believe that it is then fact. look past your own worship of rose, oyu'll actually be able to tell that while he may have once been technically proficient at the piano, his style was a mishmash of others who were not only technically proficient but also creatively inspired. that said, his ditties, because that is what they are, have been interesting at points, and even fun. He owes very much to those who came before him, more so than the likes of say, albert ayler, or hendrix ,both artists who acknowledged an allegiance to those who came before them, but who were also able to blwo the roof of those works, and stamp their own creative visions with a fierce individuality that to this day makes their music vibrant and original. Rose's work tends to allude to those who lent their influience to him, rather than extend beyond that influence, which creates a sort of creative vacuum. Yo ucan grab from many different places, and stitch together those ideas in order to make something new, but where others may take that to the next level, such as in the case of miles Davis whose originality was imbued bythe influence of previous players such as Dizzy Gillespie and Fats navarro as well as the great clifford brown, and who then ascended those influencesz, and Rose who uses the style of barrelhouse and cole porter and joseph newman, and simply creates a pastiche, rather than a style based upon. Take Professor longhair, certainly derivative of other new orleanian musicinas, Jelly roll and even king oliver's band, and probably some of that great early louis armstrong after his stint with oliver, not to mention the brass band marching clubs. but what he did with those influences was wholly different, establishing much of the foundation for rhythm and blues in his dandy piano stylings. rose on the other hand simply exists as a fringe artist, who though interesting to a degree, has never really made something as transcendent as the aforementioned artists. So there you go. It's not that Rose is untalented in my eyes, it's that his clearly angry and in some sourced cases hateful lyrics, and anti semitic/racist websites are an afront. By denying the existence of these issues is abominable and incredibly one sided. You are not the only judge of biff rose's music. other's have written concise opinions on the matter, but where opinion is the heart and soul of creative output, it isn't in the case of racism and anti-semiticism. ignoring that aspect of Rose's career is very dangerous. That is why the word fascist gets thrown aorund on here, because each time you remove other people's viewpoints on the matter you begin to construct a very narrow minded entry on your friend Biff. It seems that your close relation to the man has marked your ability to be open minded in regards to the article about him.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a></p>

<dd>I now suddenly see that this is very important work that you are doing, Jonah. Thank you for explaining it to us and saving us from this affront of a grave angry hunristic dangerous pastiche. Also, I almost bought something that was out of print, <i>and</i> self-released, <i>and</i> --while interesting-- non-transcendent in the objective realm in which art exists; you saved me from this wasteful error.

Oh you're so cute. i'm glad you like to denigrate other music forms with insipid and droll comments like "saving us form this affront.." and "you saved me from this wasteful error, I shall buy a brass band marching club cd instead." oh very cute. and good luck. maybe your musical taste will be better for that purchase. may i recommend the hot 8? they are surprisingly interesting and devoid of angry hate fueled screechings. also, the phrase "grow a pair" has been featured in numerous sketches on the recent episodes of a show called <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a> of which you might have heard. it has also appeared in an episode of <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_David_6ce8.html" title="Larry David">Larry David</a>'s show, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm_95fa.html" title="Curb Your Enthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, which you may or may not have heard. Regardless, it is apparent that many millions of people have heard, and then used the phrase grow a pair. I'm sure it has even been used in talk pages and discussion forums throughout this fine site, referring to people, much like you, who are unable to get past their own emotional baggage and get a tad bit cranky and down right wonky at times. fear not, I might mine as merely a joke, as in Damnit Sojombi, why don't you grow a pair<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 20:26, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am enjoying the brass band marching club CD you encouraged me to explore. Thank you. Back to the subject at hand. "Though lauded by pundits, Rose's negative reviews go back as far as 1972..." etc etc. You could probably say that about any artist. They will have positive and negative reviews. That strikes me as a rather skewed way of framing things, though. You are defining him primarily by his negative reviews. Do you really think that's an accurate, balanced evaluation? Who are these "pundits"? You will notice that in my last version, which Marcuse reverted to, I did my best to include both the negative and the positive. I don't think it was one-sided at all.</dd>

I will be happy to recuse myself as well if he agrees to do the same. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 01:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That could be construed as a threat will, which in wiki land can also be determined as un wiki like and you could be brought up to the admins much like you were before you surreptitiously changed your name. AS for legal threats, I don't believe any were made, i merely pointed out that with the new law, Jonah Ayers could theoretically bring you into a court on charges of that most ludircous law, which states that anyone found to be annoying can be sued. That's that, you can try and manipulate the situation in any fahsion, and true to your nature, you have used your opportunity to be almost agonizingly patronizing, irritatingly smug, and mindbogglingly suspect in your biased approach at using wikipedia. I applaud you for your complete lack of self control and inability to be anything more than annoying- uh oh, I'm going to be taken to court for annoyingly calling someone else annoying. ouch. Now, let's talk about the sierra club, what exactly is your relation to them?<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.7.12.html" title="User:216.244.7.12">216.244.7.12</a> 05:42, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
