Can anyone explain why the page is being edited so intensely? One of the pillars of the project is our obligation to edit from a neutral point of view. Rose is a real person who did a number of notable things, which is why we have this article. Let's just try to to the best job we can in writing a concise, comprehensive summary of the available sources in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> manner. There is room for good, bad, and indifferent material so long as it is properly sourced and presented. Whatever we do, let's please use this talk page to discuss controversial edits. Wikipedia works on consensus. Thanks, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 06:35, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently some of Rose's recent albums have been self-released. That doesn't mean he didn't record and release them. They are still a part of the record of his life. I've added "self release" to the last three, and we can annotate them further if necessary. But deleting them is uncalled for. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 19:43, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p>I agree with Willmcw! Hooray. There is a significant precedent of important artistic works being "self-released"....witness much of the work of Sun Ra in the 50's-70's, and many albums in the D.I.Y. punk movement starting in the 70's.</p>
<p>Small note: "Buddha" is not a record label, but "Buddah" was, in the late 1960's, early 1970's. They had a number of hits singles and LPs.</p>
<p>As for the question "Can anyone explain why the page is being edited so intensely?" A great many entries, under several different names and IP addresses, are the work of an obsessive fan/anti-fan/stalker of Biff Rose who has been doing similar work elsewhere on the web (myspace.com, Biff Rose's message board, private emails, etc.) using the same or similar IPs to the ones here. The ongoing claims of NAMBLA and a crime in Florida (you will notice that it was upgraded from molestation to a "disappearance" in later drafts) are libelous, highly destructive, and a sham; that is why they keep getting removed. This same vandal (who, ironically, created the initial entry for the sake of making the Florida claim appear "respectable") uses slanted/back-handed language such as "journeyman," " "flash in the pan" and "sank from view," and removes significant achievements out of spite. The article is still not all that well-written in a couple places. Some of the original, somewhat misleading sentences remain, as my early edits were basically a quick band-aid to deal with the libel.</p>
<p>I'm appreciating and enjoying that this has taken on a life of its own. Wikipedia is cool!</p>
<p>I am not Biff, but I would not mind giving out my real name, email address, and, privately, even my work phone number if it will put some of these issues to rest. I will not do so yet because I do not know the etiquette of Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>I think its time youstopped trying to rearrange my words. Teh information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. Yo uare not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you ahve become like a fascist.

<dd>Why do you delete the number of "Carson" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

actually, I, too, am Esteban 'Steve' Espinola. Which is why I ended up using that as the name I edit under. Look under my name, I've done edits on numerous articles this week, since I joined up. Mmmmmbo had me over to the Biff Rose site, as I have written some music criticism. I went over to his website, and was surprised to find some lyrics that could only be construed as racist. I ordered a disk, from old, and got one from new, and it is quite clear the later years has been a hateful time for Rose. It's important not to let your own opinions ride through the entries, so I have added words such as detractors and critics, though Willmcw keeps adding niceties that make it seem as as if the whole of Rose's ouvre was happy go lucky. It is not, and so should be noted, this strange turn toward angry old man, with particular venom toward minorities. I have also noticed that this 'other' Steve Espinola has his own website linked to Biff Rose's and therefore is probably what you call on here, a sockpuppet. the connection between the 'other' Espinosa and Willmcw is not as clear, though they seem to communicate with some regularity. I hope all who read this will check out Rose's music, old and new and his mulittude of websites, because the answers are inside his words and web presence. In regards to email, I can email you form my earthlink account. It will identify me as Esteban 'Steve' Espinola. Ok. thanks<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_espinola_f2ae.html" title="User:Steve espinola">Steve espinola</a></p>

<dd>I could have sworn I responded to this here....apparently I only did elsewhere. I object to the version of the page that has been "frozen." It is a distortion, it reduces the accurate acheivements of Biff that have appeared in several earlier versions, and it is the product of a guy who has been posting to the page under at least 13 usernames. My name is actually Steve Espinola, and I am a biographer of Biff's. I can prove it by more than just a name attached to an email address, as I have already done for one Wiki editor. That there are two apparent "Steve Espinola's" here is no accident. This other fellow took on that username because he objected to my removal of his false, libelous statements: among them, claiming Biff was wanted in Florida on serious felony charges. Biff lives in New Orleans at a stable address, and would be easy to find if the police wanted him. The statements were false. I comment below on the claims of racism and anti-semitism; it's not a simple issue, but it's certainly not dealt with well in the current version.<br />

<p>Hello, I was asked to take a look at this page by Steve Espinola. I've protected the <a href="../../../b/i/f/Biff_Rose_8111.html" title="Biff Rose">Biff Rose</a> page until the dispute can be settled. I don't know who is right/wrong, but remember to keep in mind <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">the non-point of view</a> policy. If he is generally known as an anti-semitic, then that could be mentioned. Also, I've removed the picture because it seems doctored/fake- Hitler obviously wasn't around in 2004. Finally, keep in mind <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>- this rule applies to everyone. Thus, please try and solve out this dispute. Once you do, you can contact me or another <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EAdmin_66ad.html" title="WP:Admin">admin</a>, and we can unprotect it.

<dd>Thanks for checking on that. Yes, A new user adding to the article a photo that was uploaded three minutes earler by "another" user is too much to believe. FYI, the photo is really on one of the Biff Rose websites and I believe the mustache and writing were added by Rose. While the intent of adding the photo to the article seems to be to make Rose look bad, I don't think that this particular "contribution" is true vandalism. However there are plenty of instances of vandalism by other newly-created users. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:54, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, HSo xMule, for researching this guy. The picture was part of a photo essay created by Biff, and is an example of some of his edgier material. Hitler shows up in some of his songs as the personification of pure evil. One of his songs starts "Sometimes I feel like the mother of Hitler," and the second verse starts "Sometimes I feel like the mother of Jesus." The point being that we all have a light and dark side to us, and the potential to do great harm and great good. Much as Hitler is lampooned in Mel Brooks' "The Producers", this photo essay shows Hitler reduced to being a drunk in a bar, practicing drums, trying to manage a country band and "taking over Romano Cheese." The first page of the essay reads "Now that Hitler is once again on the loose, sweeping a rein of terror through the streets of New Orleans, it is up to the rest of us to save the world from total destruction." Even when initially disturbing, Biff's stuff like this can also be pretty funny. And some of it just stays edgy. I'm Jewish, as are many of Rose's friends, and I thought this particular essay was funny.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Taking the picture out of that context was, as far as I'm concerned, part of the mystery-user's attempt to paint a distorted, simplified, negative portrayal of Biff. Now how do we get this page unfrozen and fixed up?

<p>I think some agreement needs to be made. Just went over and tried to fix some of the writing at the new Biff Willmcw put up. Horrible style really. Haven't even addressed the other issues. Why? Because no one seems to want to admit that Sojambi Pinola is a mouthpiece for Rose. Why would he say anything negative about Rose. I think Rose hada really interesting early career. I do. Molly is pretty cool, and so is the whole carson thing. What I don't understand is that according to Wikipedia procedures, are we allowing someone to be so blatantly fawning over an entry about his close friend. IT seems to be very one sided. And to the least , having seen Rose's websites, the lyrical postings too-- maybe including how others don't always see his genius in regards to the racist statements could be included. I don't know many people who are african american who stand for a white fellow singing about niggers. That's just too loaded nowadays. Even in the form of theater, this is so controversial, it has the possibilkity of getting someoen grievously injured, in New Orleans, in New York, where Steve Espinola writes from. Now Espinola says he's a jew, and that hopefulyl means that he has read some of Rose's decidedly anti Jew screeds, and learned how Rose did not mean them. Explain. IT's time to stop trying to sugar coat his life.

<dd>Also, regarding the Korean War, if Rose was born in 1937, and the war ended in 1953, then it appears that he would have been on 16.

<dd>I think I explain it pretty thoroughly on <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_espinola_f2ae.html" title="User:Steve espinola">user:Steve espinola</a>'s discussion page. It's a guy who has had a vendetta against Biff for a long time for some reason. He is operating under that username because I (birth name SE) began trying to remove the libel from the early versions of that article. As to why he is vandalizing other articles, I really don't know, unless he is just trying to appear like a deep Wikipedia contributor. I suppose it could be to make me look bad?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another way to answer this is that Biff's art illicits strong reactions, out of proportion to his current level of mass-media fame. Not many people know his stuff (compared to commerical "top 40" "artists") but those that connect with it, positively or negatively, _really_ connect with it. He's a pretty radical and unusual artist, and has managed to keep a following in spite of a lack of corporate backing. Two CD compilations of his stuff will be coming out on reissue labels this year, so you may be hearing more about him soon.<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 01:39, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, let's all work together in a civil manner. There has been some talk about a reluctance on my part to add material that is negative about Rose. As long as we can properly source criticism and present it in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> manner then I have no objection to any criticism of Rose. The trouble, I would imagine, is that there hasn't been much written about Rose in the last while. But if we can find a reviewer who says the songs are off-color and the singer is off-key then that's appropriate to mention.

<dd>"There's only two ways to handle women, and no one knows either of them."--this is printed on a Biff Rose album cover but Rose attributes it to someone else. On the other hand, "McDonald's Hamburgers" is an actual line of Biff's that gets quoted a bunch. Why was this removed?</dd>

<dd>The current comments about Biff's later work remain simplistic and reductive. A slightly earlier version (not by me, by the way) hit the mark a bit better. I feel J.A. should really find some references to back up his claims of these criticisms. I'm not opposed to the subject being dealt with, but we are reducing hours of varied recorded material to one controversial component of it. Still, this version is far less objectionable than most earlier drafts. If we can agree to considerate tinkering, I'm up for unfreezing it. I'd have to wait 'til I get to a better connection (in a week or so) to show the changes the way I would recommend them. <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 06:00, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Considerate tinkering" is what Wikipedia is all about. Regarding Rose's later work, we need to follow the same standards as with any article. We cannot make up our own criticisms and any POV needs to be attributed. Which means we'd need to find some noteworthy critic who has made a criticism (using the term broadly - a critic can say nice things too). Why don't you give a holler when you're ready to start working and we'll see abuot lifting the protection. Of course anyone can tinker with the temp page in the meantime.

<dd>considerate tinkering is cool with me, but I don't think this is going to work if every time someone mentions rose's lyrical propensity for hateful words like nigger and kike- his usage not mine- you two change it to say how you feel about him.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Edits by Jonah Ayers</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that this user attempted to remove various NPOV statements and "extraneous information", but I object to several of the edits. First, removing the name of the one hit song "Molly" is not removing extraneous information. If you look at any of other musician's entries, such as The Beatles, their hit songs are mentioned by name. I would suggest putting this back. Second, removing the fact that he appeared in "The Kraft SUmmer Music Hall" but not that he appeared in "The Mort Sahl Show" seems random, either remove both or neither. Third, removing more accurate descriptions of his piano styles takes away from the article, it's like saying that the fact that Elvis played rock'n'roll is beside the point. Fourth, removing the fact that he spent a large part of his career touring in a bus named "bird" is equivalent to removing the fact that BB King's guitar is named Lucille. Fifth, why are the self-released albums removed?</p>
<p>It seems like this user has removed useful information from the article for no good reason, at random and on a whim. If he has some justified reason for doing this please mention it here before removing other people's edits. Again, I have no particular agenda regarding Biff Rose, but I don't like people using Wikipedia to air their own personal vendettas, or whatever they are. I am not a sockpuppet of Willmcw, Sojambi Pinola, Steve Espinola, Biff Rose or anyone else related to this article, so don't even go there. I suggest reverting the above mentioned edits to improve the quality of the article, and will do so unless anyone has a logical objection. Any opinions? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 17:18, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I reverted that edit. If we can add notable criticms of Rose that'd be great. But I don't see any reason to remove factual info. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:15, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see wherre yo utwo are coming from. But NPOV here is not what you think. What is being written here is poorly done. Extracting the looseliimbed info about Molly and about the songs is gobbledy gook which you don't find in the middle of other posts of similar length about other artists, muscians, etc... We don't read about David Salle's habitual coffe shop lingering, or of Rodney Bingenheimer's VW bus. So why is it neccessary only in Biff Rose's article to know the name of a bus he lived in, it gives no true insight into the article. Comparing Rose's van to BB King's guitar would make sense if it were something he utilized during his career, and kept it up, as a symbol, but the true fact is that Rose had the bus for a few years and it's never been as solidly identified with his persona as Lucille was to BB King's. On to the Molly issue. The description of the song has no merit, other song writer's don't includde this sort of maudlin tripee on their entires on this site, and I feel that Rose's should not be altered accordingly. It's useless, and has no true bearing. The fix I wrote helps to expound on the grander themes of the entry, that the song was a hit, that it was covered by John Denver. Reverting back and forth is an edit war. And for some reason Willmcw thinks this is funny. But as their is no true belief in your edits to my own, I feel it is my duty to revert it back. If this keeps up I will again alert the original adminisrator who froze the account, and it will stay frozen. I believe removing the molly POV will help in getting past this part of the creation of a worthy entry. The self released records need to be put into a self released category. In this day and age, and in previous ones, self releasing means you have paid to produce your record, and are therefore not truly in any music scene, but a fringe element. I will again revert now.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 17:44, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have no problem with most of the new edits just recently added by Jonah, and they seem like a good compromise. There are a couple of things though. First, one of the records in the discography ended up with strange formatting and should be fixed. Second, I have an issue with the phrase: "His critics lay claim to the idea that Rose is not enacting any theater, rather that the bigotry is real, citing Rose's repeated use of the words Nigger, and Kike." Mainly with the fact that it claims that his critics cite his use of derogatory terms, but there is no source as to who these critics really are. Can you add a citation to a published review where critics actually complain about his bigotry? Otherwise the statement reflects your point of view and should be altered to be neutral. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 18:23, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK, I fixed some formatting issues and reorganized the last section to make it more neutral. If you feel strongly about including "Nigger and Kike" in there do so, but "derrogatory and racist" language seems to include these terms, and there is no need to repeat them since they are, in-fact, derrogatory and racist. Other than that, I think it looks pretty good, anyone alse have more to add? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 19:28, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Re the quote: "However, it is important to note that Rose's later music is different in tone than [sic--you mean "from"] his earlier work. His frequent use of derogatory and often racist language in his music, has created much controversy among Rose's audience. " Again, I believe that this sentence is POV masquarading as fact. In my critical _opinion_, there is no more true "racism" in Biff's lyrics than you will find in a typical, commercial rap record (or a Richard Pryor or Lenny Bruce routine) using the same language. I might hear it as street-talk or taking on of a voice. (e.g.: Biff's reference to the word "Nigger" on the Tonight Show was a line voiced by a ignorant character in a socially critical poem about a lynching, which was also covered by Bob Dylan on the 1962 Gaslight Tapes.) Context is everything. My _opinion_ differs from the statement in the article, which makes me suspect that this statement is also critically subjective, an opinion. And your opinion does not belong in the article any more than mine does. If you can find a citation that justifies the words "frequent" and "derogatory," there may be a point to this. But for the most part this is an original critique and goes against Wikipedia's policies. (Also, there shouldn't be a comma before "has". Subject and predicate are not separated by a comma unless it is a set of commas off-setting a clause.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jonah, your comments on this page: "In this day and age, and in previous ones, self releasing means you have paid to produce your record, and are therefore not truly in any music scene, but a fringe element." This is inaccurate. Examples: Tom Lehrer self-released his first two, classic, studio albums in the 1950's, and they sold like hotcakes, led to a famous off-Broadway revue ("Tomfoolery"), and remain in print. Ani DiFranco self-releases all her records and they have sold millions. Many acknowledged "classics" in the punk/hardcore genre were self-released, (there was a "D.I.Y"="Do It Yourself" scene) as were most of Sun Ra's most influential and discussed works. On the other hand, some albums released on major labels don't even sell in the hundreds. In this day and age of a collapsing recording industry, self-releasing is often the only place that chance-taking artworks can exist without anti-artistic corporate meddling; it is also a prerequisite for any larger-label releases, which are often simply re-releases of these works.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Along those lines, several of Biff's recordings from his self-releases are about to be re-released on a European compilation with significant distribution. Some of the listings in Biff's "self-release" category were actually financed by outside investors. Another is a re-release of a nationally-distributed live radio broadcast. They are _selling_ from Biff's website, which strongly implies that there is an audience for the work. Mojo magazine, among others, reviewed "Bone Again" favorably when it was released, and at least one song from it was played repeatedly on a nationally syndicated radio show. The "importance" of the distinction, and even the parameters of the distinction, exist primarily in one's head. I think the CD release categories should be removed/merged into one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You can't have it both ways: If he is part of a "fringe element" --one that implicitly has no impact, "scene", or audience-- how could he be creating "controversy" for his "audience," as you also claim? This seems like an internal contradiction. Your need to categorize certain works as a product of a "fringe element" suggests that you have a set agenda to diminish Mr. Rose's accomplishments by any means necessary. That alone takes your work out of the realm of straightforward imparting of information into the realm of POV, or even intentional slander. Please try to keep a cap on this impulse for the sake of this encyclopedic article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The bus "Bird" is referred to in several of Biff's recorded live monologues as an implied symbol of the hippie lifestyle. I don't have a strong feeling about keeping it in, but it is not exactly a superfluous detail. Leave it out, that's fine. I think you have a case there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statement about Biff being "banned" is not backed up by the quote by Biff submitted by Oceanchild. Biff merely says that he was controversial, got a single negative letter from a viewer of the show, and that he left town in a VW bus to tour. I quote: "Everything was always hunky dory on the Tonight Show and the idea of my being "banned" is stupid."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, Jonah, I will gently remind you of your above statement, "There needs to be less antagonism here as well." Using such terms as "gobbledy gook", and the threatening tone of your posting in general ("If this keeps up I will again alert the original adminisrator who froze the account, and it will stay frozen"), is not really in the spirit of friendly debate. Please work on your tone as we work on this. Thank you. - <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 17:40, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Fine, but I don't think that separating commercial from self releases really implies anything about fringe elements as Jonah or Sojambi suggest, so I see no harm in leaving that as such, but feel free to correct whatever you wish. Next, I think to say that he uses derogatory language in his lyrics is not out of line nor inaccurate, no matter what the lyrics in hip-hop records are. Obviously some of Rose's audience feel offended by this and it is not a bad thing to acknowledge this, without diminishing Rose's work. Finally as far as the Carson thing goes, in his website Biff even notes that he wasn't invited back because of what he sang, so that's where I came up with him being banned. Seemingly, the email produced from ocenachild contradicts this, and if that's the case, as I said before, feel free to incorporate this into the article. I would suggest that you two (Jonah and Sojambi) stop bickering about each other's "tone" and finish revising this article. I also say bring back the bird note, I agree with Sojambi on that one. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 18:39, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

We can work from there and continue debating if need be. If you or whoever else changes it, it will still remain in the "history" and can be referred back to.

<li>The changes sound good to me, somehow I have a feeling Jonah might not be happy with them, especially regarding Rose's later career. Where did you draw most of this new material from, do you have sources? Also, has anyone looked at these so-called profiles from Time and the NYT? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 01:13, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I added as many online citations as I could find with my limited time. I don't have the date of the NY Times profile handy, but I can add it soon. I used some other musician articles on Wikipedia as my guide, and found that I am using no more detail, and often quite a bit less, than other comparable artists from the late 1960's. The citations that are missing will probably be easier to fill once the new Biff Rose compilations are reviewed in the next couple of months. - <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 02:38, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I am not happy, and as long as I'm posting and fcello has this frozen we are going to stay at loggerheads. When I post things and change them, I am rebuffed.So I have stopped changing other peoples additions, unlike Sojambi Pinola who tries to make it seem like Rose is a happy go lucky sweet heart of an old man. Then removes wuotes and other informqation that was written into the posting. One look at his websites will prove Rose is an angry misanthropic man. Sojambi Pinola is attempting to steam roll his way to a victory of edits- that's not what this site is about. This is not only unreasonable, but vicious and deserves some sort of punishment. I can't believe that I'm the only person to hear the racist sentiments in Rose's work. Reviews of Rose's reissued albums will not change the racism inherent in the later versions. Also, Sojambi Pinola has posted under numerous names, why isn't this being looked into.Then he says that Marcuse is my sock puppet. It is so strange that such a loose nut can be given such creedence. The very fact that this editor admits to being so close with Rose underlines his lack of NPOV, he is biased toward Rose, and anything he doesn't think fits on this site he then removes regardless of the veracity of said item. Oh man this is so lame. Leave the criticism in, then we'll reach some consensus. That's all.</dd>

Then we can all discuss your additions, and you can discuss mine and weigh in on them. Since most of the quotations were "one-liners," I changed the word "quotations" to "one-liners."

<dd>Until you revert back to a more logical form of editing this isn't going to be friendly you are obviously unable to sperarte your POV from any edits, and I aks that you recuse yourself, and let others form it. Your questions are baseless if yo uare simply going to again STEAMROLL over anything you do0n't write yourself. That isn't editing, and isn't going to get the one were editing to replace the frizen one. until you can better present yourself, I'll revert. You say subjective, I say Racist, I wrote in edit, some critics, using a NPOV tone, you erased that. That is against the policy of wikipedia.. so you are in fact refuting yourself. Not good. All albums that are self released will be categorized as such. Fast eddy, Wascals don't exist as true record labels, but as fan pressings of Rose's rambling gooseberry hunts. Therefore, all self released are put in theri proper places. His real releases are categorized ahead, because they were the ones that were most easily accesible when rose was of any ocncern at all to a record buying public. His sales are under 50 a year if that. So, there you go. I've got more than fcello involved now, so it's going to keep the language or we stay here on the discussion page. No one liners, I think the lead off should be the quote Bag of donuts placed in the lead position. I'm unmovebale there. As you have been in trying to eradicate any listing of rose as a racist antisemitic angry old man. I think you are the one that takes things out of context, when you misplace quotes, and bury them deeper in the piece. Let the quote speak for itself, how out of context can it be.. the very sentence itself is offensive. It's not out of context, you are. So we are back to the same old same old. I shall jsut try a completely new edit, with rewrite and all until you can muster up your senses and come to a compromise, which I already offered you. Also, you need to learn how to write if you are going to continue to edit this. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 07:16, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I Promised myself I would leave this article alone, but the arguments going on above are a bit over the top, so once again, here are my two cents. I'll try and mediate. First, I think separating the discography into commercial and self-releases seems like a logical compromise, it does nothing to demean the artist and it is factually accurate. Plus, in general, I usually find self-released albums more interesting than commercial releases, so I even see that as a plus. Having someting like CD era, LP era etc. seems forced, since often LP's get re-released as CD's. Second, I think "Summer Kraft Music Festival" should be re-added. Although it was a brief series in the 60's and an offshoot of the "Kraft Music Festival" it does seem to have some reknown and had did feature lots of good comedians such as Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson and was written by George Carlin. So I think it merits being put back in. I think that the arguments regarding the discography and the earlier career should be solvable since both of you seem to mostly agree, so why don't we fix those parts up and agree not to change them anymore. Now as far as the later career, things seem rather irreconciliable at present, but there is no need to make childish re-edits, such as "the pc crowd is offended, etc.". I say let's write the factual part first and again leave it as is as its own paragraph. Then we can add a paragraph that basically espouses both sides. Sojambi, no matter what the context is, using derrogatory language is always going to be offensive to some, even if it is not to you. Jonah, I agree with Sojambi that you can't take this completely out of context and go as far as to say Rose is a complete racist misanthrope. Yes, I find his work a bit offensive, but one can also tell he's really out for controversy (which obviously he's caused) rather than truly being a racist a la Klu Klux Klan (which you make him sound like). I think there is room for both criticism and support. For some issues it is impossible to write from a NPOV perspective, so the next best thing is to add BOTH perspective and leave it at that. One more thing, I wish you guys stop thretening each other, since this really doesn't help in improving the article. For what it's worth, that's my two cents. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 13:29, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Elsewhere, you accused <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> of being a _promoter_ of Biff Rose, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Boothy443&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22897000" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Boothy443&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22897000" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] which is an apparently intentional falsehood.

<dd>My understanding of Wikipedia is, if it is POV, it should not be included, period. In other words, if Jonah wants to talk about "pundits" and "critics," he should source or quote these outside criticisms, rather than include his POV and pass it off as a fact. Listing Rose's accomplishments, as I have, is not POV. My most recent draft was a significant expansion of the article. For the most part, I kept your contributions, rewording them at most, removing POV material at worst. Putting the date of the Time article in the article would be considered a decent citation by most.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources needed, etc</span></h2>
<p>Here's a list of items removed and the reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Biff Rose was one of the greatest and most talented musicians and comedians to appear in the early 1960's"
<ul>
<li>We can't say he was greatest and most talented, but we can report that some significant commentators have said this, if they have. Sources needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Biff Rose arrived in Hollywood in 1966, with a banjo on his knee."
<ul>
<li>"Banjo on his knee" is unencyclopedic. The date needs a source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"There he found employment working as a sketch writer for television variety shows."
<ul>
<li>Source. Which shows?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Eventually, Rose took up with the songwriting he developed during his youth growing up in New Orleans."
<ul>
<li>Source? New Orleans is just about acceptable because it's on the allmusic.com bio. Songwriting developed as a youth, well that's another matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Rose's great work was embraced by the hippies, and even non-hippies found his zany writings and performances to be the panacea to a wounded world. Rose himself wrote the most interesting songs of the time- ignoring record label pleas for him to record more mainstream fare."
<ul>
<li>POV, and as far as "embraced by the hippies", far too vague. Which hippies?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"In the meantime, Rose began writing lyrics and combining them with the carnival like sounds he produced on the piano. A testament to Rose's popularity, his songs were covered by a variety of entertainers, looking for a national audience. Much of Rose's music was comedic, often prodding the political climate of the time."
<ul>
<li>This reads like a cosy review article. We're writing an encyclopedia. "A variety of entertainers" is pushing it a bit if we're talking about Tiny Tim and the early Bowie. Who else? Source? The comic nature of his music and lyrics is okay, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"He appeared twelve times on Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" from 1968 to 1970."
<ul>
<li>Source?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Bill Cosby's Tetragrammaton label released his debut in 1968. Rose also recorded albums for United Artists, Pacific Arts, Sweet Jane Limited, and the Buddha label. He returned to recording in 1996 by self-releasing the angry "Bone Again" CD."
<ul>
<li>Covered in the discography</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"It's important to note that these later recordings contain what many consider racist, misogynistic and anti semitic lyrics. He himself consistently refers to all the "conflict" as "theatre" on his website. His detractors equate that Rose's explanation panders to his racist hate speech."
<ul>
<li>Needs source. "It's important to note that..." is also a classic weasel phrase. The sentence would read better and be just as true (if it is true) if that was removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Most fans of Rose completely disagree with the racist tag. This man is a genius at social satire. His ability on the keyboard is not lacking either. Wiht each pluck of the ivories, Rose sends out delicious goodness to the world, truly attempting to better the world by pointing out the irregularities and sadness that encapsule us all. Biff Rose is in no way a racist. Anyone that would say that has to be a total fool. Listen to his early records, Listen to Molly the song of a clown. John Denver covered his recordings for god's sake."
<ul>
<li>Extreme POV. Source for the John Denver cover would be good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"<i>My words are just some antics.</i>"
<ul>
<li>Unsourced.</li>

A perusal of the history of this page will make that more obvious.

<li>"Biff Rose was born in October 1937, and grew up in New Orleans. He served briefly in the Army. By the early 1960's, he was a comedian and folk musician. Rose was apparently profiled in The New York Times (1964) and Time Magazine (January 29th, 1965) though the articles have not been found. He toured extensively as the opening act for Glenn Yarbrough of the Limeliters. By 1965 he had landed in Hollywood, working with George Carlin as a sketch writer for television variety shows like "The Mort Sahl Show" ."

<li>This is excellent, I missed it first time through. Well sourced. Including it.</li>

</li>
<li>"The 80's began, and Biff Rose drifted. After disappearing from the scene, Rose returned, in 1996, withhis first new recordings in almost 20 years- these were self released. He has since self released three other disks. His more recent records have continued his experimental, questing approach to songwriting, according to his pundits. It is important to note Rose has ruffled the feathers of the pc crowd, using language that others deem racist and anti semtic-words such as Kikes, Jews, and Niggers, pepper his later songs, where his fans call this "playful imagination" his critics remained horrified at Rose's ability to curry grace with such angry hate filled songs. Rose tours intermittently, playing small venues and the occasional summer festival."

<li>I think the latest version by Sojambi Pinola in the temp page actually was better sourced and more complete than the current version. Sources do not necessarily need be online sources, if some of the info is gleaned from liner notes of out-of-print records that's fine too. I also think there is room for some descriptive sentences regarding Rose's musical and comedic style as well as influences, and these can come from Rose himself (ie. from his website) or simply from the music itself. Why does it have to SAY somewhere that he played piano where it is obvious he played piano? Just because this is an encyclopedia doesn't mean writing has to be dry and limited to a list of facts. There is room for context and what not. As far as the anonymous user who keeps adding his extreme POV paragraph, please stop as you know this is only going to be reverted. Please cite a real source for the criticism. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 14:07, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sojambi, I think your stuff sounds fine. You're right, I found Biff's stuff nonsensical at first but I see that is his form of humor. I think I'm more or less done here, because my main concern was to make sure that the article was mostly verifiable fact. I think my effort worked okay as a first cut but I am more than pleased to find people more experienced with the material who can fix my errors and add stuff to make the article better. I agree with Marcuse that on top of the factual bedrock there is room for a description of Rose's style, which may necessarily be slightly subjective. On this subject it's always best to cite named reviewers in the trade press where possible, though I'm aware that because of the length of Rose's career and the fact that his heyday was the sixties and early seventies this can be difficult. And I thought researching Seals and Crofts was difficult! --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:27, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Racism controversy</span></h2>
<p>I took this bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>It is important to note Rose's later work differs from his early recordings. Most notably Rose uses stronger language in his lyrics, and in some cases uses outright racist and anti semitic terminology. His fans claim this is social intercourse. Critics do not accept this trite explanation, and insist Rose believes the words he sings.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>"It's important to note that" is unnecessary and sounds like an expression of opinion, although it isn't really. It's not necessary to describe the opinions of unnamed defenders and critics, just describe that fact that the lyrics are controversial. The reader can make his own mind up. So it comes out as:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Rose's later work differs from his early recordings. There is strong language in his lyrics, and he makes controversial use of racial stereotypes.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course we all know that a writer doesn't always hold the opinions that he expresses in a song, and we're used to that ambiguity. Someone who was interested enough from reading this article would be able to get hold of his later songs and listen to them and make his own mind up, but we could say the same of John Lennon, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Brel_c77d.html" title="Jacques Brel">Jacques Brel</a>, or just about any writer. Does Brel really hate <i>Les Flammandes</i>, or is he just expressing a distaste for a certain kind of Flemish politics? You probably won't find much about the opinions of Brel's fans on this subject in the Brel article. -- <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> <a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:19, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I applaud your efforts to raise the subject of our debate up to the level of wordsmiths such as Jaques Brel, and John Lennon, a single listen to the later works will acquaint you sufficiently to the lacking stylistic qualities included in Rose's later work. The comparison falls far short of relevance considering the level of ingenuity and intellectual sincerity of Lennon and Brel versus the angry hate fueled ditribes of Biff Rose. What is of note is that when people like David Duke and those of the White Power movement use the same kind of language in similar situations, it is referred to as hate speech. But when apologists try to slip Rose into the role of a linguistical and theatrical creator who shouldn't be bound by any guidelines, I myself have a hard time disagreeing. Artists should be free to speak as they please, everyone should be...but when someone is unable to separate bitter anger from clever wordplay supposedly promoting thought through his "conflict" theater, in the words of john Lennon, "don't you know you can count me out." The important thing here isn't the sentiments Brel used to power a larger work, but the larger workt of Rose's later career, totally imbued with his racist and anti semtic idealogy. Bypassing those issues would be akin to ignoring Lennon's pacifism, and heroin addiction, or Brel's ebullient songs, or his portrayal of the seedier elements of life with a harrowing honesty as well as an honest appreciation of their purpose. Rose on the other hand mostly pokes fun at people less fortunate than him, or merely different. Kike and nigger, words he uses with an alarming regularity, do not impart wisdom. In some cases, as with Patti Smith in her excellent Rock and Roll Nigger, there is the ability to devalue those words. Biff Rose's usage is not akin to that kind of interpretation. Instead, his songs during his later period exterpate any of the hippie ideaology his earlier works prescribed. And it might due you some good, Tony, to check out Brel's career- he expressed manyu views concerning the people of his hoemland- many not so flattering to them. In his wikipedia entry, this is noted. And Not by me.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 04:24, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>While many people think Rose is Racist, I do not. I think he speaks for americans, which John Lennon didn't do, as an emigre. True americans understand the natural world Rose speaks of, the honest world, the clean american world. Rose is a hero , a working man's hero unlike the one Lennon might have been, and who is jaques brel anyway? He ain't american, or a freedom fighter. Rose breaks with tradition and speaks his mind, and shames those who aren't as witty.<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_of_edits_6fd5.html" title="User:Master of edits">Master of edits</a> 03:58, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

And it is true, but linking Lennon's use of the word- refering to women being the nigger of the world, to Rose's racial slur usage is inconcievable, and by adding that POV he breaks the rules of wikipedia.

<dd>Willmcw is right, Nigger is ok for white people to use, in reference to black people, because black people do it all the time. When LEnnon refers to women as niggers, it's like when Biff calls the southern neihgbors dumb niggahs out for a buck. It doesn't matter if he means it- it's for arts sake. He's like Lennon because he doesn't care what people think of him. Biff is excellent and you should just let him write and say what he means, if he means nigger he means nigger and John Lennon would be proudd that someone called those mean old neighbors of biff's what they were in the first place. Willmcw is right because women are sort of second class citizens jsut like niggers are. They are. And Biff knows it. He sings about it. We hear it. It is so.<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_of_edits_6fd5.html" title="User:Master of edits">Master of edits</a> 06:06, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sojambi Pinola, first off, I'm me.. address me as me, and quit implying there are more than me, or I will start addressing you as a sock puppet of Biff Rose. Want to start that whole thing up again? Your track record doesn't help. Edits on the rose page are because, for some reason, you believe that if Biff picked his nose near a speedway in the late sixties or seventies , it's worth calling a festival and mentioning. Why do you care? Biff has no career as of now. I care because he writes mean spirited things about jewish people. And African americans. If you call his life a career, I think that's a stretching things. So since you are determined to add any info you can find about Rose, I'm willing to edit that info into a readbale- another thing YOU don't seem to care about- article on the man, that is based in his achievements- good, and bad, as well as his lyrical morass.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 18:04, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I reverted the article to the original text by Tony Sidaway, which although pared down seems fair and reads best. I kept the corrections made by S.P. in the names of the releases. Please do not remove the names of the record labels. This is standard for other Wikipedia musician related articles, and is helpful for someone trying to find old recordings. Please do not change this again. As far ast the last sentence, I think Tony's version reads best and agree that it describes the controversy, allowing the listener to make up her mind. But change it back if you feel strongly that your version was better. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 02:03, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jonah, I apologize for confusing you with 216.175.119.92. I have proven repeatedly that I am not Biff Rose. I must admit that I am frustrated with the actions of both of you, and wish you were more willing to debate the specific issue of your POV contributions. Again, it's not a matter of whether or not you are "right," it's a matter of whether your first-person critique abides by the rules of Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>In recent drafts I have agreed with the efforts of others to remove POV material, including anything of mine that could conceivably fall within this category. I am asking you, gently, kindly, to work WITH these people on this issue. I do NOT want to fight with you. I merely want to talk about the use of POV in this article. What was wrong with Tony's NPOV description of the controversy? Forget about me for a minute. What was wrong with Tony's?</dd>

<dd>Maybe you should remove yourself from editing this post. No maybe about it, I think you should recuse yourself, do to the friendship, and nature of your relationship with Rose. I also am astounded by the fact that you claim to be jewish and are totally comfortable with Rose's tone in regards to any person who is Jewish. This is unforgivable. It seems funny to me, too, that you are completely unable to digest the thought that there very well may be more than one person who finds Rose less than charming. Especially regarding this quote form his website the other day, "Dear Steve...I don't know your motives in telling mesomething like that....AND IN CAPS...I suspect it'syout liberal New York jewish nature kicking in...." * <a href="http://www.biffrose.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biffrose.com" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> on the message board posting titled 'oh christ not paul williams again'</dd>

<dd>Tony's edits seemed to cast nary a descriptive note in response to the rampant anti-semticism found in Rose's lyrics, jokes, and website message board. So instead of telling us how bad you feel, why not simply remove yourself from this discussion. It's clear you've taken things too far on more than one occassion, where you edited another person's talk page, as well as edited the same article under two different identities. Instead of complaining bitterly how you think others are not adhering to Wikipedia standards, perhaps you should focus on your own self adherence to said standards. Police yourself, and let the article state the facts, not your 'Rose' colored version of them.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 03:05, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The version, as it stands, is not a complete sentence and makes little sense: <i>Rose's newer recordings contain strongly racist and anti semitic language &amp; sentiments contained within his.</i> How about this: <i>Rose's later work differs from his early recordings. He makes controversial use of racial stereotypes through his use of racist and anti-semitic language in his lyrics.</i> I agree with Jonah on this one. Rose's use of language is certainly and unapologetically anti-semitic and racist, and he does little do dispel this in any of his websites and little statements he regularly puts out. This makes me think that in his case he does hold the opinions that he expresses in his songs. I feel uncomfortable defending his use of language and stereotypes as a mere rouse. But putting in that his use of stereotypes is "controversial" is about as much benefit of the doubt I would give Rose. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 02:13, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I took it upon myself to fix the last edit of Jonah's, in accordance with Marcuse's notation that it ended in an incomplete sentence, as well as his concern that by regarrding Rose's views towards those who he adresses with the 'strong language.' I'll discuss this with Sojambi. And a careful read of this page shows that Jonah Ayers has addresses the issue on numerous occassions. Maybe Sojambi has become to attached to the issues at hand to actually read what has been written. IT would do all of us good to let the matter drop.

<li>Sojambi Pinola, it appears you placed an email of an editor on here, which is against the rules. I have removed it. I will keep removing it, even if you only write half of it- it is best to keep anyone involved in this discussion out of harms way. By indentifying someone, even partially, you are going against the rules of Wikipedia. Please note, I have noted a number of administrators of your actions, and am going to resort to an official action toward you if you persist in breaking the rules of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.112.9.html" title="User:216.175.112.9">216.175.112.9</a> 03:02, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looks like Steve/Sojambi is getting a little out of hand here... he's trying to push other websites on to Wiki- I've brought Biff Rose's website up, any of them, because it's logical to deduce information for the article from them. But trying to fight another website, and say that everyonje who doesn't like Biff is only two people in Denver is ludicrous. I've never been to Denver. My email is easy to get, I'll send it to you Stev/Sojambi, but I've never been to that sitre, until after you pointed it out, and now it's clear that their are more than just me editing here at this site who do not like Biff and find him anti-semitic.

<li>Regading Jonah's lates version of the last sentence: <i>Rose's newer recordings contain Racist and Anti-semitic language in their lyrics.</i> While this version is accurate, and clear, it still needs some context. It reads like a warning sticker on a CD cover. It is like saying: "Shakespeare's works contains anti-semitic verses". And leaving it at that. What is needed is a bit of context. While I'm not in the business of defending Rose, at minimum say it is controversial. I've changed it to: <i>Rose's newer recordings are more controversial. They often make use of racial stereotypes and contain Racist and Anti-semitic language in their lyrics.</i> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 14:42, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

Let's go back to the days of polite disagreement. I think there is much more to the thing than what we have been writing of recently.......<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.112.9.html" title="User:216.175.112.9">216.175.112.9</a> 03:53, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Checking in</span></h2>
<p>I've been asked to check in and see if I can't help out a bit.</p>
<p>I am not an admin. I have not read very much of the history here, but realize there are hot terms like racist etc. being thrown around. Also, I see that people are talking and exchanging ideas about edits, so that is a good sign. You may not even need me.</p>
<p>I have noticed a charge of vandalism, somewhere. <b>Please be very careful</b> not to misapply this term with respect to disputed content. Vandalism and bold editing -- even removal of text -- are entirely different things. This is not aimed at any particular user.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am going to carefully review edits which go to the 3RR policy. Remember that a revert is <i>any edit</i> (except a vandalism revert -- see above) that <i>undoes</i> the actions of another editor. It can even be adding back what an editor decided to delete, and it can include other additional non-related edits, and, on its own, can be entirely justified. But even entirely justified reverts, if more than three, break the rule.</p>
<p>The best rule of thumb is to limit yourself to <b>one revert</b> per article per day. That usually avoids any possibility of an edit war. If you've already made your revert for the day, may I kindly suggest you stop. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revert counts, by user</span></h2>
<p>To help out a user, I have counted the reverts and listed them below, so he can evaluate them.</p>
<p>Remember, not every edit is a revert, and reverts are allowed as long as they do not accumulate or fuel an edit war. Also, reversions made "just after" the 24-hour period can be counted in that period, if they are too close. The edits below were not evaluated for their "validity" or quality, as this is not the issue in a revert war. Additionally, no edits were found that can be described as vandalism; such edits do not count towards reversions.</p>
<p>Time period represented: Just over 24 hours. Nothing before that period was analyzed; therefore, some of these reversions could qualify as violations if they are added to any previous reverts.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unexplained Deletions</span></h2>
<p>Jonah, I've noticed that you have tried to delete several links from the article without explanation. In one case a separate editor "Master of Edits" vandalized the article and you kindly reverted it a few minutes later, except that when you reverted it you left out the links you were originally trying to delete. What gives? I think that it is a sound policy that we agree to discuss material in the talk page before deleting it with no explanation. Please stop behaving so erratically. thank you, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 18:33, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I only reverted to one of my edits. I hadn't realized we still needed all those references as they weren't going ot be included in the article. It seems to me we don't need the extra information- much of it is extraneous and unneeded. If we somehow found the time article that would warrant an inclusion, but the things that are being included are just silly spots on the web. Do we really need every silly website referenced on this entry? Seems a little much. All of the info is unsourced as well. Do we need a list of who performed on playboy after dark? I think not.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 22:32, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the time being we don't need to worry about extraneous info.

<p>I agree with Willmcw, more info is better, especially if it backs up facts in the article, which both of those references do. There's no harm in leaving them. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 01:43, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure any of you are right. The details of Rose's career are not addressed by the referenced material. Only things that Sojambi likes from earlier in Rose's career. And they don't explain his later work, or earlier for that matter. I think they ae window dressing and take away from the article.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.112.9.html" title="User:216.175.112.9">216.175.112.9</a> 02:09, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are they not addressed by the reference material? They are direct links to sources that confirm all the facts in the first part of the article. Rather than criticize other user's contributions, why don't you add some that support material that you would like to include about his later or earlier career? How does saying that his recordings are "lo-fi" help the matter? Is this your opinion or do you have a source? The discography section already says they are self-released, so adding it here is redundant. If you are basically going to disregard any of the discussion that is been going on in this page, and write whatever the hell you want, then I'm simply not going to waste any more my time contributing to this article.

<dd>I brought in a lot of content before, covering his early 60's career to the present, and it was all deleted. Perhaps some of this made sense, as it could be considered "original research," which goes against the rules of Wikipedia. The article now consists solely of things that can be proven with internet citations --which is why it concentrates on his late 60's career-- plus one claim of racist lyrics on CDs that is not backed up by any citations of <i>outside critiques</i> of his work.</dd>

<p>Well for now let's assume that there's a sensible explanation that we do not yet know. The damage in this kind of dispute tends to be caused by misunderstandings and the resulting fallings-out.

<p>Jonah, it may have been a mistake, but you cannot mark an edit as "minor," as you did on the Biff page, when it obviously changes so much content, especially disputed content.</p>
<p>Minor edits are for adding wiki edits, correcting spelling or spacing, and suchlike. This is why this feature is not made available to new accounts.</p>
<p>When you abuse this feature, you also abuse the trust of your fellow editors, and they will become less and less willing to work with you. Please keep this in mind.</p>

<dd>I think this one was in good faith, though you are quite right that it was an improper use of "minor" tag. It looks like Jonah simply reverted his previous edit. It's fine to mark a self-reversion like that minor, <i>so long</i> as you note it in the edit summary. As a personal aside, I find it astonishing how much effort is being put into a page about a fellow virtually no one has ever heard of or would remember if they had. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 00:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Derex, this "reversion" has been going back and forth and back and forth, a long, slow and nasty edit war. You are also right that he should have written something in the edit summary (which he didn't). Jonah came to me before asking for help. I'm trying to protect him, not the article. He has now left a message on my page, which, I believe, establishes his IP as being no longer a suspected sock puppet but a confirmed one. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Klenk_4cff.html" title="User talk:Paul Klenk"><sup>talk</sup></a> 03:23, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It is interesting that the edits that were re-reverted have nothing to do with Rose's racist lyrics. They are factual things about his early career, and it seems like the only purpose you have been reverting them is to "get back" at Sojambi Pinola.

<p>I don't appreciate folks acting as such, Marcuse. I never threatened you once, and that terminology is in itself an underhanded threat, by accusing me, you offer me to the wolves. It proves your methods are indeed suspect. As for you Klenk, nope. Should stymy you all for a bit. Oi. Now, the Rose postintg, the information included on rose's listing is superfluous at best, but mostly excessive. Check out his former songwriting partner's listing here. I think by writing al lthe extraneous crud on his posting it gives the allusion that he was a 'star' as Sojmabi Pinola wants. I take aim at this method off editing because it is not what other 'stars' have on their own articles here. It is part of what is a larger form of <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> and I take pride in pointing it out and fixing it. My edits are not reverts or extractioins, they are fixes to the POV that Sojambi has placed into the article. It is in no way needed to mention the names of the songs of Rose that Pat Boone recorded if they are listed in references. That is redundant and unprofessional. It makes the entry look amateurish.

<dd>First of all, to be strictly technical, it proves nothing about the content of his LYRICS. I just listened to his two 2004 albums yesterday. Absolutely NOTHING on them that could be considered hateful to any race. One love song to a black woman, another love song to a Korean woman....both songs mention their races, and even make puns (eg. "my career" becomes "my Korea,") but they are inarguably non-sarcastic and loving songs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, I could spend some time taking apart what he's saying here, and perhaps I will more, later. He mentions that "Nigguh" is a dirty word. The most charged thing he says is some challenge about whether Jews can "control the telling of the second coming," and I honestly can't explain what he is talking about. From my experience, he is, at times, capable of equal-opportunity misanthropy, but I have not noticed him _excluding_ any particular race or religion from his tirades.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, on balance, still doesn't count as legit evidence as to the content and intent of his CDs. Now, how's about that lunch meeting, Jonah? And what of the email address you promised?</dd>

<p>My email in your hands is not something I look forward too. You have vandalized other users pages. So no, I think not, in retrospect, I thought you were more peacable. You aren't. No email for you. I DON'T WANT TO MEET YOU!!!!!! Got it? Good. You are a bore, and a bully. It is laughable that anyone should take your biased opinion on Rose's lyrical content. You are friends with the man and converse on his message board with him, as well as fraternize with him. Your take on his racism and Anti semiticism is without merit, because it is so clouded by your friendship with him. I disagree with your take on Rose. Also the lyric my career turning to my korea is plagiarized from an earlier recording by Pavement, of which he denies ever hearing, but others attest that he received from a bartender in the 9th ward of New Orleans at the time of said record's release. Get with it man, the guy you put on a pedestal is a racist anti semitic rip off artist, he ripped off Joseph S.

There is a style of writing that turns up in the early parts of last century, specifically in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnegans_Wake_199e.html" title="Finnegans Wake">Finnegans Wake</a>, and in the 1960s in Dylan's novel <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarantula_%28book%29.html" title="Tarantula (book)">tarantula</a>, and in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Aldiss_a592.html" title="Brian Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>'s novel, Barefoot in the Head. To complain that the above is "antisemitic" or "racist" is ridiculous. It's punning wordplay, unfettered, drunk on language and ideas. Great stuff!</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe I should get a hold of some of this guy's work. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New citations of Biff Rose on web</span></h2>
<p>In the wake of a just-released CD compilation, much of the non-citable information I had included in the article, later removed, is now citable. Biff is being hailed as a cult hero to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Weird_America_22ff.html" title="New Weird America">New Weird America</a> music movement, spearheaded by <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devendra_Banhart_02fb.html" title="Devendra Banhart">Devendra Banhart</a>, who is gushingly quoted. Might this be time to re-migrate some of this information back into the article? This press release <a href="http://howlinwuelf.com/_wsn/page3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://howlinwuelf.com/_wsn/page3.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> is basically the liner notes of the compilation, written by Bay Area musician Thom Moore. A Bay Guardian interview link provides additional detail.</p>
<p>There is plenty of precedent on Wikipedia for articles that go into extensive detail on the artists in question.

<dd>Look biff Rose is nowhere in the league of those people. He was an unknown. Even Paul Williams, hiscolooborator has won awards, an oscar even. Rose isn't worthy of more than a small mention, becauseit turns into POV- that's against the rules here. I'm not gonnaargue, just telling you why changes are made. I will keep your references, list them to high heaven for all I care. But leave the article to pertinent info.. not one take of roast beef. It's useless info.

<dd>Mike Nesmith is an interesting individual and this article is made more interesting by including his brief participation in Rose's life. Regarding the description of Rose's lyrics, if we can find a notable critic who describes them then we can quote the critic. But we shouldn't try to characterize or critique the lyrics ourselves as that would be original research. Regarding "stand-up comedian", I see that being added and removed. Is he? Was he? What's the deal? (I'd figured he was more of sit-down comedian). Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 07:33, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>OK, this turned into a bit of an essay. Please bear with me. &#160;:)....</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On a literal level, you are right, he'd tend to "sit down" at the piano. But the "stand-up" designation is still the correct one in terms of genre: He is not a comedic character actor, for example. So the article link reads "comedian," but clicking the link brings you to the page on stand-up comedians, which begins: "A stand-up comedian or stand-up comic is someone that performs comedy in an informal way, talking to the audience with the absence of a fourth wall. It is usually done by one comedian and usually with a microphone." At least 3 1/2 of Rose's albums fall into this category. Someone looking for his songwriter albums might be mystifed when they plunk a record on their turntable and he never gets around to singing on it. I've had that experience. His early fame was as a stand-up comedian; he was successful enough at this to be profiled in a full-page article in Time magazine, and the Wikipedia article used to reflect this. Not only was he successful, but on the basis of the existing recordings, his comedy was strange and unique. It would appear that some of his Tonight Show success was the result of combining these two disparate talents (comedy and songwriting), as reflected in the Robert Christgau reviews. It is a shame if this "can't" be included in the article, insofar as describing, non-critically, what his act consisted of.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The purpose of an encyclopedia is to give information to people. Personally, as a music fan, I am always looking for more information on artists that spark my interest, whether or not a million <i>other</i> people find them important <i>yet</i>. In fact, I find that some of the most interesting artists are the less well-known ones. I got to know Biff Rose as a person <i>only</i> after I'd spent the better part of a decade tracking down most of his albums, which I was able to do even in the case of the "self-released" ones. The records were distributed, and they did turn up in record stores in the days before internet distribution. <i>Roast Beef,</i> for example, is not a "famous" album, but I continue to bump into songwriters and music fans who have bumped into it and hold it in extremely high regard. Can I find a citation that claims that? No, I have only my personal experience to go on. I have made friends with people, and ended up in more than one band, simply because we were both aware of the existence of this album. It is a unique work, and it deserves mention; Rose is high-profile enough, beyond that album, for it to be of interest to people interested in his other work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This strange idea that someone's article should be of a length merely proportional to the size of their fame does not make much sense to me. That would imply that we are just filling up a formal space to reflect someone's "importance," as if importance were an objectively measurable quantity; but that is an illusion. The way I see it, as long as the information is potentially interesting to several people, NPOV (which is key), and accurate, it has a usefulness. Nonetheless, I am still limiting myself to information that has a connection to "reputable" sources, no matter how illusory I find that. The Mike Nesmith connection is an example. <i>Roast Beef</i> is interesting beyond the Nesmith connection, but the Nesmith connection helps give it context and legitimacy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Rose is an artist who doesn't tend to repeat himself; therefore, it may make sense to describe at least <i>some</i> of the breadth of his work, even if he doesn't sell as much as, say, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Frampton_c4fb.html" title="Peter Frampton">Peter Frampton</a>, who tends to record in the same genre each time out. The article becomes more useful if it helps people wade through his releases to find recordings they will like (or will even <i>choose</i> to be challenged by, through a more complex listening interaction). As his work is now being re-released by "legitimate" labels, it seems perfectly valid to supply some such information in the context of this encyclopedic article, as long as it can be done tastefully. A guy who managed to influence the work of both <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carlin_f409.html" title="George Carlin">George Carlin</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> probably has something interesting going on, whether or not he was able to capitalize on this in a business sense. (Or whether he was even primarily <i>interested</i> in such a limited, myopic definition of "success"....which, apparently, was not the case.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's another example: <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Fay_fee3.html" title="Bill Fay">Bill Fay</a>. The Bill Fay article is basically a stub. One could argue that, given the guy's original commercial failure, that's all he deserves. I disagree. I recently learned of this guy's music, and I love what I have heard. He is a formerly unknown artist who is getting rediscovered, and I wish someone who knows more about him would expand this article. For example, the band <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilco.html" title="Wilco">Wilco</a> covered one of his songs in their movie "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart." This should be mentioned in that article. How do Bill's albums differ? Which of the four available CDs should I buy first, given my tastes? I think that would be useful info, but I'm not the guy to do it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One could argue that if an artist like Fay is getting his music re-released nearly 40 years later <i>in spite</i> of its commercial failure, there is probably something there beyond nostalgia. That's a pretty tough fence to leap over, and he has done it. So, it would appear, has Rose. They both have followings without the benefit of hype, and that is a particular test of quality.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Several bands on Wikipedia have not only articles, but articles devoted to each of their albums and even individual songs. A couple of people have taken it upon themselves to write articles on each of <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styx_%28band%29.html" title="Styx (band)">Styx's</a> albums, which were famous once but considered to be crap by a great many mature adults. &#160;:) I have no problem with that....<i>Someone</i> must find that interesting. Given <i>that</i> scale, I find nothing problematic with expanding this article a bit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to the idea that Rose is an "unknown": Given that Bruce Springsteen is name-dropping him in his interview, as linked, one might have a little problem characterizing him as unknown.</dd>

<p>I can not believe the amount of adulation you throw on a second rate racist who can't even make enough off his Bowie connection to live on... He's a wastrel. With a past, but jesus chirst Espinola, get a grip, life is more than what you think it is, and the sad fact is that with a quick glance to Rose's message board, and a slight listen to his records, you can tell he's a pissed off misanthrope. Search a little deeper and you fgind out about how he abandoned his kids, and delve just a little bit more, which you calim to have done, and you're going to discover he's justa pathetic drunk,a class a alcoholic, his discourse, his interpesonal relationships all point to his alcholism. To top it all off, I've worked in the record industry, sales, management, and this guys records show up in the trash bins more often than in the used bins. If you found them, you found them because you were the only one looking. Get over your pride.

<dd>It's not the addition of racism info I object too, though that ought to properly sourced. Frankly, it would be more surprising to me if he weren't racist, purely from a statistical perspective of his age and location. I'm from around there, so I know how common it is. What I object to is the continual deletion of factual information about his career, that might be somewhat positive. But, I'm just frustrated and irritable. Forget it. As to Mary Hope, she doesn't strike me as a sockpuppet at all, neither through her comments, her home page, her edit history, or her writing style. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's quite a leap.

<dd>Of course there are. Lots of my friends are. I'm just saying it's wouldn't be at all surprising if he is, because it's very common. Pick some random fellow of that age off the street in mississippi or nola, and there's a fair chance he's a racist. You'd be amazed at the conversations at the 'country club' among 60-something lawyers who assume everyone present shares their attitude. It's really fairly shocking. However, it does not matter a lick if Rose is racist is unless it shows up in his music or public performances. His personal views spoken in a private context have no place here. Without hard evidence of racism in the works for which he is notable, I don't care and I don't think it's relevant. Nobody's say-so is enough; it needs to be sourced. I do think the 'nippie higgur' album title, or whatever it was, suggests there might be an issue here. I'll check out the Mary Hope thing, been avoiding my mail this week; it was a pretty good effort if it is a puppet.

<dd>Marcuse writes: "In this case it is fair to put forth both sides of the issue." My understanding is....unless we can find _outside_ criticisms, then _neither_ side of the issue belongs in the article. And no-one has found such outside criticism. My viewpoint doesn't have more right to be in there than anyone else's. NONE of our viewpoints should be there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Backing up a little: There are two issues here, getting mixed together. One issue is...does including "too many" citable facts amount to POV? In other words, if the article is "too long" or "too detailed" does that make the artist "too important"? Many of the deletions that are occuring are occuring on that alleged basis, not on the racism-issue basis. Then the issue becomes, if we are cutting out a bunch of provable, factual stuff, what place does this factually-vague-yet-serious allegation have in the article?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other issue is...is Rose actually, factually a racist, and is that the CRUX of his most recent work? I'll admit that it's not a simple question to answer, because he certainly plays with volatile material.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Saying that (I paraphrase) "given his age, race and location it is statistically likely that he's a racist," is, obviously, not decent evidence to make a decision on. The guy was also a hippie who wrote a song predicting an alien arriving on earth with "half a million colors in his face" --showing our racism up as silly-- on his second album ("Color Blind Blues"). He and Harry Belafonte hugged on the Tonight Show and it apparently caused ripples at the time. Based on his past AND present, it's not a clear shot. He says a lot of things now on his website that contain apparent contradictions, at least on a surface, knee-jerk level. I could post a very anti-racist email he wrote a month ago. It's complex; one could write a long essay on it if they cared enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And especially because it is complex, I think it is ONLY fair to mention it if we can find reviews which approach the issue. Otherwise, it is POV. If both sides of _our_ issues are there, it is simply TWO POVs, not NPOV. Remove the topic altogether, you remove the POV. To repeat myself: Until we can find outside criticism, the topic has no place in this Wikipedia article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example: I'd be <i>happy</i> to write about the sound of Biff's newer music, and what my interpretation of it is. There is <i>plenty</i> about his new work that differs from the old...plenty that is innovative, difficult, and interesting. In fact, I <i>did</i> write about it, but all that material was removed. And checking into Wikipedia's policies, I'd say "rightfully so," as it amounts to 'original research.' But...and here's the big but....if that stuff has no place in the article, neither does the implication of racism. That's also original research or original criticism, and it has no place in any Wikipedia article. It skews and minimizes what the material is about, and it amounts to an unsubstantiated allegation, with no evidence that the writers have even bothered to listen to the complete albums in question. You could quote a paragraph from Huckleberry Finn or even "The Color Purple" and claim that the writers were racists, without being terribly clever....and obviously, you would be wrong. So we should stick to the simple, proveable facts.</dd>

<dd>Let me just respond to the comments about my "statistical" phrase. What I am saying is that it would be utterly unsurprising, so I don't think it should be dismissed as an outrageous suggestion off the cuff ... like I would be instantly inclined to dismiss the child molestation charge without a cite. Moreso because his album title is suggestive. Also, an easily verifiable cite is difficult because his lyrics are not on the web. However, I have never suggested that the fact there are plenty of racists provides any basis in the least for <i>asserting</i> Rose is one. All I am saying is that I don't think it's a crazy issue or a surprising one for someone to bring up. I'm not sure why that statement is being misintrepreted so.</dd>

<dd>I am also very clear that I don't care what his personal views are, only how it affects the work for which he is notable. I think it has <i>no place</i> here at all without proper sourcing. Now, that said, do we need a citable "controversy" to mention it? I think not, if his music contains <i>self-evidently</i> and <i>obviously</i> racist statements. Mentioning racial issues or names or making sarcastic political commentary or any of that does not count. It has to be indisputable and clearly sourced, and someone here that I trust on this (i.e. a long-time editor) needs to check it. In that case, I see no more difference is stating his music contains such language than to saying Jimmy Buffet's music talks about sailing. That would not be "original research", it's just stating a fact.</dd>

The "well said" below does not refer these comments, I jumped in because I felt my "statistical" comment was being misinterpreted, and that bothers me very much. I'm a social scientist, so I'm accustomed to making such statements neutrally. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">@</a> 13:56, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well said. I agree. In particular, we need to restrict ourselves to reporting criticism and not doing the criticizing ourselves. If I hear a song I can't say, "It sounds like cats fighting" or "It's the most fantasmic sound ever!" I can say that Rolling Stone" magazine said those things (if it did). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 09:12, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The sentence I suggested does not say he is a racist, what it says is that he makes controversial use of racial stereotypes. Even the title of his latest release says this, terms like the 'nippy higgur' etc clearly are trying to push the envelope in terms of race. If you consider his official websites and the little performance pieces within them and things like "Jewmanity" as part of his overall work, then again, it is obvious that he is making controversial use of racial stereotypes, for whatever purpose it may be. You don't need a critic to tell you that the white house is white, when it is obvious that it is. This is not my POV, it is factual information taken from his work. As I said, feel free to put it into context, call it theater or what you will, but do acknowledge it. As far as the article being too detailed, it is ridiculous to claim that a three paragraph article has too much information, leave that as is, and please add more.

<p>Decent points, all! Great!</p>
<p>Looking again at this paragraph:</p>
<p><i>Rose's later work differs from his early recordings. There is strong language in his lyrics, and he makes controversial use of racial stereotypes.</i></p>
<p>I still don't think the combination of sentences is exactly fair. It implies that use of racial stereotypes it _the_ thing that makes his new work differ. I appreciate Marcuse's suggestion to try to put it in context, and to add more.</p>
<p>If that temp page is still there, I may try some more rewriting and adding and see what people think. Thanks for the feedback. -<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 15:20, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Go for it, but please be considerate. I have no problem putting this in context. Truth said, his lyrics do seem relatively mild compared to what is on his websites, which he tones down significantly in his lyrics. I'm not one to be easily offended, and my instinct is to basically dismiss comments like his. But it seems like I am not the only one uncomfortable defending his use of race in his work. Here, for example, is a commment from the SF Bay Guardian about how some people might not appreciate song titles such as "Chinky Gee" or the cover of his new album <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/39/49/x_8days.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sfbg.com/39/49/x_8days.html" rel="nofollow">(scroll down to the bit on Rose's upcoming performance)</a>. You can't ignore his obsession with race in his later work. As far as antisemitism goes, no matter how many times I look at Jewmanity.com, I really cannot see this in any other context - sure he makes fun of Hitler, but he also implies Jews have an unhealthy obsession with Hitler. I really can't make heads and tail of it, and as a jewish person, it makes me very uncomfortable. Would you sit down with your jewish grandmother and browse Jewmanity.com? Any religious jew will also be offended by the disrespectful use of Hebrew scripture as a background to the site. I mean, do you have a better interpretation of this material? But OK, none of this is mentioned in his lyrics, so do as jew wish with it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 15:54, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see that this article is the subject of content disputes. I see that there have been too many reverts that use as an edit summary that they are reverting vandalism. Removal of content that is the subject of a dispute as to whether it is correct or encyclopedic is not vandalism. Claims of vandalism, when there is a real content dispute, are personal attacks.</p>
<p>Can we please try to summarize what the content issues are?</p>
<p>I see one content issue, which is that the statement that recent Biff Rose songs have racist content is a POV. A statmenet that a writer has claimed that they have racist content is NPOV. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 11:53, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

The removal of material by Jonah Ayers is vandalism in the sense that it was not a matter whether the material he repetedly removed was correct or not. This material is actually factual info and well sourced. He was just removing random bits and pieces from it because he basically felt like it, not because there was a dispute about the factuality of the content.

<p>I can't take it anymore. This chess match has got to stop. Why won't you others help? I had some helpers. Now they all have abandoned ship. This shouldn't be so difficult. We need to rally round and put an end to Jonah's big whale of a tale. Biff is not a child molester. He is a star, a bona fide star. He is not anti semitic and is not racist. HE sleeps with black girls because he says their pussy tastes better, and I'm a jew, and a latino. One of his best friends too. So you see, Jonah is making up things and posting them as truths. Biff might use the word 'nigger' to devalue it, and sometimes calls me a 'heeb' in joking. He is not an offensive person. Rather, he reinvigorates hateful words with wit and charm and brilliance.

<dd>In response to further anonymous rewriting of the "racism" sentence, I have removed the sentence in its entirety, pending actual discussion. I'll take a stand: We need to come to actual consensus here or leave it out. Unless we are going to include that discussion as part of a more well-rounded article, it casts an unfair and unbalanced pall on Rose's work, and seems to me to be a obvious, deliberate attempt to undermine. The person doing it, under all his names, is not acting in a community-oriented manner.</dd>

<li>Jonah, I think the way you left it reads like a warning label on a CD containing profanities. I think the way the sentence has been written before by others is accurate, since not all of his songs deal with race, and to say his later recordings are "rife" with racism is inaccurate. Plus, it would give you more credibility to stop using an annonymous IP. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 17:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Apologies, Marcuse and everyone. I was fed up with Mr. Multiname's lack of working with the rest of us. The main reason the sentence is there, in any form, is because of this character's insistence on it, which I don't put much stock in at this point due to his generally inappropriate behavior. Obviously, my solution was not very effective, either. I flew off the handle, and I am sorry.</dd>

<p>I don't agree with that at all. That sentence waters down the sentiment completely. I've rewritten it, and posted my version, which explains the matter in one sentence.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.115.53.html" title="User:216.175.115.53">216.175.115.53</a> 20:35, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is not about sentiment. It's not how you feel about Rose's lyrics, it's what's in them. Please give one, concrete example where he uses something which most people will agree is anti-semitic language in his song <i>lyrics</i>. One example. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 22:20, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is right it isn't about sentmiment, so where rose's language is inappropriate I have pointed it out. Websites are where it is anti semetic. Steve Espinola aka Sojombi Pinola is the one who has attached sentiment and POV to his postings about rose, becoming completely unable to separate a freindship with the man from a NPOV account of the man and his work<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.175.115.53.html" title="User:216.175.115.53">216.175.115.53</a> 17:56, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
