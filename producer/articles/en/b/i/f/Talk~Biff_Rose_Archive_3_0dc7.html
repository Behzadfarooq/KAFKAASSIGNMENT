<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editing in bad faith</span></h2>
<p>While most of us editors have been working towards a consensus on the article, editor <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">user:Jonah Ayers</a> has been sabotaging this process at every step, editing in bad faith and misrepresenting his edits in the edit summary. For example, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biff_Rose&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34154768|this" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biff_Rose&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34154768|this" rel="nofollow">edit</a> he claims to be rearranging the discography, but the actual edit basically substitutes most of the text for his prefered version. In this other innstance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biff_Rose&amp;diff=34063059&amp;oldid=34048758" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biff_Rose&amp;diff=34063059&amp;oldid=34048758" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> he accuses an editor of vandalizing the article by deleting a picture (which he did not) and then claims to re-add the allegedly deleted picture in the edit summary while replacing the entire text of the article. Combined with his malicious, mean-spirited attacks on other editors, his aggressive use of sockpuppets and anonymous IPs, I suggest he recuse himself from this article. I will be happy to recuse myself as well if he agrees to do the same. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 01:44, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

AS for legal threats, I don't believe any were made, i merely pointed out that with the new law, Jonah Ayers could theoretically bring you into a court on charges of that most ludircous law, which states that anyone found to be annoying can be sued. That's that, you can try and manipulate the situation in any fahsion, and true to your nature, you have used your opportunity to be almost agonizingly patronizing, irritatingly smug, and mindbogglingly suspect in your biased approach at using wikipedia. I applaud you for your complete lack of self control and inability to be anything more than annoying- uh oh, I'm going to be taken to court for annoyingly calling someone else annoying. ouch.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think the current version<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biff_Rose&amp;oldid=34696494" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Biff_Rose&amp;oldid=34696494" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, with all the pics on the right looks better/neater than with the staggered pics. I also think that SP's description of his later work (spoken rap elements etc.) is a good way to introduce and contextualize Rose's later work. I think the article looks and reads great in its current form. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 02:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>contextualiziation is POV... let's keep it to the bare minimum. Also, I prefer, obviously, the staggered photos. I think the top one shouldx be the most recent, so am going to refile them that way. Most recent first.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.3.219.html" title="User:216.244.3.219">216.244.3.219</a> 02:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>OK, left the photos, but had to rearrange slightly to make sure table of contents is flush left, to conform to wikipedia standards. Contextualization is not POV, SP's edit simply provide a description of his later material. PLUS, one of the guidelines for writing WP articles is that the subject should be put into context, so rather than POV, contextualization is a necessary goal of any article. I have melded together Sp's edits with those by Jonah and the anonymous user. Finally, I noticed there are no descriptions of his earlier work, just a list of what songs he wrote, etc. Will add this material now. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 15:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jonah, what are you talking about?! SP never implied I said anything, and has certainly not edited in bad faith. Perhaps it would behoove you to work with the other editors rather than spout out accusations at every step. I think progress is being made, so please do not try to sabotage the process. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 03:52, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Marcuse, jonah is referring to the spot just above here where underneath a post that you placed he placed a line that reads, "&#160;::"Judiasm is targeted" is a really problematic phrase." he then responds, and attributes the phrase to you, if you follow jonah's link, it proves that Sojambi left said quote, and then deliberately misleads the page to make it seem as if you posted this remark. The page in question on Rose is already wildly over worded, and needs major surgery.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.3.219.html" title="User:216.244.3.219">216.244.3.219</a> 04:12, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think some text may have been unintentionally deleted when editors were both writing at once. This entire discussion is unnecessary. Let's move on. Can we please stop moving between such different versions? Can we agree on the discography? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>clearly that isn't the case the proof points to the fact that Sojambi posted the line, and the nresponded to Marcuse, as if Marcuse wrote it. if no action is taken I will seek a new voice, a new admin to respond, because there have been numerous times when my IP has been blocked at will's whim, for no violations, but for "supposed" vandalism. This new Will Beback needs to address the issue here or his desire to be more of a mediator will be struck down. This is clearly a case of VANDALISM<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.3.219.html" title="User:216.244.3.219">216.244.3.219</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Look Jonah and anon. editor, Thank you for looking after my interests here, but I never interpreted SP's remark as him attributing a comment to me. I do not consider his edit vandalism (see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>) and neither does anybody else. Vandalism is however what the anonymous editor has been doing to the article by repeatedly destroying other editors changes, deleting photos from the article and generally disrupting any attempts toward reaching a consensus. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 18:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a name="Discography" id="Discography"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
<p>We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Officially Released</li>
<li>Self Released</li>
<li>Singles</li>
<li>Out of Print Compilations</li>
<li>In Print Compilations</li>
</ul>
<p>Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:31, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue). Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 14:45, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do wonder at the designations of "self-released" vs. "officially released." At what point does one become the other? "Bone Again" and "Elizabethan Period" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine. "Roast Beef" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold. "Hamburger Blues" was an "official" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases. "Uncle Jesus" was a major label album that is harder to find than "Roast Beef." "The Pickwick album was an "offical" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases. The whole issue of "in print" vs. "out of print" is a bit difficult to assess as well. If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still "in print"?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort. If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made. For example, see <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Ra_2947.html#Partial_Discography" title="Sun Ra">Sun_Ra</a>. A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones. It is a vague and misleading designation. Why not go for straight chronology?</dd>

<p>The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle.

<li>Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the "released on cdr" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr?

Plus, anyone paying such sums would have to reveal their core identity, which may mean they would have to find it. All interested parties would also have to stop calling me at 1:40 am, and would certainly have to stop leaving death threats for the subject of the article (had they ever started such practices, of course).

<p>If this guy puts a line in aboiut every review he digs up about rose, then we're sort of magnifiying the importance of Rose. Better to link it, and leave the piece as it is. If Sojambi had his way the article would be a 5 stars out of 5 review praising rose and ignoring any of the more mercurial aspects of his life. i think it's best to als okeep in mind that Rose's Academy Award winning former songwriting partner <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Williams_4fc0.html" title="Paul Williams">Paul Williams</a> has a less actual sentences written about him in his entry, it's longer than the wki entry for one of rolling stone's 100 greatest guitar players of all time, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Kramer_27af.html" title="Wayne Kramer">Wayne Kramer</a>, and is a bigger entry than one of the record labels he recorded for, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddah_Records_b1f3.html" title="Buddah Records">Buddah Records</a>. By allowing his entry to gain such size and space we're denigrating these other extremely important people and things... rose has a value, it's just not on the par of these others, and so curtailing the article to the size of his influence and the scope of his work seems to be the best way to handle this, instead of heaping lavish praise on the man, let's write a succinct and honest article.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 01:24, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While most of us editors have been working towards a consensus on the article, editor <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">user:Jonah Ayers</a> has been sabotaging this process at every step, editing in bad faith and misrepresenting his edits in the edit summary.

<p>contextualiziation is POV... let's keep it to the bare minimum. Also, I prefer, obviously, the staggered photos. I think the top one shouldx be the most recent, so am going to refile them that way. Most recent first.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.3.219.html" title="User:216.244.3.219">216.244.3.219</a> 02:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>OK, left the photos, but had to rearrange slightly to make sure table of contents is flush left, to conform to wikipedia standards. Contextualization is not POV, SP's edit simply provide a description of his later material. PLUS, one of the guidelines for writing WP articles is that the subject should be put into context, so rather than POV, contextualization is a necessary goal of any article. I have melded together Sp's edits with those by Jonah and the anonymous user. Finally, I noticed there are no descriptions of his earlier work, just a list of what songs he wrote, etc. Will add this material now. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 15:34, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jonah, what are you talking about?! SP never implied I said anything, and has certainly not edited in bad faith.

<p>Marcuse, jonah is referring to the spot just above here where underneath a post that you placed he placed a line that reads, "&#160;::"Judiasm is targeted" is a really problematic phrase." he then responds, and attributes the phrase to you, if you follow jonah's link, it proves that Sojambi left said quote, and then deliberately misleads the page to make it seem as if you posted this remark. The page in question on Rose is already wildly over worded, and needs major surgery.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.3.219.html" title="User:216.244.3.219">216.244.3.219</a> 04:12, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>clearly that isn't the case the proof points to the fact that Sojambi posted the line, and the nresponded to Marcuse, as if Marcuse wrote it. if no action is taken I will seek a new voice, a new admin to respond, because there have been numerous times when my IP has been blocked at will's whim, for no violations, but for "supposed" vandalism.

<li>Look Jonah and anon. editor, Thank you for looking after my interests here, but I never interpreted SP's remark as him attributing a comment to me. I do not consider his edit vandalism (see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>) and neither does anybody else.

<p>What the anonymous user/Jonah is doing is not disagreeing. You are deleting large part of an article and calling this a difference of opinion. What you are doing is vandalism through and through. Perhaps we can get a member of the Arbitration Committee to mediate? I somehow don't think that they would sympathize with your side of things. My offer still stands, if you recuse yourself (including ALL your sockpuppets and IPs) from this article so will I. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcuse_9665.html" title="User:Marcuse">Marcuse</a> 04:28, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the record, my silence can be bought, but only for three years of my salary up front. And then I'd probably still find sneaky ways around it, like getting friends or <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indentured_servants.html" title="Indentured servants">indentured servants</a> to do my bidding, or at least vote their conscience around here....which would make it a not very good deal, I suppose. Plus, anyone paying such sums would have to reveal their core identity, which may mean they would have to find it. All interested parties would also have to stop calling me at 1:40 am, and would certainly have to stop leaving death threats for the subject of the article (had they ever started such practices, of course).

<dd>Contrary to the note left on <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a>'s page, Rose was not "banned from playing the Echo." He did, however, cancel a recently scheduled appearance in LA....a scheduled appearance that one of the "IP editors" had been writing to Biff about in a very threatening manner. I believe Rose cancelled for other reasons, but it's worth noting that this drama extends beyond this bio.</dd>

<p>Yeah, but there is no career, jsut like there really isn't a tv writing career, he did both things for a half an hour, and Christgau reports he found him funny, that doesn't give him a comedy career.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 20:01, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Christgau refers to him as a comedian. Several of his albums are spoken-word comedy albums. "Half-Live At The Bitter End" and "Thee Messiah Album" come to mind. They are dominated by stand-up routines with a live audience. --<a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 21:50, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If this guy puts a line in aboiut every review he digs up about rose, then we're sort of magnifiying the importance of Rose. Better to link it, and leave the piece as it is. If Sojambi had his way the article would be a 5 stars out of 5 review praising rose and ignoring any of the more mercurial aspects of his life. i think it's best to als okeep in mind that Rose's Academy Award winning former songwriting partner <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Williams_4fc0.html" title="Paul Williams">Paul Williams</a> has a less actual sentences written about him in his entry, it's longer than the wki entry for one of rolling stone's 100 greatest guitar players of all time, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Kramer_27af.html" title="Wayne Kramer">Wayne Kramer</a>, and is a bigger entry than one of the record labels he recorded for, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddah_Records_b1f3.html" title="Buddah Records">Buddah Records</a>. By allowing his entry to gain such size and space we're denigrating these other extremely important people and things... rose has a value, it's just not on the par of these others, and so curtailing the article to the size of his influence and the scope of his work seems to be the best way to handle this, instead of heaping lavish praise on the man, let's write a succinct and honest article.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonah_Ayers_2cd3.html" title="User:Jonah Ayers">Jonah Ayers</a> 01:24, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a starvation mentality. The denigration is in your own head. Not all things good are big, not all things good are small. This article is the size it is because that is the length of the information at present. There's plenty of other information that should be added once citations can be found. Who's to say who's more "important" than who else? You are important, too, Jonah, even though you are not even semi-famous. And me too! We are all special.
