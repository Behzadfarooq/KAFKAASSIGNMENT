<p>I'm having trouble finding anything on the web for this besides Biffeche's own site. The whole thing's odd enough that I'm very uncomfortable not having more references on this--a kingdom run by an American in Senegal that co-rules a kingdom in Ghana? I can't find it referred to in Academic Search Premier or JSTOR either; unless somebody can post a news story or related item about this soon, I'm worried Wiki may be perpetuating someone's hoax here.

<p>It seems to me that a lot of this article is probably correct. Where it starts to become improbable is in the appropriation of the genuine historical kingdom by a modern micronation of dubious provenance. So mostly I think the article needs to be re-written to keep what's real and delete what's not. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 12:29, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Even though you've removed the most obvious dubious content, most of what remains still was present in the original edit - the same edit that included the bit about the American being proclaimed king. I don't see how we can destruct this article into anything proper. It needs to be constructed anew based on credible sources. If that's not possible, then it's much better to have no article. <i><b>Ã</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 16:47, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dlyons, you're rapidly becoming my new wikihero for your stellar research here (and double kudos for the holiday overtime). Over the next couple of days let's rework this with your references point-by-point--I feel we need to be extra careful with this one--and then ask folks to change their vote on the AfD. The last thing I think we need to reword here is the idea of the "Kingdom of Biffeche"; it still looks to me as if the island is named Biffeche and once held a loosely organized polity named Gangueul, under the Waalo--is this your understanding, too? So far as I can tell you've confirmed everything else that remains. Again--you rock. --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 23:55, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

A number of Senegal tourism websites mention Savoigne: such as <a href="http://www.senegalaisement.com/senegal/region_du_fleuve.html" class="external text" title="http://www.senegalaisement.com/senegal/region_du_fleuve.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> - no reference to any kingdom - and <a href="http://www.nouvelles-frontieres.fr/nf?mas=SEARCHPACKAGE&amp;srv=008&amp;codeCanalCourant=09&amp;countryId=572&amp;idProduct=23136" class="external text" title="http://www.nouvelles-frontieres.fr/nf?mas=SEARCHPACKAGE&amp;srv=008&amp;codeCanalCourant=09&amp;countryId=572&amp;idProduct=23136" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which mentions "Savoigne (le royaume de BifÃ¨che)".</p>

<p>I believe both of the satellite images linked are way off, though I'm not comfortable enough with the geography to fix them.

Things have definitely changed since the antique maps were drawn, but it seems to me that the island is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=16.214675,-16.305084&amp;spn=.363918,.482712&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=16.214675,-16.305084&amp;spn=.363918,.482712&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">somewhere here</a>, but not easily distinguishable because the water to its east is not visible.

<p>The modern micronation of Biffeche absolutely does exist. A close relative of mine spent several months there (he is a friend of King Ronald) working. I can produce photographs if desired. It is indeed a strangely set up place, with the American king and all, but that's all the more reason to include information about it here. Barring objection, I'm going to re-add the removed information about modern Biffeche (without removing the article's current content of course), although I concede that I cannot provide any websites that prove its existence. Like I said, however, I do have photographs of the grave/monument to King Edward, as well as other Biffeche scenes if there is still skepticism. As for the anthem, it does indeed exist, although I am unsure as to whether it is actually ever played in Biffeche, so I won't resurrect that article. <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 07:50, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Currently the only published source for the existence of this micronation is its own website. See <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> on the point of personal websites as primary sources: "we should proceed with great caution and should avoid relying on information from the website as a sole source.

<dd>OK, fair point. This is a rather interesting situation...the fact that most interest in the place would be merely trivial makes it pretty unlikely that a whole lot of info about it would be available anywhere, which is apparently the case. It just seems against the spirit of Wikipedia for information provable to be true to be removed. Still, I suppose there's nothing to be done about it, except hope they strike oil and CNN covers it. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 23:24, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>It just seems against the spirit of Wikipedia for information provable to be true to be removed'.</i></dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what you mean. Everyone else here has been working exactly by the spirit of Wikipedia, which is that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability, not truth</a> is the criterion. Because the standard fact-checking procedures used by other publications can't be relied on (anyone here can claim what they like) only material in reputable publications is treated as a valid source. There are hints that could be traced. <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/history.htm" rel="nofollow">www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/history.htm</a> says of King Edward I that "Esquire magazine had an article on his Kingdom". So find it.</dd>
<dd>Off the record, I think it's a very interesting situation. There's plenty of collateral information if we get into original research. We can look up Ronald Reisinger's list of honours ("Baron of Culbin, Garlies, Carstairs and the territorial earldom of Crawfurd-Lindsay and Laird of Ascog") <a href="http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/Contents/book/UK/FHP/Peerage/fhp-INNERYNE.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/Contents/book/UK/FHP/Peerage/fhp-INNERYNE.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and conclude that they're defunct titles for crappy bits of Scotland that he bought for cash. You can check out the aristocrats of Biffeche and find that, say, "The Ladies Ann and Ellen Fusz, who have long been staunch financial supporters of the Kingdom" are a couple of retired teachers in the St Louis Opera Guild, St Louis, Missouri. And so on.</dd>
<dd>But as you say, until they strike oil and CNN covers it, this is all by-the-by. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 01:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't quite mean that. I just meant that it seems odd that verifiably true information (albeit not verifiable within the Wikipedia guidelines) would be removed from an article. Like I said though, I recognize that its removal was completely in keeping with Wikipedia guidelines.</dd>
<dd>And regarding the king, I'm not entirely sure how seriously he takes all this, but the people of Biffeche do recognize him as their king (for the sake of money no doubt). -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 02:20, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The story on the "Befeche website" is that the king of Befeche (an African, of an ancient dynasty) was childless and willed his kingdom to an American because the American was a benefactor financially and in other ways, and that the people of this little tribe or band of people consequently regard him as their king, and lastly that he keeps a low profile (no interviews, no granting of "titles" to jokers who pay for it, no nothing). The web site also says Befeche is "a part of the Republic of Senegal" and "non-secessionist", i.e. it doesn't claim to be independent. Since there are lots of African republics that recognize traditional local "kings" and "kingdoms" within their territories, the story isn't especially implausible or unlikely. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.93.65.103 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.93.65.103_64c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.93.65.103">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I can certainly confirm that it's not a hoax, and have plenty of photographic evidence that could prove it - but no credible sources.

<p>The strong effort to use edits to extinguish every reference in wikipedia to the kingdom of biffÃ¨che (describing it only as "a former island", what ever that means!) may have had a political motivation. (Look at the pattern of edits by antiking elements from France.) They called the biffÃ¨che kingdom "hoax" and "spam" over and over again in edits which was evidently improper and false and unfair, even if the kingdom's original article was in fact quite poorly documented. Poorly documented (lack of references) does not equal "spam" or "hoax". <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> disguised his campaign by adding a lot of real, some relevant, scholarly references. That is good, but a thin disguise.</p>
<p>View here a local tour company of SÃ©nÃ©gal that includes regular travel-tours of the kingdom of biffÃ¨che right now (February 2007):</p>

<p>The text says:</p>
<p>"4Ã¨me jour&#160;: Atelier de brousse et parc national. AprÃ¨s le rÃ©veil dans le village et le petit dÃ©jeuner dÃ©part vers Savoigne (le royaume de bifÃ¨che), pour la visite de lâatelier de brousse de terre cuite du pÃ¨re italien Emmanuel de la paroisse Saint Blaise de Savoigne. RÃ©gion peuplÃ©e de sÃ©rÃ©re catholique. Retour au Ranch de Bango pour le dÃ©jeuner."</p>
<p>which includes, in English: "depart for Savoigne (the Kingdom of BiffÃ¨che)..."</p>
<p>The campaigns of <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> and <a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> against biffÃ¨che appear like a few turks destroying information on armenia, or other similarly biased distortions and painstakingly thorough wikipedia destructions. Even the Savoigne edits censored out all reference to the kingdom, which make Savoigne interesting.</p>
<p>To deny the kingdom history was wrong. There is a map in a book published in 1728, shown at:</p>
<p><a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103380p/f166.table" class="external free" title="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103380p/f166.table" rel="nofollow">http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103380p/f166.table</a></p>
<p>On that map the claimed old capital of biffeche, Maka, is there.(<a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/griotsong.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/griotsong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/griotsong.htm</a> says "For a while [a period of time], our kings lived at Maka. When they were called âBarak Biffecheâ. Maka was our capital, then. But now it has fallen away. And MboubÃ¨ne is our capital, now.") One sees clearly in the lower-centre of the old map: "Maca, residence du petit Braque" of Biffeche, which means "Maca, residence of the little king" (braque or barak) in English. Voila! The actual capital of Biffeche is also there at the place called "Emboulan" on the map which was in the wikepedia article "<a href="../../../m/b/o/Mboub%C3%A8ne.html" title="MboubÃ¨ne">MboubÃ¨ne</a>" evidently also raided by the politico-vandals if you look at the old antikingdom edits. We also see that "Bequio" ("Hoval" also in Wikipedia as "Bethio") is shown as a PART of BiffÃ¨che in 1728, and Bequio only had a seigneur (lord) but not its own braque (king) as biffÃ¨che has.</p>
<p>On page 247 the "little king" of biffeche is described to have absolute power within his realm: <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103380p.table" class="external free" title="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103380p.table" rel="nofollow">http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103380p.table</a></p>
<p>Both these present-day and ancient references showed in the very first two pages of Google results using "bifÃ¨che" in 2 minutes and I have not even looked at the rest. So the antibifÃ¨che campaign does not look to have been very sincere. (Note mutual public praises of the raiders: '"Dlyons, you're rapidly becoming my new wikihero for your stellar research here..." Dvyost') This manipulation was not research.</p>
<p>NOTE: <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> put only the censored no-kingdom "former island" on the French Wikipedia and he wrote it himself.

<p>Aha, now I see that an old chart that <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> himself added in his scholarship (his 3rd old chart) shows something else: see <a href="http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=IFN-7759788&amp;M=notice&amp;Y=ImagesFixes" class="external free" title="http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=IFN-7759788&amp;M=notice&amp;Y=ImagesFixes" rel="nofollow">http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=IFN-7759788&amp;M=notice&amp;Y=ImagesFixes</a> and click on the "positive-sign" for the enlargement. There, after enlargement, you will see in very small writing, "Petit Brac" next to a dot, but see that the dot is not at Maca as before but is exactly at the location of Emboulan (or <a href="../../../m/b/o/MBoubene_16e1.html" title="MBoubene">MBoubene</a> ) claimed by the <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/griotsong.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/griotsong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/griotsong.htm</a> to be the capital of the kingdom or location of the king (brac, brak ou braque).

<dd>So correct it! As far as I can see, nobody here has any issue with reliably-sourced <i>historical</i> material on Biffeche/BifÃ¨che. The 1728 Labat book looks a very good source, and should be incorporated. It is just the modern Kingdom of Biffeche that has insufficient documentation. <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net" class="external text" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net" rel="nofollow">www.kingdomofbiffeche.net</a>, as a self-published website with no independent verification, isn't up to the standards required by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

<dd>You suggest to "correct it" myself? I tried such a thing before within other controverted subjects.

One may argue for weeks, and even prevail obviously on every issue, then a person of "wikipedia adminstrator level X" settles the issue as he wishes. I will prefer to allow someone with higher "wikipedia power" than myself to correct the french censorships against the kingdom (on both french and english languages wikipedias). <a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumuli_20c4.html" title="User:Tumuli">Tumuli</a> 01:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another peculiarity of the "French edits" is that they state that "Biffeche" is "the early name of a medium-sized island". Why would anything in Wikipedia be so referenced, by its early or former name? In fact it isn't a mere "early" name at all, it's current, and Biffeche isn't an "island" -- and it isn't even "in" Senegal, because at least two Biffeche villages due north of the Saint-Louis, Senegal Airport are in an in Mauritania, not in Senegal. Google Earth shows them (one is called Dios or Dyoos) as being on some wet-season islands (islands only when surrounded by flooded areas in the rainy season), but they are definitely on the Mauritania side of the official border with Senegal, being on the west side of the main channel of the Senegal River. A large-scale map of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_West_Africa_a6a0.html" title="French West Africa">French West Africa</a> drafted by the US Army in the 1940s for the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, based on a French map of the 1920s, shows "B I F F E C H E" as a large land area including not only the two large (and several small) "islands" but also an area of mainland Senegal southeast of the Marigot de Lampsar and across the main highway to Rosso. Less than half is the isle(s) in the 1700s maps linked-to above (where the "Isle de Biffeche" is marked as including several islands, including the entire <a href="../../../d/j/o/Djoudj_National_Bird_Sanctuary_241d.html" title="Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary">Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary</a> area). Biffeche is an area that includes a big area of mainland on the Senegal side, some intermittently flooded mainland on the Mauritania side, and Several riverine "islands" large and small, on both sides. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoppityChop_4c2a.html" title="User:ChoppityChop">ChoppityChop</a> 07:14, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One notes that the isle d'ntieng (or tieng or tiene), for example, is one, which is, on the kingdom sites, shown as part of biffÃ¨che in addition.

Using "Google Earth" myself, which has excellent coverage of there, I find no evident villages of houses on isle de tiene. What was his majestÃ© doing there, one wonders.

<dd>A problem with correlating maps is that terrain in river delta territory is very changeable. The shape of islands in the 1700s may well be rather different from the present day.

<dd>Wait----since all references to the kingdom are already assiduously removed by our french friends, there is nothing about it remaining in the main article now to "substantiate". Not so? You do not need to tell me to "be cautious" or to "substantiate" every remark and webquote I make in a discussion page. But now, since you mentioned it, these few following facts, which were REMOVED from the main page, are indeed already independently substantiated now: 1. It is now called "royaume de biffÃ¨che" locally (my tourism agency citation). 2. The american king Edward was elected king of biffÃ¨che in 1963 (the USA post-dispatch newspaper article about him, cited above). 3. The kingdom webpage claims about <a href="../../../m/b/o/Mboub%C3%A8ne.html" title="MboubÃ¨ne">MboubÃ¨ne</a> being the new capital after <a href="../../../m/a/k/Maka.html" title="Maka">Maka</a> are vindicated (by my chart discoveries above). 4. The kingdom area is not a "former island" after all but a larger area including shore land in two countries, called BIFFECHE. (US/french army map reference just above, but needs date and title) I think it was quite a grave error of the kingdom staff to ignore everything that was done to them on wikipedia, for almost two years so far, because a lot of people will make a quick negative jugement based only on wikipedia.<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumuli_20c4.html" title="User:Tumuli">Tumuli</a> 11:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Let me add that your own citation and quote from Lonely Planet listing the current "Kingdom of Biffeche" in the class with <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somaliland.html" title="Somaliland">Somaliland</a> suggests that it cannot be mere fiction.<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumuli_20c4.html" title="User:Tumuli">Tumuli</a> 11:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that there's such an entity, and it should be mentioned. But verification of the basic existence doesn't mean we buy into everything that is stated on www.kingdomofbiffeche.net. A trivial example of dubious information there: it's the sole source for the existence of the claimed "Biffeche Dragon, the second largest lizard in the world". <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 12:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is leaving out the word "reputedly" in the original: <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>&#160;: "Biffeche is home to the Biffeche Dragon, reputedly the second-largest lizard in the world" (reputedly where?) and a discussion on the FAQ <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/faq.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net/faq.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> openly mentions a controversy whether it even exisits at all as a separate species from the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile_monitor.html" title="Nile monitor">Nile monitor</a>. Either way, such kind of side-issue-question would appear utterly irrelevant to the removal of all mention of the kingdom from wikipedia.<a href="../../../t/u/m/User%7ETumuli_20c4.html" title="User:Tumuli">Tumuli</a> 14:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is no mention of the (fabricated) 21st century Biffeche made in this article? The author of the site <a href="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kingdomofbiffeche.net" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> has obviously gone to some length to promote his fantasy, and I believe it does deserve some mention. I know personally the man and story behind the 'modern Biffeche,' in that it is a complete fabrication and that the site is being used as an advertisment for selling royal titles (reading between the lines on the FAQ page, it doesn't take long to figure that one out). Perhaps with some clever sourcing and cross-referencing this fraudulent activity can be brought to rest, courtesy of Wikipedia editors? 24.94.113.184 18:53, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I largely agree with you. But, again, the problem is the complete lack of reliable third-party sources per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Personal knowledge falls foul of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>, as does putting together all the bits and pieces and deducing. All we've got is the Kingdom of Biffeche site, which because of its exceptional claims really can't be used as a source without serious substantion (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Exceptional_claims_require_exceptional_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Exceptional claims require exceptional sources</a>). We've got the snippet about Edward Schaefer, and the non-fact that the Lonely Planet <i>Micronations</i> book says it isn't going to mention it. Can anyone find anything - newspaper, magazine, whatever - reporting in detail the current situation? You'd think such a good human interest story would be worth reporting. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 19:23, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Forgive my ignorance, but what does the "snippet about Edward Schaefer" concern? 24.94.113.184 19:59, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I meant Schafer - the section from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch obit quoted above. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 20:01, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
