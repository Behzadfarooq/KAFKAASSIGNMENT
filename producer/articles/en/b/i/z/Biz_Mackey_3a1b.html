<p>Born in <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Pass%2C_Texas_41de.html" title="Eagle Pass, Texas">Eagle Pass, Texas</a>, Mackey began playing baseball with his brothers Ray and Ernest on the Luling Oilers, a Prairie League team, in 1916 in his hometown of <a href="../../../l/u/l/Luling%2C_Texas_2f50.html" title="Luling, Texas">Luling</a>. He joined the professional San Antonio Black Aces two years later. When the team folded in 1920, his contract was sold to the Indianapolis ABC's in time for the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_National_League_%28the_first%29_0d6c.html" title="Negro National League (the first)">Negro National League</a>'s first season. After three years under manager <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._I._Taylor_5087.html" title="C. I. Taylor">C. I. Taylor</a>, in which he hit .315, .317 and .344, he was picked up by Hilldale when the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Colored_League_099e.html" title="Eastern Colored League">Eastern Colored League</a> was organized in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923_in_baseball.html" title="1923 in baseball">1923</a>.</p>
<p>In his first season with Hilldale, he batted .423, winning the ECL batting title and pacing the team to the pennant, and followed with eight consecutive seasons batting .308 or better. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_in_baseball.html" title="1924 in baseball">1924</a>, he finished third in the batting race as Hilldale repeated as champions, but lost to the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Monarchs_fe34.html" title="Kansas City Monarchs">Kansas City Monarchs</a> 5 games to 4 in the first <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_League_World_Series_aa7e.html" title="Negro League World Series">Negro League World Series</a> with Mackey playing <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_baseman.html" title="Third baseman">third base</a>. At first platooning behind the plate with the aging <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Santop_67e5.html" title="Louis Santop">Louis Santop</a>, while also sharing time at <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortstop.html" title="Shortstop">shortstop</a> with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_Lloyd_8ec6.html" title="John Henry Lloyd">Pop Lloyd</a>, he took over the full-time catching job in 1925. In that year's Negro League World Series, Mackey helped Hilldale to the title over the Monarchs with a .360 average. He drove in the lead run in the 11th inning of the first game, which Hilldale won in 12 innings; after scoring the winning run in a 2-1 victory in Game 5, his three hits in the deciding Game 6 clinched the title.</p>
<p>His barnstorming tours included a highly successful trip to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_baseball.html" title="Japanese baseball">Japan</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927_in_baseball.html" title="1927 in baseball">1927</a>, during which he became the first player to hit a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> out of <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiji-Jingu_Stadium_a5bb.html" title="Meiji-Jingu Stadium">Meiji Shrine Stadium</a>, doing so in three straight games. He was particularly well received on the tour and made later trips to Japan in 1934 and 1935. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931_in_baseball.html" title="1931 in baseball">1931</a>, he won his second batting title with a .359 average, as Hilldale also finished with the best record among eastern teams.</p>
<p>In voting for the first <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_f162.html" title="Negro League Baseball All-Star Game">Negro League All-Star Game</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933_in_baseball.html" title="1933 in baseball">1933</a>, he was selected at catcher over the young <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Gibson_1443.html" title="Josh Gibson">Josh Gibson</a>, batting <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28baseball%29.html" title="Batting order (baseball)">cleanup</a>. He would play in three more All-Star Games by 1938. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934_in_baseball.html" title="1934 in baseball">1934</a>, he batted only .299, as the Philadelphia Stars' won the NNL second-half pennant, but had a good postseason, batting .368 and driving in the first run of a 2-0 victory in Game 7 to defeat the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_American_Giants_3ac5.html" title="Chicago American Giants">Chicago American Giants</a> 4 games to 3.</p>
<p>By 1937, he was managing the Baltimore Elite Giants, where he began mentoring 15-year-old <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Campanella_0d8d.html" title="Roy Campanella">Roy Campanella</a> in the fine points of catching. Campanella later recalled:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In my opinion, Biz Mackey was the master of defense of all catchers. When I was a kid in Philadelphia, I saw both Mackey and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Cochrane_04f8.html" title="Mickey Cochrane">Mickey Cochrane</a> in their primes, but for real catching skills, I don't think Cochrane was the master of defense that Mackey was. When I went under his direction in Baltimore, I was 15 years old. I gathered quite a bit from Mackey, watching how he did things, how he blocked low pitches, how he shifted his feet for an outside pitch, how he threw with a short, quick, accurate throw without drawing back. I got all this from Mackey at a young age.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Mackey joined the Newark Eagles in 1939, replacing <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Lundy_%28baseball_player%29_4055.html" title="Dick Lundy (baseball player)">Dick Lundy</a> as manager a year later, and continued his work with young players such as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Irvin_d1e1.html" title="Monte Irvin">Monte Irvin</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Doby_4b43.html" title="Larry Doby">Larry Doby</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Newcombe_45ab.html" title="Don Newcombe">Don Newcombe</a>. When Doby joined the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947_in_baseball.html" title="1947 in baseball">1947</a>, it was Mackey who recommended moving him from <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_baseman.html" title="Second baseman">second base</a> to <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_fielder.html" title="Center fielder">center field</a>.</p>
<p>Personality conflicts with Newark owner <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effa_Manley_04e4.html" title="Effa Manley">Effa Manley</a>, which were common-place under her regime, led to Mackey's departure from play after the 1941 season, but he returned to the field in 1945, and managed the team in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_in_baseball.html" title="1946 in baseball">1946</a> as the Eagles won the Negro League World Series 4 games to 3, again over the Monarchs, who featured pitcher <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satchel_Paige_2d9f.html" title="Satchel Paige">Satchel Paige</a>. Even in his 40s, Mackey was still an effective player – he batted .307 in 1945, and appeared in the 1947 All-Star Game at age 50. When the Eagles moved to <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a> in 1950, he retired from baseball following the season.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, he moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> and began working as a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forklift.html" title="Forklift">forklift</a> operator. In 1952, he was selected by a <i><a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Courier_4c02.html" title="Pittsburgh Courier">Pittsburgh Courier</a></i> poll as the Negro Leagues' greatest catcher, ahead of Josh Gibson. Mackey received more attention on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_baseball.html" title="1959 in baseball">1959</a> when Campanella was honored at the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum_f2f1.html" title="Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a> following his paralysis from a car accident. Mackey was introduced to the crowd of over 93,000 for an exhibition game between the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Dodgers</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>.</p>
<p>Mackey lived quietly until his death in Los Angeles at age 68. He was buried in that city's <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evergreen_Cemetery_%28Los_Angeles%2C_California%29_0b5e.html" title="Evergreen Cemetery (Los Angeles, California)">Evergreen Cemetery</a> <a href="http://www.thedeadballera.com/GravePhotos/MackeyBizsGrave.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thedeadballera.com/GravePhotos/MackeyBizsGrave.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Through the 1990s, reference sources widely reported his death as having occurred in 1959; this seems to have resulted from Campanella's recollection in John B. Holway's 1988 book <i>Blackball Stars</i> that Mackey "passed away right after" the Coliseum event, an apparent error that Campanella repeated in other interviews.</p>
<p>Mackey was elected to the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting%2C_2006_b83c.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>Mackey's grandson <a href="../../../r/i/l/Riley_Odoms_2512.html" title="Riley Odoms">Riley Odoms</a> played 14 seasons for the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">NFL</a>'s <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>.</p>
