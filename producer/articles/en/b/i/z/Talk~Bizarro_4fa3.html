<p>The comic strip by Piraro is definitively more wide spread and probably more well known than this guy. That article is a stub, is that the reason it isn't placed here instead?</p>
<p><br />
I think the popularity depends on who you ask. I'm an avid reader of the comic strip, so it's more popular to me, but I'll bet my comic-loving brothers-in-law would immediately think of the anti-hero. Would someone care to supplement this article with a short discussion of the Bizarro way of talking ("This am great!")? I know it's unique, but I'm not knowledgeable enough about the subject to write about it... --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyRush_795a.html" title="User:TobyRush">TobyRush</a> 15:38, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bizarro (the DC character) is a long-standing and well-known character. I'd heard and read of Bizarro long before I knew of Dan Piraro's strip. Additionally, the character has some pop culture references (see the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealab_2021.html" title="Sealab 2021">Sealab 2021</a> parody, specifically), and has been the impetus for getting the word into the English language as a modifier for bizarre (as someone once said, "it's no longer bizare, more bizarre, most bizarre; it's bizarre, bizarro, mondo bizarro." Lastly, Piraro got the name of his comic from the character, or the word (which comes from the character), so if that doesn't qualify Bizarro for occupying the "prime real estate", I can't think of a better reason.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 18:39, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/z/Talk%7EBizarro_4fa3.html" title="Edit section: Linguistics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Linguistics</span></h2>
<p>Can someone shed some light on Bizarro's linguistics? In some portrayals, he merely has a very poor grasp of English. In others, he speaks the opposite of what he means. In the recent Superman/Batman crossover, it seems that he negates every word in a sentence, rendering it almost unreadable. For example, it seems that lines like "You am never my worst enemy" translates to "You are always my best friend". Has this changed in other ways over Bizarro's many incarnations? --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 18:35, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He doesn't seem to have consistent linguistics, I guess that's part of what makes him Bizzaro. Sometimes his linguistics are correct if crude, and his reasoning is mangled, such as breaking through the wall because it would be rude to knock. Sometimes his linguistics are both crude and wrong, but is reasoning is relatively correct.--66.162.55.2 21:01, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>IMO Bizzaro is attempting to communicate more clearly (sometimes) by doing/speaking the opposite of what "he believes" is right; in other words, a double negative. To put it another way, imagine if you were placed in a world where everyone and everything was its opposite; in order to communicate with people, you might do the opposite of what you would normally do in order to get your point across. To you, this would appear to be the opposite of what you intend, but to everyone else, it would appear normal and natural. Therefore, if Bizzaro does or says something that appears to be "normal" or "natural", to Bizzaro it would actually seem to be the opposite of what he intends, but necessary in order to get his point across. IMO, Bizzaro's speech and actions are sort of like someone attempting to speak a foreign language which they have very little grasp of; sometimes the words come through clearly and make sense, other times it is just gibberish. This is what makes Bizzaro so difficult for the other DC Comics characters (and the reader) to understand; did Bizzaro mean the opposite of what he just said, or did he actually mean what he said?</p>

<p><i>Despite the generally maintained fact that Superman and Lois Lane would be unable to have children, Bizarro and Bizarro Lois Lane had children on the Bizarro World.</i></p>
<p>I really don't believe this is at all the case. The idea of children is in fact a big question for the comic, in much the same way as "Will Lois ever find out?". In certain stories, pregnancy has been considered dangerous for Lois, but by and far, there are many stories where this is not the case. ie - Son of Superman, among many others. I think the first part should be omitted, and if the line is not intrinsic to the incarnations of Bizarro World, removed altogether. -- <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroken_Arms_Gordon_cc1f.html" title="User:Broken Arms Gordon">Broken Arms Gordon</a> 15:56, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I havent read Superman since Zero hour, but I remember that during the first year (real time) after the Zero Hour series another bizarro was created.</p>
<p>I dont recall exactly all details, but it was created by Lex Luthor (III) (or maybe II and was released as a desperate act when his cloned body was about to die, I'm not sure) and he was exactly like Superman when "born". Then his appearance changes to the usual angular-white and his suit inexplicably changes to a more purpleish blue. The 'S' reminds straight.</p>
<p>This Bizarro acts pretty much like Bizarro #1, but has some of Superman's memories, and kidnaps Lois, and fights Superman upset, if I remember correctly, because he tries to undo his mistakes. They also meet with Superman's blind friend.. her, who knows he's Clark, not sure of the name.. anyways, she gets her view back because this Bizzarro's skin had some weird healing properties, and they use them for something, or try, or something.</p>
<p>As you see there's a lot of "I think" "I dont remember" and "something"s in my head, thats why I don't fill it in myself.. so, that.. anyone with the magazines at hand could fill that up--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrymology_ec0a.html" title="User:Lacrymology">Lacrymology</a> 05:06, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll take a look at some of my issues the next time I get a chance, but I have a feeling it's just a re-hashing of an already-printed storyline, which happened numerously during Zero Hour.

<dd>In spanish there was an.. edition? called "The Man Of Steel" (El Hombre de Acero) or something like that where the four monthly Superman magazines (Superman, The Man of Steel, Superman in Action Comics and.. dont know.. the man of tomorrow?) where printed together. Its a 12 issue (12x4 that is. One year of publications) series that start two or three months (real timeline, as in opossed to in-comic-time) before Lobo (a woosy pussy Lobo that made me very sad, I might add) came back looking for revenge, and where Superman finds himself getting stronger and stronger until he becomes a huge mass of muscle, very funny looking. Afterwards he finds some cure for this (in the meanwhile he travels the universe because he can't control his strenght and thinks he's a threat to earth, his wife and all that crap) and comes back. The clones are dying of some illness that ends up killing Lex Luthor II (the red-headed supergirl's boyfriend one) blah blah blah. I am just hoping that some background will help with the search =) --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrymology_ec0a.html" title="User:Lacrymology">Lacrymology</a> 02:02, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, until only a few years ago, the four Superman titles (Man of Steel, Action Comics, Adventures of Superman, and Superman) ran their stories across each, so that each week you got a new piece of the story. Man of Tomorrow was a sort of annual title that didn't run for as long. Anyway, I remember that story. It's after Superman comes back to life, and Lobo shows up and of course they fight. They take the battle into orbit, and Superman discovers that he no longer has to breathe in space and that he's stronger than before he died and able to effortlessly throw an orbiting spaceship. He travels through space for a while, getting stronger and stronger, and when he gets back to Earth, he's too massive to control himself. At this point, they use the Parasite to siphon off the extra energy. This is all pre-Zero Hour. I've been busy and keep forgetting to review my issues, but I honestly don't remember another Bizarro. -- <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroken_Arms_Gordon_cc1f.html" title="User:Broken Arms Gordon">Broken Arms Gordon</a> 15:14, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, yeah. You're right. It's right before Zero Hour, I think. Actually, I think #12 of this edition is the month right before the whole thing starts. Anyways, Lobo appeared in #4 of my collection, and Bizarro in something like #11, so if Lobo first appeared in april, Bizarro would have appeared in November. I am sorry I feel so useless.. but my magazines are in the other side of the world right now, and until april or may I won't have access to them. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrymology_ec0a.html" title="User:Lacrymology">Lacrymology</a> 03:30, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Didn't Alan Moore write in "The Last Superman Story" that Bizarro killed himself? This was one of the last Pre-Crisis stories for Superman, and would count as the final fate of Bizarro's Pre-Crisis character (as opposed to Crisis wiping him out, as the article states). --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 12:48, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would debate whether that section should be included. Though Alan Moore wrote the story from the perspective of the last Superman story ever, it was never intended to be so. Nor is it true that the story was "retconned" as alternate reality. Theere have been lieterally dozens of fanciful stories over the years. The Story of Superman Red and Superman Blue immediately springs to mind, where Superman splits into two people and raises two families on Earth and New Krypton. -- <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBroken_Arms_Gordon_cc1f.html" title="User:Broken Arms Gordon">Broken Arms Gordon</a> 09:55, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was called "What ever happened to the Man of Tomorrow", and in it, yes, Bizarro goes crazy and kills himself.

<dd>Bizarro didn't go crazy. He was already crazy. And I don't think that story was imaginary in the same sense as the Superman Red/Blue comic. It was a valid, if somewhat dramatic, part of pre-Crisis continuity, intended to be the last Superman story within that continuity. Jimpartame 00:07, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Bizarro is a fictional character in the Superman comic books and associated media" This is actually false. In the Superman Comic books, Bizarro is a real person. In the real world, Bizarro is a fictional character. An example of a fictional character in the superman comic books is the television character Jimmy Olson portrays when he is on TV dressed up as "Turtle Boy". Turtle Boy is a fictional character in the Superman Comics (though Jimmy Olson later becomes Turtle Boy, and so Turtle Boy is also a real character in the Superman Comics). I recommend changing the wording of the opening to be more accurate. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">Terror Island</a> 23:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia states that "Luthor later recreated Bizarro to see if it would offer insight into how to stop the "Clone Plague". This Bizarro escaped, and kidnapped Lois Lane, taking her to "Bizarro World"; a warehouse set up like a surreal version of Metropolis. He subjected her to danger, so that he would be able to rescue her from it. She managed to escape, and Bizarro was recaptured by Lexcorp, where it subsequently died", yet <a href="http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=bizarro" class="external text" title="http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/who/who-intro.php?topic=bizarro" rel="nofollow">this site</a> says "When Lex Luthor's cloned body was dying he had his current scientist, Sydney Happerson, resurrect the technology Dr. Teng had used to create Bizarro previously. The body once again deteriorated but at a somewhat slower rate and this Bizarro seemed more human in the speech patterns and emotions. Superman had many confrontations with Bizarro when he was trying to apprehend the creature. After a series of events that had an ailing Luthor determined to posess the Bizarro body for research on the cure for the clone plague running rampant through Metropolis. In the end, Bizarro actually put a stop to Happerson and Luthor's work and died in Lois' arms"</p>

<p>This article at times seems as though it is written by an angry fan boy. Article needs some slight TLC so it reads with information, not opinions. <a href="../../../t/e/h/User%7ETehPhil_f3a9.html" title="User:TehPhil">TehPhil</a> 14:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We should totally put up a pic of Bizarro from superboy, it's his only live action appearence. I looked on the next for it, and it was very interesting what I saw. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan4314_e12a.html" title="User:Ryan4314">Ryan4314</a> 03:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
