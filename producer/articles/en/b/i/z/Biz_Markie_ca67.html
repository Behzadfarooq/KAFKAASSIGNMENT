<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/z/Biz_Markie_ca67.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Markie's career began in the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. He established his reputation and cemented his place in <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-Hop_637d.html" title="Hip-Hop">Hip-Hop</a> history as a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat-box.html" title="Beat-box">beat-box</a> artist. He was one of the original <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artists.html" title="Artists">artists</a> that helped producer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marley_Marl_bdb5.html" title="Marley Marl">Marley Marl</a> build <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Chillin_Records_995d.html" title="Cold Chillin Records">Cold Chillin Records</a>. <a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_Shan_d538.html" title="MC Shan">MC Shan</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/x/Roxanne_Shante_0dc5.html" title="Roxanne Shante">Roxanne Shante</a> were <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marley_Marl_bdb5.html" title="Marley Marl">Marley Marl</a>'s and Cold Chillin' Records first acts. Biz beatboxed on Roxanne Shante's underground hit <i>Def Fresh Crew</i> (1986) which leant credibility to his recording career and put Cold Chillin' on the map. In the same year, Biz Markie 'coming out' single, <i>Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz</i>, was released on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prism_Records_bab4.html" title="Prism Records">Prism Records</a>. He released his debut album, <i>Goin' Off</i>, which attracted a fair amount of attention, largely due to the lead single, <i>Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz</i>. The album also featured the underground hit singles <i>The Vapors</i> and <i>Pickin' Boogers</i>.</p>
<p>A year later, he broke into the mainstream when <i>Just a Friend</i>, a single featuring rapped verses and out-of-tune, sung choruses, reached the pop Top Ten, and its accompanying album, <i>The Biz Never Sleeps</i>, went gold.</p>
<p>As one of the most prominent hip-hop stars of a still low-key musical scene, expectations were high for Biz's next album, <i>I Need a Haircut</i>. Sales were already disappointing when Biz was served a lawsuit by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_O%27Sullivan_bc0f.html" title="Gilbert O'Sullivan">Gilbert O'Sullivan</a>, who claimed that the album's <i>Alone Again</i> featured an unauthorized sample from his hit <i>Alone Again (Naturally)</i>. O'Sullivan's claim was upheld in a landmark ruling, <i><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Upright_Music%2C_Ltd._v._Warner_Brothers_Records%2C_Inc._2288.html" title="Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Brothers Records, Inc.">Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Brothers Records, Inc.</a></i>, that altered the landscape of hip-hop, finding that all samples must be cleared with the original artist before being used. In accordance with the ruling, Warner Bros., the parent company of Cold Chillin', had to pull <i>I Need a Haircut</i> from circulation, and all companies had to clear samples with the samples' creators before releasing the records. This development mirrored the increasing popularity of hip-hop and the financial stakes over which releases were set. Biz responded in 1993 with the mischievously titled <i>All Samples Cleared!</i>, but his career had been hurt by the publicity emanating from the lawsuit, and the record suffered accordingly. For the remainder of the decade, he stayed out of the spotlight, occasionally doing work like his 1996 <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle_rap.html" title="Freestyle rap">freestyle rap</a> commercial on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV2_13e9.html" title="MTV2">MTV2</a> and a guest appearance on the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beastie_Boys_c626.html" title="Beastie Boys">Beastie Boys</a> anthology, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sounds_of_Science_9813.html" title="The Sounds of Science">The Sounds of Science</a></i> (1999).</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, Biz redirected his focus to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turntablism.html" title="Turntablism">turntablism</a> over rapping, but he continued making various appearances in mainstream media. He interpreted the song <i><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_and_the_Jets_237b.html" title="Benny and the Jets">Benny and the Jets</a></i> on an episode of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chris_Rock_Show_f88a.html" title="The Chris Rock Show">The Chris Rock Show</a>. Biz also appeared on records by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morcheeba.html" title="Morcheeba">Morcheeba</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Smith_8633.html" title="Will Smith">Will Smith</a> (e.g. <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/Willennium.html" title="Willennium">Willennium</a></i>), and <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len.html" title="Len">Len</a>, a Canadian rock/rap ensemble most notable for their hit <i>Steal My Sunshine</i>.</p>
<p>In 2002, he appeared as a rapping alien in <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_in_Black_II_b8d6.html" title="Men in Black II">Men in Black II</a> with <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Smith_8633.html" title="Will Smith">Will Smith</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lee_Jones_14fe.html" title="Tommy Lee Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a>. In 2003 he appeared in the international television series titled <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_Faux_3158.html" title="Kung Faux">Kung Faux</a> performing a series of voice over characters featured in a variety of episodes. In 2004, his song <i>The Vapors</i> appeared on the soundtrack of <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockstar_Games_0326.html" title="Rockstar Games">Rockstar</a>'s popular <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videogame.html" title="Videogame">videogame</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/Grand_Theft_Auto%7E_San_Andreas_e6da.html" title="Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> which featured an <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_school_hip_hop.html" title="Old school hip hop">Classic hip hop</a> radio station, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playback_FM_afe9.html" title="Playback FM">Playback FM</a>. In 2005, Biz detoured from his recording duties to appear on the first season of the television show <i><a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_Fit_Club_cd41.html" title="Celebrity Fit Club">Celebrity Fit Club</a></i> which challenged celebrities to lose weight by a combination of diet and exercise. Biz Markie lost more weight than anybody else in the competition. That year, he was also in an episode of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Andy_Milonakis_Show_3a65.html" title="The Andy Milonakis Show">The Andy Milonakis Show</a>. He appeared as the Rap Fairy, and said, "I'm the Biz Markie, and it's about that time I grant you the powers of rap and rhyme." He granted Milonakis "rap powers", and demanded $35 from Milonakis, who paid him with <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato_chips.html" title="Potato chips">potato chips</a>.</p>
<p>He has also made a career as a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_jockey.html" title="Disc jockey">DJ</a>, giving performances where he uses his <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdomen.html" title="Abdomen">abdomen</a> to move a record on a turntable and thus <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scratching.html" title="Scratching">scratch</a>. He is also a legendary record collector and supposedly the sole owner of a rare CTI 12" containing a version of Take Me To The Mardi Gras which has no bells in the intro.</p>
<p>One item of interest with regard to Biz has been the truthfulness of some of his claims about various musical and pop-culture miscellany which he has alleged he owns. He has bragged in interviews about toys, lunchboxes, videotapes and records that no one has ever heard of although he swears to his ownership of said items. Perhaps most significantly, the extent of his extensive vinyl collection has been called into question. He has claimed that it is stored 'in a building next to his house', although many have questioned this. Biz has also claimed he owns certain 12" singles of famous breakbeat records that were not formally released although this claim might be more plausible, given Biz's early participation in the genre and his position as a pioneering hip/hop artist. Also supporting Biz' claims on this count is the fact that New York recordstore Downstairs Records pressed their own white label bootlegs of said records and which were widely respected within the hip-hop community. One claim which Biz made which was later shown to be false was that he inherited Lenny Roberts' entire collection (Ultimate Breaks And Beats compilation series). The range of falsehoods and possible truths about Biz' musical holdings only serve to enhance his legacy, and at least focus attention on a man with an undoubtedly significant role in the development of hip-hop. Since speculation about his holdings has died down, Biz quietly re-entered the very competitive recording industry with his 2003 release <i>Weekend Warrior</i> through <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Boy_Records_b144.html" title="Tommy Boy Records">Tommy Boy Records</a>.</p>

<p><b>Oh, snap!</b> is an expression popularized by Markie in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_music.html" title="1989 in music">1989</a> song "Just a Friend". It has since entered the mainstream as an expression of disbelief. It has also entered use as acknowledgement of a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissing.html" title="Dissing">diss</a> by third parties, to heighten the feeling of disrespect and insult. "Oh, Snap!" has been known to be used as another way of saying "zing!" It may also be used as an expression of shock or amazement. It is also a form of salutation.</p>
