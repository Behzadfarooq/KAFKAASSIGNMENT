<b><i><u>ZACH JEBENS JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A GIRL..... THAT SOLVES A LOT OF RUMORS!!!</u></i><br /></b></p>
<p>Starting off, I don't have to worry about anyone editing any of the stuff, because nobody goes here anyways... if you are here...congratulations and keep reading.</p>
<p>Bizkitfoot (also known as Colin Eggers) is a student at West Aurora High School, class of 2007. He is interested in computers, and would like to go into the field after high school.</p>
<p>The name "Bizkitfoot" actually started as "Biscuit-foot" when he had stepped on a biscuit, and his uncle started the name. The name started as biscuit-foot, but later was changed to Bizkitfoot because of the spelling issue with Biscuit. People sometimes don't know how to spell Biscuit.</p>
<p>Bizkitfoot.com was the first website that was created by Bizkitfoot himself. It featured game cheats, and South Park media clips. Created with Microsoft Publisher 97 (10 year anniversary of Bizkitfoot.com coming up in March...) the site was published on various free sites (Geocities, Fortunecity) before landing a home at <a href="http://www.bizkitfoot.com" class="external free" title="http://www.bizkitfoot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bizkitfoot.com</a></p>

<p>Colin Eggers gets along with mostly everyone. He likes to talk computers all the time, and never gives up on anything. A computer problem is no match for Colin.</p>
<p>Colin Eggers is part of the West Aurora High School Acappella choir, known as the geek. His common task is shutting off cell phones at various choir performances. Student Assisting Meg Papadolias, he has picked up lots of ins and outs of how everything works. When he graduates in 2007, the WAHS choir will have to find a replacement for the services that Colin Eggers provides. One such canidate is freshman Billy Czech (Class of 2011). The torch will pass down to Billy, and Billy will have to take over and perform the services. Although there can be no replacement for Colin, Billy Czech is currently undergoing training to ready himself for this task.</p>

<p><br />
<b><i><u>FIRST OFF</u></i> I don't really care to hear your gripes with me. Write on a piece of paper and swallow it. That's how much I don't care. It's easy to top me at things, but I have one thing that everyone else can't possess; Computer knowledge. Any day you feel like a challenge, email me. I'll be willing to take you to the dogpound. Ruff Ruff.<br /></b></p>
<p><br />
BTW, I do hear all of the crappy comments about me, and they aren't really appreciated, but I learn to ignore them. But whatever, I can't change you as a person, you just have to crawl out of your bad ass cave and realiaze that I am just who I am. A mean person (Right).<br /></p>
<p>Colin Eggers has an infamous job to annoy all people that walk the face of this planet. He doesn't mean to do so, it just happens naturally (Colin seems to be depressed about this.) Here is a list of people that Colin likes to annoy on a daily basis:</p>
<p><br />
--Coach B. Brooks &amp; Asst. Coach L. Weisner (She'll be here all year!)<br />
<br />
--Teacher J. McLear (AKA Jonny)<br />
<br />
--Teacher M. Papadolias (Did you know that she's only 4'11")<br />
<br />
--Teacher A. Lutzenkirchen (Has the power to shut you down 17 different ways at the same time)<br />
<br />
--Student B. Czech (You'll be a horrible brown-noser. Work at that!)<br />
<br />
--Student N. Joy (Prolly on crack half the time, not as bad as "You Know Who at the front piano")<br />
<br />
--Student T. Wollenweber (Who thinks that HTML is a breeze)<br />
<br />
--Teacher N. Faulstich (Ha. She just doesn't have good days)<br />
<br />
--Teacher J. Neukirch (My favorite cuz, with all the "branches" intact. Hahaa)<br />
<br />
Colin also loves it when Teacher M. Papadolias yells about things that are not right, or picks at random small things. Colin is also entertained by the fact that Meg Papadolias will have to drive the short bus down to Peoria. She is driving the short bus becuase West Aurora High School's Acappella Choir has made it to the allstate, and she has been nominated to drive the short bus down to Peoria. FYI: She has equipped herself with a pillow to boost herself to the pedals...... (Even I find that distasteful.)<br /></p>

<p><br />
So I changed some stuff for everyone... Read your name and see what's different!<br />
<br />
In doing this, don't be scared. I'm not stalking you, or getting weird (some people jump to that conclusion, go figure). Only stating what makes you unique. I don't do it often... and I will NEVER state it in person to you... so this is the next best thing.<br /></p>
<p><b>Coach Brooks and Weisner</b><br />
Although I've only known Weisner for about 2 months, it was an instant click. Cool person with a down to earthy personality. Can always take a joke, and blended into the PE department very well. Even though I graduate, I would like to see Weisner make it as a teacher there, possibly even AD down the road (Our current AD is great, but he won't be in the seat forever [cries]... Wait until the position opens at least.) Brooks is a similar but different story {Does that make sense?}. He is a unique person, that only his students can understand. Nobody will get his corny sense of humor, (Like naming people: Cody becomes Commander Cody, Claire becomes Clarinet, or eclaire) but he always has something unique and fun to say, and a fun thing to do in class. A carefree person he is. Besides all of this, Brooks is one to try new things, and never gets in a bent attitude, meaning that he is always happy, and never in a horrible foul mood (I'm not hinting at any other people).<br />
<br />
<b>Jonny McLear</b><br />
Oh Jonny Boy. I remember the first day that you came in; all professional (almost too professional). Nervous because any move you made, you'd have a 4'11" dragon on yo' ass. (Not Literally). Jonny has the capability to do anything, and knows more about the innerworkings of a program than I do. He beats me out in Cakewalk software, as well as Sonar. I could never learn that, or have the patience to do it. If It don't work, it's in the weeds. And I've never seen someone enter music into Finale faster. He can play the piano better than anyone i've seen, and he likes to show humility. It's especially funny when I come into the office and ask the genuine question "What did your wife pack?" and how everything leads back to "your mom." Even better is when I open a can of pop by his ear, and he starts to swear at me. That's hilarious. Such fun times!<br />
<br />
<b>Censored Person 1</b><br />
I have censored your name becuase of your request. Does this make you feel better??<br />
What can I say? You're my idol. Even though you're only $' $$", you've got a heart the size of a giant. My grandmother always says that "good things come in small packages" and you are living proof. Whenever I make a trip to the cafeteria, I ask the same question "Do you want potatoes?" You all have to understand, that potatoes are the best ever in the WAHS student cafeteria. The BEST! Aside the orgasmic potatoes in the cafeteria, I'm waiting for #%$ to be fired for something that she says/does. I won't go into examples, as to protect your credibility. #@! is like me in a way becuase #$@ sometimes doesn't think before acting. That is my enemy, and I have been moved, punished, etc for it. When you clean the room, you'll find the stuff that I saved from when I was a student. (HINT: It's attached to something that has another thing on it that you use every morning, and it has a qwerty problem) That should give away the clue.<br />
<br />
<b>Mr. Lutzenkirchen</b> (I think that's how it's spelt)<br />
On the first day of my freshmen year, "Lutz" was my gym teacher. This man shows no emotion, but has a passion for what he does. He can take a good joke, and can say one thing that will bash you in 15 different ways at once. Good with words, and will do good in the phys.ed department. Always wants to make sure that i'm dressed and away from his class. Don't worry Lutz, there will be a Reprise of my wrath (haha).<br />
<br />
<b>Billy Czech</b><br />
Ever since 4th grade, I've rode the bus with my busdriver, Gay L. She's been awesome and still is. And Billy has been on the bus since that time. Even though he always referred to me as "the kid on the bus", he later got to know my name. He's supposed to take my spot in the West Aurora Choir. I don't know about that...he's a horrible brown-noser (meaning that he can't do it very well) and really needs to learn how to. He doesn't ever push the envelope with anything, which is something that you have to do, to see how far you and only you can get away with. There are some things that only I could get away with; that if any other kid tried it, they would get into some seirous trouble. That's what brown-nosing is all about. You crap on a higher level than everyone else. I'll work with Billy and see if we can't get things straightened out.<br />
<br />
<b>Nick Joy</b><br />
Cousin. What else is there to say? Nick is the type of person that you have to like, otherwise you have something wrong with yourself. He's what's right with America. Lots of interests, lots of talent. Really starting to sprout out in choir. He'll prolly beat me up for typing that. Poor Nickelodeon. He's always one to seem kinda high at times, but I just regard it as being "high on life." He's not as bad as that one kid that's in our piano class (I won't name him, becuase it'll destroy him...). Nick's got his head in the right area, and he'll go far in life, when he realiazes his full potential.<br />
<br />
<b>Tom Wollenweber</b><br />
So yea. Tom is prolly one of the only students that remotely understands HTML. Nobody else would waste their time. HTML is not a bad thing to learn, and it is all common sense. Tom, you'll go far if you stay with the HTML; or if you decide to follow your music dream. Either way, your name is one that will be recognized throughout the world one day. AND.. im using HTML to do this comment section right now. Just a seires of "b and /b, br and /br" commands. See how easy it is?? And even though you moved, I still miss you, and hope that you keep with your dreams.<br />
<br />
<b>Miss Faulstich</b><br />
Wow...to the person that seems as if no day is good (although this past week has been ok for you..) You've been stuck with some real jerks this year, and I feel your pain. Every day I see you, you've had a horrible day. Some craphole kid has given you a hard time, or some class has pissed you off. Aside all that, you've been an awesome teacher, and I feel like we're on the same wavelength with being pissed at people. I could write a whole book about you, but I only wrote 4 lines for everyone else, and I don't wanna show favoritism...kinda like "No Teacher Left Behind!<br />
<br />
<b>Mr. Neukirch</b><br />
The first day that I was in your class, it was an instant like. I felt like we had something in common. I took your syllabus home to my mom, and she screamed becuase the last name "Neukirch" is actually a changed version of Neuenkirchen. How funny it is, becuase we are cousins. HahA. I feel sorry for you, but I try not to rub salt in the open wound. Of course when you read this you'll start swearing under your breath. I wish the best, and hope that you have another version of a Dawn and Colin combo next year. Maybe we will fail your class and have to come back next year. Never the less, you are awesome, Nuke.<br />

<b>If you're not in this section, don't feel left out. I don't hate you, it's just there are so many people that have had an impact on my attitude and life, that I can't list them and write descriptions about them. I will list them though:<br />

<p><b>So yea... this part of the WikiPage is where I would just give a generic description of a person without using a name, and if you think it's you, come find me, becuase everyone goes to West in this section:<br />
<br />
1. You're the type of person that I can't stand becuase you constantly bust me out, but you have lots of potential. Although you have lots of potential, you think too much of yourself, almost to the point to drive everyone nuts. I feel that we just got off to a bad start, and I don't think that it'll be getting better.<br />
<br />
2. I admire your skills. First impressions of you would be "god what a screw-off" but once they get to know you, they have a whole different voice about you. I feel that I misunderstood you, and that now I truly see what potential you have, and I admire that.<br />
<br />
3. When I first saw you, I thought that you were a total jerk. I got to know you and realiazed that you are awesome. I appreciate your company, even though we never hang out. If I had to be one person, you would be it. You're just a cool person to know, you fit in so well, and I just think you are the best. You fit in so well, and I could never do that. I love everything about you.<br />
<br />
4. In freshmen year, you pissed me off becuase you were so much better than me at everything (I get ticked at that really easy). I got to know you as a person better and I respect your knowledge, and I love your energy. You run loops around me. To be honest, I envy the oppurtunities that you get.<br />
<br />
5. You had some large crush on me in sophmore year, almost to the point that you wanted to stalk my shadow. I was always trying politely to tell you that I wasn't interested, but you never took the hint. Today, I still feel that there is some friction between us.<br />
<br />
6. You are a complete jerk. I cannot say one positive thing about you, and I would just keep going with the negative things. You purposely go out of your way to make my life the worst possible experience, and when i'm down, you keep kicking me. You don't understand me as a person, and frankly you just plain annoy me. Just the sight of you depresses me.<br />
<br />
7. We worked together for awhile, and in class, you always told me what to do, and I found these tips pointless. But I really like you as a person; you are just so bubbly, that it can't help but transfer to me.<br />
<br />
8. I really wanna go out sometime. You are cute, and funny, but I must not be your type. I've admired you from afar for like 6 years. You rejected me once like 4 years ago, and I think im still getting the silent treatment for that. Often times, I lose hope.<br />
<br />
9. You are an awesome person. When I first met you, I thought you were a little "off the wall". We spent some time during the summer, and I really have come to appreciate your company. You're awesome!!<br />
<br />
When I think of other people to do, then i'll post. Like anyone reads this wikipage??<br />

<p>If you see your name on this WikiPage, cherish the moment that Colin has thought about you enough to include YOU in this exclusive WikiPage. Don't get pissed, just cherish. You never know, the page might be famous one day...:)</p>
