<dd>The article has always linked to <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg.html" title="Leg">Leg</a> in the first sentence, which is the extent of other counts' direct relevance to this topic, and a better place for an editor with the interest and background to compare and contrast. <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg.html" title="Leg">Leg</a> has always mentioned at least quadrupeds (although most of that <i>history</i> is now to be seen in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_leg.html" title="Human leg">Human leg</a>), and now goes further. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 16:52, 2004 Jun 13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then i realized that what is needed at <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg.html" title="Leg">Leg</a> is not what the IP asked for, and that moving the msg was pointless, and wrote a different msg here than i'd anticipated.<br /></dd>

<p>I want to add something to the origin of bipedalism, which, as far as I know, was not mentioned. I will not go into details of the hypotheses now in fashion as I do not find them convincing. I want to link neoteny with bipedalism. As the main human trait - development of neocortex - started, neoteny - birth of biologically immature babies- became a necessity. These immature babies - by definition- were immature and could not be autonomous in almost any sense. The dependence on the mother became almost total. At some point the young mother (homo sapiens to be) got to the point, when she had to "choose": either to grab her baby and perform whatever halting and imperfect bipedalism, run with the baby in her new-found embrace - or loose her baby. The choice was so stark. Because the baby, being so immature, could not even cling to the mother, would fall and become lost. So, the forelegs had to act as hands, for grabbing and holding- and this of course had its greatest impact in this context. Of course, most young mothers could not achieve this, but some were more able, for both anatomical and CNS reasons- and these were able to keep their newborns and automatically also the species to become more and more bipedal. Bipedalism, of course- showed itself to be both plus and minus in other aspects of life of these ancient creatures, but the ability to keep the babies alive during their immaturity was the most crucial for the whole species.

<p>Below has been pasted from the Savannah Theory page, it is discussion about the Savannah Theory page.</p>

<p>HEre is the previous talk page</p>
<p>I'm putting a NPOV label on this article because the author put way too much time refuting this theory, without displaying the prose and cons from both sides. Arbadihist 20:33, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. An aquatic ape supporter is not a suitable author for the opposing theory. [edit]</p>
<p>internal inconsistency</p>
<p>This article has been flagged for NPOV due to author's pro-wet ape theory, but the Aquatic_Ape_Theory article has not. This is probably confusing to the reader.</p>
<p>The Aquatic Ape Theory article is balanced. The author makes a strong case for it, points out the criticisms, then rebuts those criticisms. This article (Savannah Theory) makes no case for the theory, then makes a strong case against it with no rebuttals. Regardless of the author's strongly biased orientation, the Savannah Theory has the most fossil evidence to support it, and (likely because of this) has the most support among anthropologists. This is just a badly written article. (Danaidh 01:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)) [edit]</p>
<p>What can be done?</p>
<p>This page is really appallingly bad. I don't know wikipedia well enough to know what can be done about this. It seems that there were attempts to bring it to the attention of the wikipedia community at large, but those attempts have obviously failed. And the article desperately needs revision. Not only because it's biased, but also because it contains next to no useful information about the theory at all.</p>
<p>I've been trying to research the topic so that I can improve upon the article, but it's quite a complicated issue, and I don't have the necessary background knowledge, nor valid sources. Actually, my limited research thus far seems to indicate that the term "Savanna Theory" is only used in context of the Aquatic Ape discussion, and not in discussion of human evolution in general. That is, when people discuss the theory, they do not refer to it as such. Additionally, it appears that the savanna itself is not playing as large a role in theories of human evolution as the article indicates. It appears, therefore, that this article is not only biased in its coverage of the material, but also a simply incorrect portrayal of the "conventional" or prevailing theory of evolution at the moment, or at least an incorrect portrayal of the savanna theory as the prevailing one.</p>
<p>Then again, I could be wrong about the above--I simply do not have the knowledge or resources to discern what the theory actually is, what it is called and by whom, and what role it plays in the anthropological and paleontological communities.</p>
<p>But I would love to find out more, and as Wikipedia would be an ideal way in which to compare the two theories, I beg someone with the ability to rewrite this article!</p>
<p>I know that I haven't really made a contribution here except to whine and ask for help, but the poor quality of this article has been bothering me all day.</p>
<p>Hi. You might want to read this article, which has a more scholarly view of human bipedalism origins. I agree, that savanna(h) theory is language not used by professionals researching the subject and that this article is a textbook example of a strawman argument. What can be done are a number of things. At first I was going to suggest a complete rewrite of the article, although as the term isn't really used, that may not be wise. A merge / redirct to Bipedalism might work.
