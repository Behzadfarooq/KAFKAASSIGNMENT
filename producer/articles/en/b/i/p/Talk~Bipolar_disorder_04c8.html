<hr />
<p>The diagnosis section contains the statement "Both within and between individuals with the illness, energy, mood, thought, sleep, and activity are among the continually changing biological markers of the disorder." This is a big stretch of the term biological marker, with is generally used to refer to a molecular or genetic marker that can be tested for physically, say with a blood test or other physical means. Since at this point there are no genetic or chemical markers that are tested to diagnose bipolar disorder, the use of the term is innaccurate and implies a greater biological understanding of the illness than we currently have. A better term here might be simply the word characteristics or physical manifestations. There are also several sentence fragments in the article which noone has bothered to clean up. The highest concordance rate from twin studies given needs a citation. Overall the article is probably not up to the same quality as most Wikipedia articles and considering the importance level it's been given, I'd rate this one more in the class of a C-.</p>

<p>I have some concerns about this statement: "People suffering from the disorder may be periodically disabled, but many live full and productive lives whether or not they receive adequate treatment." This statement has been chopped around recently till it has reached this state. I'm not so sure that people can live full and productive lives whether or not they receive adequate treatment. It just doesn't make sense to me. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 22:28, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I read this article out of curiousity because I have BPII and this statement struck me as contradicting most of the rest of the article. Besides, how can you say that untreated bipolar sufferers may lead full productive lives (whatever you define that as) when someone who has been diagnosed will, in all likelihood, receive some kind of treatment? If someone has a reference for this, fine, but this contradicts both my personal experience as someone suffering since childhood but not diagnosed until my mid-30's, and everything else I've read about bipolar disorder.<a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrrlgeek_d1e9.html" title="User:Grrrlgeek">Grrrlgeek</a> 21:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believe that the "<i>whether or not they receive adequate treatment</i>" is meant to suggest that bipolars can "<i>live full and productive lives</i>" without resorting to psychiatric treatment (ie. an allusion to the belief that psychiatric treatment fails to satisfy many bipolars). <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarchist42_03d4.html" title="User:Anarchist42">Anarchist42</a> 22:24, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But does an "allusion to a belief" belong here? And when I read "<i>treatment</i>" I didn't necessarily think psychiatric; even self-treatment is treatment.<a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrrlgeek_d1e9.html" title="User:Grrrlgeek">Grrrlgeek</a> 03:29, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good question. I believe that, in general, psychiatrists do not regard self-treatment as appropriate and claim that they are very successfull in treating bipolar disorder using pharmaceuticals (a claim that is disputed by many patients). The statement in question evolved as the two sides tried to emphasize their opposing beliefs, until a balance was achieved. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarchist42_03d4.html" title="User:Anarchist42">Anarchist42</a> 19:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it refers only to psychiatric treatment it should say so. What I really think is that the sentence is opinion only and has no place in an encyclopedia article, but that is opinion only as well&#160;;}.

<p>"The following is a quote from a successfully treated individual with bipolar disorder (from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health):"</p>
<p>I think this quote should be replaced because:</p>
<p>1) It starts off as if describing bipolar depression in general and in sensationalist terms too ('manic-depression...incites dreadful behaviours', 'destroys...') and also makes strong scientific claims (says e.g. "it is an illness which is biological") - rather than elucidating a sufferer's personal experience.</p>
<p>2) The quote was selected in some way by the NIMH, which as noted above (by me in a previous incarnation) is a strongly 'biomedical' organisation (even though they removed that term from their website banner shortly after it was highlighted) and it seems likely that they chose a quote that fit with their outlook and aims</p>
<p>3) The link is to a page that appears to be a sort of position statement on bipolar by NIMH and doesn't actually seem to have the quote on it - and no information on who this person was, how NIMH got the quote from them, what 'successful' treatment they were receiving, or anythign to enable validation of any of it</p>

<dd>It's a quote from Kay Redfield Jamison's <i>An Unquiet Mind</i>: see <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/NIMHbipolar.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/NIMHbipolar.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> for a cite. Jamison is a well known researcher in the field, and is bipolar herself; in this quote, she's referring to her own experience of, and treatment for, bipolar disorder. I can't see anything particularly contentious about her statement about the nature of the disease: the statement that bipolar disorder has biological origins is consistent with all recent research. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:00, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for clarifying this here and on the page, this was not indicated or linked to previously, and explains the sensationalist (published book) language. It remains the case that the quote was orginally transferred to here because NIMH had included it in their work.</dd>

<dd>To start again - Kay Redfield Jamison is of course very well-known and respected in this area, but the purpose of this section seems unclear when there are two quotes from one person giving generalised clinical opinions as much as describing a personal experience. I am assuming a section like this, if it is allowed on Wikipedia, should be confined to the latter, and should give a representative range of quotes as far as possible? What about finding a more personal quote from Kay (her medical work could be addressed elsewhere in the article of course)? Some other quotes could be obtained from user-led organisations - I see Bipolar World has a list of personal stories <a href="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Stories/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Stories/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 17:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I asked about this on the policy page, and I guess user-led org materials wouldn't really be reliable/verifiable enough. When I get time I will try to find reliable published works with quotes from someone diagnosed with bipolar - I hope anyone else can too of course. I do think the first Jamison quote can be replaced by something more balanced, or at the very least, in the interests of NPOV, counterbalanced by an additional view of its nature/etiology etc. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 21:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I don't think that this section adds anything to the article, which is very long and needs a lot of cleaning up. I don't think this is in the style of Wikipedia, I haven't seen "Personal accounts of ..." in other articles, about medical conditions or otherwise; please correct me if I am wrong. I also agree with EverSince, <i>if</i> this section has a place in this article, it should consist of some actual "personal experience" type quotes. It all just seems very out of place, and I'm going to be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and remove it now. /<tt><a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkagedal_c3c6.html" title="User:Skagedal">skagedal</a></tt><a href="../../../s/k/a/User_talk%7ESkagedal_ca3e.html" title="User talk:Skagedal"><sup>...</sup></a> 21:29, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does this article seem to change around quite a lot and be relatively disorganized? Currently a lot of points are duplicated in different personal-seeming wording, and the various headings seem quite disparate with an unclear flow. Would it help to establish some kind of agreed basic organization on this talk page? I'm wary of spending time trying to organize the article otherwise, in case it's wasted. The structure of other psych pages would seem to suggest something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple intro/overview</li>
<li>diagnosis (incl. subtypes and comorbidity)</li>
<li>symptoms/features</li>
<li>history</li>
<li>epidemiology (e.g. prevalence)</li>
<li>etiology (causes/influences/models)</li>
<li>treatments and services</li>
<li>self-management/society/recovery</li>
<li>controversies?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other suggestions? Just noticed there's been a similar discussion to this already, middle of last year, but seems that it would still be useful to get a basic heading structure clearly listed <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 04:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Added paragraph:</p>
<p>It's important to note, however, that currently bipolar diagnosis is made solely on the basis of a psychiatrist's judgement. No medical imaging or any other modern technology is able to objectively diagnose any mental illness.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest changing this to the following:
<blockquote>
<p>The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder is made based on the assessment and evaluation of a mental health professional. The assessment may include clinical judgement, various psychological tests, a review of history, and a comparison of presenting symptoms with the DSM criteria. There are no biological tests for this disorder</p>
</blockquote>
The words "solely" and "modern" present a slant that isn't particularily neutral. Furthermore, a variety of mental health professionals can diagnosis and the basis for a diagnosis is ususally multi-modal. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 13:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the suggested rewording.

<p>Contrary to popular belief, disabilities -- of any kind -- do not make people more "creative." Stevie Wonder is not more "sensitive" to sound because he's blind -- he just has on of the finest ears for rhythm and melody in recorded history. Likewise with bi-polar disorder -- even though we have these myths about the "sensitive," "melancholy" artist, bi-polar disorder does NOT make one "more creativity." It is a crippling illness which leads to feelings of worthlessness, apathy, and eventually suicide. bi-polar disorder is not just a few "sad feelings" in someone's "head" -- it is an illness as real and verifiable as cancer -- therefore to attach some kind of 'mystique' to it is completely inexcusable. So, for the self-appointed expert who placed the silly "Depression and creativity" section in the article on bi-polar disorder, I have just this to say: Van Gogh's bi-polar disorder did not cause him to paint the "Starry Night" -- but it did cause him to shoot himself. Think before you post such ignorant garbage on Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Surely the correct way to proceed is not to simply nuke the section. It's a fairly common belief that bipolar disorder is somehow connected to creativity. Now it may very well be hogwash but there have been studies on the subject and there's more than enough reason to keep this section and address the issue. Pending discussion here, I will revert your deletion which, incidentally also added a sentence to the effect that bipolar disorder was the explanation for a majority of suicides, divorces, and employment terminations.

<dd>I'm all for removing anything that's uncited but removing the section won't solve anything.

<p>There is a strong link between bipolar disorder and creativity; see Jamison's research, and her popularization <i>Touched by Fire</i>, and also Nancy Andreasen's work in the 1970s. However, just because a significantly high proportion of creative people have bipolar disorder, doesn't necessarily mean that the correlation works the other way; no-one is pretending that bipolar disorder is anything other then destructive, even in the lives of those few people who are fortunate enough to also gain a benefit from it. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 11:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Creativity and mental health</p>
<p>A study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism.[28] Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex.[29] This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals.</p>
<p>Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (aka bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (aka unipolar disorder). In Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament, Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist, Michelangelo.</p>

<p>It makes more sense to me, therefore, that bipolar is an effect rather than a cause of creativity, or rather that both are an effect of changes to the prefrontal cortex. In future can we try not to be so blunt and offensive when referring to bipolar sufferers, regardless of how angry we are as to a particular inclusion of something etc. I have a good friend who suffers from bipolar, and making it sound as if bipolar sufferers are simply no-hopers who are all going to shoot themselves doesn't inspire much confidence in me as to your opinion. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenis_3297.html" title="User:Senis">senex</a> 04:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Polling is not a substitute for discussion. The content of articles should be determined by consensus driven by evidence from reliable sources, not by counting supporters of any particular view. Please see <a href="../../../v/o/t/WP%7EVOTE_9fb8.html" title="WP:VOTE">WP:VOTE</a> for more details.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, we seem to have achieved a consensus on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current article has an excessive emphasis on the suggestions of a link between creativity and bipolar disorder, and that this discussion needs to be cut down</li>
<li>any such assertion should be backed with cites -- we have cites, but they date back to the 1970s, and some contributors suggest (without providing any cites) that these results are now outdated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not proceed on that basis for now?</p>
<p>First, let's find some cites that meet the normal standards for evidence-based medical research that either support or oppose the hypothesis that bipolar disorder is correlated with creativity. Then, let's work out what to do after that.</p>
<p>A Medline search for "bipolar creativity" brings up 83 hits.</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">OBJECTIVE: Understanding of mood disorders can be enhanced through assessment of temperamental traits. We explored temperamental commonalities and differences among euthymic bipolar (BP) and unipolar (MDD) mood disorder patients, creative discipline graduate student controls (CC), and healthy controls (HC).
<p>...</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: Euthymic BP, MDD, and CC compared to HC, had prominent temperamental commonalities. However, BP and CC had the additional commonality of increased openness compared to HC. BP had particularly high Cyclothymia scores that were significantly higher then those of MDD. The prominent BP-CC overlap suggests underlying neurobiological commonalities between people with mood disorders and individuals involved in creative disciplines, consistent with the notion of a temperamental contribution to enhanced creativity in individuals with bipolar disorders.</p>

<dd>Good detective work, but Ref 1 and ref 3 are the same authors reporting different questionnaires on the same bunch of 49 people, while ref 2 discounts the link. I actually don't object to the discussion of the subject matter <i>per se</i>, but it is not a core part of an <i>encyclopedic</i> entry on bipolar either. Instead, a well-written page on bipolar and creativity (the beginnings of one which already exists) is the place this material should be taken. I am not saying it should be deleted outright. cheers <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 19:28, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">It has been known for a long time that people with salient social and artistic creativity suffer more frequently from psychiatric illnesses than the average population. In their review paper, the authors assess the Hungarian and international scientific literature regarding the association of creativity and psychopathology. They conclude that contrary to the concept prevailing in the first part of the 20th century about the strong association between schizophrenia and creativity, <i>the results of empirical research now unambiguously suggest that prominent social and artistic creativity is associated primarily with affective, and more specifically with bipolar affective illnesses.</i> In addition, we already know that as regards the development of creativity, it is not the given affective (depressive, manic, hypomanic) episode which is important, but the hyperthymic or cyclothymic temperament structure which also predisposes for affective illness.</td>

Equally i see no reason why any valid, cited information in the current <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creativity_and_bipolar_disorder.html" title="Creativity and bipolar disorder">Creativity and bipolar disorder</a> article should not be merged here as a subsection (and, whatever is not valid and cited, of course, just deleted). --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 21:53, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ok. However, the valid, cited information in this other article is the same info that was here this afternoon. I just copied it there a few hours ago.

In other words, as far as I am concerned the topic is not appropriate as an article, it is appropriate as a subsection, but there does not seem to be any valid, cited text to use for that yet.

<p>I've perused this page and the talk page archives, and I can't for the life of me find why this page is tagged as biased towards world-northern views. Does the psychiatric community outside of the Northern Hemisphere subscribe to some different form of science? This tag should be justified or removed. <a href="../../../o/h/m/User%7EOhm_813_db63.html" title="User:Ohm 813">Ohm 813</a> 18:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
