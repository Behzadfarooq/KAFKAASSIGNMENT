<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing specific DSM criteria</span></h2>
<p>I have had an on-going discussion with the permissions people at the APA, and they are adamant about refusing to give Wikipedia permission to display or publish the DSM diagnostic criteria, or any version thereof, even if the area where that information is displayed is locked and uneditable.</p>
<p>That said, and to avoid potential litigation, I would like to remove the criteria listed on this page, and insert a link to the "official on-line page" and boilerplate explaining that outlink. Kindly see the DID page for an example.</p>
<p>Comments? Objections? Support? --<a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> 12:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, what is 'the DID page'? Are DSM diagnostic criteria to be removed from <i>ALL</i> mental illness articles?

<dd>It's not a policy, and it's not new. It's a question of copyright infringement. When referencing copyright material of any sort, you need permission from the source. APA will not give Wikipedia permission. Period. This is an on-going conversation that I have had with their Permissions Department regarding my own sites, and one I've broached with them re: Wikipedia...even if the information is placed on uneditable pages, then answer is a resounding, "No.".</dd>

<dd>I added some boiler plate to accomodate the directory linking format. See what you think. I believe the intention here was a good one, and supports comments made by others re: external link policy and the number of links (previously) on this page. I dropped Barrylb a note to heads him up on what was done to accomdate the directory concept here. Maybe the ODP will pick up on it. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> (<a href="../../../m/j/f/User_talk%7EMjformica_0cab.html" title="User talk:Mjformica">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mjformica_4e20.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mjformica">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>The section called ketogenic diet indicated that a study was underway at Standford University. The correct university is Stanford. Here is a link to the study Stanford University Bipolar Disorders Clinic: Ketogenic Diet in Bipolar Depression <a href="http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/studies/stu56839.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/studies/stu56839.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Also, If you are taking Depakote, check with your doctor before starting a ketogenic (Low Carb) diet. My personal experience was a 75% reduction of Depakote's efficacy. Since this was my primary defense against mania, I quickly became hospitalized.</p>

<p>Making extended or significant changes are of concern to other editors. Every edit to Wikipedia is checked by other editors. Making numerous changes over many days makes it very hard for others to check your work. Please propose major changes on the Talk page.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Changes to unify article</span></h3>
<p>I have a concern about this article. First, this subject is continually evolving because it is a very hot topic in the psychiatric literature right now. So there's really a lot of information. In particular, this page seems to be very broad. I've looked at the "Diabetes" page and it is organized quite clearly and cogently. I have decided to stop making adjustments to the page because I need more input from others.</p>

<p>It seems like there is great repetition between the Bipolar depression and Mania sections within Domains of the bipolar spectrum. What is called psycosis in Bipolar depression seems to be the same thing as what mania is talking about, they should probably be combined it seems. An7drew 01:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it true that someone with a bipolar disorder cannot control their sexual urges. If anyone can answer this question, it would help my relationship immensly. Thanks</p>
<p><br />
I was just wondering if anyone out there could help me. I am engaged to a very beautiful women who was recently diagnois with bipolar. She was told that because of her disorder, she would not be able to control some of her feelings or actions. She was also told that she would have highs; where she felt untouchable and COULD do about anything she wanted. Other times she would have lows (manic depression); where she WOULD do just about anything. What I would like to know is; "Can her manic episodes be controlled?"</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have BP II - I was BP I at first, I got better over time, with the help of the meds most likely, to the point where I'm just a BP II now. It is important to note the different between BP I and BP II - BP I is the level of severe mood swings, BP II is the level of low to moderate mood swings. The difference in size of the mood episode, between BP I level and II level, in my experience, is the same as a 9.0 on the Richter scale for an earthquake (BP I level), compared to a 3.0 for BP II. So BP is not a one size fits all illness, and the cycles, as this wikipedia document so eloquently details, vary greatly between BP's, in terms of frequency and intensity. I think it is 100 percent false to say that a BP cannot control themselves. In any area, sexual or otherwise. The only thing that is out of control is the mood. The teacher in Florida, IMO, who is having her attorney use BP as an excuse for having sex with a student, is using the BP as an excuse. Otherwise, you'd hear about statistics linking pedophiles with bipolar disorder, which is simply not the case. In fact, the large majority of crimes are committed by persons who do not have mental illnesses. It's just that defense attorneys like to use the "insanity" defense when they have no other defense available. So the mentally ill get a bad rap as a result, hence part of the stigma associated with mental illness.</dd>

<dd>There is also a well-supported clinical view that <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">clinical depression</a> become bipolar disorder over time. In a 2005 study, Jules Angst and his colleagues at <a href="../../../z/u/r/Zurich_University_53f3.html" title="Zurich University">Zurich University</a> tracked 406 patients with major mood disorders over a 20-year period.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Of 309 patients presenting with depression, 121 (39.2 percent) eventually manifested as bipolar (24.3 percent to bipolar I, 14.9 percent to bipolar II). In all, more than 50 percent of the study population turned out to have bipolar disorder. This supports the view that most cases of bipolar disorder are initially misdiagnosed as depression.</dd>

<p>The following sentence seems to be oddly worded, and I have changed it:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The prognosis for bipolar disorder is, in general, better than that for schizophrenia, but some individuals with schizophrenia respond remarkably well to the atypical antipsychotics which are also used in bipolar disorder.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Bipolar disorder" at the end of this sentence should be changed to "bipolar mania," as there is no evidence that it helps treat bipolar depression. This sentence also might lead some to believe that atypical antipsychotics were first developed for bipolar disorder. This is patently untrue, at least in the United States, where the indication for bipolar mania of the atypicals came fairly recently. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankieist_c759.html" title="User:Frankieist">Frankieist</a> 08:18, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>An important rebuttal to this statistical critique of the Epidemiological Catchment Area study retabulation needs to be made. First, the collaborators on the original and follow-up study have international reputaions and are known for world-wide leadership and excellence in their fields. For example, the first Epidemiological Catchment Area study involving over 20,000 people was headed by Harvard Medical School Epidemiologist <a href="http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/people/faculty/permanant/kessler.php" class="external text" title="http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/people/faculty/permanant/kessler.php" rel="nofollow">Ronald Kessler Ph.D.</a> in collaboration with other stellar individuals from Columbia, Johns Hopkins and Yale Universities. Second, the more recent retabulation effort was led by Lew Judd M.D., former Chief of the <a href="../../../n/i/m/NIMH_977b.html" title="NIMH">NIMH</a>, editor of many current Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego. His co-investigator on the retabulation was international mood disorders expert, former NIMH researcher, Editor in Chief of the Journal of Affective Disorders and Professor of Psychiatry at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego.<a href="http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/hakiskal.html" class="external text" title="http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/hakiskal.html" rel="nofollow">Hagop Akiskal M.D.</a> So, the likelihood of having made <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_positive.html" title="False positive">type I errors</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_negative.html" title="False negative">type II errors</a> with the resources available to Dr Judd and Dr Akiskal is unlikely. Furthermore, a project of this size, (again, over 20,000 people) funded by the federal government is unlikely to utilize ineffectual statisticians or statistal software. Regarding your other claims: 1)There is no need for researchers to do fieldwork of this size. 2)The "substantive" limitations claim is baseless: have you looked at the methodology? 3)The study was in survey format so structured interviews were necessary to reduce bias. 4)Why don't you listen to Ronald Kessler yourself in his presentation during the 6th International Bipolar Confernence.

<p>I've just made a minor change to the page. There were three main headings near the bottom of the page that concerned diagnosis (two of them were just 1 paragraph long!). I've created a new section, "Diagnosis" before etiology and incorporate all three as sub-sections. Apart from a duplicate sentence, the content remains identical.

<p>"Seasonality or exposure to daylight also affects mood in bipolar disorder. In untreated individuals, the bipolar cycle tends towards mania in the mid-to-late-summer, followed by depression in autumn and winter (due to decreasing natural light). <i>There once was a man who liked to suck on straws because he was fixated at what Freud would call the "oral" stage.</i>"</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Extro/Introverted</span></h2>
<p><i>An evolving literature exists concerning the nature of personality and temperament in bipolar disorder patients, compared to major depressive disorder (unipolar) patients and non-sufferers. Such differences may be diagnostically relevant. Using MBTI continuum scores, bipolar patients were significantly more extroverted, intuitive and perceiving, and less introverted, sensing, and judging than were unipolar patients[citation needed]. This suggests that there might be a correlation between the Jungian extraverted intuiting process and bipolar disorder.</i></p>

<p>"Having relatives with MD/depression doesn't prove it's genetic. It could indicate that such families have ways of thinking that induce the illness."</p>
<p>That point may validly be drawn from the detail presented, but if you familiarize yourself with the research on the topic the conclusion is unmistakable: bipolar disorder is strongly genetically determined. Adoption and twin studies can provide a control for the rearing environment (with twins you vary the inheritance and compare monozygotic concordance rates v. dizygotic rates) and with adoption studies you vary the rearing environment).
