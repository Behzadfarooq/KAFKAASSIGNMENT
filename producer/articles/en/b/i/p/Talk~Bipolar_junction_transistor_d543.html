<p>"very sensitive to the current passing through the base."</p>
<p>I've heard it's actually the voltage that does it, in BJTs *and* FETs. current is just a byproduct in BJTs. - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 20:37, Jul 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can't have one without the other. Whether you see it as current-sensitive or voltage-sensitive just depends on which model you use. As a first approximation, a BJT can be modelled as a current-controlled current source. The proportionality constant between the base current and the collector current is β or h<sub>FE</sub>. This is taught in many lower-level electronics courses, since it is often sufficient for circuits operating in the forward-active mode. The <a href="../../../e/b/e/Ebers-Moll_ae5a.html" title="Ebers-Moll">Ebers–Moll</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/m/Gummel%E2%80%93Poon_model_c92f.html" title="Gummel–Poon model">Gummel–Poon models</a> use diode-like equations relating voltage to current. When using the current-controlled model, it's useful pedagogically to assign causation to the current, and when using the Ebers-Moll model it may be more useful to assign causation to the voltage. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 01:02, Jul 29, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Math models obscure the question as they simplify the concepts. Look to the full-blown details in order to understand how transistors actually work. As with any diode junction, the B-E junction contains an insulating "depletion layer" whose thickness is controlled by applied voltage. Make this insulating layer thicker, and the diode turns off (reverse biased), or make the layer thin enough, and charges are able to get across; the diode turns on. E.g. the diodes's current is controlled by the voltage applied to the diode's terminals. Now in a BJT there essentially are two currents in the same B-E diode junction: the base current and the Collector current, and... both are controlled by the thickness of the insulating B-E depletion layer. And the thickness of the B-E depletion layer is controlled by the applied voltage Vbe. THEREFORE, both the collector current Ic and the base current Ib are controlled by the Base-Emitter voltage Vbe. Things only SEEM confusing because Ib happens to be proportional to Ic. In reality Ib cannot affect Ic, instead both are affected by a third variable: the B-E voltage. Weird, eh? At the most fundamental level, BJTs and FETs are both controlled by voltage. However, in a BJT the main current must cross an insulating layer of variable thickness, while in an FET the main current remains in the conductive regions while the insulating regions encroach from the side. If a BJT acts like the dark lens in a pair of variable-density sunglasses, then an FET is more like a variable-aperature optical shutter or iris: a variable-sized empty hole. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 21:29, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can't agree with this. Whether a BJT is a current or voltage controlled device depends upon whether the base-emitter junction is current or voltage fed. If we use a current source, then the b-e voltage will float to whatever is appropriate to allow that current to flow. If we use a voltage source, then a current appropriate to the voltage will flow. So, in truth, the collector current is dependent on *both* the base-emitter voltage and current. However, given that beta (the current gain) is relatively constant, then it's easier to consider a BJT as a current controlled device: increase the base current by x, and the emitter current increases by beta times X. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Holmes_27df.html" title="User:Phil Holmes">Phil Holmes</a> 15:45, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree in principle with what you are trying to say here but I am uncomfortable with how you have said it. Specifically, the manner in which a two-port is driven does not in any way affect it's fundamental nature. Further, claiming that the collector current is dependent on both the base-emitter voltage and current is misleading. I am not aware of an equation for collector current that, to first order, has independent terms for both base-emitter voltage and current. But, you have also said in effect (and correctly) that the base-emitter voltage and base current are not independent. Thus, the collector current equation can be written as a function of base-emitter voltage OR base-emitter current.</dd>
<dd>Now, consider an ideal transconductance amplifier. By definition, the input current is zero so driving this amplifier with a current source is, let us say, a problem. In the non-ideal case however, the input current may be non-zero and is related to the input voltage (linearly in the case of a resistive input or more generally, non-linearly as in the case of BJT). Thus, by solving for the input voltage in terms of the input current, one can look at the non-ideal transconductance amplifier as a non-ideal current amplifier. This has nothing to do with the way the amplifier is driven - it is simply an alternate perspective on the transfer equations.</dd>

<dd>If the base-emitter of a BJT is driven directly by a current source, it is reasonable to adopt the current amp perspective. Since the voltage developed at the input is relatively small and nearly constant over a wide range of input current, the BJT is an (approximately) ideal linear current amplifier from this perspective. If a voltage source is used instead, it is reasonable to adopt the transconductance amp perspective. However, since the source current varies greatly and non-linearly over a small range of input voltage, the BJT is a highly non-linear non-ideal transconductance amplifier from this perspective. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 20:57, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It all boils down to whether we want to teach how transistors work, or whether we only want to solve some design equations. Never lose sight of the fact that the collector current is never <i>directly</i> controlled by the base current. If we drive the base with a constant current source, this creates a certain value of BE voltage. This BE voltage then determines the thickness of the depletion layer, which then controls the collector current. Yet if we could somehow hold Vbe constant while changing Ib, we'd find that Ib cannot control Ic. Be careful not to confuse the simplified "black box" mathematical model with the physics-based explanation of transistor behavior. Yes, simplified engineering equations say that Ic is determined by Ib, and these equations are incredibly useful... but these equations are "wrong" because they mislead us into believing that Ib directly affects Ic. It does not. Instead, Ib determies Vbe, and Vbe determines Ic, which shows that a transistor is a voltage-controlled device which pretends to be a current-controlled device. Many people seem to hate this fact, and try to talk themselves into believing that Ib directly affects Ic. But unfortunately there's no escaping the well-known transistor physics. If we want to know how transistors work, we have to confront the fact that the flow of Ib charges has no affect on the flow of Ic charges. Yet for simplified introductory classes where <i>nobody cares how transistors actually work,</i> it's fine to say that Ic is controlled by Ib... and then to never mention any complexities such as the fact that the control relies indirectly upon Vbe. On the other hand, if a more advanced textbook never mentions the Eber-Molls model, or worse, tries to use semiconductor physics concepts to "prove" that Ib affects Ic, then that author has a serious misconception, and is doing their readers a disservice. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 20:02, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not much of a mnemonic, but the terminal with the arrow is the emitter, and the arrow points in the direction of current flow. So if the arrow points from emitter to base, it implies the emitter is injecting positive charge into the base.

<p>Please see that I've changed the sentence that used to say "The proportion of electrons able to run the base "gauntlet" and make it to the collector is very sensitive to the current passing through the base." That's not correct - I've now clarified that this is fairly constant, but that gain occurs as a result of the emitter being more highly doped. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Holmes_27df.html" title="User:Phil Holmes">Phil Holmes</a> 08:47, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good catch. I was just reading that paragraph a day or to ago and the word 'proportion' didn't jump out at me at all. But don't forget that the light doping and the thinness of the base is also important to the gain. What is required is that the the diffusion length is long compared to the thickness of the base. This ensures that the odds of a charge carrier from the emitter recombining in the base region before reaching the base-collector junction are small. The smaller the odds, the greater the 'gain'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One thing that I don't see mentioned in the article is that once the charge carrier reaches the base-collector junction, it is the electric field within the depletion zone that sweeps the charge carrier into the collector region. In a way (this is sure to raise some eyebrows!), it can be said that the role of the forward biased base-emitter junction is to increase the reverse bias 'leakage' current through the base-collector junction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, there is a statement in the opening paragraph that I'm concerned about but that I'm hesitant to change. This statement is: "BJTs can be thought of as current-controlled resistors".

<dd>I just visited the hydraulic analogy page. I've often thought about this analogy so it is good to see you working on this. I have a suggestion for resistor. A small diameter pipe sounds like higher gauge wire. But a resistor is like an obstacle course for moving electrons so maybe a water resistor is like a restrictor plate. I'm picturing a disk with holes in it that fits inside the pipe. I doubt if such a thing is actually found in a hydraulic system but maybe it would help create a picture of electrical resistance in a resistor <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 03:06, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The analogy of a BJT to a current controlled resistor is very poor. Alfred's comment towards the top of this page reminded me of how much that grated when I read the article for the first time. To explain. The resistor we would be refering to would be between the collector and emitter terminals. With no base current, we put a voltage varying between 1 and 5 volts (say) between those terminals, and see what current flows. In this state, it would be negligible. We now apply some base current and do the same. The result we will see is that beta times the base current will flow at 5 volts, and there will be very little difference at 1 volt. (The Early effect means there is some difference). This is very different behaviour from a current controlled resistor. With one of those, I'd expect to see "infinite" resistance with no base current, and a current at 1 volt that is 1/5 the current at 5 volts with base current applied. My suggestion would be to delete the analogy. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Holmes_27df.html" title="User:Phil Holmes">Phil Holmes</a> 11:44, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We already agreed it's a poor analogy. I still think it's helpful for someone who has no concept of what it is. It's better than saying "a controlled current source" or "an amplifier".

<dd>Frankly stuck for a good analogy. Perhaps it would be best not to bother with analogy and simply say that a BJT is a device that controls current flow between the collector and emitter by using a control signal between base and emitter?

<p>I was wondering if much more could be said on how current and voltage gain are obtained in a transistor. I have no idea myself, and i couldn't find any good explanation of it. I too think of a transistor as a variable resistance, but that analogy obviously breaks down when applied to an amplifying transistor circuit.

<dd>Does this not explain it&#160;?</dd>
<dd><i>In normal operation, the emitter-base junction is forward biased and the base-collector junction is reverse biased. In an npn-type transistor for example, electrons from the emitter wander (or "diffuse") into the base. These electrons in the base are in the minority and although there are plenty of holes with which to recombine, the base is always made very thin so that most of the electrons diffuse over to the collector before they recombine with holes. The collector-base junction is reverse biased to prevent the flow of holes, but electrons are swept into the collector by the electric field around the junction. The proportion of electrons able to cross the base and reach the collector is approximately constant in most conditions. The heavy doping (low resistivity) of the emitter region and light doping (high resistivity) of the base region mean that many more electrons are injected into the base, and therefore reach the collector, than there are holes injected into the emitter. The base current is the sum of the holes injected into the emitter and the electrons that recombine in the base - both small proportions of the total current. Hence, a small change of the base current can translate to a large change in electron flow between emitter and collector. The ratio of these currents Ic/Ib, called the current gain, and represented by β or Hfe, is typically 100 or more.</i></dd>

<p>mm.. not really. I mean, it does indeed explain the general operation of a transistor, but the way its written is a bit hard to understand. On top of that, gain takes a huge backseat in this description. After reading that paragraph perhaps for the 4th time or so, I still can't imagine how gain would occur. Obviously small changes in the base voltage produce large changes in the amount of current allowed throgh the transistor - thats the whole point of the device. However, gain requires that *more* current or *more* voltage come out than comes in, which seems 120% unintuitive to me and I think is *so* important that it should have its own section on this page. Also I'm pretty sure that the base *current* is more of a byproduct than a cause, and that the base *voltage* is really what produces the transistor changes. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 22:25, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK then, does this explain it any better:</dd>
<dd><i>Math models obscure the question as they simplify the concepts. Look to the full-blown details in order to understand how transistors actually work. As with any diode junction, the B-E junction contains an insulating "depletion layer" whose thickness is controlled by applied voltage. Make this insulating layer thicker, and the diode turns off (reverse biased), or make the layer thin enough, and charges are able to get across; the diode turns on. E.g. the diodes's current is controlled by the voltage applied to the diode's terminals. Now in a BJT there essentially are two currents in the same B-E diode junction: the base current and the Collector current, and... both are controlled by the thickness of the insulating B-E depletion layer. And the thickness of the B-E depletion layer is controlled by the applied voltage Vbe. THEREFORE, both the collector current Ic and the base current Ib are controlled by the Base-Emitter voltage Vbe. Things only SEEM confusing because Ib happens to be proportional to Ic. In reality Ib cannot affect Ic, instead both are affected by a third variable: the B-E voltage. Weird, eh? At the most fundamental level, BJTs and FETs are both controlled by voltage. However, in a BJT the main current must cross an insulating layer of variable thickness, while in an FET the main current remains in the conductive regions while the insulating regions encroach from the side. If a BJT acts like the dark lens in a pair of variable-density sunglasses, then an FET is more like a variable-aperature optical shutter or iris: a variable-sized empty hole. --Wjbeaty 21:29, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>It does explain a transistor better. But I must be missing something fundemental, because I see no mention of gain in that description, nor can I see how gain arrises from that description. All of these descriptions seem to follow the variable-resistor analogy, while the concept of gain doesn't.

<dd>Well you do understand that current gain is the ratio of Ic/Ib&#160;?

</dl>
<p>That must be what I don't understand. I understand the mathematics of Ic/Ib, but I don't understand why that it is the case. What I think I don't understand is that you can get gain with a voltage-based variable resistor. I would have thought that that is impossible. If the variable resistor analogy is held, then by, say, increasing the voltage in the base, the resistance through the CE junction goes down. But no matter how much one varies a resistor, it seems to me that the limits are a gain of 1 and a gain of 0 (when the resistance is infinity and 0 respectively). It seems to me that the resistance would have to be negative for one to get gain out of it (ie a battery or something). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 00:28, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>gain <i>is a mathematical concept that arises from equations. In the physical world we have lots of electrons (in the npn) pushing to enter the emitter and cross base's ultra thin layer (since the depletion (insulating) layer has been removed by direct polarization.) Then electrons are projected to the collector's layer since the ultra thin base layer has not as much holes to capture every electron. In the collector an electromagnetic field attracts the 99% of electrons and</i> "collects" <i>them to the collector's exit. A negligible amount of charges goes to the base</i> "forming" <i>a little current (that can be seen as an unwanted side-effect, hence the MOSFETs.) The whole process can be modelled mathematically as an amplifier with a gain of quasi 100 (the 1 electron that goes out the base against the 99 that go out the collector.)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>BJT transistors are made in order to work this way efficiently. That's why they have a thin base layer (otherwise there would be no transistor effect) and an emitter more doped than the collector and very different surfaces (otherwise they would have been symmetrical and with major power losses.) --<a href="../../../z/i/m/User%7EZimbricchio_ffcb.html" title="User:Zimbricchio">Zimbricchio</a> 13:09, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is another perspective of the bjt gain: For a well constructed transistor when a single carrier (hole for an NPN) is injected from the base into the base-emitter space charge layer, you will get approximately beta times as many carriers (electrons for an NPN) injected from the emitter into the space charge layer. The reason for the larger number of carriers from the emitter is the higher doping of the emitter. Once the carriers injected from the emitter reach the base most will diffuse through and end up at the collector. You get more than beta injected from the emitter because you lose a few due to recombination in the base, hence the requirement for a thin base. The imbalance of carriers from the base compared to the emitter is the primary cause for current gain. This explanation covers the case for an upside down transistor (where you try to use the collector as the emitter) where the beta is about one because the base and collector doping is comparable.</p>
<p>This explanation also is relevant to the current control vs voltage control discussion because it shows that the factor that controls the emitter current is the base current, the number of carriers injected from the base to emitter.</p>

<p>Also, isn't it true that a PN junction necessarily 'employs' both types of majority carriers? It might be misleading to make this statement especially in the opening paragraph. It is usually said that the BJT is a minority carrier device for the reason that the charge carrier current making the greatest contribution to the total electric current is the minority carrier in the base of the BJT. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 13:52, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>a) I changed it to 'volts must exist' to remove the impression that you can just put any old battery across the BE junct. as the diagram shows. Because of the exponential relationship of current to voltage, current can vary tremendously with a few mV change. I admit its not the best wording! But I cant alter the diag to include a base resistor.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>b) I mentioned 2 types of charge carrier to try to explain the name <i>Bipolar</i> Junction Transistor (as opposed to FET which has only one type of charge carrier) Again this may need rewording if you think its not clear.</dd>

<dd>Anybody know what is meant by 'high' doping and 'low' doping? Is the writer trying to differentiate between the majority carrier types in the base(P region) and the emitter(N region). If so, it is not explained very well. <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 23:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If I were to use those terms, I would be refering to high or low doping densities. The base region is lightly doped which means that the mobile hole and electron densities are relatively similar. That is, the majority carriers aren't that great of a majority. On the other hand, the emitter is highly doped meaning that there are very few minority carriers compared to the majority carriers. BTW, I like your addition of the word 'appreciable' but I would suggest that you parenthetically add what appreciable <i>is</i> in this context. I would think that something in the neighborhood of 1mA would be about right. Regarding your change of 'emitter' to 'base' - if it makes you feel better then so be it. Both are correct as long as <span class="texhtml">β</span> is finite. Here's a question for you to ponder though. Let <span class="texhtml">β</span> go to infinity and ask what current does <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>E</i></sub></span> control? <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 01:44, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was thinking of the case when the collector current is small - but in that case, Ib = ~ Ie, so I'm not sure now! I guess I was thinking of the B-E junction alone.<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 20:21, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure what your notation is here. Are these small-signal currents? Actually, it looks like the notation used on the original schematic that I have now modified. That is, for DC (constant) voltages and currents, the letter and subscripts should both be capitalized. So given that, you are correct that <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> is proportional to <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>E</i></sub></span> as long as <span class="texhtml">β</span> is finite and the BJT is in the active region of operation. So, it is equally correct to say that <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>E</i></sub></span> controls <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> or <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>E</i></sub></span> or <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>C</i></sub></span>. However, if you let <span class="texhtml">β</span> tend to infinity (which is not so farfetched - the small signal model for a JFET 'looks' like the small signal model of a BJT with <span class="texhtml">β</span> set to infinity), <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span> is zero. In this limit, it is clear that fundamentally, <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>E</i></sub></span> controls <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>E</i></sub></span> I'm teaching a junior level class on small signal modeling of transistor circuits this semester. It's good to clear out the cobwebs and review this stuff. It's amazing how much more sense it makes when you have to explain to someone else. I remember reading somewhere that a prominent theoretical physicist would, whenever he was stumped on some difficult problem, explain the problem to his dog. His dog would just sit there and look at him without interrupting and, as he would try to explain the problem to his dog, he would invariably see the resolution to his difficulty. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfred_Centauri_dbab.html" title="User:Alfred Centauri">Alfred Centauri</a> 20:52, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I was intending DC currents, but I've always been sloppy about the capitalisation I use (I just cant remember them all (any?). The problem does not practically occur in JFETs in that most reasonable voltages applied between gate and source won't cause a large current to flow and blow up your transistor junction( unless you apply the wrong polarity).-- that is the point I was tring to make.

<p>I did not know why I'm putting so much info on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a>, slaps forehead. The transistor page can get smaller if I link to bjt and fet. The following paste will be highly edited on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a> now. It is here for future use.</p>
<p>The <b>bipolar junction transistor</b> (BJT) was the first type of transistor to be commercially mass-produced. Bipolar transistors are so named because the main conduction channel uses both <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron.html" title="Electron">electrons</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron_hole.html" title="Electron hole">holes</a> to carry the main electric current. Two <a href="../../../p/-/n/P-n_junction.html" title="P-n junction">p-n junctions</a> exist inside the BJT, <i>colector-base junction</i> and <i>base-emitter junction</i>. When the BJT is not powered, the junctions are in unbiased <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_equilibrium.html" title="Thermal equilibrium">thermal equilibrium</a> with a <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depletion_region.html" title="Depletion region">depletion region</a> formed at each junction. The arrangement of greatest interest is when the B-E junction is forward <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltage_bias.html" title="Voltage bias">biased</a> and the C-B junction is reverse <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltage_bias.html" title="Voltage bias">biased</a> because this makes amplification possible. Applying a forward bias voltage to the B-E junction unbalances the thermal equilibrium of the junction. In an NPN type BJT, the p-type base begins to inject surplus holes (holes not required to maintain thermal equilibrium) into the emitter where they quickly recombine in the n-type material at the emitter contact. Similarly, the emitter injects surplus electrons into the base. If not for the close proximity of the reverse-biased C-B junction, the B-E junction would behave like a <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diode.html" title="Diode">diode</a>–injected emitter electrons would recombine in the base and transistor action would not occur. However, in the NPN BJT, the electrons which are injected from the emitter into the base <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diffuse.html" title="Diffuse">diffuse</a> across the very narrow base region before most of them have time to recombine within the base region. The depletion region of the nearby reverse biased C-B junction contains an electric field, which sweeps any electrons close to it into the n-type collector, where they recombine with holes at the collector contact. Through this action, only a small amount of carriers in the base (holes) are needed to cause a large amount of carriers in the emitter (electrons) to flow through to the collector.</p>

<p>that diagram looks like its meant to represent a particular highly complex process but it doesn't specify which one and really serves more to confuse then inform. imo the first diagram in the article should show a minimal bjt and possiblly have diagrams of more complex processes further down. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 03:15, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>At the moment, part of the article reads "By varying the voltage across the base-emitter terminals very slightly, the current allowed to flow between the emitter and the collector, which are both heavily doped and hence low resistivity regions, can be varied." AFAIK, this is incorrect. The emitter region of the BJT is the highest doped region, whilst the collector region has a relatively low dopant concentration --<a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspanton_1ccf.html" title="User:Rspanton">Rspanton</a> 00:22, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Correct. I've deleted the reference to doping at this point to correct this.

<p>Yes, that was an example, I think the article should include a section with a brief description of the models, with a picture and the description of the main parameters on every type of signals. Those models include not only the hybrid pi model but also the Ebers-Moll model or the T Model (I don't know more), that section would later include links to the main articles and also explain the advantages and applications of each model. The article lacks that kind of information and much more.

<dd>Yes . One page on Transistor 'hybrid pi' model, one page on Transistor 'T' model. (I think Ebers Moll is the same as the T model).

<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the Ebers Moll and the T Model are separate models, the Ebers Moll model is used to predict the operation of the BJT in all modes (active and saturation).

<dd>Forgive me if you already know this, but if you're ECE, you should get comfortable with the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_signal_model.html" title="Small signal model">small signal model</a> concept. In analog design, you have steady-state (DC) and small-signal (AC) models. You need DC and AC versions of each parameter, because each one is used for different purposes. DC is needed to find the operating point, output range, etc. AC is needed to find the gain. In reality AC and DC operation are happening at the same time; it's just more convenient to analyze them separately. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako098765_2591.html" title="User:Mako098765">mak</a><i><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMako098765_ef35.html" title="User talk:Mako098765">o</a></i> 21:33, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've added that there is a big difference between the Beta in forward or reverse operation mode, however I am not entirely sure of the numbers. I believe the ideal forward operation current gain is mostly about 300, but the 100...1000 region is probably correct. In reverse the gain is surely smaller than 1?

OK, I read that discussion, but I don't agree that a consensus was reached. I think we need to add a section to the article about voltage- and current-control views.

<p>I think the issue of <i>truth</i> is a bit misplaced here. It's all about description of physical processes, in which no part of the situation can be called the <i>cause</i> as opposed to the <i>effect</i>. A better model, if you want truth, is the charge-controlled model, since it explains collector current as a function of minority charge concentration in the base region, and therefore contains photo-transistor effects, turn-off recovery-time effects, etc. Voltage and current are just the terminal properties we use to explain charge in the base region. Maybe we should write that up, too. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 19:59, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I added it, to the section on current control and voltage control, as you noticed and already mutilated. Please don't think that the current-control and voltage-control models should be associated with driving the base from a current source or voltage source (the latter being a ridiculous thing to attempt with a BJT, notwithstanding the funny diagram that shows it that way). In general, the transistor is in a circuit that needs to be analyzed as a whole, and the current-control model almost always makes that job easier if the circuit is intended to be approximately linear. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 21:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apology accepted, as Stephen Colbert likes to say. When you changed "(current control)" to "(if unusually driven by a current source)", you destroyed the parallel explanatory structure of the sentence to insert your irrelevant opinion of what kind of base drive might be usual. It makes no sense anyway, as it seems to imply that you think maybe the base would be driven by a voltage source. As I said, how the base is driven is not relevant to the alternative ways of modeling the transistor action. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 21:33, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If by conductors you mean semiconductors with free majority carriers in them, then yes, 7 is OK. If by a layer of insulating material you mean a depletion region, in which the majority carriers are absent, then yes, 8 is OK. And 9 is OK; you can make the depletion region thin or nil by forward biasing the junction. So yes, that's all fine. However, it does not make a case for "THE TRANSISTOR IS NOT CONTROLLED BY CURRENT". Anyone who uses BJTs knows that you control the collector current by the base current, and that you get a current gain of beta, and that the base–emitter junction has to be forward biased to get such a current. As I said in the article, the voltage-control and current-control views are related to each other by the b–e junction V–I curve, and these are both simplifications of the internal processes of the transistor. It is not necessary to deny one to use the other. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 23:52, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see a bit of confusion here, and it seems to be caused by semantics. People can argue forever over whether the transistor is "voltage controlled" or "current controlled." And each side means something different by that. And each side is trying to win an argument, not trying to clarify matters. (They already know the truth. In any religious battle, the first rule is to never question the viewpoint you're defending.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Instead, what if we ask a different question: how do transistors work?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In explaining the transistor effect, if we drill down through various ideas, we find a central concept: when the base terminal injects charged particles into the base region, there is no way for the motion of those particles to influence the other charged particles being sent out by the emitter. There is no mechanism by which the base charge-flow can directly affect the emitter's charge-flow. Yet if we inject a tiny base current, we obtain a huge emitter current! The hfe parameter is no illusion. Base current obviously does control emitter current. How? It's because any change in Ib <b>absolutely requires</b> a change in Vbe... and Ie is determined by Vbe because Vbe determines the thickness of the depletion layer. Base current can control emitter current through a multi-step process involving Vbe and the depletion layer. Charged particles injected by the base do in fact influence the charged particles sent out by the emitter. They just can't do it directly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So is a transistor controlled by current? Yes, if by "controlled," we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the base current. Is it "controlled" by voltage? Yes, if by "controlled" we mean that the emitter current can be changed by changing the value of Vbe. And those people who choose one side or the other can fight forever about the "right answer." They'll almost come to blows over the <b>O</b>ne <b>T</b>rue <b>P</b>ath to transistor enlightenment, since their own viewpoint is obviously good and true and right, while the opposing side are all a bunch of worshippers of Darkness and Confusion whose blasphemy must be ridiculed.

<dd>On the other hand, it's hard to become a victim of either meme if you laugh at religious wars. But that's a very difficult habit to teach. Instead, it's easier to take some devout "Current Believers" and shatter mental grip of that meme by demonstrating an alternate religion. So some become outspoken "Voltage Worshippers." With luck they'll eventually see the folly in either viewpoint, and be immunized against both, yet accept both. The "Transistor Zen" practitioner views BJTs from both viewpoints, switching back and forth as needed, while also seeing the duality as an illusion and rejecting the notion that a single best answer can exist. --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 03:03, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course! The voltage-control view is "right" because it gives us a deep grasp of the transistor effect. If we watch the impact that the depletion layer has upon transistor currents, then we can figure out how transistors work. But while designing circuitry, unfortunately the voltage viewpoint is far less useful than the current-control viewpoint, because current-control gives us a powerful rule of thumb called hfe.--<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 06:10, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no real answer to the question, though.

<p>Does a wheelbarrow accelerate because you push it, or does the accelerating wheelbarrow cause you to be pushing it? Surely the whole point is whether "control" means "physically control" (i.e. a belief of cause and effect) or "mathematically control" (i.e. apply this function to that value). It is very hard to comprehend a transistor being "physically" controlled by current, because our bodily experience tells us that force causes motion/acceleration; therefore voltage causes current, and so transistors are (physically) voltage-controlled. However the mathematics is not tied to a physical interpretation, and by rearranging equations you can model transistors as current-controlled or voltage-controlled; however this is completely detached from a physical interpretation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't really have much bodily experience with pushing via alteration of electric potentials, so they're both abstract to me.

<p>LC reverted my claim that the term BJT comes from requiring junctions of both semiconductor polarities. I found the current claim not credible, because "the main conduction channel employs both electrons and holes" is not true; only minority carriers flow through the base to the collector; or there some other notion of "main conduction channel" that I'm missing. So I'm trying to find a reference, and having trouble. I found this one <a href="http://www.semiconductorsinfo.net/bjt.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.semiconductorsinfo.net/bjt.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> that says the BJT is a current-controlled resistor, but that sure won't fly with LC.</p>
<p>I'm willing to believe I got it wrong, but it's also wrong as written. Perhaps it can be corrrected to say that both types of carriers are involved, since there is a small component of the opposite type in the base–emitter current. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 02:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In scanning over this article, it seems that it is very heavy on BJT usage in circuit topology and general application, but extremely light on the actual device operation and the various processes that govern its behavior. For example, the sadly short "Explanation" section discusses an NPN BJT in forward active mode but never makes it lucid to the reader that this is the case. I think this section should be rewritten and generalized into something better. I'd propose bringing in a simple energy band diagram as well as one or two figures showing carrier distributions under the common operation modes (active, saturation, and cutoff; inverted mode is rarely used). Personally, I find it highly useful to visually show the six or so significant current components within an active-mode BJT when explaining its operation.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this article is nearly totally about BJTs in active mode (as it probably should be), but never makes it clear that this is the only mode that really provides useful current gain or why. That seems to be a fundamental failure since the primary use of BJTs in modern devices is as a high gain amplifier. The article seems often guilty of making statements without explaining them. For example, the section about the Ebers Moll model mentions "normal" operation but doesn't define what "normal" is. From the rest of the article, the reader might be led to assume that "normal" means "forward active". We also have very brief mention of junction breakdown without any explanation of the basic breakdown mechanics. These should at least be briefly summarized, perhaps with a nod to the PN junction article (assuming there's a decent explanation of breakdown mechanics there... I haven't looked).</p>
<p>Then too, there is the discussion of the hybrid parameter BJT model. Therein it is explained that the model is useful for "small signal" analysis, but never what small signal conditions are or why they must be maintained to keep the transistor in forward active mode (it also neglects to mention that the H-parameter model is only useful in active mode). Maybe a simple common-emitter single-BJT amplifier with a resistor biasing network would be good for illustrative purposes here? I dunno; I'm admittedly more keen on device operation and design than circuit topology. A full discussion of a single transistor amplifier might be too far out of this article's scope anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to vent some of my complaints with this article before I messed with it too much. I made a few changes here and there and decided I should check in on the talk page before going much further. I don't want to step on anyone's toes or anything, just make some needed improvements to the article. If nobody has any objections, I'll probably try to write a decent explanation of BJT operation in terms of carrier concentrations and movement. Of course, I'm far from an expert on semiconductor physics (just a humble research student), so your feedback is greatly appreciated! -- <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberpenguin_c2a8.html" title="User:Uberpenguin">uberpenguin</a> <code>@ 2006-08-22 05:49Z</code></p>

<p>This whole section is sort of a mess, and I thought we might as well talk about it since there seems to be a disagreement. The section is very confusing and, on the whole, misleading because it sort of combines an explanation of operation regions with small signal modeling. In reality there are four well defined regions of operation (or biasing modes) for a BJT:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Forward active</b> — EB junction forward biased, BC junction reverse biased</li>
<li><b>Reverse active</b> (<b>inverted</b>) — EB junction reverse biased, BC junction forward biased</li>
<li><b>Saturation</b> — Both junctions forward biased</li>
<li><b>Cutoff</b> — Both junctions reverse biased</li>
</ul>
<p>"Linear" is NOT a BJT operation region (it is for the MOSFET). I can only assume that whomever wrote that was combining or confusing small and large signal models. Operation mode of a BJT depends on nothing but the biasing of the two junctions; things like external current limiting circuitry do not directly affect the operation region (unless they change the biasing of one of the junctions). Most of the time BJTs will be biased squarely into the forward active region, wherein the common small signal models later described in the page actually apply. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-09-29T22:49Z</code></p>

<p>While it is true that a transistor is in cut-off region when both junctions are reverse biased, that is not as strictly necessary condition. Furthermore, it is not even typical. Consider, for example, the grounded-emitter switch configuration. When the base is at or near ground, it is in cut-off; it is not possible to reverse bias the base–emitter junction in a circuit that can't pull the base below ground. So let's just say what's true and verifiable, OK? <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 20:53, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I stated in my edit comment, your view seems to reflect a simplified CVD model of the junctions in a bipolar transistor, not the actual physics of the device. If you'd like, I would be happy to provide references from three modern semiconductor physics textbooks and one modern microelectronic circuits textbook that verify exactly what I asserted. I think this is merely a conflict of terminology understanding, since some googling confirmed that a few sources claim that cutoff exists for small forward bias on either junction. However, this isn't correct usage of terminology and is not claimed by any semiconductor device design book I'm aware of.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Taking the example you gave (if I understand you correctly, and assuming an NPN device), the transistor is actually in forward-active mode for small input voltage. Since <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>E</i></sub></span> is very small (as you said, close to ground potential), very little electron current diffuses across the EB junction, and there is therefore a relatively small minority carrier perturbation in the base to provide carriers to be swept over the BC junction to the output. Now, once the potential at the base becomes larger than a few multiples of the thermal voltage (<span class="texhtml"><i>k</i><i>T</i> / <i>q</i></span>), the current through the EB junction quickly becomes significant. This current is amplified and a larger current is pulled through the collector and load. Obviously this causes a voltage drop at the collector, which quickly ends up at a lower potential than the base as the collector current rises. When this occurs, the device goes from forward active to saturation and the collector current doesn't change much with increasing <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>E</i></sub></span>. So you see, the simple emitter-grounded BJT switch is in forward-active when "off" and saturation when "on". The "turn on" voltage of such a switch is a few times the thermal voltage, which is approximately where diffusion current starts to dominate over the small R-G current in the EB junction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I encourage you to look at how TTL works; it uses transistors primarily in saturation and reverse-active mode, but not cut-off. Anyway, to show good faith, I will not make any further changes to the section until we've talked things out to your satisfaction. Please let me know if you'd like me to cite those textbooks I mentioned. I'd also be happy to sketch some potential diagrams to illustrate what I have explained if that will help. I realize that you have much more electronics experience than myself, and I mean no disrespect to you. However, semiconductor device research and physics is my area, I think I've provided a clear enough explanation, and I'd be happy to cite some sources that confirm proper usage of the four BJT biasing regions' terms. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-09-30T23:30Z</code></dd>

<dd>Matt, since in your first couple of rounds you left the statement "the base–emitter voltage is too small for any significant emitter current to flow. In typical BJTs manufactured from silicon, this is the case below 0.5 V or so," I assumed you had no quarrel with that; your additions narrowed the scope of cut-off a lot from there. So, which is it? I do understand semiconductor physics well enough, but there may be a disagreement over the terminology, among various texts. I can see the logic of what you're saying, which is that it's in forward active region even when the current is too small to measure, by far. Please do show me the references. I showed a couple that disagreed, and didn't find any that defined cut-off the way you want to. I did find some that said the transistor is in cut-off when the junctions are reversed biased, which is obviously true, but they did not specifically say that the cut-off region is limited to that condition. That is, reverse bias is sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for cut-off. Who is the authority on such terminology? Furthermore, if we decide to define cut-off that way, should we then change the part about transistors used as switches, since in many cases (e.g. H-bridge drivers) they will never be in cutoff by that definition? <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 23:42, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dick, I cited my four references in the below section. If you'd REALLY like, I'll try to make some photocopies of relevant pages from the texts, but that will take some time (two of the books are lent out to friends right now and I don't own a scanner) and I'd rather not have to do it if possible. I don't have any quarrel with the statement you quoted, but the magnitude of current flow does not determine the biasing modes of the BJT in any semiconductor physics text I have seen. A quick google search found numerous online documents that confirm my voltage-only definition of biasing modes, but I hate referencing online documents, which is why I mentioned the text books. It seems that the only sites which agree with the current-related definition of biasing/operation regions are those that use a CVD-like simplification for the transistor. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, because that's a useful simplification for small signal modeling, and obviously small signal models are what we typically use for real electronics design, not the full mathematical models. However, I have never seen operation modes defined with anything but the signs of <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>E</i><i>B</i></sub></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>C</i></sub></span>. Personally, I think these definitions make the most sense because they directly define the positioning of quasi fermi levels within a device, which ultimately is what determines the rates of drift, diffusion, and R-G current. Of course, at a circuit level potential and current are so closely related that it's a difficult distinction to make, so I certainly acknowledge that there's a fine line to tread here. Anyway, I'm sticking with my definition as being backed up by a number of semiconductor physics texts, and I will provide copies of my references if that's what it will take to change your mind. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-09-30T23:57Z</code></dd>

<dd>P.S. - I'm not contesting at all that the transistor is being used as a switch in the described configuration, just how we define the device biasing regions. There's obviously no perfect solid-state switch (especially with a bipolar device), and the small "off" base current is negligible regardless of what we choose to call the transistor's biasing mode at that point. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-10-01T00:03Z</code></dd>

<dd>P.S. (again) - Perhaps we can strike a balance between the voltage/current definitions. The more I think about it, the more it seems to me that the voltage explanation makes slightly more sense and is easier to quantify, but the current definition has more to do with the operation of the device within a circuit and is therefore equally valid. Would it be acceptible to you if I added something like "the biasing regions overlap for very small applied voltages" and briefly explain that this has to do with the exponential nature of the I-V relationships? -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-10-01T00:26Z</code></dd>

Neaman, and "Microelectronc Circuit Design" by R.C. Jaeger and T.N. Blalock. All of these quite clearly agree with my proposed text. I also reference google, which will quickly verify the biasing conditions for the four BJT operation regions. I can provide photocopies from some of these books upon request, if necessary, but I encourage you to just google it since a quick search for "bjt biasing modes" will verify all of this (ignoring the handful of sites that use a CVD model simplification for teaching transistors in circuits without bothering with actual device physics... a pox on them for the "lie to students" method of simplification).</p>

<hr />
<p>Bipolar transistors have four distinct regions of operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Forward-active</b> (or simply, <b>active</b>): The emitter-base junction is forward biased and the base-collector junction is reverse biased. Most bipolar transistors are designed to afford the greatest common-emitter current gain, <span class="texhtml">β<sub><i>f</i></sub></span> in forward-active mode. If this is the case, the collector-emitter current is approximately <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportionality_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Proportionality (mathematics)">proportional</a> to the base current, but many times larger, for small base current variations.</li>
<li><b>Reverse-active</b> (or <b>inverse-active</b> or <b>inverted</b>): By reversing the biasing conditions of the forward-active region, a bipolar transistor goes into reverse-active mode. In this mode, the emitter and collector regions switch roles. Since most BJTs are designed to maximise current gain in forward-active mode, the <span class="texhtml">β<sub><i>f</i></sub></span> in inverted mode is very small. This transistor mode is seldom used, usually being considered only for failsafe conditions and some types of bipolar logic.</li>
<li><b>Saturation</b>: With both junctions forward-biased, a BJT is in saturation mode and facilitates high current conduction from the emitter to the collector. This mode corresponds to a logical "on", or a closed switch.</li>
<li><b>Cutoff</b>: In cutoff, biasing conditions opposite of saturation (both junctions reverse biased) are present. There is very little current flow, which corresponds to a logical "off", or an open switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these regions are well defined for sufficiently large applied voltage, they overlap somewhat for small (less than a few hundred millivolts) biases. For example, forward active mode may be alternatively viewed as cutoff mode for very small biasing of the emitter-base junction or as saturation mode for very small biasing of the base-collector junction. However, transistor behavior in these regions is usually only considered in transient analysis and is avoided for principle device operation.</p>

<dd>On the one hand, you're right, but on the other there is a balance to be struck here. This is (supposedly) an encyclopedia article, and is therefore an overview and summary of the topic. Simple and methodical (as long as its correct) is often preferable to a full explanation for obvious reasons. The biggest thing I've gotten out of this dialogue is that the definitions of the operation regions are less universal than I had originally thought, so I don't really see a problem with us picking a simple explanation as long as it is a correct one. Industry usage? I learned analog electronics from a guy who was a senior analog engineer at TI for several years. He never indicated that there is any other way to reference biasing regions than the voltage-sign method. I learned semiconductor device operation and physics from the guy who I now work for, someone whose research is all about semiconductor devices (HBTs, APDs, MEMS). Same story. If you have alternative experiences to relate, I'm all for hearing them. I'm certainly not suggesting that alternative definitions of the biasing regions are less valid, far from it. I'm merely asserting that for two equally correct explanations, the simpler one is preferable. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-10-01T01:49Z</code></dd>

<dd>Matt, good job. I just wanted to know what the references really did say exactly. The photos were one way to show me. Be sure to ref those, or at least one, in the article. One thing still unclear to me is how you get the pulldown transistor to have a reverse-biased B-E junction in a TTL logic gate. The paragraph that spans the Jaeger pages says the cut-off region is most commonly used in logic switching as TTL, but I don't see how it can be with that definition. Same goes for RTL and DTL circuits; all use the grounded-emitter configuration, where the B-E junction can never be reverse biased. So this story retains a nagging inconsistency. Pierett is not so explicity self-contradictory, but close. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 05:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's a twist: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0970951175&amp;id=vajziWdo_JoC&amp;pg=SA3-PA77&amp;lpg=SA3-PA77&amp;dq=transistor+cutoff+region&amp;sig=yAlIPeTweuS6U-sbC95JGlYfg-4" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0970951175&amp;id=vajziWdo_JoC&amp;pg=SA3-PA77&amp;lpg=SA3-PA77&amp;dq=transistor+cutoff+region&amp;sig=yAlIPeTweuS6U-sbC95JGlYfg-4" rel="nofollow">this book</a> says that VBE &lt; 0.6 V is "reverse biased". Is that the way you're thinking of it? I always assumed that reverse biased meant a negative relative potential, but this is one way to make the definition as used in your references not contradict the idea that the cutoff region is used in logic switching. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 06:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm... Well that's a rather interesting way of looking at it. I guess they are going from the perspective that the junction's built-in potential works against applied bias and are calling "zero bias" what I've usually heard termed "flatband voltage". However, I've <i>never</i> heard anyone call bias anything but <i>applied</i> voltage; all of the equations I've ever used explicitly separate biasing voltage and built-in voltage. I think that book is providing a very non-conventional explanation.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'm not entirely sure how to answer your logic question. Digital logic frankly isn't my thing. I thought that under TTL the BJTs are in saturation and reverse active mode. I know ECL uses BJTs in cutoff, but I don't really have an off-the-cuff answer for you there... I guess I could thumb through the relevant pages to see if I can find an explanation. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-10-01T06:18Z</code></dd>

<dd>I would still feel better if you added text to indicate that the definition of cutoff is sometimes extended to include the region of essentially zero current even if the junction biases are zero or slightly forward. This makes it compatible with statements of cutoff as the "off" state in logic circuits. Or, you can go ahead and add your text, and I might "improve" it in that direction. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 20:40, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's what the text about region overlap was intended to address, but feel free to modify the text once I add it to the article. I'd say that zero bias isn't a situation worth talking about much since it is only theoretically attainable (that is, there will always be some tiny potential difference in a circuit). We talk about it when describing device state in equilibrium, but the entire "operation/bias region" notion implies a non-equilibrium condition. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-10-02T21:11Z</code></dd>

<p>In my recent edits to this article I've noticed that convention is sometimes switched around. I think we should introduce and adopt convention for common terms in this article, if only to save us the trouble of typing very common phrases out over and over.</p>
<p>My suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use NPN transistors for most of the examples. We'd need only have a few lines explaining what the primary differences between the two types are. The operation region section should also note that "forward" and "reverse" biasing is always with respect to the p side of the junction.</li>
<li>NPN convention means that we'd probably use <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>E</i></sub></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i><sub><i>B</i><i>C</i></sub></span> to denote junction voltage (unless explicitly talking about PNP), since these are positive for NPN forward biasing.</li>
<li>Similarly, <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i><sub><i>C</i><i>E</i></sub></span> for collector-emitter current since this is the direction of the majority conventional current flow in an NPN device in active mode.</li>
<li>The emitter-base/base-emitter junction will be referred to as the "BE junction"</li>
<li>Collector-base/base-collector: "BC junction"</li>
</ul>
<p>Since these conventions are pretty arbitrary, I'd be happy with pretty much anything so long as its consistant, so let me know. I think maintaining consistancy with these terms will help the article's readability a good bit. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-10-01T00:41Z</code></p>

<p>The given reference is a rather oldish book (which may explain the germanium transistor example) which I do not have access to. Comments on this?

<dd>Let me briefly express my concern a little better. If we were to call avalanching (or how about "breakdown" since the Zener process often is not insignificant) a mode of operation, why not also call high frequency gain cutoff a mode of operation? How about the catastrophic high-current-magic-blue-smoke-releasing mode of operation? You'll forgive my sarcasm, but the point is that modes of operation are arbitrarily defined by some standard, and the standard I've always seen used doesn't really take into account non-idealities of the transistor and mostly concentrates on biasing conditions. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-11-02T03:44Z</code></dd>

<dd>I've seen common base gain written with several subscripts, but upon reading the section I've realized that there is some confusion of terms here. The article as it currently stands is incorrect in a couple of places. <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>T</i></sub></span> is usually the symbol (I've seen) used for the base transport factor, and is almost correctly defined. It is actually the proportion of the <i>majority carrier</i> current component in the collector to the <i>majority carrier</i> current component in the emitter. So for a PNP transistor, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/b/1/2b16a8ceb8e47fc33a43760fd072d05e.png" alt="\alpha_T = {I_{Cp} \over I_{Ep}}" />. The bigger problem with the article is how it defines <span class="texhtml">β<sub><i>F</i></sub></span> in terms of <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>T</i></sub></span>. This is incorrect since <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>T</i></sub></span> is NOT the same thing as common-base DC current gain. If we use <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>d</i><i>c</i></sub></span> for the common base current gain (or whatever subscript you fancy), <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>d</i><i>c</i></sub> = γα<sub><i>T</i></sub></span>. <span class="texhtml">γ</span> is the emitter injection efficiency; the ratio of the majority carrier current in the emitter to the total emitter current, or <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/8/1/1812f2cdbad063700dd545ca3987f51e.png" alt="\gamma = {I_{Ep} \over {I_{Ep} + I_{En}}}" /> for the PNP. Obviously this is very close to 1 in a typical highly doped emitter. Now, defining <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>d</i><i>c</i></sub></span> in this manner, the relationship between "alpha" and beta as given in the article is correct: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/5/e/35e8cd5e6efdf95cbcad751446f0596b.png" alt="\beta_F = {\alpha_{dc} \over {1 - \alpha_{dc}}}" />. Going back to the earlier alpha definitions, you can see that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/4/2/342bf2d803ddb285f8536c37b66698ea.png" alt="\alpha_{dc} = {I_{Cp} \over I_{E}}" /> (again for the PNP). So there's obviously a mix-up of terms in this section, especially as regards the base transport factor and the common base DC current gain (which are not the same thing). I'll try to fix things. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-12-10T19:49Z</code></dd>

<dl>
<dd>P.S. - You'll notice I threw the word "approximately" into the article text a few times. This is because these simplified relationships do not take into account unwanted current flow between the collector and base due to thermal generation at that reverse-biased junction. Normally you can ignore this current component since it is very small, but for very tiny base current, RG currents dominate and you can observe their effects. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-12-10T20:10Z</code></dd>

<p>Matt, do you have a reference for your definition of alpha? I always thought it was just the C/E current ratio. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 21:01, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, there are two "alphas" here; the one you're defining is the DC common-base current gain (neglecting very low-current effects). The gist of all that I wrote is that <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>T</i></sub></span>, the base transport factor, is not the same thing as <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>d</i><i>c</i></sub></span> or <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>F</i></sub></span>, the common-base DC current gain. As for sources... I'll go with the three textbooks I have; Semiconductor Device Fundamentals (Pierret 1996), Microelectronic Circuit Design (Jaeger, 2004), Semiconductor Physics and Devices 2nd Ed (Neamen, some year I don't remember). You can likely google the terms "base transport factor" and "emitter injection efficiency" to verify what I've said, as well. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2006-12-10T22:41Z</code></dd>

<dd>Can you be more specific? This isn't the <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">Simple English Wikipedia</a>, so the article cannot be expected to omit technical terminology where appropriate. I don't think that this article is excessively jargony, but it isn't written for the lay man. Some understanding of basic electromagnetics, semiconductor physics, and circuit theory is probably required to totally understand the contents, and frankly one can't hope to gain a good understanding of what a BJT is and how it works without some prerequisite knowledge. I would stick to the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a> article if you're looking for a less technical overview; I think that article does a slightly better job explaining the broad picture. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2007-03-16T02:32Z</code></dd>
