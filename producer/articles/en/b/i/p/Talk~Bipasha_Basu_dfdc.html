<p>Hello friends, Bipasha does not mean "deep, dark desire" in bengali or any other language. Bipasha (or Vipasha) means one who has broken the bonds (vi/bi = "anti", pash = bonds). Also, Bipasha is another name for the river Beas that originates from the Himalayas. In fact, the word Beas is a corruption of the word Vipasha/Bipasha. - Language Master</p>

<p>An anon added lots of material, which I edited down severely. I removed several claims that Bipasha is Bollywood's first sex symbol! Well, Helen comes to mind, and there were probably vamps before her. Bollywood has always sold skin and sex appeal, it's just that the ground rules seem to have shifted recently. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:28, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I rewrote, trying to make the article more organized. I left out some information I didn't think contributed much to the article. The actress wanted to be a doctor when she was little? I don't think childhood aspirations count for much in biographies unless they have a connection with one's later life. Ditto the rambling tale about how she met someone connected with the movie industry in a hotel lobby and consequently entered a modeling contest. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:45, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You left this message:</p>
<p><i>Come on...if there is a page on Bips, could you guys at least put up her correct birthday???</i></p>
<p>You put it up after erasing a previous message. Ordinarily, you don't mess with anything on a talk page except stuff that you've contributed. Also, it helps to sign your messages. You can do that by putting four tildes in a row ~~~~. If you're logged in as a user, the software will add a signature for you, replacing the tildes.</p>
<p>So far as we know, that IS the correct birthday. I checked. It's the birthday that's up at IMDB, the Internet Movie Data Base. Could you link to the websites that contradict that? We need some outside proof, you understand -- and then we're going to have to figure out if IMDB got it wrong, or your sites got it wrong. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:37, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After googling, I found a number of sites with the January birthday and some sites with the other birthday (what is it, March?). There were more January sites than March sites. However ... the IMDB is THE standard reference for all movie industries, world-wide, and it is usually quite reliable. I will change to the January date, make a note that there is some confusion, and then ask my gurus on rec.arts.movies.local.indian.</p>
<p>Please don't be upset when you're doubted. It has nothing to do with desi or non-desi, it has to do with references. There are too many people who think it's fun to vandalize Wikipedia by adding bogus info. We have to check. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:05, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>No i am not upset</p>
<p>but the thing i am most confused about is.. HOW can a VERy Reliable source like IMDB put up a wrong information?</p>
<p>Do u know where did they get the information from ?</p>
<p>I am Very Cofused</p>
<p>Can you please let us know? After you are totally sure from your Gurus?</p>
<p>thanks and take care</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm never TOTALLY sure -- it's just that the guys hanging out in that Usenet discussion group usually have an answer whenever I have a tough question, and so far, they haven't been proven wrong. There's always a first time, however.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Their most recent feat was to give the titles of all the songs in the song parody sequence in <i>Lamhe</i>, complete with movie title, playback singer, and picturised on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know how often IMDB gets it wrong, either. If the birth date is wrong, it's the first error I've found. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:09, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmm i gotcha :)</p>
<p>welll the first time i came around her birth day was.. when they were releasing one of her movie.. "Razz" in January..</p>
<p>So in an article.. it said.." They are celebrating the release of the movie.. Plus Bipasha's Birthday together"</p>
<p>and then the next was IndiaFM or filmfare.. where it said that its on January 7th..</p>
<p>plus On b4utv.com it says 7 january .. on her profile.</p>
<p>But i would like to be Totally sure. Is there any way ?</p>

<dd>With actresses, well, you can't count on them to tell the truth, since they're in business to sell youth. A photocopy of a birth certificate might count -- but of course, photocopies can be "touched up". I guess I'd settle for an investigative reporting piece from a reputable Indian newspaper. YOU tell me which ones are reputable &lt;g&gt;. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:53, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am back..</p>
<p>So how is it goin ? I was wondering if u got any informations about her birthday from other place?</p>
<p>but as u asked me that I should provide you with the well reputed magazine. Well to my knowledge.. "Filmfare" magazine is the best, because their Award is like the Oscars in India..</p>
<p>and I got her birthday as 7th january from them..</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I should have gotten back to this. My Usenet gurus said that they didn't know and they didn't know HOW to find out, given that actresses lie about their age all the time.

<p>did u find out anything new?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Sorry, busy life, lots of articles. Myself, I think the article is OK as it stands now -- at least people can see the range of answers and figure out who to trust. Not being in India, or knowing anyone in the industry, I really don't know who to approach to get a reliable answer. Given that actresses lie about their age routinely, asking her publicists would be of little use. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone added that Bipasha is "dusky" in appearance. I know what this means, in Indian matrimonial ad-speak (she's somewhat dark-skinned compared to many Bollywood actresses), but this term would be incomprehensible to most Americans. It's also assuming that we have a universally accepted scale of skin color, which I don't think we do. I don't think it's anything worthy of remark. If any remarks are to be made, they should be quotes from some reputable source. The picture seems to be gone ... we need a new picture. A picture allows viewers to draw their own conclusions re skin color. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:51, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Her being "dusky" is notable because traditionally Indian film heroines have all been milky-white. It was common belief that a dark-skinned girl could not be successful because she's not considered a beauty. I cannot recall any actress revealing a not-so-fair skin before Kajol, and even Kajol was considered a maverick when it came to traditional moulds of beauty. But yeah, use a different word, but keep it. She has been referred to, and questioned about it a zillion times over. I'll try to dig up a verifiable link online. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaghabhat_eff9.html" title="User:Anaghabhat">Anagha</a> 15:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I looked at some of your previous edits Zora, and with all due respect you do not quite seem to be in touch with Bollywood. It's a well acknowledged fact that she dated Dino Morea. They both have talked about it in interviews. And as for John Abraham, the two of them have even appeared on Kaun Banega Karodpati as-a-couple! They have never denied it! But if you insist I have a link for you.</p>
<p>Secondly - you say her being a Hindu is irrelevant. Really? Isn't this a biographical page? If that's the case, why is her being the second of 3 daughters relevant? Why is her age relevant? Just put "she is an Indian actress" and a filmography!!! Nobody is saying Hinduism is better or worse - it's just a statement - why did it irk you? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaghabhat_eff9.html" title="User:Anaghabhat">Anagha</a> 15:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anagha, take a look at <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. After the Seigenthaler episode, WP is being extremely careful in what we say about living people. We should not include gossip. Assertions should be referenced. We do not make statements about religion or ethnicity unless it is relevant to the person's public life or career. Bipasha is not known for her religiosity! Far from it. She may have been raised in a Hindu family (though there's no proof for that) but that background doesn't seem to have turned her into a devotee. Unless she goes on record as saying that Hinduism is extremely important to her, she visits her favorite temple weekly, etc., we have nothing to report.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shez, if she wants to be regarded as an actress and not just a sex symbol, then surely there should be a quote from a reliable source that says as much. Don't put statements in her mouth without proving that she said them! I agree that if she said that, it would be relevant. Also, some quote from a critic regarding her choice of roles, if she has appeared in indie movies requiring acting rather than skin exposure, would help.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for statements about who is dating whom: WE ARE NOT A GOSSIP COLUMN. If you don't have any proof, you shouldn't be saying that she's dating X, or dumped X, or X dumped her, and so on. It's not just that gossip columnists love to speculate. Movie publicists also have good reason to send out rumours about co-stars becoming romantically involved in real life, as that gets publicity for the movie and might increase box-office receipts. Stars even have good reasons for playing along, if appearing in public with a co-star is going to make them richer or more famous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hollywood studios, back in the 20th century, were famous for this sort of thing: they would order stars to appear in public, say at nightclubs and parties, with other stars. The gossip columnists would say that X was dating Y and ticket sales would go up. This tactic was also used as a cover for a number of male stars who were homosexual. Rumors re homosexuality were deflected by carefully arranged "dates" with actresses. Bollywood publicists aren't idiots and they surely use these same tactics. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:49, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What you said about stars "dating" for publicity is true... But then they say that about married couples as well... a lot was said about Tom Cruise &amp; Nicole Kidman, who are as "new" as they come. So much so, that when they split up, the joke doing the rounds was that the kids will now be returned to the prop department of Universal Studios! But what's important to note is, gossips about sham marriages, and homosexuality are also just that - gossip! We have to draw the line somewhere. Let's not believe gossip columns, and managers and producers and publicists... but if we have it from the horse's mouth in an interview, we can believe it. Don't you think? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaghabhat_eff9.html" title="User:Anaghabhat">Anagha</a> 13:31, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that statements like "X dumped Y" are not for an encyclopeadia. But I have provided references for the fact that Bipasha has dated Dino in the past, and is currently dating John. While reverting to and from the gossip, please try to maintain the references. I had dug up a new-article link to verify the trivia about molestation charges as well, but I find it has disappeared again! <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaghabhat_eff9.html" title="User:Anaghabhat">Anagha</a> 06:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I lost the refs, sorry. I think the wording should stay the way it is, but refs should be attached to the names of all the actors she is supposed to have dated. Readers can click to the refs and decide if they believe them or not. Also, it puts the matter in perspective. This is really unimportant stuff! If she gets married, yes, of course. Dating is something else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the molestation charges, yes, a reference. I read about them in Rediff and Sepia Mutiny at the time everything happened, and I have no reason to doubt that "something" happened -- though what it was may never be clear. It's her word against theirs and I'm not sure that she has, or will, press charges in a US court. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually don't like keeping Abhishek and Vivek on that "dated" list... There's zero credibility to that claim - no reasonable references, no interviews affirming it, not even reporters questioning the concerned people... Can we drop them altogether?

<p>All forms of gossip need to be removed. Facts that are shown by reliable sources may be included only. The problem with the birthdate controvsery section is that it is original research based on reading blogs and fan sites. In the absence of any reliable sources, use IMDB (as the best available but not necessarily good) or leave it blank. Also, editing in sections <b>Birthdate controvsery'<i>,</i> Fun facts</b>, <b>Trivia</b> is—and I can't think of a nice way to say this—lame. Facts that are interesting and verified should be integrated into the body of the article, not scattered around like breadcrumbs. Facts that are not interesting enough to be added to the main body shouldn't be on the page at all. This is an encyclopedia, not a fan site. The anonymous editor will be subject to repeated blocking unless he can learn to follow our rather simple rules. Thank you. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, most of the Bollywood articles have trivia, and I've learned to live with it. I'm just on a lonely crusade to make sure that it's not slanderous, or utterly trivial/ephemeral, and that it's referenced. The birthdate controversy is a real problem -- I spent days trying to find out when the actress was actually born. IMDB is not always right -- its content comes from user contributions, as does ours -- and Rediff is actually a reliable source. So when reliable sources contradict each other, I think it's best to call attention to the problem rather than chosing one source over another.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I'm not going to fuss over the deletions -- I would rather have the article bare than full of material that would hurt Ms. Basu to no good end. There's another editor working here who is actually very good on chasing down references and I imagine that he will be able to restore some of the material, with cites. Thanks very much for your intervention, Thatcher.</dd>

<li>The Internet Movie Database and MSN give the date as May 5, 1979, and the birthplace as New Delhi.</li>
