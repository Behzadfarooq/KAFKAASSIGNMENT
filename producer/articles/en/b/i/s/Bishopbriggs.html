<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopbriggs.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Bishopbriggs was first documented in Cadder Parish records of <a href="../../../1/6/5/1655.html" title="1655">1655</a>, and according to one historian only had eleven residents in the mid-1700s. Even more than a century later, after substantial growth, the village was still being referred to in the terms of its mother parish of <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadder.html" title="Cadder">Cadder</a>. ‘Bishopbriggs’, Neil Thomson stated in 1903, ‘is the fast growing capital of Cawder’. Despite fears that the village would end up being swamped by nearby Glasgow, its house-building programmes of the twentieth century, combined with its strong sense of identity, have ensured its survival. Instead it was the fate of Cadder, a gift from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_Scotland_5d51.html" title="William I of Scotland">King William the Lion</a> to the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Glasgow_3a59.html" title="Bishop of Glasgow">Bishop of Glasgow</a> in 1180, that fell by the wayside, with 2000 of its acres being donated to the city during the 1920s and 30s. The town has also been known as 'Bishopbridges' and was so described in published maps up to the mid-1850's. The arrival of the railway heralded a change, although the first printed tickets called the station Bishopbridges, platform signage showed Bishopbriggs and it has remained so ever since.</p>
<p>By 1793, the introduction of new farming techniques had improved yields. While crops such as oats, barley, potatoes and flax flourished, Cadder’s population fared less well; a decrease of around 600 from the mid-1760s was attributed to new agricultural methods which combined smaller farms or <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_rig.html" title="Run rig">Run rigs</a> and swept away independent tenants, known as the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowland_Clearances_180e.html" title="Lowland Clearances">Lowland Clearances</a>. By 1836 there were ‘almost no <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotter_%28farmer%29.html" title="Cotter (farmer)">cotters</a>’ with the largest farms employing no more than ten people, and some of those as maid servants. Land reclamation (through drainage) changed the landscape so that crops could grow, where once there was only marshland. Dairy products, dispatched to Glasgow markets, were relied upon to cover ground rents. The districts' farmers claimed their produce was the finest in Scotland.</p>
<p>Development during the 19th century was slow compared to the industrial expansion of other nearby areas, such as <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springburn.html" title="Springburn">Springburn</a>, and in 1836 Bishopbriggs population stood at 175, compared to neighbouring Auchinairn Village's 284. The missing factor was coal, but since this was transported to the village via the area's excellent communication links (the canal, road and rail links), there was little incentive to invest in discovering it. Bishopbriggs train station, opened in 1842, underlined its status as the emerging focus of the parish although expansion was slow throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carron_Company_9294.html" title="Carron Company">Carron Company</a> (an iron and mining concern), was the district’s main employer, building the hamlets of Mavis Valley and Jellyhill to accommodate its workers, and there were also many small mining communities in the area, including quarries in nearby Cadder, Crowhill, Huntershill and Kenmure. As a result the town was a major centre for freestone quarrying during the 19th Century, supplying many major municipal building projects in Glasgow, such as <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_George_Gilbert_Scott_e996.html" title="Sir George Gilbert Scott">Sir George Gilbert Scott</a>'s <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Glasgow_4a0a.html" title="University of Glasgow">Glasgow University</a> main building (the second largest <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Revival_d3b9.html" title="Gothic Revival">Gothic Revival</a> building in Britain), via the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forth_and_Clyde_Canal_152b.html" title="Forth and Clyde Canal">Forth and Clyde Canal</a> until the exhaustion of the quarries around 1900.</p>
<p>Heavy industry didn’t fare for long, however and Bishopbriggs suffered a decline in the early decades of the twentieth century. With the working out of the quarries around the turn of the century, what mines it had closed systematically thereafter, throughout the 1920s. Luckily, manufacturing industries arrived after the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> to soften the blow, with engineering firms, a wire-rope factory, <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadbury_Schweppes_7b19.html" title="Cadbury Schweppes">Trebor Bassett</a>, and Blackie and Sons Publishers amongst those providing alternative employment. In 1929, new printing works for the Blackie company were erected on Kirkintilloch Road, and retaining the original name 'The Villafield Press', were built on this 13 acre site (opposite ASDA). During the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, Blackie &amp; Son Ltd used 33% of their Bishopbriggs works for the manufacture of 25 pound shells for the Ministry of Supply. They also undertook some toolmaking for another Glasgow company, William Beardmore &amp; Co Ltd, and, for a short time, produced aircraft radiators. By 1960 the publishing and administration section of the company relocated to join the printing section in Kirkintilloch Road, Bishopbriggs, and in 1971, new premises were occupied in Wester Cleddens Road, eventually becoming the headquarters of the company. The printworks were now no longer required and earmarked for demolition, following a demand for residential property in the area. The Villafield name lives on in these residential streets.</p>
<p>In the 1930s Bishopbriggs emerged as an administrative centre for local government, although the final stage of its expansion was yet to come. The last major boost to the town's population came about as a result of the building programmes of the fifties and sixties which replaced Balmuildy and Woodhill farmlands with private housing estates. A campaign by the local Ratepayers Association won Bishopbriggs its late bid for <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgh.html" title="Burgh">burgh</a> status in 1964, and this same organisation played a major role in keeping Bishopbriggs out of Glasgow district (and within <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strathkelvin.html" title="Strathkelvin">Strathkelvin</a>) during the local government reorganisation of the mid-70s.</p>

<p>The principal retail area of Bishopbriggs Cross is known as the Triangle shopping centre. This was a redeveloped area made possible by the demolition of older tenement housing stock to facilitate the construction of new council offices, retail units, and a large <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safeway_%28UK%29_ba64.html" title="Safeway (UK)">Safeway</a> supermarket (now <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrisons.html" title="Morrisons">Morrisons</a>) in the early 1990s. Tenement buildings dating from the Victorian era are still present on the western side of Bishopbriggs Cross.</p>
<p>There is also a pedestrianised area at Cross Court which includes the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_memorial.html" title="War memorial">war memorial</a>, erected in 1920 by the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Stirling_b123.html" title="Clan Stirling">Stirling family</a>, once major land owners in the area. The family seat was Kenmure House (now demolished) in parkland which is now Bishopbriggs Golf Course. Cadder House (1654) was also a Stirling family residence. It is now the clubhouse of <a href="http://www.cawdergolfclub.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.cawdergolfclub.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Cawder Golf Club</a>. Bishopbriggs is also notable for its superior villas, constructed during the 1850s, adjacent to the then recently completed <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_to_Edinburgh_via_Falkirk_Line_8b68.html" title="Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line">Glasgow-to-Edinburgh Railway</a>, its art deco 'Garden Suburb' on the former Brackenbrae and Balmuildy Estates, and also for its large scale modern housing developments. In the 1960s the town residents campaigned successfully to avoid being absorbed into the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Glasgow_37fa.html" title="City of Glasgow">City of Glasgow</a> boundaries, resulting in the formation of Bishopbriggs Town Council. Following local government reorganisation and the creation of Regional and District Authorities, Bishopbriggs became part of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strathclyde.html" title="Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a> Region, and the Town Council gave way to Strathkelvin District Council, along with <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirkintilloch.html" title="Kirkintilloch">Kirkintilloch</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenzie.html" title="Lenzie">Lenzie</a>. With the introduction of the present unitary local government system in 1996, and the dissolution of the Regional and District setup, Bishopbriggs became part of the East Dunbartonshire Council area.</p>
<p>In the last decade or so, major housing developments in the nearby village of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robroyston.html" title="Robroyston">Robroyston</a>, adjacent to the <a href="../../../m/8/0/M80_motorway.html" title="M80 motorway">M80 motorway</a>, have led to residents of that area relying on Bishopbriggs for most vital services such as churches, schools, and recreational facilities. As a consequence there have been calls in recent years for Robroyston to be formally incorporated within Bishopbriggs and transferred from the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Glasgow_37fa.html" title="City of Glasgow">City of Glasgow</a> to the control of East Dunbartonshire Council.</p>
<p>Famous residents from the area have included the actor and writer <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirk_Bogarde_3f37.html" title="Dirk Bogarde">Dirk Bogarde</a>, the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Awards_b109.html" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a>-winning director and actor <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Capaldi_0fe3.html" title="Peter Capaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>, musicians Paul Buchanan and Paul Joseph Moore from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blue_Nile_122d.html" title="The Blue Nile">The Blue Nile</a>, bassist <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Bruce_33d1.html" title="Jack Bruce">Jack Bruce</a> of seminal 60's supergroup <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_%28band%29.html" title="Cream (band)">Cream</a>, Owen (Onnie) McIntyre, rhythm guitarist and vocalist with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Average_White_Band_d1b7.html" title="The Average White Band">The Average White Band</a>, and the political radical <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Muir_%28radical%29_306b.html" title="Thomas Muir (radical)">Thomas Muir</a> of Huntershill, after whom one of the local Secondary schools is named.

Although the decision to change the location of the new school against public opinion has caused significant local controversy, this will make a large area of land adjacent to the Cross available for expansion and commercial development. The town has a municipal library, which forms a prominent local landmark, housed in the B-Listed former buildings of the Bishopbriggs School. The library has been enhanced by a £400,000 refurbishment in recent years. Bishopbriggs also has a large <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leisure_centre.html" title="Leisure centre">sports centre</a>, the 'Leisuredrome' which is one of the best equipped facilities of its kind in Scotland.</p>

In early January 2007, it was announced that East Dunbarton Council had lifted its objection to plans for the prison to be extensively modernised and extended, and after completion will be three times its present size, capable of containing 900 inmates in a medium-security facility.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopbriggs.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The derivation of the name Bishopbriggs has caused some controversy over the years. Some prefer the explanation that it was named after ‘the Bishop’s Bridge’, supposedly that over the Callie Burn that runs through Bishopbriggs Park, whereas others believe the middle ‘b’ is a corruption. This, so the argument goes, appeared because it rolls off the tongue more easily than the original name of ‘Bishop’s Riggs’.
