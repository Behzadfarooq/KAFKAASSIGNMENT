<dd>A precis to update you... Geogre looked into it, and based on the evidence in contribs and style, blocked as an obvious sock. Deckiller protested, unblocked, discussion on AN/I ensued, Essjay popped in, ran the checkuser without being formally asked, and officially confirmed sockhood and I reblocked. This time for good hopefully. Amazing how much time of the community this user wastes.

<dd>Well, being the unoficial scold of AN/I, I have to say that I agree with the questions, the checkuser, and the reinstatement. It's all cool, and folks should get cookies for being thorough.

<dd>Thanks guys. (I'm a little baffled by the way the people don't seem to have taken on board my own ANI post, but whatever.) Lar, since your block is the operative one, did you tick the "disable account creation" box when you blocked? If not, I'd advise you to unblock and then re-block doing that. (<i>Don't</i> tick the other box.) The CheckUser result rather suggests, to my mind, that Lingeron was editing from the wolfster's very own unique IP--we know she has one of those--rather than from an open proxy, and in that case this would be a great opportunity to disable account creation from the expansive sockfarm of this pest. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:54, 30 July 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I *think* I've read that the two new checkboxes don't do *anything* if it's a username being blocked and not an IP, actually. (And I'll certainly help out with that other thing too.

<p>I think that you have good cause for an arbitration request against MSTCrow, however it is also clear that the NPR request will not be accepted, largely due to the fact <i>that</i> dispute is seen as content-related and premature. I know you had asked that the case be accepted to look into MSTCrow's conduct, and I hate causing more work for the sake of process, but in this case I do think it would be worth the time to file a new request specifically for MSTCrow, and give more rationale specifically for that case. That would be more articlate and will probably be accepted.

<dd>While I (obviously) agree with you that there's enough troublesome behavior to warrant ArbCom action, a quick look at the ArbCom page tells me that you folks are already up to your eyeballs in work, so practically it may not be a good idea -- especially if, as seems likely to me, MSTCrow is on his way down the slippery slope to a community ban. Under the theory of "give 'em enough rope and they'll hang themselves", it won't take much more edit-warring, insults, pointless wikilawyering -- note his defense of <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELingeron_802e.html" title="User:Lingeron">Lingeron</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELingeron_ee69.html" title="User talk:Lingeron">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lingeron_f0c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lingeron">contribs</a>) -- and occasional outright lies for him to alienate a critical mass of editors/admins, which would render ArbCom action moot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, if he's true to form, any ArbCom case involving him would be wikilawyered up the wazoo, all intended to prove that it's everyone else's fault. His blocks certainly haven't taught him a damned thing (<i>I've been blocked</i> twice<i>, not five times, and both times the blocks were vindictive and not based on fact...</i>, as he claimed on his talk page) and I kind of doubt ArbCom sanctions would do more than provide him a martyrdom issue, either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We'll see, I guess. So far, no other ArbCom members have weighed in, and depending on how they feel, this may be moot. <small>Note: Copied to Bishonen.</small> --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Calton and Rattboy are better placed than me for drawing up a case against the user: I'd have to research it bigtime, as the only thing I've seen of him comes from noticing those dumbass templates on Calton's page, and the following unreasonableness and aggression. I'm pretty centrally involved in two RFAr cases right now, plus I'm on vacation dammit, there's no way I'm going to instigate another one. I'll weigh in if you guys request arbitration, though. Calton, you might be interested in my latest comment on Bunchofgrapes' page: I see certain reasons to suspect MSTCrow of being yet another maggie sock. The coincidences aren't enough to be certain at all, but there's the unreasoning Bishonen hatred (see how there's no resentment of El C, the actual blocker, all the venom reserved for me? And BoG mentioned, too: both of us are old adversaries of the wolfster, especially me.) And on the sensible principle, enunciated by Lar, I think it was, that anybody who thinks maggie is a good editor has to <i>be</i> maggie (or be insane), this should be maggie. Anyway, you might want to keep it in mind as a possibility. There's something about the tone that strikes me as not the same, though. Equally objectionable, but not exactly in the same way. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC).

<p>Ultimately I'd say he's just a disgruntled wikipedian who fell in with Lingeron because they were both "abused" by Bishonen. Lingeron expressed sympathy for one of MSTCrow's earlier blocks because she too felt Bishonen was unfair, and MSTCrow later started rabble-rousing about Lingeron's block because he had an axe to grind against Bishonen. Think horses, not zebras. That said, I'd still say MSTCrow is probably going to flame out spectacularly and earn himself a block all by his lonesome if he keeps up the inflammatory rhetoric accusing Bishonen of corruption.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 22:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Have you guys looked into the other half of this edit/flame war. In my opinion, <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">user:pm_shef</a> isn't the innocent victim here. <a href="../../../e/d/2/User%7EED209_5d5a.html" title="User:ED209">ED209</a> 01:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's possible. It's not the point here, the point is that pm_shef's action was not vandalism. Do you realize that I've been telling JC that he must stop referring to non-vandalism edits as vandalism for several months now, and he just keeps going? Oh, you do. Good. Do you also realize that Zoe and I are in agreement that it's time for a block, and, indeed, progressively longer blocks, if he keeps going? JohnnyCanuck needs to get his head round the <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a> page, especially the section "What vandalism is not". His behavior hurts the wiki. I quote from <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">WP:Vandalism</a>: "If a user treats situations which are not clear vandalism as vandalism, then he or she is actually damaging the encyclopedia". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:00, 6 August 2006 (UTC).

<li>JC only does that because Pm_shef removes warnings from his page and calls it "vandalism". As well as removing other critical commentary. ED203

<li>EDwhatever, you seem to be missing several salient points here. Pm_shef is well entitled to remove baseless warnings from his page.

This is a kid and a newbie. She thinks wiki is Myspace and makes up imaginary friends when she has trouble getting enough action... shrug... OK, we can't have that, wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but I wish somebody would just take her in hand and explain stuff, rather than the blocks and the templates. That wish isn't directed at you, I know it's a lot to ask, and I'm not willing to do it myself either. (Children have enough nightmares about Bishzilla as it is.) It looks to me like there are two options: either put on the puppeteer template and adminprotect the page, or post an appeal for a volunteer nanny on ANI. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC).

<dd>It's worrisome I'll agree. At first I was inclined to say she knew too much HTML to really be eleven years old, but when I saw her add the warning tag to her userpage today and break about every div tag on the page, I realized she's just probably copy/pasting what she likes from other userpages. So while I grit my teeth at her claim that she created the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perry_Mason_04f5.html" title="Perry Mason">Perry Mason</a> article (which she's never even edited on) I do wonder if there's anything we can (or even should) do. Certainly she doesn't seem to understand warnings and other input from admins, and will often just delete them. In other users this certainly wouldn't be tolerated, but I can understand your concern about taking a harsh approach with her.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 14:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On the subject of the naive, I agree with Rosicrucian, but I also note that Bishonen is more asking for a patient parent-figure to help the child than that the child's misdeeds be ignored. I like to be a New Critic about this stuff and say that, if a person is doing harm and no good, then it's just a case where "You must be this tall to ride the Wikipedia" -- that we still have to correct and prevent damage, <i>even at the same time</i> that we shower the user with the grace of Wikilove (it's Sunday, and I'm missing church, so expect religious metaphors all day). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:38, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I do understand what Bish is getting at, it'd be with some trepidation that I'd ask someone, indeed <i>anyone</i> to open this can of worms, which is largely why I haven't slapped a puppeteer template on the kid. I remain doubtful the user would take any outside criticism or advice the right way, as she seems to just get confused when people try to nudge her in the right direction. Certainly given the tone some editors and admins have taken with her, she probably doesn't know who to listen to and who to ignore.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 14:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bishonen, you are one of the most respected editors on Wikipedia. I would be eternally grateful if you would edit the "Alternative Treatments" and "Controversy" and "Parental Roles" sections of the <a href="../../../a/d/h/ADHD_4f6a.html" title="ADHD">ADHD</a> to give them a more neutral viewpoint. I would do this, but having ADHD myself, I find myself unable to handle it with a neutral point of view.</p>

<p>Thank you for indef blocking <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJipanzee_ea3c.html" title="User:Jipanzee">User:Jipanzee</a>, he seems however to to have created a sockpuppet to evade his block a grand total of two minutes (at 15:41) after the block. the sockpuppet is <a href="../../../s/o/w/User%7ESowpon_8feb.html" title="User:Sowpon">User:Sowpon</a>, his sole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sowpon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sowpon" rel="nofollow">edit</a> seems fairly self explanatory. If you're interested, as I told <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">User:JamesTeterenko</a>, I believe these latest sockpuppets are in fact seperate from VaughanWatch/JohnnyCanuck (assuming JC is a sock). Their edit patterns seem sufficiently different (VW focused on PoV pushing in mainspace, the new ones, included ED, focused more on personal attacks and disrupting wiki) to lead me to believe that rather than all being spawn of VW, we're dealing with two seperate groups, with the second cooperating with the first simply out of convienience. Anyways, thanks for keeping an eye out - wish we had a more effective way of dealing with them. --<a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 00:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am surprised you are an admin here. For Your Information From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page" rel="nofollow">Etiquette</a> "Actively erasing non-harassing personal messages without replying (if a reply would be appropriate or polite) will probably be interpreted as hostile. In the past, this kind of behavior has been viewed as uncivil, and this can become an issue in arbitration or other formal proceedings. Redirecting your user talk page to another page (whether meant as a joke or intended to be offensive or to send a "go away" message), except in the case of redirecting from one account to another when both are yours, can also be considered a hostile act. However, reverting such removals or redirects is not proper and may result in a block for edit warring. If someone removes your comments without answering, consider moving on or dispute resolution. This is especially true for vandalism warnings".<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> 11:51, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So am I sometimes, but life is full of surprises. The etiquette guideline you quote refers to erasing <i>non-harassing</i> personal messages. See, that doesn't happen very often. It's inherently unlikely that people will want to erase civil messages, and it's not what dab was doing. Dab has not contacted me, his page merely happens to be on my watchlist, so I'm not especially well informed about the conflict between you; but then I don't have to be to see that your messages on his page are rude, threatening and abusive, in other words <i>harassing</i>. I would like to endorse the advice you quote from the etiquette page: "If someone removes your comments without answering, consider moving on". <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:08, 8 August 2006 (UTC).

<p>Oh, charming--I just spent half an hour looking out the links and writing it up for you in words of one syllable, and now you don't care any more? Bugger that, you're getting it, because someone did (=me). Here it comes:<br />
Some 30 admins have listed themselves on that page. Open to recall means they're willing to surrender their adminship and go through a new RFA if six users in good standing ask them to. You know, users such as you and me. Or you, anyway. Admin <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">User:Crzrussian</a>, who is listed on the page, has just done some dumb stuff with his admin powers, and Dmcdevit and I have asked him, per the "open to recall" page, to surrender his adminship. It's the first time the page has been invoked. Dmcdevit's post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Crzrussian#Recall" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Crzrussian#Recall" rel="nofollow">here</a> gives a good picture of what the problems were. It's being discussed on <a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">User talk:Crzrussian</a> and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Crzrussian" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Crzrussian" rel="nofollow">this ANI thread</a>.

Two or three other users have chimed in, everybody else thinks we're being mean and petty and "casting the first stone" (that's the choice wording of Crzrussian himself) and oh, no, how cruel to expect him to de-sysop himself. (So in fact there aren't at present six users requesting it.) I've a good mind to propose the "open to recall" page for deletion--apparently it's merely for show and showing off. (Bunch and Lar have listed themselves on it.)

<dd>We're bad, bad people. I'm uniquely bad -- being both in the nasty category and also being among those asking for a re-RfA for Crzrussian. This is such awful behavior on my part that it is a shame it hasn't caught on among his supporters in this affair to go over to my page and ask for my own recall. Does this one case adequately demonstrate that the idea doesn't work? I'm not sure. Do we demonstrate "humbleness mixed with cockiness"?

<p>Uh-huh...I'm grooming "myself" for adminship..just joking. But anyway listen y'all, what's the point of listing yourself on that open to recall page if you simply ignore it? Btw, the admin Crzyrussian just made the decision to ignore a few users (myself included) who are tryna recall him by calling me a stalker. --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 22:44, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think there are some misconceptions in this thread. I see this process working out pretty well so far, and to characterise it as cocky is a bit of a misstatement. Before you get ready to propose it for deletion, let this process work through and see what happens. RfAr exists as a check, if Crzrussian acts unreasonably, it will go much harder for him at ArbComm... Also please remember that by definition it's Crzrussian's (or in Bishie's case, hers) perogative who is certified. He chose, presumably after reviewing B.h's contributions, attitude, and other factors, not to certify him as a user in good standing with him. His perogative. I'm clerking so won't express any opinion on the merits of the case but there are 4 people already certified so to say that you can't get 6 is a bit of a stretch I feel. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 23:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Agree wholeheartedly with Mark. I believe all recently blocked users should be cut some slack regarding what they do in the frustration of reacting to the block. For instance, don't scrutinize their posts for personal attacks, don't expect model behavior, don't take it so personally if they tell you how abusive you are. A block is a shock. All admins are more powerful than all regular users; but admins are so much more powerful than a blocked user that it should give them pause. It's not the right moment to express your irritation with how much trouble the user is being by slapping on an indefinite. Assume even more good faith than usual. This all goes double if the first block can be seen as dubious or unfair. I support unblocking now. Oh, and btw, I'm assuming good faith on Deckiller's comment that we "might be able to get an indefinite for this": I'm sure he didn't mean it as crassly as it sounded."</p>

<dd>Until further notice you're very welcome here, James. Thank you for asking, and thanks for the compliment. I feel strongly about what I see as harsh blocks, especially for "personal attacks"--there's too many of those, with too loose definitions of both PAs and of "disruption"--and especially about any hint of vicious-circle progressive blocking, whereby users get slammed with longer blocks simply for chafing under the first one. The quote of the week at the top of this page is from a rather lengthy shitstorm I've been in for acting on these convictions. The statement's supposed to be withering, but I display it with pride. Some solutions need unsolving.&#160;:-) That's not to say I think you and I are any too likely to see eye to eye in blocking matters in general. And if this is really about the two-week block I see you've just come off, I don't have any opinion about it, I haven't been following it. Callous as it may sound, there are a lot of less high-profile cases around that *nobody*'s following or protesting, and that don't require reading a few mind-numbing novels' worth of background first, so... Sorry about that. (And if it was about the Extraoradinary Machine brouhaha, I'm afraid I'd probably support the block.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:33, 11 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Well, the painting <i>is</i> on the "stepback," so Keepsleeping must be right. This leaves us no nearer to knowing if the painting has a name other than "Painting of Great Fire of London." We know it's at the Museum of London, and we know that the copyright doesn't actually apply, as the Bridgeman Case would argue, but no telling whether anyone has been brave enough to scan a reproduction and loosed it on the web. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi. It's a subject where consensus is changing too rapidly for official policies to keep up, so if you really want to get into it, you should look at some current discussions. See <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a>, which is a <i>proposed</i> policy/guideline page and contains an overview of what the principle is in actual policies and guidelines. They're not entirely mutually consistent! Take a look at the discusssion and poll on the talkpage, too. In a nutshell (the way it looks to me): many users and admins consider it <i>uncivil</i> to remove warnings, provided these warnings are 100% legitimate and bona fide, but don't consider it vandalism. Look carefully at Stifle's wording, which is straight out of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVand_c0ad.html" title="WP:Vand">WP:Vand</a> (he's probably using a template); see the complications in it? There are also a couple of current, piping hot, discussion threads on WP:ANI, "User:El_C Vandalism by Administrator(Removing Warnings)" and "User:Avraham Vandalism (Removing Warnings)". I believe these show a strong admin consensus for the "just let other people do what they want on their pages" school of thought. I'm sorry it's so complicated. That's the way it goes when consensus, as here, is formed by practice, not handed down from above. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:55, 12 August 2006 (UTC).</li>

<p>If I were to venture upon starting an article on Davenant's converted tennis-court theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields that was originally Lisle's Tennis Court but might also be called the Duke's House or one of a handful of other things, what you you think the article would best be titled? Currently we have a de facto convention of linking to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%27s_Inn_Fields_2a4f.html" title="Lincoln's Inn Fields">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a> when mentioning the place, but this seems most unsatisfactory.

<ul>
<li>Personally, I think it should be part of Lincoln's Inn Fields, since the same <i>name</i> got glued to several places, just as Covent Garden and Drury Lane were several different places. &lt;shrug&gt; However, if you wanted to do it otherwise, I'd say First Lincoln's Inn Fields or Restoration Lincoln's Inn Fields. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:00, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, nobody ever called it those things, though. I'll get back to you, but listen, guys. A new user has created Wikipedia:Admin Policy. It's not, how shall I put it, actual policy... could somebody move it to his userspace and write him a nice explanatory note, please? I should warn you that speaking to him at all tends to cause him to get... upset. But if it was <i>me</i> doing it, it would doubtless be censorship and a criminal attempt to hide my breaches of admin policy. I'll be damned if I try to talk to him again, and just moving it without saying anything would be confusing and unkind.

<p>So back (nudge) to the (poke) original question, which you do have some opinion on: tell me your opinion before I am forced to create the page at Lisle's Tennis Court between Portugal Street and Portugal Row off Lincoln's Inn Fields Duke's Opera and New Theatre, which would probably not be so good. I am currently leaning for no good reason at all toward Lincoln's Inn Field (Theatre), though if truth be told, in my heart I just want to call the thing <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisle%27s_Tennis_Court_cecd.html" title="Lisle's Tennis Court">Lisle's Tennis Court</a>, because, you know, it's catchy. Then again, it does seem to be verboten in the sources I've seen to call Christoper and John Rich's rebuilt 1714 version "Lisle's Tennis Court". —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:56, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certainly secondary sources call it that as often as they call it other things, at least for the older incarnations. There being so few theatres in London at the time, primary sources AFAICT don't call it much of anything useful at all. You know -- "Duke's House", "The theatre", "the Opera", that sort of generic thing. (Bishonen, you scamp!

<dl>
<dd>Either can come first IMO. Ideally, a small consensus is first established on WP:ANI by raising the matter the way I did, followed if appropriate by an indefinite block. But then a third step is important: that a big consensus grows from it--that as many admins as possible pay attention to the case, and actively decide whether or not to unblock. The community ban of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">User:Thewolfstar</a> followed that pattern. But IMO we need some better way of generating enough attention for these proposed bans, both before and after blocking. We don't want a scenario where three or four admins form a "consensus" on ANI and everybody else was busy with something else that day. It's not a problem that arises in this case, though, as there's obviously not consensus even among the people who've responded. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 05:00, 13 August 2006 (UTC).

<dd>As I read the policy for community bans, blocking comes first. "a user has exhausted the community's patience to the point where he or she finds themselves blocked. Administrators who block in these cases should be sure that there is widespread community support for the block, and should note the block on WP:ANI as part of the review process. With such support, the user is considered banned" Can you point to the policy that outlines how the community should first decide on a ban of an editor who is not blocked? --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 14:42, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

The practice now seems to be to either start by blocking indefinitely and then posting the block on WP:ANI for review, <b>or</b> by first raising the question on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, the way I did. I think the second is the better, more civlized, way, because it doesn't unnecessarily put the user through the block/unblock mangle. I'm sorry, but I think I've shared all I've got on this issue. If you're making a point about my conduct, could you be more explicit? If you're not, do you think you could raise further questions on the talkpage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&amp;oldid=69164976#Banned_by_the_Wikipedia_community" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&amp;oldid=69164976#Banned_by_the_Wikipedia_community" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and/or <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:03, 13 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I noticed you are an admin... maybe you can answer my question. I had a 24 block placed on my account and it expired about a week ago. The template for my request to remove the block is still on the USER TALK page, but I believe it should have been removed when the block expired. How do I get it removed? Also, I changed my username after that incident and am limiting my edits to non-controversial topics. Its just not worth the headache. Someone felt it necessary to post on my old talk page that I had changed my user name, they also added a "redirect" link. Is this standard procedure when someone changes their user name? Can I remove the post without getting attacked for violation of some rule? Thanks - appreciate your time. --<a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneCyclone_b1a5.html" title="User:OneCyclone">OneCyclone</a> 17:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me see. I'm pretty sure I can delete a userpage at your request without any hassle, so the simplest way is probably if you ask me to delete your old talkpage and userpage (the one that's a redirect). You know, just reply here and confirm that you'd like that. If you would in fact like that. Meanwhile, I'll ask <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> if she minds. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC).

If they would rather have EE editing here than me - well that can easily be arranged (it seems they want to do so) - and I say good luck to the project - do stop saying though you will go if I go, appreciated as it is, it only makes me feel guilty, and you would hate it - sitting their fuming at the ignorant edits, while I am of a completely different disposition, I would just think Wikipedia was getting the edits it deserves, and quite enjoy seeing them. I'm only posting this here now, because I'm not sure when they implement these things. Although I'm in USA next week, I won't bother editing with an American number (I won't have the time anyway) because I actually feel rather sick, this has all been a bit of an eye-opener hasn't it? I shall hang around until banned - it would be nice to see WWP finished and FA'd but I'm very short too of real life time (I mean busy not about to kick the bucket).

<dd>Well, you know, it's possible that offering someone an apple is a sure fire way of telling them that you'll force them to eat arsenic, since there is arsenic in the seed of an apple, and tea is clearly a threat to force someone into either early kidney failure due to diuresis or that you plan to use an illegal herb. In fact, you should never propose that anyone eat anything nor that they not eat anything, nor, obviously, think that they should or should not, as it all could be a threat. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:22, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You mean where I warned you about your edit to his userpage? Well, admins poke their nose in when they see vandalism, that's just part of the system. And the reason I saw what you did is that I have BoG's userpage on my <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatchlist_eb79.html" title="Wikipedia:Watchlist">watchlist</a>. It's actually very easy to oversee what happens on particular pages or with particular users. For instance, by going to your page and clicking on the button "User contributions" in the left-hand column, I can see all the edits you've made. Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Drybranmuffin" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Drybranmuffin" rel="nofollow">here</a> to try it. See the list of your edits? If you click on the word <b>diff</b> in any particular post, you will see the text you actually contributed to the encyclopedia. Please take a look. Hmmm. Would you say any of it is helping to build the encyclopedia? I actually wouldn't. And yet that's what you're supposed to be here for. (If you're not, you shouldn't be here.) I hope you will start editing more constructively.</dd>
<dd>Please feel free to ask me questions, but may I ask you to refrain from calling me "my dear"? I prefer neutral appellations--gender neutral, and neutral in every way--from strangers. If indeed they experience a need to call me anything. Please sign posts on talkpages by typing four tildes, like this: ~~~~. That's magic code, which will translate automatically to your username plus a timestamp when you save--please just try it, it works. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:22, 17 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Neither Joshua nor WMC have responded to me, obviously. I really wish somebody on the other side would try to justify the way you've been treated, because it's weird to me, and as far as I understand what happened, it was quite unfair.&#160;:-( I'm sorry it went like that. If I'd seen this earlier, I <i>would</i> have done the "unilateral" blocking thing, but now that both Joshua and Arktos seem to be assuming responsibility for Deuterium's behavior not continuing (and he has modified his userpage), I won't jump in and block him. I guess it would be punitive rather than preventative. I'd like to stand by and keep an eye on him, too, but I'm in the wrong timezone for it, it's--OMG, it's 4 AM.

<dd>"Indeed a poet undergoes a great deal before he comes to his third night; first, with the muses...then, sir, with the master of a playhouse to get it acted, whom you generally follow a quarter of a year before you know whether he will receive it or no; and then, perhaps, he tells you it won't do, and returns it to you again, reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime; but if he should receive the play, then you must attend again to get it writ out into parts and rehearsed. Well, sir, at last, the rehearsals begin; then, sir, begins another scene of trouble with the actors, some of whom don't like their parts, and all are continually plaguing you with alterations: at length, after having waded through all these difficulties, his play appears on the stage, where one man hisses out of resentment to the author, a second out of dislike to the house, a third out of dislike to the actor, a fourth out of dislike to the play, a fifth for the joke sake, a sixth to keep all the rest in company.

<dd>Thanks, Ungovernable. (Do you ever meet user "The Irresistible Force", and what happens then? User The Immoveable Object comes into being..?) Yes, I watch Grappa's page, and had been checking the contribs and feeling rather unsure, in spite of the anarchism/communism angle. But that Justforasecond comment certainly is suggestive. It's not just ye olde abusive admins, but also the neediness, the typical "I like you, please come and talk to me, I don't have anybody to play with!" It must be incredibly frustrating for the wolfster to have finally realized that if she does the things she <i>wants</i> to do--runs around planting affectionate messages on all her old friends, and just happening to run across a quite unusually abusive admin by the name of Bishonen--she'll be outed again. (Doing those things was a regular giveaway with her first ten or so reincarnations, lol...) It's not so much that she's my favorite user--I can take her or leave her--but I do believe I'm her favorite admin!&#160;;-) And it's the <i>tone</i>. Thanks for keeping me posted.

<p>My private view is that if London had not burnt, they would have found a reason to demolish the heart of it and re-design, it all fitted with the new scheme of things there. However they were short of funds and the fire was convenient, probably started accidentally but almost certainly allowed to rage through intention - Charles II and his cronies wanted a new sweep, literally and they obtained it. Charles I reign had begun to see radical changes in architecture there, and London was not the rat infested medieval city it is often portrayed. Paris had improved but was far from Hausemann's version of today, and Constantinople was a little like going to Venice today, beauty could be seen in its decay accept of course people were not so easily aesthetically pleased at that time. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 22:03, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I think you're attributing to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence. And by an <i>excruciating lack of mobile phones</i>. I'm going to have that as a kind of red thread running through the narrative. "Not having Bluetooth, Pepys was forced to go bodily to Whitehall to alert the King. Precious minutes, even hours, were lost through lack of adequate hardware. Telecommunications and water supply failed together." There was no "allowing", as I think you'll acknowledge once I'm done with the narrative. Thanks for the edit, the poor relation is very good.

<dd>It is a fact that all of the nobles were mysteriously missing from the area where the fire raged, and the Masons had all, just coincidentally, gone on vacation. A coincidence? Ha! Records show that five thousand Freemasons were supposed to be asleep in their beds that night, but they managed to get out of the fire area in time. (It's a miracle any fire was ever put out at all, not that that one raged. Space had been the previous fire retardant, but the growth of population from 1600-1660 had eliminated that. Good old capitalism was beginning, and bringing with it the charming habit of accumulating loads of poor people, just in case workers start wanting to get paid for their work.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:38, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If not, Pura Paja is a meat puppet of him. Logical things can be done by several users but absurdities, such as redirecting sub-articles to a main article so nobody can edit them read them and so on, are rarely done by more than a vandal.</p>
<p>I believe my edit was a good way to denounce the situation. I've not spent much time here, but, well, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> was banned for a month from editing the Wikipedia and he created <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">User:Skanking</a> to continue editing, as it's been demonstrated. Can you explain me why no administrator has blocked SqueakBox yet if he didn't respect his ban the first time? Have you nothing better to do than harass honest users like me with silly details that you can't enforce a ban of the Arbitration Committee? <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 06:26, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, SqueakBox is under Personal Attacks parole and he has posted the following in this page: "[My main successes has been ...] restoring <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero_5f9d.html" title="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a> from the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">POV</a> of another user who claims to write about saints but who is determined to slur him." One of the meanings of "Hagiographer" is that, a person who writes about saints, so that paragraph is clearly an attack against me. I've simply deleted vandalism in the <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapatero.html" title="Zapatero">Zapatero</a> article, about which I don't feel any especial interest and I would not have paid much attention to it if it wouldn't have been repeatedly vandalised. So, I want an explanation of why those negative remarks go unpunished on a user who is under POV parole. If you want more negative comments of SqueakBox against me you can find them here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FSqueakBox_%282nd%29&amp;diff=70335337&amp;oldid=70333660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASuspected_sock_puppets%2FSqueakBox_%282nd%29&amp;diff=70335337&amp;oldid=70333660" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/g/User%7EHagiographer_1a80.html" title="User:Hagiographer">Hagiographer</a> 06:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You want an explanation? Here it comes. You see, no administrator takes responsibility for everything that goes on on the entire site. To pick an admin at random--me--and demand an explanation of why this or that user has not been punished, is a meaningless question, as you'll only be told "I don't know the case". You should ask the people who have taken on responsibility for the user's conduct: the Arbitration committee. Like this: go to the front page of the request for arbitration where Squeakbox was banned and put on parole and so on, and look for the heading "Enforcement" near the bottom of the page. There you will see information about exactly how and where you can effectively complain if you think Squeakbox has violated any of the remedies that ArbCom applied to him. (If you had told me what that case was, I could have told you more briefly and exactly what to do, but you shouldn't have any trouble finding the place.) There's not much the ArbCom can do if people who know about violations, like you, don't tell them about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that it's difficult for a new user to know which way to turn with a problem, but I'm afraid you picked two bad ways: sniping at the user by altering his edits is not a "good way to denounce the situation", it's itself a violation of site rules, and it makes you look bad, and accomplishes nothing. And bluster at an uninvolved admin like myself ("Have you nothing better to do than harass honest users" etc.) is not a good way either. When you have a complaint about lack of enforcement of an ArbCom ruling, the good way is to read that ruling and see what it says about enforcement--probably, that you should report the behavior to arbcom--and do it that way. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 08:09, 21 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>First of all, I have to say I'm sorry because it's true I was too hard. By the way, the "you" of the <i>question</i> was intended to convey a "plural" meaning. I didn't refer to you, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">User:Bishonen</a>, but to all the Administrators in general... Sorry again. However, you must understand it's difficult to take the rules seriously when somebody defies them so blatantly.</p>
<p>As I understand you don't know the case, it can be found in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas_ff79.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas</a>. In regard to the month ban it says the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>SqueakBox and Zapatancas banned for one month</b>. For personal attacks, edit warring, and harassment, SqueakBox and Zapatancas are each banned from editing Wikipedia for one month.</dd>

<p>I posted this on Friday on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Arbitration_enforcement_148a.html#User:SqueakBox" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement#User:SqueakBox</a>:</p>

<dd>As can be seen in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas_ff79.html#SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas_banned_for_one_month" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas#SqueakBox and Zapatancas banned for one month</a>, SqueakBox was banned from editing the Wikipedia for a month. It has been proved that <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkanking_aa8d.html" title="User:Skanking">User:Skanking</a> was a sock puppet of him as can be seen in his user page and his block log ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Skanking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Skanking" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>]). He used it to edit during his ban starting at the beginning of June (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_SqueakBox_and_Zapatancas_ff79.html#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/SqueakBox and Zapatancas#Log of blocks and bans</a>) as can be seen in Skanking's history (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Skanking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Skanking" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>).

<p>So, I don't understand why SqueakBox isn't banned for a month if he hasn't respected the decision first.

<dd>It hurts me to see wordiness and adspeak like that. And of course, if only the praisers of the product would see it, a neutral encyclopedic-sounding text in a place like this is actually a <i>better</i> ad for them.

<p>I've been looking around at this -- it's aggravating. I think Tinniswood is just plain wrong, one way or another.

<p>Hi, I just left a message on Bunchofgrape's talk page about this, but I don't think they're online right now (but according to my watchlist, you are. Anyway, <a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDTC_5378.html" title="User:DTC">User:DTC</a> who some suspect of being a sock of <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">User:RJII</a> has been removing the tag on their userpage that says they are suspected of being a sock. I don't know if they are or not (although they do seem quite similar to RJII). What I want to know is, what is the policy regarding removing such notices? Thanks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 07:31, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not much use invoking policy where removing tags from userpages is concerned: the community is divided and the policies and guidelines are warzones. See for instance <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a>--not strictly relevant, as sock tags are neither warnings nor on talkpages, but still. I would go with common sense: how good is the suspicion? Are reasons given for it, beyond "See contribs" (yes, a very little more), was it added by a respected editor (yes, I believe it was, though I don't know <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_Intentions_d6f9.html" title="User:Good Intentions">User:Good Intentions</a>)? It sounds as if you've researched DTC's "content and style". From that, do you <i>think</i> it's a RJII sock? (You don't have to be <i>sure</i>, as it's a tag for suspected, not ascertained, puppetry.) If you do, it would be appropriate to ask an admin to put the tag back and protect the page. However, I do <i>not</i> personally think it would ever be right to block or threaten an editor over the removals (suppose they're not a sock after all?), only to keep the tag in place. I'm willing to do that if you request it--if you <i>strongly</i> suspect they're a sock. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I haven't personally researched it enough to say. But from my interactions with DTC I do suspect it, but not strongly enough for that. I do however tend to trust Aaron's judgement with socks, especially since he has been around the anarchism articles for much longer than I have, and would probably know RJII's style better than most others. I think it would be good if impartial admins were to review the user though and get an idea. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 08:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Bishonen! Thanks for the offer of guidance with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I really appreciate it! Here’s my understanding as it relates to my comments about the baby talking at six months:</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, say there is an indisputably reliable source that says that Natasha’s mother said “Natasha could speak by the age of six months.” Then say there’s an equally reliable source that says it’s impossible for a baby to speak before 12 months of age. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says <i>"Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources, regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth."</i></p>
<p>I take that to mean that we can report Natasha’s mother’s statement in the Wikipedia Article, word for word, even though it’s not true. She said it, it’s verifiable.</p>
<p>Where am I going wrong with that? Thanks! <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 00:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Several things are wrong with it. In the first place, the article is supposed to be about Natasha Demkina, not about her mother, right? I assume you'd mention both those reliable sources (if you didn't, somebody else would), and a foolish, random, and provably false statement about ND by her mother doesn't say anything about ND; it only says things (embarrassing things) about her mother. The article isn't about her mother, and Wikipedia also isn't about embarrassing vulnerable people for no good reason. I call her vulnerable because that's a good word for a person who'll put herself out in the public sphere in such a way. I have no idea if her claims about her daughter are signs of carelessness, memory problems, mendacity... whatever, but (in your hypothetical case) I do know they're not true. Your argument that we <i>can</i> quote them seems to me, if you don't mind my saying so, based on the letter rather than the spirit of the policy. The policies aren't meant to be cherrypicked like that, you're supposed to read and digest the whole of them and get to grips with the spirit of them. Try asking yourself, not "Can we quote it?" but rather "<i>Why</i> would we quote it, to what end?" And now I really am going on wikibreak, please see the top of this page. I'd rather you didn't continue this thread here while I'm away, but you're welcome back on Monday. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:46, 24 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<li>Oh I thought you were very quiet (no pun intended) how very awful for you, I have never had tooth ache in my whole life, and have perfect toothies, all white a shiny, I think it's because I brushed them twice a day as a child and drank all my milk and orange juice! I'm no longer bored, I've been internet shoping and bought lots of new clothes (I bought my famed chest-wig on the internet you know) this also stops Mrs G from becoming bored as she has to pack them all up and send them back when they arrive as they are usually all the wrong colour and size, or else she feels they are not suitable for someone of my age, I always think they will make me look like the model, but sadly they seldom do, in fact the last pair of sun glasses she said made me look like a bluebottle, I'm not sure why I married her sometimes.

<dd>Wow, and here I thought that last one was the most severe blurting out of existential despair ever (at least ever by me). Camus's dead Arab and Sartre's upset stomach had nothing on it, I thought. Our ends are so far from our beginnings that they scarcely know themselves, I guess (to crib from that American hero of despair, TSE). That reminds me: I should probably give <i>The Four Quartets</i> another go, now that I'm old enough to ignore the critical apparatus and apparatchiks. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:49, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You needn't call me an idiot, you know, just because my telepathy is on the blink. Ackoz says that I'm arrogant. I can't be both, unless I'm the president of the United States, and I'm pretty sure that I'm not, as I was even more unelected than he was. I took a self-test at the doctor's office today. According to it, I'm depressed and need medication. Also according to another self test, I have PMS and erectile dysfunction ("Can you perform sexually whenever you desire to?" Well, I don't have a lover, so I'd say that's a big "no") as well as painful shyness and probably several forms of hypertension and HPV.

<p>I haven't made up my mind yet about Carnildo, and probably won't for the next few days. But I thought your points were very well thought out, and extremely well expressed. So well, in fact, that I wonder were you unconsciously copying from <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, where Elinor was "mortified, shocked, confounded"? Anyway, I appreciate your understanding of how a block log affects some people (though I think others don't seem to mind). I've always been a bit annoyed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Carnildo&amp;page=User%3AGordonWatts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Carnildo&amp;page=User%3AGordonWatts" rel="nofollow">this</a>, though the subsequent blocks and the consequences were, of course, far worse. On the other hand, I've seen people just disappearing from Wikipedia after an unsuccessful RfA, so I can't help feeling some admiration for someone who sticks around and keeps working for the project, despite the humiliation or being desysopped.

<p>So I went to write what I thought might be a new article on <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanic_School_823b.html" title="Satanic School">Satanic School</a>, but, of course, an uncharacteristically verbose (three whole lines!) port from the Nutall Superbrief Blurb of Literature was already there. I noticed that it was in only one category -- that being Nutall -- so I went to put it into some more. Our literature category does not have subcats for Renaissance, Augustan, Romantic, Victorian, Edwardian, Georgian, Modern, Post-mortem literatures, so this article, which is quintessentially Romanticism, has no subcat to belong to. If a body wanted a ton of edits on categories, it would be an easy thing to create subcats for all the breakdown of academe and then start trying to but things in their proper boxes. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please Sarastro777, I'd prefer that you not ride your complaint against InShaneee on top of mine. While you may be experiencing a similar bullying attitude from InShaneee, the conduct for which I filed a complaint is not quite the same as what you're complaining about. An administrator can remove some kinds of personal attacks and an administrator can block or threaten to block editors for any serious violation of Wiki's No Personal Attack Rule. That's not the same as being a "content moderator." What InShaneee did to me was to falsely call my editing a personal attack, remove it, and then threatened to block me if I put my comments back. That's censorship and an abuse of his administative powers. Thanks for your understanding. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 17:44, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know Pope's definition of "Bathos," I'm sure, and I trust you to know the modern meaning, as well. Take a look at the contention between myself and another editor at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathos.html" title="Bathos">Bathos</a>, if you get a chance, and weigh in on the talk page. My feeling is that nothing allegorical, much less anything allegorical and mystical, can suffer from "Bathos," because the usual rules are in abeyance. This is aside from when and whether an image moves from the bathos to the sublime. Whether Pope himself would have applied the definition to the Bible or not (and we know that answer), I feel pretty strongly that no mystical allegories are susceptible.

<p>Bishonen, I keep having an unwelcome editor on my page. No doubt hoping I will break the three revert so I can be conveniently banned. Would you be so kind as to ask him to desist and take his comments away with him. He seems rather slow in taking the hint that he is unwelcome there.

<li>I <i>think</i> the source for that was graffiti found on a wall during the plague, rather than the fire. It was a common enough thing for an age where the use of Latin was part of every educated person's baggage. Where, though, it entered modern currency is another matter.

<p>As I lay there, my ears rattling with pain, somehow I still managed (when I got the lucid chance) to get half way through Dmitry Merezhkovsky's 500-page (how was I even able to carry it — well, thanks to my gentle care, it's now physically split into a few pieces, that's 1953 hardcover for ya!; I would have actually prefered softness under these circumstances) <i>the Romance of Leonardo Da Vinci</i> (oddly, the Hebrew translation I have is only titled <i>Leonardo Da Vinci</i>).

<p>Okay, sorry to bother you about this again (I'm sure you're as sick to death of this situation as I am), but EE's returned and is again edit warring at <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28song%29.html" title="Cool (song)">Cool (song)</a> and quarreling on the related talk page. He first parachuted into the talk page yesterday claiming to be three different editors, none of whom were EE (really, how many Gwen Stefani/Shakira/<i>Legend of Zelda</i> fans edit Wikipedia?); having his bluff called, he's now gone back to reverting edits that I've justified and explained to death on the talk page (including rewriting his hopelessly ornate prose - apparently, according to him, "reminisces about" is preferable to "remembers"). I was wondering if this type of behaviour was covered by the ArbCom ruling on him, because I'm considering leaving a report at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Arbitration_enforcement_148a.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement</a>, but I'm not sure how these things work.

<dd>Certainly it's covered. Amply. IMO you should ban him from the pages he disrupts, and <i>then</i> report on the enforcement page that you have done so. I suggest banning for two days, since it says "a week in case of repeat offenses" (a strangely feeble time indication, which sounds as if it's meant for blocks rather than bans). Don't forget to ban from the talk pages also, otherwise you might as well just semiprotect the articles. Now, to ban from a page means, as you know, to <i>tell an editor</i> that they're not allowed to edit it. I realize the problem there, since it's a cloud of IPs that needs to be told, but you'll just have to post a message on the talkpages of the IPs involved so far (obviously, there's no need to check whether each of the IPs has separately been disruptive, it's disruption by the individual that's at issue). And why not reinforce it by posting the message on the article talkpages also. Then report on the enforcement page. Then, if/when you find that the ban isn't respected, report <i>that</i>, semiprotect the articles, consider whether to semiprotect the talkpages also (but that is a very, very, awkward thing to have to do) or merely keep reverting the editor, and do what you can to <i>block</i> him, because that is also what a ban means: if it's not respected, you block. If you're not savvy with range blocks, appeal to the arbcom to help, ask them how long the block can be, post an appeal for range blocking or other clever technical solution on ANI, and ask somebody like Mackensen or Essjay directly.</dd>
<dd>Sorry to be telling you what to do it rather than do it myself, but I'm not dealing with Hollow Wilerding any more. I'm tired of it, I have better things to do, and it's not like my previous efforts have been appreciated. I don't need telling twice that I've "taunted" a sensitive user, or to have my friends threatened with banning for trying to help.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Proposed_decision&amp;oldid=72575270#Giano_banned_for_taunting" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Proposed_decision&amp;oldid=72575270#Giano_banned_for_taunting" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> It's somebody else's turn.

<dd>Thanks for responding. I completely understand that you're not going to deal with HW anymore; I'd do the same myself, but unfortunately we both worked on that specific article quite a bit. (Long story short: there was a big dispute involving myself and EE/Winnermario regarding the coverage of pop music on Wikipedia; I helped "save" the article from imminent FAC failure as my way of extending an "olive branch" to WM, and that gesture turned around and bit me soon enough.) Anyway, I thought I was too close to the dispute to place a ban myself, so I posted on <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Arbitration_enforcement_148a.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Arbitration enforcement</a>, and Bunchofgrapes has done it. I disagree with the idea of banning - or "cautioning" or otherwise - Giano for what he said to EE; his remark seemed rather harmless, particularly given the circumstances. I don't want a good editor like you to feel stressed, so here's a <a href="../../../o/t/h/Wikipedia%7EOther_awards_c564.html#The_Zen_Garden_Award" title="Wikipedia:Other awards">Zen Garden Award</a> in honour of your "extraordinary patience in the face of toil or turmoil".

I just told Werdna on IRC... well, never mind what I told him, maybe I'll post it on the wiki as well, but I <i>have</i> to go out now. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:21, 5 September 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I did see the comments about him by by some people who do not know him, and forced myself for once not to press save, otherwise i probably would have been banned for obscenities. his email won't work either. This is terrible. BTW is that D Bryant allowed to keep fiddling with my archives, because he's changed his mind over his daft template, I though people were not supposed to tamper with archives. Can I revert him?

<dd>Well, I suppose you <i>can</i> revert him, but it would be pretty ungracious. All he's doing, that I can see, is removing stuff he posted himself—striking through it, so that the archive is still complete, and still contains everything that was posted on your page—and apologising. I wouldn't revert that if I were you. On the other hand, if I've missed him messing with anybody else's posts (=yours), then, yes, it would be appropriate to revert. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Ditto. If a naive and befuddled newcomer may be permitted an observation: the administrative war now raging against "incivility" reminds me of the Vietnam war general who explained the U.S. war strategy as "destroying the village to save it." The biggest threat to civility in Wikinam is not the hot-headed posts of angry editors. It's the cold, calculating intollerance of criticism and dissent. Just as the U.S. policy sought to label Vietnam nationalism as "communist expansionism," certain administrative warlords are attempting to label dissent and criticism as "incivility." If they continue, they just may save the village by destroying it.<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 12:19, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well don't give up on the place, there are a lot of good admins here, who are in command of huge respect by not expecting it. The admins who hang out on this page for instance. Sadly people seem to be confusing brusqueness, and direct speaking for incivility, and a lot of people seem surprised when their own incivil or bizarre actions lead to incivility in response. It's a problem and it's not going away. Incidentally if you are new, you won't know that ALoan is in my view one of Wikipedia's most respected editors because of his contributions and impecable manners. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 12:32, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may butt in, I've been thinking about this issue recently too, and I think in part it can be attributed to the phenomenon of the cure causing more of the disease, or rather the remedy causing more of the problem. The same way that a 1-800 number at a vacuum company will prompt way more people to call for help instead of reading the manual, and that some people believe bar brawls and shootings outside nightclubs would decrease if cities reduced police patrols and instead paid people to hand out free flowers at closing time, I think admin intervention (of a certain type) is escalating the incivility and conflict. Perhaps there should be a civility patrol, of people who are especially gentle souls, who can post genial, non-threatening warnings/suggestions on the talk pages of people who have been accused of incivility; the lack of 'threat' associated with a warning from an admin might de-escalate as well as, but less invasively than, the cooldown blocks currently in use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But in fact I think the problem is bigger, and regrettably I think it's because of the way the site is run. I'm not a dictator, but I think the lack of hard-and-fast regulations makes it very stressful for the people who shoulder the responsibility of helping the site run smoothly. I've seen many instances here recently (and I've seen this a lot in RL too) where people with authority and responsibility, or even just a <i>sense of responsibility</i> come to the community and say something isn't working, and 'the community' says in its wisdom that no, it <i>is</i> working, everyone (like Animal Farm) just has to work harder, but it is in fact the ones <i>asking for a change</i> who are doing all the work. I see this most blatantly over requests to lock pages due to vandalism. There are a <i>lot</i> of people who just get fed up with WP because they can't stand to watch vandalism happen without doing something about it, but they're too pooped to keep up with aggressive cells. IMO there are several key deficiencies in the way the community is run that are directly causing burnout, and I'm not trying to deflect responsibility from the admins people have been discussing, but I think the recent behaviour is, if not burnout, a result of a deficiency in the community's order. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 12:48, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Carnildo got promoted anyway? That's insane! Everyone else needs 75-80% approval. I guess you don't if two members of ArbCom vote for you. To promote him anyway is not simply a question of changing the goalposts, but intentionally throwing scorn on an enormous number of people who voted against him.

<p>Hi Bish, Suddenly, everyone has a right not to be offended? I don't get it. When I arrived, it was only a handful of newbies who cared what people said and thought about them. Suddenly, who said what first and better take it back or else is all I see. Is it just that I'm spending more time on people's talk pages? Or is the encyclopedia finished and it's time to lock all the pages and send everyone home? It seems that improving the encyclopedia has reached the point of diminishing returns, and the politics is becoming more important than the outcome. Sigh. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 08:06, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Ben. Yes, the encyclopedia is done, now comes the next great project: the civility drive. I propose upgrading the RFA process by requiring all admin candidates to take this simple test:
<dl>
<dt>You block a person for Personal Attacks and write them a block message.</dt>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Do you call them a) by their name, b) "asshole", c) "my friend"?</li>
<li>Which of these phrases would you use to announce the block: a) you have been blocked, b) you have been given a time-out, c) I'm giving you an opportunity to reflect?</li>
<li>Which of these policies/guidelines would you recommend to the blockee? a) <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, b) <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, c) <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>?
<dl>
<dd>That was a trick question, you must recommend all of them. Here's the real question: <i>when</i> you recommend these pages, would you use the verb a) to see, b) to review, c) to get a load of?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Do you tell them that they <i>are</i> welcome to contribute as long as they remain civil? a) sure, and also that I'm trying to <i>help</i> them contribute more constructively, b) hell no, c) yes.</li>
<li>You should mention their attitude. Do you tell them it needs a) fixing, b) improvement, c) adjustment?</li>
<li>In this space, add your own suggestions for helpful things to say: ...............................</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>For a perfect score, the correct answers are c, c, b, a, c. Note that 1b is <i>very bad</i>, go away and try again next year. 5b is somewhat acceptable. One good answer for question 6 would be "This is not a punishment", but it is hoped that you will be creative.

<dd>Ideogram: yes, I am. I apologize for doing it indirectly like this. I was going to criticize you on your own page, but when I got there you had archived the offending material, so I meant to let it slide. Apparently I couldn't resist blowing off a little steam when a visitor quoted you. It would obviously have been better to explain my problem to you directly, and I'll do that now, if you like. Or archive this thread, as you archived material I assume you had some regrets about.

I blinked in surprise when I read that. We've met before, and it wasn't what I expected from you. The best thing you can do to promote civility on the site is to lead by example, not level down to make a point. Also, about your analogy, please consider that you have pretensions that Ghirlandajo doesn't: to be a guardian of civility, to lecture others on it, to be a mediator (if you still do that, I don't know). Especially for those roles, your first concern should be your own civility—to be civil always, including to people who speak brusquely to you. I was going to make these points on your page but refrained when I saw you had archived your reply to Giano so it wasn't visible any more—I assumed/hoped that you'd started to regret it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:20, 9 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I don't understand why you say I have pretensions. I'm just saying that we should all obey the same rules, so if you are going to excuse Ghirlandajo for being uncivil, you certainly shouldn't criticize me for the same thing.

<p>My apologies for interjecting into your private conversation, but in my view we certainly <i>should</i> all obey the same rules - that is, follow accepted norms of civil, rational discourse. Are you seriously suggesting that the proper response to someone who you think is uncivil, is to be uncivil back? We will end up in the land of the blind men, where no-one can see, that way (and heaven help our article on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant_test.html" title="Elephant test">elephants</a> then). Being uncivil is bad; being <i>deliberately</i> uncivil as a response to perceived incivility in others is <i>worse</i>. If you are finding it an effort to be civil (as an increasing number of people seem to recently, whether by accident or design), may I suggest that you count to ten, take a deep breath of fresh air, and consider whether you really want to be uncivil. (If nothing else, if someone else is being uncivil, then being icily polite back throws their incivility into higher relief, and may shame them into tempering their behaviour.) -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 21:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Of course it is bad for anyone to be uncivil. But what you find uncivil, I and others may not. It is incumbent on every editor to make reasonable efforts to try to avoid others perceiving incivilty in what they say and do, but I can't help it if you take umbrage at my always-reasonable comments and actions&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:05, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that case I'll continue. Oh, yes, we're agreed on that. My position isn't that incivility should be condoned or approved, it's that incivility should not be so eagerly <i>sanctioned</i>: RFAR'd, RFC'd, or (especially) blocked. It's not the case that everything that's not sanctioned is <i>all right</i>. Now, your statement that "If he doesn't get sanctioned, neither will I" seems to say that as long as you don't get sanctioned for it, it's <i>all right</i> to be uncivil. I don't think that at all. Did you notice I complained, in my RFAR statement, of Ghirlandajo's incivility to me? Did you notice he apologized? (Answer: yes, you did, you even mentioned it and praised him for it.) Do I see any signs of you apologizing to Giano and Pan Gerwazy? (Answer: no, I don't.) See how your analogy works both ways? And a final question: if you were to apply for adminship, would you like to see people quote some of these things you've been saying here back to you? Like for instance "I would certainly prefer it if everyone was civil, but I'm not about to make the effort if other people don't"? See, that's wrong-headed and petulant and rankly against Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:09, 9 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I had never seen Ghirlandajo apologize before, which is why I made a special note of it and as a result recommended the RFAr be dropped. That really was my problem with Ghirlandajo, that he never seemed to admit that incivility was a problem. He was always assuming the problem was something else.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apologizing is an extraordinary act, not something that can be required of people. I hope you agree with that. I never would have said "Ghirlandajo must be forced to apologize", forced insincerity is pointless. The fact that Ghirlandajo decided to apologize on his own is what makes it sincere and extraordinary. I might go so far as to say the fact that he apologized shows he can be a <i>better</i> man than I, and I respect him for it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now that we agree that incivility is undesirable, the next question is how can we discourage it? ALoan suggested above that we set an example by continuing to be civil. Do you think I didn't try that? What do you think was the result? Do you really think I should keep trying something that doesn't work?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Going to Arbcom is not a good solution, but we <i>tried everything else</i>. Certainly if Ghirladajo left Wikipedia it would have been bad for Wikipedia, but the question is whether that is worse than people avoiding him and letting him rule his little fiefdom of articles. Ultimately that's a decision only the Arbcom can make.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You should note that we agree on almost all the major issues. We agree that Ghirlandajo's civility is undesirable. We agree that Ghirlandajo has improved of late, and as a result the RFAr should be dropped. As far as I can tell we only disagree on one tactic, my allowing myself to express my true feelings (resulting in incivility) in order to make a point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may not have been the best tactic to choose, but I was in fact getting very frustrated and didn't know what else to do. We are all human, and ultimately the only way to work beyond our mistakes is to assume good faith and discuss things. Before I was concerned because Ghirlandajo seemed to refuse to discuss anything. Now that he is more amenable, I welcome him to Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for adminship, if someone were so deluded as to nom me, I would gently decline and suggest they seek counselling. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 22:27, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will also add that by being deliberately incivil in an effort to get people to admit that incivility is bad (duh), you are not only violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> yourself but also <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <i>Yet</i> note carefully that we are <i>discussing</i> this with you, not blocking you or hauling you before arbcom.

<dd>But the oldest attestation it provides is from <i>the Observer</i> 1984: "At weekends boatloads of Dutch 'anoraks' — pirate radio fans — come out to cheer on their latest hero."

<p>Hi -- thought I'd let you know that an anon vandalized CSICOP; looks to me as if a checkuser to see if this is Davkal would be warranted. I'm at work and can't wend my way through the policies to figure out whether and how to post the request, but I'll do that this evening if you don't have time to look at it. If it is indeed Davkal, I think his block needs to go up to a month; after the Leonovski incident he can no longer plead ignorance of sockpuppet policy. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 14:08, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although there are some similarities (such as use of obscenities in vandalizing articles on skeptics), I don't think this is Davkal. However, he needs some serious blocking - his talk page is littered with warning notices and at least one block for his ongoing vandalism attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:170.3.8.253" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:170.3.8.253" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 15:33, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello Bishonen - On May 19, after discussing the matter with <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">User:Charles_Matthews</a>, you moved the article on Erich Heller to User:Prof02/Erich Heller so that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf02_45e8.html" title="User:Prof02">User:Prof02</a> could work on the article with minimal intervention by other editors. At the time, Charles Matthews called the move a "short term solution" and proposed returning to this "in the not-too-distant future." Time has slipped by, and Wikipedia has now been without an article on Erich Heller for 4 months. Meanwhile Prof02 has produced a still rough but very long (161 kb) draft in his userspace, written in the florid, editorializing manner which you and Charles tried to discourage. I dropped him what I thought was a civil note, suggesting that he should release the article back into public user space, but he says he has no "deadline" and may even choose to delete the whole thing in the end. I'm not sure that he appreciates that he is not simply writing from scratch but was entrusted with an article that was already in the main encyclopedia. Perhaps it is time for you to consider reinstating the May 19/2006 version of the Erich Heller article in the public pages. You could even protect the public Erich Heller article, if you think Prof02 is really going to come up with something usable. But until he does, Wikipedia users should find something (even if only the May 19/2006 locked-down version) when they search on "Erich Heller." - <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiPedant_c1b0.html" title="User:WikiPedant">WikiPedant</a> 05:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree, WikiPedant, especially since we seem to be still waiting for the user's promised mellowing-out (hello there, Uppland). And especially since the latest comment from the professor is that he may need another four years (!). I'll see if I can figger how to move the pre-prof version complete with its history into article space. Then the user can go on editorializing in his userspace ad infinitum, at least as far as I'm concerned; I don't see what harm it does. (I don't see what use it is, either, but perhaps it's time to stop expecting it). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I think it's
<ol>
<li>delete the page,</li>
<li>restore the older versions</li>
<li>move the page into article space (this leaves behind the deleted newer versions I beilieve)</li>
<li>restore all the deleted newer versions at User:Prof02/Erich Heller</li>
<li>revert to the pre-redirect ver</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>All theoretical knowledge, of course: whenever I actually try anything like this I end up with a heart attack. Probably best to beg someone good with the buttons to do it; only downside is that Prof2 might then accost them. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that sounds right, Bunch, but I worry about getting tripped up by some unexpected busybody feature in the software--especially that 4) would actually jump the restored versions to the new name--to article space.

<p>Bishonen, sorry to trouble you again. But Davkal is back and edit warring again. Despite the overwhelming consensus reached among editors on the CSICOP talk page, Davkal's resumed reverting changes and writing in his POV. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 15:06, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bishonen, I can understand this decision, but what I don't understand is why you would then stack the deck in his favor. Why did you delete one of Davkal's most vile personal attacks from his talk page, where he called you a "meatpuppet" and a "prickess," and made a sexual innuendo against you? You explained, " Since another admin will be turning up at this page, I'm doing you the favor of removing the most egregious of your insults." What did he do to deserve such a favor? Did he EVER apologize for those vile attacks - or even admit that they are wrong? Shouldn't he be held accountable for his conduct? <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 13:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you do, EM. When will you learn, eh? There is a ruling that she's limited to a single account; and after a lot of kicking and screaming and "declining" the ruling--I'm glad the ArbCom got to see that exhibition with their own eyes--she finally (apparently) accepted it. And right away she's editing anonymously? Again? If she had made some sort of immediate excuse, said she'd done it by mistake or something, that would have been different. I'm writing a request for clarification right now, asking what the appropriate penalties are for violating the ruling. (If there aren't any, then helloo, meaningful ruling!) So let me get this clear: you're saying that, quite apart from the IP issue, now that she has been warned off making piddling annoyance edits to articles authored by Giano, Bishonen, Bunchofgrapes, she switched to doing them to you instead? Is that it? If so my advice is: block Velten for 24 hours for annoyance edits, plus 24 for spitting in the face of the ruling. 48 hours. I can do it if you'd rather not, I don't mind being involved to that extent. Don't wait for the reply to my request for clarification--you remember how long it took for ArbCom to even cast enough votes to activate the ruling? (We might still be waiting if I hadn't been running around reminding them.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:10, 19 September 2006 (UTC).</dd>

Hmm, I'd like to think of myself as good natured, but I guess adminship images requires more "firmness" in the face of disruptive users. Okay, I've blocked her for 48 hours, and I might comment on the request for clarification (just to help stress the urgency and importance of the matter, if nothing else). On an unrelated note, I'm thinking of listing a pop music article at peer review in the (somewhat) near future. I was wondering if I could ask you to take a look at it for me then? I know you said you weren't interested in the pop music articles, but I want to make sure the article could be understandable to someone who doesn't know much about pop music. If you're not interested then I won't mind; it's just you have more experience in writing good articles (particularly FAs) than I do. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 18:28, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also think the points I make, resulting in KB's allegations of personal attacks, are warranted since he is claiming not to understand what the phrase "state of play" means in order to disrupt the talk page on telepathy, and is treating me in a condescending manner by suggesting that I am one of only three people in the universe who understands that term.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 22:53, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I know you're not much into the "cooking up policy" theorizing, Bishonen, but your talk page has pretty good traffic, so I hope you don't mind if I piggyback a bit. I explain the situation on the page, but, essentially, I have faith that the people who could write a million articles are clever enough to have some alternative to RFA other than having the beaurocrats do exactly as they wish without regard to the community's voice.

<p>Bishonen, I need your help or any other administrator's. I put up a complaint on AN/I yesterday, but thanks to a little intervention by my friend InShaneee, no administrator has responded.

<p>Bishonen, here is an interesting piece of Wiki policy:</p>
<p>"Use of blocks to gain an advantage in a content dispute is strictly prohibited. That is, sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute."</p>
<p>Given that we are currently engaged in such a dispute, ie., it is my edits of your edits that you are complaining about (they are the only ones I have made in the last few days so it can't be anything else), it is clear that you are breaching a policy and that such behaviour is "striclty prohibited". I would therefore be grateful if you could remove my page ban from the CSICOP page immediately.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 13:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen them. <i>I</i> would go ahead and fix what are left of your tendentious, POV, and non-grammatical edits, but no doubt you would then state that <i>I</i> was involved in the content dispute as well, and on down the line of administrators <i>ad infinitum</i>. The absense of people stepping up to the plate in the last few hours or days to edit-war with you is much more a reflection of their understanding that Wikipedia regards edit warring as a gravely bad thing, than any indication of consensus that your edits are beneficial. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 14:28, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Davkal, here's an interesting instruction prominently posted at the top of my page: <b>Please post at the foot of the page!</b> And here's a suggestion: when your conduct is criticized, reflect on your <b>conduct</b>, don't march off to the nearest policy page looking for something you can take out of context and out of the spirit of the policy to ruleslawyer with. And here's some information: I'm not in a content dispute with you. I'm not a regular editor of the CSICOP page, I merely fixed up a few style issues in passing, in a neutral way. It never even occurred to me that anybody would object. I suppose that shows I haven't yet plumbed the depths of your keenness to push your POV, and never mind about article quality: if a word like "arrogant" about the side you don't <i>like</i> goes, with explanation, you must of course restore it, without explanation. My mistake. And here's the whole irrelevance of your post on my page: as I explained in my original message, you are still able to edit, in other words I haven't <i>blocked</i> you. I've <i>banned</i> you. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:32, 22 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Yes, and your ban is in bad faith since there has simply been no edit-warring taking place in the last few days. There have been very small edits to a number of sections by myself and then these have been added to, but certainly not reverted, by two of the other main contributers to the page. The only person who has actually reverted any of my changes was you - without any discussion on the talk page, and without any knowledge of the article that the passsage in question was characterising in the lines you amended. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 14:37, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest you (Bunchofgrapes) go to the CSICOP homepage and see what it says there. I then suggest you go the CSICOP discussion page in WIKI and see my reasons for using the perfectly grammatical wording I chose. I also suggest you go to the CSICOP article page now to see that editor who changed my wording's contribution is still there. I then suggest you explain how a change by me from "avoid" to "not to" and then a correction of my own edit from "not to" to "do not" to reflect what the CSICOP website actually says, and then a change from KB from "do not" back to to "not to" is a knee-jerk revert ratrher than merely being some tinkering around the edges to try to make the article better. I suspect you thought that my original change from "not to" to "do not" was a revert - it wasn't, it was a CORRECTION of my own edit to "not to" when I realised that the website actually said "Does not". But then you would know all that if you had actually looked at the edits. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 14:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bunchofgrapes - you call me a child. I think you are the child. You made a mistake but can't admit it. There was no edit war. You mistook my own earlier edits and corrections for revertions and edit warring between editors. I made the change to "not to" and then to "do not" - not Hob Gadling as I think you suppose - I am surely not edit-warring with myself. KB then changed it back to "not to" (he probably made the same mistake as you and thought he would spite me by reverting to another editor's words rather than to my earlier version which is still the version in the article). Now why don't all the adults in the room go back to the CSICOP article and see that what I am saying is true. Then like adults, the ban can be lifted and like children, we can all live happily ever after.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 11:41, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bishonen wrote: "I see you congratulate yourself on having driven off a valuable editor, how nice" just below my favourite lyrics. It does not take a genius to work out what she is (wrongly) referring to so to suggest that I have admittted that these lyrics are about askolnick on account of my working this out is nonsense. The lyrics were actually a goodbye to all at Wiki from me since I was fed up of the constant abuse and harrassment I have suffered at the hands of asolnick, bishonen and others. The last straw being the now constant reverting of almost any change I make just for the sake of it, and the "protection" of the CSICOP page from editing by anyone who edits in line with my views and arguments. Since the supposed consensus was attained in my absence, the ridiculously POV version that was adopted has been reverted or altered three times by two seperate editors in as many days. Undeterred, Bishonen has simply blocked the editrors or protected the page so that only I am allowed to edit from my view and so of course it will look like I am breaking consensus. The only problem being, there never was a consensus - there was just three editors with biased views trying to get their POV in by hook, but mostly by crook. The fact that there version lasted about 15 minutes before someone quite unconnected recognised it for what it was and changed it is all the evidence you need to see that others find the article POV as well.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavkal_758b.html" title="User:Davkal">Davkal</a> 17:22, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you look at askolnick's reasons for leaving he was blaming another editor at the time - THB. The fiftieth editor, or something, that he had become embroiled in a war with.

<p>You should see the last on my talk page: There is an RFAR where I am an involved party regarding the Giano/Carnildo mess. As someone more conversant with diffing and careful than I, you may wish to take a look. I know there are too many demands on our time already. (Oh, and for Giano: A philosophy prof from Iowa told me he told his class, "You know, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_James_2cca.html" title="William James">William James</a> had an even more famous brother. Anyone know who it was?"

<li>I don't get it. Is this in place of the other one, in addition to the other one? All I see currently is Tony telling us that there is a mass of evidence, but it's privately communicated to the ArbCom and Jimbo. That makes no sense and somewhat illustrates the very problem. If evidence isn't on the evidence page, it's not supposed to be evidence at all. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:46, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's the same case. Up until now, technically, it was only a proposed case. Once 4 arbitrators vote to take the case, it gets officially "opened" and gets its own pages. The prior comments remain in the record but more detailed evidence, arguments, etc. can now be offered by those feeling inclined. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:18, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is also widely believed of many that the Arbitrators don't spend much time looking at those statements once the case is open, and sometimes (but not always) the Workshop page gets short shrift too. The most important thing -- the page the Arbitrators are required to look at with careful scrutiny -- is the evidence page.

<dd>Well, the arbers I've seen have waxed wroth with him, indeed. Were he the issue, there would be a conclusion of it. I'm afraid that he is not the issue, to my mind, but rather a symptom of it. The fact that folks are having to infer what has been implied is, by itself, another symptom of the "our house is ours, and the windows are blacked out." I do not expect or desire public humiliation, but I do expect openness. Either there was no grounds for dismissal (no RfAR) or no need for secrecy. I gather from the "I wrote you privately" on the evidence page that there was some form of resignation. If there were, that is private and not appropriate for an evidence page. If there wasn't, then ... Well, my point is that it's either evidentiary (and therefore open) or not (and therefore not to be mentioned as evidence), but mentioning it is yet more of an insistence that there is a back slapping back channel, and that's no way helpful. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:46, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Just out of interest, and this is a very interesting domestic tip for the benefeit of all Wikipedians, if you have to buy a new cuttlery thingy for a Miele dishwasher it costs £55 from John Lewis, but if you go to your local tip, they have them behind the skips and let you take them out for nothing (well you have to give them a fiver) take it home, soak in domestos (you don't know who the previous owner was) and hey presto you have saved £50 - Clever nicht wahr? <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 20:59, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>ALoan was making a funny about "ping" -- a sonar pulse, see <i>The Hunt for Red October</i> perhaps -- not about clothes dryers, Giano -- and clothes dryers aren't kitchen appliances, you know. Whatever would you do without me. As for your domestic tip, I don't know what a "local tip" is, nor "the skips", or "domestos", so I'm afraid I'm going to have a hard time following up on it. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 22:04, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bishonen, I just got your message -- I forgot to add your page to my watchlist, so I didn't know you'd responded. Sorry. As for the sock, I have no idea who it is -- BTW, he's got a whole 12 now&#160;:( -- in fact I didn't even look at the contributions. Have a checkuser run -- please, as I'm just a bit irritated that the person <i>is</i> a sock (and that I stupidly missed that).</dd>
<dd>That being said, yes, I <i>was</i> nasty to KV because I'd had enough of him at pseudoscience -- I'm sorry, but he's a pompous ass. OK, maybe that's not a great excuse, but it is honest.</dd>
<dd>Flo brings up the key point though -- his edits are highly questionable, and he tends to twist facts (or fact/quote-mine) to support his position. This too is likely to be considered uncivil, but beneath that is the major philosophical difference betwen myself (and others) and KV. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vitalism&amp;diff=78377625&amp;oldid=78376728" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vitalism&amp;diff=78377625&amp;oldid=78376728" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> -- i.e., the example you posted on my page.

<dd>Hello all. Well, yes, take a good hard look at what I have done here. I turned up originally on the PS article a while back. I noticed a lot of problems there and worked towards problem solving. I've discovered quite a lot of good solutions. The very concept of PS needed clarifying. Especially as it relates to fields. From the majority science view, fields are generally not considered pseudoscientific, or at least, not in explanation. Fields have PS aspects, usually multiple. I worked on many specific PS concepts in many fields in order to clear this up on the PS article. I then worked with others such as Jefffire and FeloniusMonk, to clarify the point on the PS cat. My proposal was always towards enforcing the NPOV policy on pseudoscience, and what science says about it. I basically used clarity and compromise. Rather than fields being identified as PS (and some are), I worked hard to ensure that the specific elements of those fields were identified as PS, rather than the field. The field can be mentioned, but only to say which particular PS concept is used where, and to explain why is is considered pseudoscientific. This overcomes a lot of problems at once. It means that proponents don't get their whole field labeled "a pseudoscience". It reduces the complaint about PS being a pejorative term. It means the reader gets specifics on why a field is considered to have PS aspects. It allows us to look at PS aspects of accepted fields that have moved on. Its a great solution. Some proponents will not like it nevertheless, and of course some proponents will resist NPOV policy in general and they will rant and rave and attack whenever you try to add the PS cat to their vested interest despite other accepted fields being added to the cat. But the fact remains, more specific information has been presented as a result of my encouragement in that direction. I've encouraged civility, and worked flexibly with other editors. Some groups will tend to stalk one through WP though. Anyway, as a pathalogically lying pompous assed mahatma, I may yet have more solutions on the way. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrishnaVindaloo_27e9.html" title="User:KrishnaVindaloo">KrishnaVindaloo</a> 09:52, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Jim62sch. You'd be battling with NPOV policy so perhaps you are quite sensible to give up. All the names you dropped above have shown a strong tendency for consensus over NPOV policy. So they are pretty unlikely to get along with me, no matter how many times I contact them for civil discussion. There is a problem on the PS article for the same reason, and there is certainly a problem on the chiropractic article. There are groups with biases who stick together and award each other barnstars for committing OR, and who generally try to find authority figures with claimed credentials in publishing etc. I've a few publications myself, but I have no need whatsoever to use authority, or to seek approval from POV pushing groups. NPOV policy does it all for me. Or perhaps I should say, I have adapted to NPOV policy. That is the environment we are working in, that is the reality. If you don't like it, well just go ahead and give up. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrishnaVindaloo_27e9.html" title="User:KrishnaVindaloo">KrishnaVindaloo</a> 11:22, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your input, all. Jim, I'm sorry I didn't make it clear on ANI about the sockpuppet issue. I thought I had, but I guess I was too roundabout. I've put a question to the user on <a href="../../../v/i/t/Talk%7EVitalism_2c30.html" title="Talk:Vitalism">Talk:Vitalism</a> now. But this isn't something I can request a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">CheckUser</a> about—no policy basis for it, as no specific puppetmaster is suspected and the sock isn't known to have been abusive.

If you think I'm windy and nebulous, as I no doubt am, I'll entertain any suggestions about what to cut, but I'm as tight as I can get on my own. There is some news, as well, which I've e-mailed you about (Wiki news, not real news). The real news is that the little buggers all have the latest campus plague, and they've succeeded in passing it on to me, so I'm going to have a week or so of mysterious autumn rhinovirus. (One child had actual strep throat.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:40, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh that! why didn't you say so in the first place, you Americans are always so evasive, we would just say the kid needs its tonsils out, and take it down to the hospital on "Tonsil day" (making sure it was tonsil day) and have them out - end of story.

I still don't see why tonsylitus is called strep throat - anyhow I can't read the medical pages they always make me feel ill, as I can't help adopting the symptoms, in fact I have the start of a soar throat now........<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 20:53, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes -- I'm back, busy but back to the routine of daily life. Alaska was wonderful and I needed the break. Thank you for your note. It has been quite some time since I played with that article. I'll look it over. It has been decided that I will finally stand for administrator, although I still have reservations. I suggested we do the "paperwork" during the second week in October. Do you have any advice? I work in such obscure corners that I don't think many editors know my ID. Of course, admins do because of all the lovely blocks. They continue, to my sorrow.

<dd>I thought I should let you know that my schedule has changed again. I'll be sent out of state for work during the 2nd week in October. So, I guess we'll try on the 4th week instead.

<p>Hogeye just created two pov forks of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28social%29.html" title="Anarchism (social)">anarchism (social)</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28political%29.html" title="Anarchism (political)">anarchism (political)</a>). These are both clearly pov forks and were redirected to the anarchism page, which hogeye has already reverted calling it vandalism (even though I explained why on the talk pages of each). Hogeye knows this is against policy and doesn't really give a damn as evidenced by his message on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a> under the topic "YANDP". This user is seriously wearing down people's patience and is clearly trying to provoke an edit war. As a relatively non-interested party (and an admin) I would appreciate it if you got involved in this. I also just noticed <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Anarchism (disambiguation)">this</a> page as well. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 19:30, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could one of you possibly be a little use for once in a blue moon? I reverted Hogeye's POV fork <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism_%28social%29.html" title="Anarchism (social)">Anarchism (social)</a> back to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>, see post above, and he reverted me right back, which was his fourth revert of that one article in two hours. Apparently he's under the impression that by saying "rv vandalism" in the edit summary, he magically turns the previous edit into vandalism indeed. He's an experienced editor and experienced, uh, blockee, so he obviously knows about the 3RR. Would somebody like to cast a look and take appropriate action, should any occur to you? (<a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3RR_fb6a.html" title="WP:AN3RR">WP:AN3RR</a> just feels like a lot of trouble for such a simple case.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Hi, Bishonen. Since you linked to a post from me<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78543787" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78543787" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> as evidence that there's a general feeling that it would be tactless to criticize Kelly now that she's gone, I feel I should clarify my post. With Kelly gone (but possibly still looking in and reading her messages), I felt it would be in bad taste to turn her talk page into a forum for discussion of her faults. I also have a particular dislike of editors using another editor's talk page in order to carry on an unflattering discussion about that editor. (If you think I'm an awful admin, then say it <i>to</i> me on <i>my</i> talk page, or say it <i>about</i> me on <i>someone else's</i> talk page.) However, I do think it's appropriate that the arbitration case should look into her behaviour, since she is a party in the case. It may surprise you, but I was considering adding my name to those who asked her <i>on her own invitation</i> to give up her admin rights. I was more inclined, however, to ask her to consider that as a second choice if she couldn't agree to stop treating so many users so dismissively.</p>
<p>By the way, you were partly responsible for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006/Vote/Kelly_Martin&amp;diff=34673594&amp;oldid=34667501" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006/Vote/Kelly_Martin&amp;diff=34673594&amp;oldid=34667501" rel="nofollow">this</a> (if you read the second half of my last sentence), although I think it would have happened anyway, as I hate being part of a lynch mob.

<p>I am very disturbed by your implication that more productive editors deserve special treatment ("allowing for the sensitivities and pride of productive editors"). Did you really mean this? --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 01:34, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I certainly do. Productive editors deserve more care than useless trolls. That is my comparison, exemplifeid by Giano as against Eternal Equinox. Do you see me imply anywhere that, say, Giano and Ghirlandajo deserve <i>more</i> special treatment than <i>other</i> productive editors? No, you don't, and it's not what I mean. "Productive editors" means "all those who are here to help build the encyclopedia." It includes people who do other useful tasks than write articles. It includes everybody who even wants to be useful. It includes everybody except the people who are here <i>only</i> because they enjoy wasting the time of others. You might not think there are people like that on Wikipedia, but believe me, I've met them. We should try to keep them out, IMO. All productive editors are <i>equal</i>, and equally deserving of care, and of allowances for their sensitivities. Does that clear things up? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:05, 2 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>In that case I think you could have worded your opinion more clearly. Tony Sidaway, Camildo, Kylu, basically everyone involved in this case is a "productive editor" by your definition. I agree with your clarification of your statement, but I just don't see how it is relevant here. I have seen a disturbing tendency from Giano and Ghirlandajo to emphasize their own contributions and suggest others should look to their own rather than carp over issues of civility. I think you would do well to dissociate yourself from these comments and perhaps advise them not to take this approach. --<a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 02:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do <i>not</i> look if you're awake on the day you consider Monday. However, there is now a first draft by Fred of the proposed decision.

<dd>By way of clarification, there's a draft of the <i>first part</i> of the proposed decision, but he hasn't gotten to the bulk of the findings or to the remedies yet. There is also Dmcdevit's preliminary views on the workshop talk page. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, guys. Sorry, I had already looked, at both... I've been chatting with BoG, the most compulsive watchlist-watcher in the world, and he has been updating me on any and all news hot off the griddle. I know you're only giving me the outworks here. This may be the most updated I've been in my life.

<dd>I looked, and I was right not to look before and wrong to look now. Maybe I'm just too much of a writing freak (although not a professional proofreader), but the decision is plagued by the same nebulous and meaningless language and special pleading as Fred's comments on the workshop. He's saying things like "Don't bait. Don't take the bait," but it's only gradually clear (in the signing statements, as it were) that agreeing to either is to agree that Giano baited and Tony took the bait. "Trolling is bad," and that means nothing at all, except that he believes that "trolling" is what I've done. He also argues, more than once, that it's a mere quibble over Carnildo and that only arbcom gets a voice. This is despite the pretty incredible evidence that Radiant! offered. Fred insists that anyone who gets demoted will never prevail on an RFA in the future, and Radiant! offered <b>data</b> that such is not the case. He insists that it was a small group complaining about the Carnildo affair, when Radiant!'s evidence established the reasoning behind the no votes.</dd>
<dd>No, I shouldn't have looked. I'm not the Master of Logic, but there is such winking and private reasoning going on there that even my modest abilities are offended. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:08, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I know. I couldn't believe it when Fred insisted that the problem with Tony's civility was that he let himself be <b>baited</b> (unstated premiss: <b>baiting</b> was what the other side were doing, not offering convictions or arguments of their own). Dmcdevit's comment about how Bishonen, Irpen, and Ghirla "don't seem sufficiently involved or problematic" (I'm supposing, sufficiently to be sanctioned or censored) also sounds to me like the only use of input from the community is as a yardstick for whether people need to be told off for offering it or not--I see nothing about anybody's input being of information or enlightenment. As you say, Radiant's analysis would have been a good candidate for that. I hope I'm reading too much into it. Perhaps I should comment on the page. But if comments are mere potential offenses, it seems a bit of a waste of time to offer them. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>It seems, when he has tried to spell it out, that he's saying: disagree, get told off, stop talking. If the other person won't do the right thing, you have to let him do the wrong thing, else you're trolling, because it's "sterile." So, speak only if you win, but you will only know if you will win by speaking, but, if you do not win, tug your forelock and get back to singing spirituals. Needless to say, I am "sufficiently involved," no doubt, to be upbraided for believing what I believe and expressing it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:04, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That picture makes him look like a legitimate cool cat, which is never how I've thought of him. One reason for writing Cockney School (and not letting it get folded into a "list of" article) is that it changes our readings to remember that these were not just young turks in the Shelley sense but young turks in the Allen Ginsberg sense. They were grime covered as well as great. (It's very hard to read Keats's poetry and think that he didn't live in the country. A city dweller did "Eve of St. Agnes?" How odd.)

<dd>I rememberd that BoG had gotten it late. The painting is a classic, too. Follow the gaze motion: dog to Tom to you. Follow the structural motion: dog to Tom's back to Charles to book pile to book to dog. Follow the interior structural motion, and you go dog's back to book to arm to finger to face. Great composition, and the dog's gaze is really touching. Also visible in there is the vogue for <i>large</i> dog collars. It would continue. Remember, one of the bits of Pope everyone knows is the "Epigram Writ for the Collar of a Dog":
<dl>
<dd>I am his majesty's dog at Kew,</dd>
<dd>Pray, tell me Sir, whose dog ar you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You can't get that on a conventional "Return if lost" dog tag, and it was a plate on the collar itself. Look how wide the collar is on Tom's dog. (Yeah, I would notice the doggie.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:34, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>At long last, Geogre seems to believe that the painting actually <i>is</i> of Killigrew.

<dd>Watch it! I don't need <i>you</i> pulling my tail, too. As for the picture, I cannot be sure if it is Tom Killigrew or Tom D'Avenant, as I never met the gentleman, but that's certainly Killigrew's dog. (Or, "Don't bother me, boy. Don't you know I have an army?" Or, "I never said it wasn't, and I defy to to find the diff." Or....) We need an article on <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collar.html" title="Collar">collars</a> that can generate List of famous dog collars and Dog collar fashions.

<dd>You <b>do</b> know that I'm making fun of myself there, I hope. By the way, every time it comes up on my watchlist I'm reminded that the article I'm proudest of (not the best by any means) is <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_adaptation.html" title="Film adaptation">film adaptation</a>. It's the best wiki-success I've had. Started as a substub, rewrote it from my head and my training, and then folks have generally added good stuff right along. It's rarer that something like that happens than that something all from one's solo work does, but it's really neat when it does. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

Clara got a little boost too. And there were just a few good comments and improvements amongst the slew of dross and vandalism (if you look carefully though the diffs and on the talk page).</p>

<li>So, how do you find all that out? No, don't tell me. I'd probably want the honor of having <a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Tale_of_a_Tub_8136.html" title="A Tale of a Tub">A Tale of a Tub</a> pass <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attalus_I_0ff7.html" title="Attalus I">Attalus I</a> in the "least clicked" category. I know it's got to be near the bottom. Even Orrmulum has to be miles in front of it, given the fact that it mentioned Lincoln or something in its first sentence and thus would have prompted hometown clickers. ("Hello, Cleveland! And Duchess of Cleveland, how do you do, too?") The "one edit per article" game is one of my own creation, and really just a challenge to myself, because I saw Interiot's tool and was <b>horrified</b> that I was spending 4 edits per page. I wanted to reduce that number as much as possible. I know it sounds like proving a point, given the current "evidence that's not evidence but posted from a blog for some reason other than evidence" boast of 10,000 vs. 1,000 edits in a year, but it really has been my goal to write one thing well from start to finish in one throw. (Oh, and ALoan, I had asked Grapes why he had a picture of Dryden up under the "Killigrew" heading at Drury Lane, so he was just rubbing it in a bit.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Click! Yesterday's edits on the rhino are there for all to see (it helps to have it as a link on a page and then look at "related changes"). And there is a magic "tool" that works out how many times a pages has been seen per day in a given month. (I mentioned Clara because there was a flurry of activity yesterday, which cannot be coincidence - she is mentioned). -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 18:26, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
