<p>Bisgh, I am kind of mentally different and like to do things that people dont approve of necessarliy but how would you like it if you were locked in your parents big house all alone most of the time either with just a computer and a TV?? I DO have friends but they have to come over and see me most of the time and I can't go see THEM without supervision. If have some money from my parents but can't really live alone yet and I don't know when. So a lot of my time is just sitting here&#160;:( Now Lucky wants to banish me for doing drugs. Well what would you do if it was after midnight and you hadn't gone out in 2 days either? I"m sorry, do what you have to do but please try to undrestand me.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_brah_9e73.html" title="User:Wiki brah">Wiki brah</a> 02:39, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been pointed in your direction for either a translation, or an explanation of the word "länsteater" and similar. My question arouse because of Gävleborgs Folkteater mentioned in the article <a href="../../../a/n/d/Anders_Norudde_d08e.html" title="Anders Norudde">Anders Norudde</a>. Do you know if there is a generally accepted translation of this proper name? If not, do you have a suggestion on a not too lenghty explanation of what a "länsteater" is? / <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 14:41, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry to cause you such trouble! Since I was pointed in your direction, I assumed you had something to do with Swedish-related stuff... I've corrected the dating info on the play/the forming of the group. "County theatre" sounds great, tax-sponsored institution is indeed what it is - but not very "folkrörelse", just paid by the tax. As we don't know of an official English namn, I think that addition explains enough. "People's theatre" to me sounds a bit too much like China. / <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 07:19, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bishonen knows a lot about theatre, and about Swedish-English translation, which is why I suggested that you ask her. Anyway, I think this is the type of translation issues that is likely to come up more often with better coverage of Swedish institutions and organisations. Sometimes a translation is obvious and straightforward and may even end up as an English term actually used for a similar type of institution. In other cases a translation sounds strange and may even be misleading. (Politically loaded terms are particularly problematic - how do you translate "<a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisinnade_folkpartiet.html" title="Frisinnade folkpartiet">Frisinnade folkpartiet</a>" or "<a href="../../../l/a/n/Lantmannapartiet.html" title="Lantmannapartiet">Lantmannapartiet</a>"?) As for theatres, I just thought of an article I wrote a while ago on the architect <a href="../../../a/x/e/Axel_Anderberg_91c3.html" title="Axel Anderberg">Axel Anderberg</a>, who built a number of theatres:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"His first significant commission was the new <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Swedish_Opera_e099.html" title="Royal Swedish Opera">Opera House</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> (1889-1898), which replaced the gustavian opera building. After having won the contest for the building he spent additional time abroad for the particular purpose of studying theatre architecture. He later designed the city theatres in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlstad.html" title="Karlstad">Karlstad</a> (1893), <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link%C3%B6ping.html" title="Linköping">Linköping</a> (1902-1903) and <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristianstad.html" title="Kristianstad">Kristianstad</a> (1906) and the <i><a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscarsteatern.html" title="Oscarsteatern">Oscarsteatern</a></i> in Stockholm (1906)."</dd>

<dd>I am not asking you to see this as a model, just as an example of my spontaneous reaction when confronted with a list of Swedish theatres. "Stadsteatern i X" was easy enough to translate and probably not misleading, but I felt that <i>Oscarsteatern</i> was a bit too much of a proper noun to translate (and I couldn't find an official translation). I left it in Swedish but in italics, which warns a reader that "here comes one of those long compound Swedish words, beware of stumbling!". Having thought about it a bit more, I think I would probably treat Gävleborgs folkteater much as Oscarsteatern; even though it is on the surface easy to translate, the translation looks a bit odd and possibly misleading. Generally speaking I would be more inclined to use a Swedish name as an article title (like <a href="../../../r/i/k/Riksdag.html" title="Riksdag">Riksdag</a>, for instance), where it can be explained and alternative English translations offered at the beginning of the article, but to use a reasonably good English translation (like <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_parliament.html" title="Swedish parliament">Swedish parliament</a>) in text, pipelinked or redirected, to avoid the "stumbling" effect of stacking to many foreign terms into an English text. --<a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 08:06, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now I'm not sure how to do... continue on Bishonen's talk page? Maybe we can move it from here later, if we think we find something worth saving on an article talk page? Or to mine, if we want to avoid disturbing Bishonen.</dd>
<dd>I completely agree on the riksdag/parliament example. The problem is the cases where no suitable English translation exist. I find your exemple with the theatre buildings smooth, your way of writing it avoids pretending that the English description are English proper nouns.</dd>
<dd>When reading texts about foreign things, a certain amount of foreign proper names can be expected. My idea of how to avoid the stumbling effect is to wrap it up in an explanation, if possible put before the foreign proper name. "The stage play <i>Den stora vreden</i>", for instance. If mentioned several times in the text, it can be referred to as "the play" - or <i>Vreden</i>, short and nice and the word that people do use when they talk about it. Actually, I would do something similar in your theatre building example if I only knew a good description in english of "privatteater" (not funded by tax money, owned by a person or a company, usuall if not only found in big cities, usually playing popular stuff like musicals and comedies that attract a larger crowd). I know it is not "private theatre", but for the sake of the example... "He later designed the city theatres in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlstad.html" title="Karlstad">Karlstad</a> (1893), <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link%C3%B6ping.html" title="Linköping">Linköping</a> (1902-1903) and <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristianstad.html" title="Kristianstad">Kristianstad</a> (1906) and the private theatre <i><a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscarsteatern.html" title="Oscarsteatern">Oscarsteatern</a></i> in Stockholm (1906)." This gives rougly the same information that Swedish readers can extract from the nature of the very names of the various theatres, and is more smooth than just stating the name. / <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 11:17, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Don't look for me on IRC or the various policy/talk pages. I'm about done with this place. It occurs to me more and more every day that not only will quality get swamped by bulk, but that, increasingly, there isn't even the smallest island for quality, so merely retreating to writing solid article and letting the rabid and distempered gradually agree that Wikipedia should be Everything2 isn't an option. I may go on full break. I haven't decided, yet, but I care less and less about how successful people can be at eliminating any deletion, any featured status, any standards at all. Quality, it seems, is only desired in the abstract, but having one great orgy of self-expression is demanded in the here and now. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:48, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I was very distressed to see Fil go (although he told me in an email that he would probably be back — I sure hope so, its been awhile now). I would also be very distressed to see Geogre leave. I think we are suffering from growing pains and have scaling issues but I believe they can all be managed. I think it is especially hard on the people who have been with the project for the longest time. But whatever we can do to keep great editors like Fil and Geogre, we should.

I'm just wondering if you might care to have a look at <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Zambezi_e588.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Zambezi">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Zambezi</a> and associated comments on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_f596.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates</a> - I incorporated a lot of 1911 Britannica text into the article, which has raised questions about whether it can be considered an example of Wikipedia's best work. I seem to recall you've done quite a bit with lavish 1911 prose so would be interested to hear your views. Also, I just put <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surtsey.html" title="Surtsey">Surtsey</a> up on FAC.</p>

<dd>Obligatory? Argghh. Compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21128495" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=21128495" rel="nofollow">this post</a>! Hmmm. Well, I'm kind of prejudiced against the 1911, to tell you the truth. All I tend to do with text from it is replace it, actually. I mean, even though the editors were very enlightened for their time, you can imagine their basic POV for Restoration drama, namely "Disgusting!" Not much I can use that for, so I make a fresh start. (If you mean I've <b>written</b> some lavish 1911-type prose, OTOH, you may have a rather worrying point there.&#160;;-P.) The Zambesi would be a whole different case, naturally. I certainly will take a look and try to come up with a thought. <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surtsey.html" title="Surtsey">Surtsey</a>? <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surtsey.html" title="Surtsey">Surtsey</a>!!

</dl>
<p>Yes, that 1911 POV does rear its head on a lot of subjects! With Zambezi, there's luckily not too much of a colonial attitude you can bring in to describing the course of a river, so most of my alterations were just trimming the luxuriant prose into something more toned down. Some time soon I'm going to tackle <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andes.html" title="Andes">Andes</a>, which is just a horrible 1911 mess at the moment, and severely handicapped by the fact they didn't believe in continental drift back then. ETPH, it must be said, perhaps verges on 1911EB proportions of hyperbole and descriptiveness, otherwise I think your writing is acceptably modern&#160;:) Anyway, look forward to your thoughts on Zambezi and Surtsey! <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 17:32, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From your comment, it doesn't look like it. It looks like a standard knee-jerk reaction to something someone doesn't like.

<dd>Oh, groan, that's bad. In the first place, it's impossible to follow, both because the anon doesn't sign, and becauses everybody posts all over the place, there is no chronlogy. And in the second place, that's a lot of ad hominem and poisoning of the well going on there. I have posted (I just realized I forgot to ask everybody to for \¥¶¢‰{∏Œ˜Ü{\ sakes post at the FOOT of the page), I hope it has some effect, but if not, I think you should go ahead with the RFAR. It's an important article, after all, we can't have everybody abandoning it because editing it has become too unpleasant. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:45, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm very unnerved about contributors saying they want to leave, that's for sure, and I'm guessing others are not going to like this either. Naturally, he once again reverted to the SIL classification, even though he doesn't even understand the difference between East/West and Insular/Mainland. I'm going to start preparing the RfAr.

<p>It usually takes more than one individual to make a harsh discussion. I won't excuse anyone's personal attacks, but it appears to me that you have a special ability to end up in controversy. If you hold your finger off the trigger for just a second, I will try and appeal to the anon to reach an agreeable solution. I may still spend less time on the article than I'd like, but hopefully something may come out of it.<br />

<dd>Thanks for your appreciation of the article! With the present disposition, the history section will get quite a bit longer, as it needs the addition of the period from 1800 until now, and the location bit needs expansion too, as do other things... A History of Uppsala University article could be spun off and be even longer. I still think it is important to keep focus on the history in the main page. Too many of the university articles around here seem to be written for presumptive students rather than anyone else.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Other spin-off articles may be possible (music, nations, history of student life in general). The organisation looks very dull, but I wonder if it can really be an article all of its own; perhaps one could de-list it and make it more like narrative text, perhaps with a list in a table on the side. The locations/buildings section is really just a draft; it could probably be spun off into an article of its own, but it needs more content first, and I don't really have images for many of the places (I have no camera at the moment). The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Academic_Orchestra_7bf7.html" title="Royal Academic Orchestra">Royal Academic Orchestra</a> and Allmänna Sången need articles, as does the Uppsala Botanical Garden. The university hospital could probably be spun off into an article all of its own.

<p>Hi Bishonen. I presume you are aware that <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> has decided to leave the project (see: <a href="../../../f/i/l/User_talk%7EFiliocht_11a7.html#Why_I_won.27t_be_back_any_time_soon" title="User talk:Filiocht">User talk:Filiocht#Why I won't be back any time soon</a>.

<li>I think its a nice, well meaning idea to celebrate Fil's achievements, but I have one big problem with such a plan, well two or three actually. Firstly Fil was/is very modest and would probably hate such a show. Secondly, his work stands for itself as his talent. Finally and most importantly, if one buries some-one with a final goodbye, one makes it very hard for that person to exhume themselves should they wish, and I sincerely hope he will one day have such a wish. Lets remember the reality, Fil is alive and kicking in the Emerald Isle, he has merely (hopefully, just for the time being) ceased to operate here. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 11:41, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I just saw <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plain_Dealer_43cf.html" title="The Plain Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a> for the fist time (the article, I mean; I've never seen the play acted, but I've read it more than once). It is exactly that kind of nonsense with which we should not up put. You and I like to annihilate it when we see it in our field, and this particular article is certainly in your way, but it occurs to me that one of the things that Filiocht did before he took his name was offer serious, sober, and balanced articles on 19th century British and Irish authors. These are the writers second most likely to be distorted by those abortions planted all over Wikipedia: the public domain encyclopedia. I understand that folks <i>mean well</i> when they plant those corpses in our garden, but it only makes me more wish for a Wiki-pager system. "Thinking of dropping teh literature bomb? Call 555-18TH first!" Filiocht gave us comprehensive, and precise articles. You and I have done what we could as we have had time and inclination, but few will know and fewer care the amount of good this does when we are working on a "I got there first!" project. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:39, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, perhaps I should be off the list, as my prose is "leaden." (sigh) Here I thought I could feel my own prose and was not blinded by aesthetic distance.

<dd>Neither of us should be listed, really: you write leaden prose and I contribute to the poisonous atmosphere. In any case, I have a suggestion: I think it would be a good idea if people copied their Filiocht tributes to Fil's own page, since that, rather than this, is where others would expect to find them. Also they'll probably stay visible longer there, as my page gets archived quite frequently. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:54, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good idea. I, of course, was not writing a tribute but filing a complaint and trying not to mention the offenders. I did this only because I hadn't before agreed with you enough about how awful the 1911 incursions are, and I saw on <i>The Plain Dealer</i> that your edit summary had mentioned it. A graceless segue, perhaps, but not an actual tribute. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:03, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

YBM, I've posted on <a href="../../../b/o/g/Talk%7EBogdanov_Affair_a499.html" title="Talk:Bogdanov Affair">Talk:Bogdanov Affair</a>, to try to defuse matters. If it doesn't help, the option of blocking remains.

<li>Of course. I just couldn't resist being a wag. I do sort of think though that these unconscious mistakes by new users betray something deeper. They're lapsus scriptiae. The troublesome users seem to share the belief that a communication of theirs on a hosted website like this one is just exactly like an e-mail. Therefore, when what they say is deleted, it's "censorship." When someone follows them around to undo the damage they make, it's "stalking." There is a really, really fundamental misunderstanding there: this is not the public space, and no one owns the words. I'm not sure how we could make the welcomes explain it any better, but I do see most of the totally unhinged folks sharing that one misapprehension. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:54, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's ludicrous to go to a different word to avoid the Br/Am spelling wars—what an idea! But believe it or not, I've seen that suggested in all seriousness on some policy talk page, and getting some support, too. Unbelievable. Still, don't you think you need a bit more than that for an RFC? But maybe you've got more? If so, I'll be glad to endorse or whatever it's called. Not for stalking, though. See the history tab of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStalking_f70d.html" title="Wikipedia:Stalking">Wikipedia:Stalking</a>, now mercifully a redirect, and mind you don't get people associating you with <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangerdude_981c.html" title="User:Rangerdude">galloperande enfald och hyckleri</a>.

<p>I was thinking about writing a short article about the concept of spelman/pelimanni. The question is, what word should be the title. It's spelman in Swedish, pelimanni in Finnish, in Norwegian I honestly don't know nor do I know if they have the word in Danish... The concept is the same throughout the Nordic Folk genre. I don't really think there is a good, accepted term in English. My dictionary says "folk musician, fiddler" and neither is a good description - of course a spelman can be a fiddler, but (s)/he could also play accordeon, nyckelharpa etc.</p>
<p>When Swedish folk music is exported, as far as I can see they usually leave the concepts <i>spelman/spelmansmusik</i> out, and just talk about folk musik but this is less precise. Kulning, spilopipa, instruments made from cow's horns, and songs... these are Swedish folk music, but not "spelmansmusik". Finnish pelimanni music (<a href="../../../j/p/p/JPP_0c23.html" title="JPP">JPP</a> etc) tend to mention the word pelimanni in their PR material when exported, maybe because Finland has several other strong folk music traditions that are not higly pelimanni related (kantele, rune chanting). Maybe "pelimanni" as a concept is more spread in English than "spelman?" Still, it this case to me it feels a bit odd to choose a Finnish word over the Scandinavian ones... I might be biased here, of course.</p>
<p>It's like, what ever title I choose for it it will be wrong. The least bad version, maybe, is to randomly pick either "spelman" or "pelimani" as the title, and make a redirect from the other version. Whoha, I have already written more text here than I suppose the first version of the article will be... comments are welcome. / <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 11:10, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Habj. The Norwegian is speleman or spelleman--I suppose that'll be bokmål and nynorsk respectively. The Danish is spillemand. A few redirects for you there...! Anyway, I've got a reason to suggest for picking pelimanni, kind of a superficial, practical reason: pelimanni is the one that's <b>not</b> an anglophone proper name. Try googling for "spelman" on English-language pages, and you'll see what I mean. Spelman seems to be quite a common name, as well as having some famous representatives who give lots of hits. Speleman is a fairly common name also. Whereas pelimani seems free from such taint. And pelimani is kind of... I hope I don't sound patronizing to Finnish speakers... but it's a really cute word!&#160;:-) Hope this nonsense helps.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:33, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, please note that you can sign a message on a talkpage by typing four tildes, like this: ~~~~. Well, I didn't make any kind of decision, the community will make the decision. I'm afraid a new page with an unencyclopedic name and little information will always run the risk of being listed on Votes for Deletion, so it's a safer method to create the page with a little more information right away. Votes for deletion aren't majority decisions, btw: pages are most often kept if they get even a few Keep votes (from established users). It takes a Delete majority of 75—80% for a page to be deleted, so if even a sizable minority of voters approve of your page, it'll stay.</dd>

<p>Uhhh, I'm out of my depth, here. First, I found out that the place I'm working has a library that has the new <i>DNB.</i> Is that good news? Well, yeah, sort of. The Gould entry, for example, is taken entirely from Sloane and from some uncited source. However, the thing here is that I wrote <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gould_0115.html" title="Robert Gould">Robert Gould</a>, and I got in a mess. Late, late, late in the article, there is a bit about his attempted tragedies. Rival Sisters is no problem. I've got that nailed. The question is <i>Innocence Distress'd.</i> He tried to hand it to Betterton and Barry, which was stupid, but he probably had no choice (probl because of his patron). Do I lie in the article? Any corrections appreciated, when time and energy permit. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:47, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Having the new <i>DNB</i> is a lot better than having nothing (which is my own case) but for minor 17th-century figures, it's just having the old <i>DNB</i>. I suppose that can't be totally true if they use Sloane for Gould, but it's my general impression. I don't have access and can't check, but I think the Vanbrugh entry is still full of errors and takes no account of the 1980s standard biography. Just like the latest <i>EB</i>, if it comes to that. (Whereas Wikipedia's Vanbrugh entry is cutting edge.) But alas, me, I know even less. You remember how brilliantly well-informed I used to be, back in May-June? That was because I had trial access to the wonderful EEBO full-text database. That's been disconnected—it's just like they disconnected part of my brain.&#160;:-( And I don't even have <i>The London Stage</i> at home any more, the library has most unfairly recalled it, in defiance of the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatters%27_Rights_53a4.html" title="Squatters' Rights">Squatters' Rights</a> principle. Not that I'd expect to find much in them, but being able to look woould be <b>something</b>. How about you post me, or attach to an e-mail or something, what exactly the <i>DNB</i> says about <i>Innocence Distress'd</i>? Because it sounds very fishy. There was only one company in 1689, the United Company. Betterton was the unofficial manager, he ran things, he could probably have put on any play he wanted. Barry was just an actress. There wasn't a theatre called Covent Garden. The Drury Lane playhouse was in the Covent Garden *area*, I guess. But it was just a house, one of the company's two playhouses, as far as I know. The one where they put on legit plays. The whole business about asking Betterton and Barry <b>in 1689</b> just sounds wrong. That ought to have happened in or after 1695. The whole report comes from Gould himself, I suppose? (Judith Milhous: "a particularly unreliable reporter where his own work was concerned"). You don't have Sloan, do you? I don't know where to look. It's an unpublished play.&#160;:-( I can get the <b>text</b> of it all right, from the 1737 edition, but what use is that? Sorry. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:24, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>See, that was the problem. I ended up lying with my own voice, there. The new DNB is pathetically brief with Gould. Everything they have is Sloan, of course, except for one "fact" I've never heard before -- that Gould was the "friend" of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Oldham_982b.html" title="John Oldham">John Oldham</a>. They merely say that <i>Inocence Distress'd</i> was never performed. I wanted to specify that the guy <i>tried</i> really hard to get it performed, that he tried, and he was furious when he was held to account for having pointed out what B&amp;B's parents did for a living. So, there I was, trying to guess where he took it, and I don't know the theaters. In essence, then, you've already answered my question. It was The United Company, run more or less by Betterton. Gould reports that Barry had a lot to do with Betterton nixing the play, though he gives Betterton full credit for being (in his opinion) petty. In a way, RG might be a good eye witness to how much power she already had at the time, if not about his own works. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 06:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A long time ago you gave me a certain award, "for all your great work". It's pretty and I treasure it. I don't know whether you have your own ideas about it and whether you have awarded it to others. I would like to give this award to a very small number of people, just one at first, who have humbled me with their grace. I am not capable of producing such pretty pictures myself, but I hope that the idea will strike you as a worthy one. I intend to pass on the torch as a recognition of greatness of spirit. Not mine to pass on, in all honesty, but perhaps a way by which we might encourage the best in one another. I would pass the award to someone who demonstrated graceful attributes that I could only aspire to. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:30, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bisgh, I am kind of mentally different and like to do things that people dont approve of necessarliy but how would you like it if you were locked in your parents big house all alone most of the time either with just a computer and a TV?? I DO have friends but they have to come over and see me most of the time and I can't go see THEM without supervision. If have some money from my parents but can't really live alone yet and I don't know when. So a lot of my time is just sitting here&#160;:( Now Lucky wants to banish me for doing drugs.

<p>Bishonen,</p>
<p>just to let you know that the "consensus" and unprotection was reached when i was either gone or not paying attention. i fixed a few technical things (regarding the name of the relevant newsgroup, and a pointer to it). but i have to object to "Some claim it to be a hoax, while others claim it to be simply sloppy work plagued by errors, and some theoretical physicists think highly of their theories" as not reflecting accurately the bonafide position of the physics community. like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>, there is very little debate regarding the quality of Bogdanoff's papers. more than 95% of theoretical physicists believe their "work" to be literally "bullshit". saying "Most physicists understand it to be a hoax or at least to be sloppy work plagued by numerous errors, while some theoretical physicists think highly of their theories." is granting a lot of consideration to the brothers. more than they deserve. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 15:33, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I added the infamous passage to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gould_0115.html" title="Robert Gould">Robert Gould</a> and put up an unedited <i>Love Given O'er</i> on Wikisource. The way <i>I</i> figure it, that just means fewer people will seek out the also <b>totally unedited</b> Grove reprint of the poem, "edited" by Felicity Nussbaum. It will <i>increase</i> the desire for an annotated version, and especially one that can compare the 1689 and 1709 versions. So...ha! (And, incidentally, I do not fret over charges of indecency, as the lines use clever dashes, so children will never figure out what's being described.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:37, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In regards to a valuable contributor leaving (dare I say it) - as none of my contributions seem to be valued, it might not be only Giano who leaves. If you want to see how ridiculous this site is getting, have a look at the GNAA FAC and check out what Kosebame has written. He is objecting to the article reaching FA status because he says that the GNAA are only notable on Wikipedia! How one person can get things so wrong is beyond me.</p>
<p>As for standardising things: if we want the site to look and be as professional as the EB, some standardisation is going to have to happen.

<dd>Ta bu, of course we value your contributions, but I am sure that you are aware that Bishonen and Giano have also produced (in my opinion) some of the best articles on Wikipedia. Of course they don't "own" their articles: in my experience, they are quite open to anyone copyediting, formatting, adding extra information, etc, so long as it enhances an article. As you are in <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploding_whale.html" title="Exploding whale">Exploding whale</a>, also one of my favourite articles.

I see you're very busy, nonetheless I'd welcome <i>any</i> criticism (positive or negative) on the talk page of that proposed guideline! --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 14:03, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, yes, but the example made me think there was something I wasn't getting. It's perfect now, thanks. Have you heard the music hall song "<a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>", supposed to be sung by the eighth husband of an inveterate Henry-marrier?

<dd>To relieve Bish from carrying around all these heavy webpages (don't forget she is busy caring for the two goats Giano has left in her userspace), I moved all but one of these. They did not require being an admin to do so. If the move target only contains a redirect to the "movee", and has only been edited once (a redirect created from scratch or through a previous move of the page with all its history), there are no problems making the move. --<a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:27, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>TBSDY got stressed by those things and more, I gather. Just ignore the FARC, not a single soul has voted remove on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Brettingham_02b0.html" title="Matthew Brettingham">Matthew Brettingham</a>, so what do you care if it sits there for a while? I'd remove it myself, except I don't feel very welcome on that page. When I saw that Netoholic was continuing TBSDY's edit war at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> on behalf of the box, I mentioned it on IRC and asked for some uninvolved admin to take a look at the history and see if they thought the page ought to be protected (note that I didn't by any means <b>ask for</b> protection, which would hardly have been proper), and Phroziac did. I may add that he seemed quite indignant at TBSDY's actions as seen in that history. Since there <b>is</b> surely consensus on the talk page, and Netoholic reverted against that consensus without giving any argument or explanation, let <b>him</b> try to work it out. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:11, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh. Cough. Well, no, it wasn't. I asked Mark to delete it because the joke got old, and because I'd acquired some personal associations that made me like it less. I consulted Giano (see above), who wrote a lot of it, and he agreed. The third main contributor has left the project, and I can't believe he'd care. It's true that other editors got into the spirit of the joke and contributed, and I do appreciate that and am grateful to them for the fun and games, but, well, it is a userpage, or it was. I hope I haven't hurt their feelings, or those of any of the nice people who've told me it made them laugh. There's nothing to stop any admin who cares from undeleting it temporarily and sticking a copy in their own space, or whatever — I have no objection. Any non-admin only has to ask me, and I'll do it for them. Maybe we'll see some forks.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:53, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fairly soon after I started editing I ended up involved in the Netoholic RFAR, which in my opinion went on way too long, and the ArbComm was way too lenient on him. His mentorship lasted longer than I would have predicted, but it still failed in the end. I almost quit editing the Wikipedia after that RFAR. Since the I have tried, for the most part, to stay away from difficult editors and controversial articles. Still, even when I was deliberately trying to keep a fairly low profile, I ended up having to deal with a problem editor. It's rather discouraging and makes me wonder what the social dynamics of the Wikipedia are going to be like in a couple of years, in 5 years, in 10 years. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 20:50, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for taking an interest in this. It's easy to feel like a lone voice in the wilderness. As an aside, while I'm sure IRC is a very useful tool, I really wish folks would try and conduct these kind of policy/procedural discussions in a more public place where all of us can participate, and where there is a public record, to which we all can refer. It kind of makes the rest of us feel like outsiders, and it enforces the perception (I hope wrong) that important decisions are being made in smoke-filled back rooms. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 02:41, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Given user:XAL's posts of Sept. 14, as well as the fact that that particular user talk page contained <i>nothing</i> aside from the Welcome Wagon message and then insults that had been transplanted there (i.e. it was not being used by the user to communicate), the user has gotten <i>another</i> 24 hour block, and the user talk page has been deleted as, basically, a libel page. The psychological state of the user is of no concern to me, and neither is the truth value of the article that he or she works upon. Wikipedia is not a place to arbitrate Ultimate Truth, convince the heathens, or negotiate the rules of the physical world, and so it wouldn't matter to me if the user were 100% correct in every opinion -- the material posted by this user is nothing but insults, and, if there are fact claims made, they are indecipherable by being krill floating in an ocean of invective. I see nothing salvagable here and believe that a much, much longer block would be warranted, given the patient and repeated warnings, admonitions and exhortations. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:27, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, Geogre? I think you need to create a new usertalk page, to tell her she's been blocked and why. She's very unfamiliar with wiki, and didn't exactly catch hold of what she saw of the block message last time. She needs something she can find, and return to, and read more than once. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I waited 24 hr after her last complaint and added a paragraph on the talk page just to explain that the block keeps going. Now Bratsche's about to give up on helping her. If Nicholas sticks it out, he'll have earned his hermitage. I actually think this is not the run of the mill sort of trilingual misunderstanding followed by edit warring and a desire to poot in the punch. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:54, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, yeah, I'd totally forgotten about that. It was six days ago! I've done a lot of editing since then. You caught me a little unawares by asking why I'm "always" being unfriendly "to you", and "always" calling your templates rubbish. I assumed you were talking about something I'd said to you. And recently. And more than once ("always" usually means that). Sorry I forgot about the sock check request, you're quite right, I did call your templates and stubs rubbish. I said it because I think it. "Partying with hot sluts in Brazil" is about as far away from an encyclopedic topic as it's possible to get. About the sock accusation, though, please note that that doesn't come from me. I don't for myself think you and Imdaking are the same person, you don't seem that way to me. I was basically more putting a sock check request made by other people on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> in a better place for it, i. e. David Gerard's talk page. However, I do think you're both nuisance editors with a net negative effect on Wikipedia, at least you've been so far.

<p>I could cope with the removal of the expansion to point 6 (what not to write at the top of a nomination), but I will argue strongly that the additional signpost in point 1, concerning the need to have nominations copy edited thoroughly beforehand, should stay. Substandard prose was becoming a serious problem in the nominations, and I think (although I'm not certain) that the problem has lessened since the recent expansion of point 1. Clearly, nominators either had a distorted sense of the standards that apply ('compelling, even brilliant' prose) or weren't reading the criteria.</p>
<p>As a contributor who has put a lot of time and effort into trying to raise the standards of prose in the nominations, I thought that something needed to be done. When I comment on poor prose in nominations, I feel I need either to roll my sleeves up and fix it myself, or quote several examples and pull them apart; it's a lot of work. That is why I acted, and no one has since complained. I wouldn't mind if the italic highlighting in point 1 were softened to roman. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 00:48, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Bishonen, thanks for your message; I've interpolated my responses into it. I hope you don't mind my pasting our dialogue into the FAC discussion page.</p>
<p>Tony, I appreciate your good intentions and the urgency that made you expand the instructions. But I do think it's bloat to add specifics on one aspect of one of the (many) criteria, right next to the link to the criteria themselves. Nominators need to either make very sure to click on that link, or else several other specially important points need to be mentioned up front (which I'm against, as creating more bloat). I'm pretty sure lack of references, for instance, is as frequent a problem as lack of copyediting.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've since pruned some of the additions in response to your comments, but your objection, I suspect, still applies to what remains. Lack of references, image copyright issues, and poor prose appear to the be most common complaints of reviewers. However, fixing poor prose, in my view, is usually the task that takes considerably more time, effort and skill than fixing the first two problems (not always, but usually). Poor prose is what will stick out when Wikipedia parades featured articles to the world. That's why I'm arguing that it be emphasised, and singled out for extra mention in the instructions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps you might edit the criteria page further instead (I see you already did), to emphasize the need for copyediting?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've already significantly simplified the wording and formatting of the criteria, and shifted greater emphasis onto prose by moving it into first position (that was one of the few substantive changes in meaning that I made). I don't know what more you can say in the one place than 'compelling, even brilliant' prose. That's why I thought another signpost elsewhere was called for.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Though I also stand by my remark about it looking condescending to tell everybody to go get somebody else to copyedit before nominating. Wouldn't you agree that there are articles that are good to go directly from the hands of the author/s/..?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that I agree; I'm a professional editor, yet on occasions I've hired someone else to edit my text when it really matters. It's the 'fresh pair of eyes' that just about all text needs, even text that has been produced by good writers. Perhaps we could soften the wording ('strongly recommended'?).</dd>
</dl>
<p>My overriding concern is that the instructions be kept simple and practical. Following Bishonen's Law, they will naturally tend to be always growing, as people add their own special concerns over time, while hardly anybody ever removes anything. I know Raul654 agrees with me in general, in fact it's Raul's ruthless pruning that has kept the FAC instructions so nice and simple compared to those of Peer Review. It wasn't very long since you made the additions, so it's possible that no one complained because no one noticed yet; the longer the instructions are, the more cursorily they'll probably be read, that's the problem.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with all of these points, but I'd like to see the additional clause in point 1 retained.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've also helped raise the standards of prose on WP:FAC, both before and after articles are nominated. For instance, some teenagers have caught a habit of asking my help on IRC ("Bish, u r a grammar nazi, will u proofread my FAC?"&#160;:-) No, I haven't heard more of those pleas since you made your changes). I've authored a number of FAs myself, see e. g. The Country Wife and its vote if you're interested. Best wishes, Bishonen | talk 08:17, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am really at my wits end with this guy. Bish, would you please keep an eye on the page <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Department_of_Transportation_01f3.html" title="Los Angeles Department of Transportation">Los_Angeles_Department_of_Transportation</a>, and its author Imdaking. It is a clear copyvio, and I have now blanked the content. Imdaking is challenging that it was ever placed there, and says the tag will be removed.</p>
<p>I even got a note from Pacific Coast Highway telling me I hadn't reported it correctly. I took his word for it. Now, I see that it's been on the copyright problem page since Sept. 12.</p>
<p>I will also notify Lucky. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Klenk_4cff.html" title="User talk:Paul Klenk"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 03:14, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you look at the article, the copyvio notice states, "If you have just labeled this page as a possible copyright infringement, please add a link to it on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_2005_September_23_a638.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2005 September 23">Wikipedia:Copyright problems/2005 September 23</a>" and the link was not added. paul says it was added since sept. 12, those are two different dates.

<p>Actually, I think this may all be a simple mistake. I'm assuming that Imdaking may have thought that just because the info came from a municipal government site that it was public domain. Just my two cents' worth. - Lucky 6.9 03:44, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't believe Imdaking has ever made <i>any</i> assertion about its gov't status.</li>
<li>He is confused about the "Sept. 23" date thing (see above), as that date is in a link, and is always based on the current date, or current date plus one. If you check all the articles listed <b>by date</b> on the Copyvio page, that same link on every page always appears to be current.

<p>Due to the sudden, and numerous, increases in template traffic and activity; It has occurred to me to create a template of my own to indicate the numerous pages I have edited, or am thinking of editing, or indeed have read or stumbled upon by chance. In this way I can have my name prominently displayed numerously all over the site, and on even more history files, my edit count will rise, and eventually lead to my own talk page bearing the template "Notable Wikipedian" - a template incidentally for which I am long overdue. It occurred to me you may like to comment on the design of this momentous template, I am thinking of a small cameo foto of me taken on my last beach holiday to Ibiza (a rather flattering foto, as I was 19 at the time) accompanied by the legend "Giano woz here!" In this way other editors can wait with excitement and bated breath for even more numerous appearances of my flowing golden text and frequently punctuating punctuation. I give you the opportunity to be part of this exiting new project as your talk page will be the first to bear this large, colourful and informative template. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 06:51, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that I am about to become even more famous, this is the foto I have selected for my template, not as recent as I would have liked but taken during my days as a hero in the Italian Army. No don't press me, I never talk about it - too modest. More importantly, I thought you may like to read my latest offering <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleonora_di_Toledo_9f70.html" title="Eleonora di Toledo">Eleonora di Toledo</a> and copy edit - every word is true, I promise; before the dreaded info box appears and despoils poor Eleonora. Its the first time I have used only on-line references but now we are all dumbing down, life is going to be so much easier now - Where does one apply for the "Notable Wikipedian" template do you by any chance know? <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 20:34, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi Bishonen. I hope you can help me on this...

<dd>Perhaps you would also like to read <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGraphic_novel_507e.html" title="Talk:Graphic novel">Talk:Graphic novel</a> where there is a consensus against a similar move and where I reference the main thrust of my argument.

I merely extended an invitation to discuss the matter there, as it seemed the best forum to achieve a consensus on such moves.

<p>Hi Bishonen. Now that the people have started to delete images, I thought I could finally get some of my orphans deleted, images I moved to commons a long time ago. So I started tagging them with "no source", since admins seem ruthlessly happy with deleting those.</p>
<p>But then I remembered that I know two admins who might do that for me even faster. A little embarrising to have to ask you all the time though. I would do it myself, but I still don't seem to have become admin.</p>
<p>Here are my orphans.</p>

<dd>Poor little orphans! OK, infanticide completed. Uh, are you sure that was right? It just struck me that the Commons images have the same names. I hope I didn't delete those as well, by clicking on your gallery images. If I did, you'd better re-upload them. Btw, did you know you can link to an image without displaying it, by putting a colon first in the name?

<dd>Thank you. All these images were uploaded to the local wikipedia. But you are not an admin on wikimedia commons, no?</dd>
<dd>These images are none the less double redundant. Most have both a .jpg uploaded to commons, and then another improved .png counterpart. In the long run, all jpg images will be replaced with .png's. These were just the really orphaned, the first batch so to speak.</dd>
<dd>Thanks also for the tip. My intention was actually to initiate a guessing game, believe it or not...</dd>

<hr />
<p>Indeed I have not (always prompt to denonciate people, as usual, YBM).</p>
<p>The confusion comes from the fact that Grichka (my brothers) is away from Paris at the moment. During his travels, he plugs in his "PC Card" on his laptop and access network. Since he did not follow the last developements of our conversations, he does not know that he should log in under his name before posting. I will contact him tonight by phone and tell him that. If I did not do it before it is because, frankly, I thought that we had reached an agreement and that the article would not be subject to anymore changes. Helas! it was without counting YBM and his friend RBJ. As I wrote on the article page, I do not think that they are concerned by the common objective to reach a good article. There is something else in their action&#160;: desire to destroy? pleasure to "dominate us"? Ego problems? I don't know. But I know that as long as they do not understand the definition of what a "good article" should lool like (which does not mean a positive article about us) and accept the rules of Wikipedia, we will not reach any consensus.</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<dl>
<dd>There was no agreement, Igor, there were only people catching their breath and leaving it on "my" version for a while. Note that I don't particularly endorse "my" version, either. I improved the article by removing two frankly terrible rants (one on each side) from it, but I fully expect that it can stand further improvement. Please, the both of you, now that I'm about to remove my "in use" flag, edit constructively. If the other person's edit seems POV to you, rewrite it and add to it, rather than simply revert. Rbj, you too. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:51, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I am ready for any improvement of the article, of course. But not for "blind addition" of negative quotes (as YBM and RBJ already did). We do have a major difficulty here. Either we merely suppress these citations (and we are entering the terrible "revert game"), or we add "positive" citations to balance the global content of the article. But this solution (endless addition of citations) will end up in a long collection of phrases and "anti phrases" which will loose everyone. Instead of gaining in clarity, the article will on the contrary become quite long and confusing.</p>
<p>What is your feeling? Is there a way to contain the "flud of citations" wanted by rbj and ybm?</p>
<p>Igor</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not getting into that issue, take it to Talk and try to get everyone involved. My own feeling is that it may be necessary to allow a lot of quotes, from both sides, at this stage, and then gradually and consensually peel them back. But that's just my 2c. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I just added some more "positive" comments in reaction to all the "negative" material collected by rbj. As I said, I do not think that it is a good idea to put together all these comments. I have 2 remarks and one proposal.</p>
<p>Remark&#160;: Rbj is now obliged to collect private emails (ie the one between the journalist Fabien Besnard and Urs Schreiber) in order to feed his "negative" tank. How far can we go like this? I observe that, at this point, we have far more "positive" (and argumented) material (it all comes from scientific discussions or reports made by mathematicians or physicists about our work) than rbj. If we continue like this, his material will come from YBM and other "internet anti Bogdas" that are haunting various forums. I really do not think that this will improve the article, far from it. As it is today, this article is really less good and clear than yesterday. Does rbj really care about it? Does Ybm care about it? I do not think so. Their only aim is to hit their target, by all means. As soon as we try to have a scientific discussion (ie our last answer to Lubos Motl on the discussion page) they promptly invent another pseudo to pollute this discussion with the same old "rengaines".</p>
<p>Proposal&#160;: I propose to come back to the version we achieved yesterday (with only the 3 "positive" additions to the 3 "negative" rbj's). At this point, every Wiki reader would have understood the controversial content of the "affair. This wayn the article would still be clear and readable.</p>
<p>What is your opinion?</p>
<p>Best regards to you,</p>

<p>That's what I mean. It opens now in the middle of things, tosses about pop culture willy nilly, and then screws up the definition. Arguably, the anon <i>meant</i> to be 19th century clever with that allusion to <i>Dunciad,</i> but it's just...weird. I don't want to do the rewrite, as it would look like reversion, and, as I said on the talk page, it's not that all the stuff is worthless. It's just kind of <i>unusable</i> and absolutely misplaced. (For a different example of why Wikipedia is doomed to misinform the world, see Weland. It's all a Wiglaf-like run through the dry slopes of Norse mythology, and then, without any warning at all, it's a comic book discussion placed on the same level of priority.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:21, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is. "Bathos" is an insult for a bad author who "sinks" when he attempts the sublime. Pope coined the term to suggest something deeper than the profound. He used the term to make fun of Philips and Cibber, and he picked out their worst lines as examples. Particularly, it occurs when the author <i>doesn't realize</i> that his comparison is so jarring as to be stupid or so indecorous as to be illegal (the comparison of God with a chamber maid in "God swept the clouds from the sky"). When the very lofty is done in a very low setting, you get bathos, but it has to be something performed with sincerity. That's why the Children's Theater production of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> is a perfect example: the little tykes are trying their best, but a 12 year old mouthing Sophocles is too much for the mind to bear without laughing. What bathos isn't is the conscious technique of undercutting that all our favorite poets used excessively. Pope, in particular, even did it with his <i>rhymes,</i> so that one line's rhyme with the next would imply an undercutting comparison. When Kierkegaard said that "the loss of an arm, a leg, or a wife" would be more noticed that the loss of a soul, he was being clever. When my student said, "A person could be mugged, murdered, or even raped!" she was being bathetic, but the deflation in series is really a cheap example (which is one why all that stuff at the opening is doubly silly). The biggest thing is that it's a pejorative. You'd never use it for <i>Rape of the Lock</i> or <i>Description of a City Shower</i> or <i>London</i> or <i>Trivia,</i> and yet all of those use a lot of undercutting and conscious comparison of the high with the low. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliment on Arbuthnot. I think, looking back on it, that it's slightly too chrnological and could benefit from more shaping (which would free it more from the DNB without letting it fall into the POV-trap of 1911). Swift knew that Arbuthnot was fat (and got fatter; he looks fine in his portrait, but at the end of his life he was quite overweight) and consequently waddled, so mentioning the waddle was a way of politely <i>not</i> mentioning the obesity, I think.

<p>Just wanted to say thanks for the Norwegian and Danish terms. Did you know them, or searched for them?

<p>It will be interesting to see if someone with more detailed knowledge on the subject turns up. What I can contribute will, for natural reasons, be pretty Sweden-biassed although it is obvious that this subject is better handled from a Nordic, rather than a Swedish, Danish etc. perspective. Do you know if there is a space at enwiki where people who are interested in music (other than pop and rock) meet?</p>

<p>Forget for a minute the long-winded explanation on my talk page. Does the text of the article now explain why Winchester Cathedral is linked, or did I misunderstand the question? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:22, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My problem is that your text doesn't mention Winchester Cathedral, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_Cathedral_0332.html" title="Winchester Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a> doesn't mention any chronicle. Easter eggs don't count. In the paper version, they literally won't exist, and they're altogether deprecated; JRM is always unpacking them, and I've started to do the same. Secondly, "Winchester's" just sounds odd, to me, ugly and ungrammatical. Is that how people refer to that chronicle? It seems such an uneasy fit for "the Peterborough Chronicle". If you were to write an article about it, would it be entitled "Winchester's Chronicle"...&#160;? Both these problems would go away if it could be referred to as "the Winchester Cathedral Chronicle", but I suppose it can't. Or better still, "the Winchester Chronicle", because there's little intrinsic point in linking to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_Cathedral_0332.html" title="Winchester Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a>. It's not much of an article. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:16, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hang on. You're not expecting me to be responsible for <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_Cathedral_0332.html" title="Winchester Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a> being poor, are you? When JRM unpacks for a print version, that print version doesn't exist yet, and most of the time people pipe the references, it's to get grammatical agreement in the sentence, so unpacking makes little sense to me. The flaw is in the print version, not the smooth-reading online version, and I don't think we should be sacrificing readability to prevent some hypothetical problem. "This place's chronicle was a copy of that place's" is the sense of my sentence, and I think there would be overuse of "chronicle" to unpack the prep. object. As for the Winchester Cathedral article having no #History section that covers its importance as a medieval center of learning, that's something that can be fixed. The link is so that folks can know what I mean when I say "Winchester's": I don't mean the town of Winchester's or a guy named Winchester's, but the cathedral at Winchester's. The "easter egg" <i>does</i> count, since anyone clicking on that link would find Winchester Cathedral, which was built just after the Conquest, and which took over from an older abbey (and that's in the article). It would be great if there were a Winchester Chronicle article, but that's a bit too esoteric. The Winchester Chronicle is remarkable mainly as being the best one for the early accounts and being terribly commonly copied by other houses. Its Anglo-Saxon is standard and unremarkable, and it stops at the Conquest, so there isn't much to say about it. Further, it's <i>not</i> one of the ones with remarkable and unique material in it (e.g. <i>Battle of Brunanburgh</i> or the little sermons interposed or the accounts of marvels). It's a very respectable, restrained chronicle, which is what makes it kind of dull and not worth writing about except as a component of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_2487.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:00, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, "the Winchester Chronicle" is usually called "The Parker Chronicle," because Matthew Parker owned it after the monastic break up. "The four chronicles recognized as distinct are called the Winchester Chronicle, the Abingdon Chronicle, the Worcester Chronicle, and the Peterborough Chronicle." Wikipedia has articles on only Peterborough and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_2487.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>. Lacking a chance to refer to an article on Parker Chronicle (which would also need a pipe, because they wouldn't understand the geographical reference of Winchester Cathedral from the name used today for it), there are only two places I could refer: <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_2487.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_Cathedral_0332.html" title="Winchester Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:10, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What a flipping <b>morass</b> that XAL junk is! I guess it's good that I'm <i>not</i> running for ArbCom, because at this point I'd figure we could just delete the whole damned article until the apes wandered away and then start afresh. Whatever people can say about the "affair," and I have no opinions on things physickal (except that, as Parmenides said, time and motion are both illusions), there is this dog and pony show going on in ring #2 where XAL proves an insane clown posse of one. One thing is clear: ArbCom is damned slow. This crap has been going on for far, far, far, far, far, far too long. (Aaron has proposed a new watchlist (see my talk page for a link to it), and he wondered "what happened here" with Tony Sidaway jumping out of the bushes to induce entropy into the talk page, so I wrote a poem to explain to him what happened.

<dd>I still favor it in the abstract, although my recent, "Look, buster, I don't care if I live or die, so don't expect me to give a flip about your feelings" binge probably wouldn't argue well. It would be as well to have Fil on. It's not too late by any measure. The elections are in December, but I think Filiocht is motivated and got on the stick early. I don't know if he's visible enough generally to win. I think there will be a <i>massive</i> IRC lensing effect, which is one more reason why I think the IRC channel ought to be stopped. It's distorting votes on the project like nobody's business -- sometimes for people I like and sometimes against people I like -- but by any objective measure it distorts votes on RFA, and I have no doubt it will do the same on ArbCom.</dd>
<dd>I know it's bad form to laugh at one's own jokes, but I impressed my own damned self with that poem.

I do hope that I shall be a good skipper of <i>HMS Adminship</i>, and I promise to sail her as best I can through both calm seas and rolling, tempestuous storms. Once again, thank you, my dear. I shall speak to you on IRC.

<p>Thanks, Bishonen, for taking time to write comments (for a record third time) on the Opus Dei page. I've just modified the introduction of the article to incorporate your suggestions and proposed to the guys there a possible solution to the issue. I will also explore other ways to incorporate the "other POVs" more explicitly in other parts of the article.

<li>Please Geogre could you stop interjecting for a moment. I just want to than Bish for sorting out my problem - the usual envelope is in the post. We all know that Bish (yet again) is headed for the front page. No wonder, when one thinks of all those roubles and skandabrods (or whatever passes for currency in that bleak land of permafrost) that she has been donating to Raul's holiday fund. We could all write daily featured articles if we lived in 23 hours of darkness a day, and the only excitement was the occasional yak wandering into the igloo. For you information Sic Bar is an informative, concise, interesting and lively page with a whole fascinating section on Sicilian tombstones. Destined for the front page as soon as Raul (and that nice Jimbo) return from the vacation I have kindly given them at my summer residence "Palazzo Splendido" in the <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayman_Islands_08a3.html" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, where I have been forced to retreat following the unjust persecution of my company "Palermo Publishing" by the Vatican and several other global feminist organizations. What's that about heresy down below. I'll go and have a look, always interested in the Inquisition, fascinating business methods, so useful in the modern world of commerce and pursuasion, I find. Now do stop worrying Geogre about unscrupulous people.

You know, I think about it more and more. See, Wikipedia propagates through a zillion mirrors. It gets all over the world. So did Charles Gildon. Gildon spread his lies through 2-3 centuries of biographies and textbooks by lazy editors and authors and by the unfortunate. It <i>would</i> be justice to fictionalize a sentence or two in the bio. It would <i>not</i> be "WP:POINT," as some would accuse me of, but 18th:POINT or Lit:POINT. It would be a little poetic justice. How about giving him a love affair with a black African in Antwerp?</p>
<p>At any rate, if you <i>like</i> getting in the middle of wiki-controversies and abuse of admin powers and the like, then look at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManichaeism_22fb.html" title="Talk:Manichaeism">Talk:Manichaeism</a>, where I may end up in a revert tiff with an <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_coward.html" title="Anonymous coward">anonymous coward</a> (Mr. IP Freely) who is fairly obviously a true believer of some revival of this cult. He generally left my edits to the article alone, but he removed one sentence. Weirdly, it was a sentence that made his people look <i>good,</i> not bad, but I'm not sure that his reading skills are all that great. I reverted his removal of that sentence. If he removes it again, I'll revert that again. Anyway, just a heads up on that. (Also, on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManichaeism_22fb.html" title="Talk:Manichaeism">Talk:Manichaeism</a> I issued one of those "go play in traffic" dismissals that can only make him angry. I'm sorry, but once it became clear that I was corresopnding not just with a heretic, but a person trying to be a heretic revivalist (how bizarre is that...ransacking history to find a heresy to support?), I figured that he wasn't at the article to write a history, but to express a view. There wasn't going to be any good coming of further dialog, so a dismissal was the kindest thing possible.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:30, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, Giano, if you haven't encountered them before, there are people who are seeking, Madame Blavatsky-style, to revive extinct heresies, particularly dualist ones. The book <i>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</i> spurred on a group of neo-<a href="../../../a/l/b/Albigensians.html" title="Albigensians">Albigensians</a>. From that, a fellow or two got the bright idea to write more stuff about possible Holy scions and, of course, other dualisms. Thus, a new Manichaeism. Wikipedia is not the place for the malleus mallefactorum, so I'm not going to invoke any <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Office_49eb.html" title="Holy Office">Holy Office</a>, but they have a strong POV that they want to insert, just like UFO freaks, "brand new art movement" people, band members, and friends of the Bogdanovs. Thing is, neo-dualists are so rare, and Wikipedia membership is so not involved with the old theology, that few people even recognize it when they see it. Even then, I wouldn't much care, except that the article, complete with its "Manichaeans took all that is best in all religions and combined them" and "Manichaeans showed the truth to Christians," is up for FAC. I objected strongly, and only the nominator supported. The exoticism of the topic is enough to scare away voters, and my strenuous vote probably would scare away others, so it's not going to get promoted. Beyond that, I suppose I don't need to care. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:56, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Geogre, you must think I have some odd tastes. It's not so much that I like wikicontroversies, but I do seem drawn to go look at complaints on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> from people who're not very wiki-savvy, and who sound like they're desperately trying to fend off somebody who's mobbing them. Depressingly common, that. You never know what you're gonna find, but it's a good recipe for getting in trouble, all right (last time I found Sophie, and thank you for your loyal defence and outrage there, sweetheart). Anyway, never mind, speaking of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colley_Cibber_0789.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>, have you guys seen the new tabular version of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_books_with_the_subtitle__Virtue_Rewarded__f343.html" title="List of books with the subtitle &quot;Virtue Rewarded&quot;">List of books with the subtitle "Virtue Rewarded"</a>?

<p>The redirect wasn't nonsensical as you claim. Yu-gi-Oh! is gay...I remember last summer, everyone was so OBSESSED with it...and the show lays a turd. So yeah, that was dumb. Sorry. But I didn't know that making something a redirect blanked it!</p>

<dd>I accept your apology, Flamewiper12, and blanking is easily reverted, so that's fine. As for "nonsense", in vandalism warnings it's most often a wiki euphemism: we say "nonsense" when we mean something worse.

<dd>Good grief, what a mess. I'd use a stronger word than "incautious" for someone who blanks great swathes of an article and then <b>reverts</b> the person who cleans up after them. I suppose <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">User:Reddi</a> was attempting to undo the damage? Not by reverting the anon (unfortunately), but by adding in a lot of partial restorations. The problem is assessing the value of Reddi's last version, as against the one you ask me to revert to... hmmm... this is very difficult. There aren't any admin tools that are relevant, more's the pity. Somewhat at hazard, I'm going to assume that Reddi's edits merely duplicate some of the blanked work, revert to MONGO as you suggest, and then put in Stirling Newberry's new lead. OK? You know the article better than I do, please see what you think of the result, Francis.

<p>I appreciate your intent, and explanation on VfU, and I probably would not have objected to the &lt;personal attack removed&gt; if it had not seemed so conclusive and condemnatory (.e.g., presuming to be judge and jury). Something less conclusive such as &lt;rm alleged personal attack&gt; or &lt;rm possible personal attack&gt;, that would have suggested to the readers that they should make their own judgements, would probably have been fine. I am satisfied with the current state, because the readers are at least made aware that there is a record/history to be investigated.</p>
<p>As to the specific comment which seems to concern you the most, there is a history between 172 and me that justifies most of it (he was territorial about certain articles in which he largely painted post Stalin soviet leaders as reformers, and barely documented the continued oppressive nature of the regimes). The part where I extrapolate to his possible personal life, is of course, speculative. I admit that it is entirely possible that in his personal life he is a complete <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milktoast.html" title="Milktoast">Milquetoast</a>, and would never cross any questionable lines, and his behavior here is just a manifestation of the breakdown in of moral restraint that occurs under the cloak of anonimity. But by speculating in this way, I hoped to convict his conscience with what others might conclude from his behavior. He seems to be immune to this however.</p>
<p>As to the use of the "dubious" template, I don't see where it is a misuse of it at all, although I wish that it was a little less intrusive in the text by referring to the talk page, which of course required an explanation there. In retrospect, perhaps just editing the &lt;personal attack removed&gt; to the "alleged" or "possible" would have been less intrusive. Would you have objected to that?--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 13:41, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Silverback is arguing that my reopening of the deletion debate regarding the category "is just a manifestation of the breakdown in of moral restraint that occurs under the cloak of anonymity." This allegation has already been discredited. "The attempted closure Silverback points to was improper, especially in such a close case, because it was performed by one of the partisans for the 'keep' side." --<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion&amp;diff=25443039&amp;oldid=25440934" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion&amp;diff=25443039&amp;oldid=25440934" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> His other charge is that I am "territorial about certain articles in which [I] largely painted post Stalin soviet leaders as reformers, and barely documented the continued oppressive nature of the regimes." I believe he is referring to my removal of some of his material in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Russia_9acb.html" title="History of Russia">History of Russia</a> on grounds that it was <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">unsourced</a> <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. He is correct in pointing out that I am the main author of the article. But he did not point out that the article is an FA. It is an insult to the community that it would allow the featuring of an article as apologetic of the Soviet Union as Silverback implies. Certainly we have quite thin evidence to state as a matter of fact, as Silverback does above, that I am 'immune to conviction of conscious'. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 15:58, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He acted fairly, you just didn't like the results. Still, if you are going to undertake the doubtful and unusual step of reopening a closed vote, you should be willing to notify every voter, instead of starting a one party campaign. You probably should also post it on the various notice boards and forums. If the step was so reasonable, why couldn't you trust that some other user would do it?

<dd>[Edit conflict] Silverback, first, reread my comments. Those were Michael Snow's words, not mine. Nevertheless, by no means was he anywhere close to casting doubt on Kbdank71's integrety. Instead, he was calling one particular action of his a mistake. Second, regarding why I did not contact every voter after reopening the discussion, no one suggested it at the time. One of the first people I did contact (if not the first), though, was Kbdank71-- one of the keep voters. Third, I will not respond to your final comment, which is yet another personal attack. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 19:44, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I didn't notice they were Snow's comments. Note also that he didn't state that the action was a mistake, but that it was a mistake for Kbdank71 to be the one to do it. I'd see his point if it wasn't an open vote where everyone could see they were counted correctly. Note, that Snow did not say that you acted correctly. Please stop accusing me of insulting the community, that is just a personal attack, and one that you would have to strain to prove, just as you had to strain to take personal offence at abstract comments on Lulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 23:03, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Silverback, I believe that you speak in good faith, your tone convinces me.

In any case his conscience is not your business. You've made it clear that you dislike not only his editing, but his ideology, himself, and what you guess or believe about his private life. So what, really? You're an experienced editor, you know Wikipedia is no place for airing opinions about those things. "Comment on content, not on the contributor." If a fellow editor were to suffer, in your opinion, a "breakdown in moral restraint" (not that I've seen any sign of it), it's not something you have to fix.</dd>
<dd>Would I have objected to editing the &lt;personal attack removed&gt; to "alleged" or "possible" PA? Well, I was implementing <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>, which pretty much equates to being, for a moment, judge and jury: I definitely thought and think they were personal attacks, and therefore I wrote in a definite way. I wouldn't have any interest in qualifying them as "alleged PA" (*I* was doing the alleging, I was not neutrally implementing 172's request). "Be bold" is an important wiki principle, and I'd do the same again. That said, an equally important corollary is that I must expect to be disagreed with and edited in turn. The short answer, then: no, I won't change it; but no, I won't object if <b>you</b> change it to "alleged" or whatever, that's fine by me. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:36, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Are 172's hypothetical flaws of "character" in some sense <b>content</b>, in your opinion? And incidentally, I don't know him, but I don't see anything in your specific accusations to warrant any attacks on his "character" whatsoever. I don't see why he should put up with continuous abuse from you, either.

<p>So, basically, I agree with the essential assertions of fact on an RfC, but I'm not certifying the request. Further, I have a firm belief that RfC's should not specify sanctions -- that's an ArbCom task -- but should only specify the next step ("refer to arbitration" or "refer to mediation" or "refer to Dr. Demento"). So, where do I sign, if there is no place to sign that says, "Agree with the assertion of fact but not with the various answers?" <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:04, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. You mean, RedWolf's "outside view" at the bottom of the page specifies sanctions, and the other one recommends mediation, so you don't want to sign—"endorse"— either of those? I don't see anything about sanctions in the sections above. Now you mention it, I wonder if the template has been changed, things seem to come in an odd order, compared to when I read an RfC last. I mean, if you do agree with the assertions of fact, the obvious place for you to sign, before, would have been "Other users who endorse this summary". But now, one asks oneself, what "summary", exactly? Would I be endorsing the whole pile of stuff above my sig? Can I really do that? So I guess the short answer is "I dunno".&#160;:-( <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:32, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Here it comes, man. I haven't gotten a helper yet, but I will, and so will you. That'll stop your relapse into editing (instead of watching people bicker). Speaking of which, I'm about done with <a href="../../../o/r/m/Ormulum.html" title="Ormulum">Ormulum</a> now. It's amazing what a few hours in the liberry can do. It's even more amusing that there is another editor of <i>Ormulum</i> -- perhaps the dullest book ever written (see <a href="../../../o/r/m/Talk%7EOrmulum_f0b4.html" title="Talk:Ormulum">talk:Ormulum</a>). A few rearrangements of the lead, and I'll FAC it. I've done my time with long, well illustrated articles. I'm due a couple of short ones on boring subjects. (Peterborough isn't boring in what it talks about, but I made it seem a lot more coherent and comprehensible in my article than it is. Such is a duty of an encyclopedist, though.) I'm shocked to death to find that I found four or five sources for <i>Ormulum.</i> Really, it is dull. I mean dull.

<dd>Hello...yes, nice article, maybe too long! Brief point on archiving--I don't think it's necessary to archive simply everything on a talk page, especially with quick and very simple notes that could have just as easily been conducted on a user talk page. We could archive every version of the article itself, but the version control handles that for us—similarly, I think only a discussion which someone might reasonably refer to should be preserved. Archives should ideally—if people are willing to take the time—only include those things which will ever be considered relevant in the future, refactored in a way that helps people get the thrust. Though what's important to keep in a talk page is subjective, so is what's important to keep in an article, and I think a unified methodology between the two is desirable. A little quote from my user page: <i>once a discussion on a topic gets straightened out, you can refactor it so that newcoming readers avoid the confusing dead-ends that people took on their way to achieving consensus</i>. I know not everyone shares the methodology, but I just think this particular one was a cut and dry case, best left to the version history, that's what it's for. More rants on Wiki Theory on my user page...best... <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaeducation_c35a.html" title="User:Metaeducation">Metaeducation</a> 19:58, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Let's agree to differ about the axing of (mainly) my post on Talk, Meta. I don't think the fat lady sang yet, far from it, as this is the great Day of Editing for Colley. His Lead section may well get more copyedits, and the Talk discussion more additions, provided it's still there. I hope you saw the blinkenlighten on your way here?&#160;:-) I'm not sure they work in IE. On an unrelated note, have you thought of joining in some of the discussions at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, if you've got the time?

<dd>Regarding FAC...read it a bit but I think I'm happy to accept what comes down the pipe...even, uh, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wario.html" title="Wario">Wario</a>. In other words, I take for granted that any topic is interesting, so most of the FAC critique process involving the selection isn't an issue to me. (Although I secretly hope to live to see <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> make the cut). But if there was a page that gives an advance warning of publication, so I could tinker before the selected page goes live—but after it's been decided that it absolutely will—I'd prefer that so any mistakes I make get caught sooner. I'm not seeking to modify or correct content since I'm generally out of my field on these, I just want to make the things flow. But the candidate tag is used too often for me to be able to justify the time. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetaeducation_c35a.html" title="User:Metaeducation">Metaeducation</a> 20:44, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's funny you should ask, I was just thinking about sending you <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_October_2005_3762.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/October 2005">this link</a>, so you can do your copyedit in advance and see it <b>on</b> the Main Page. I suggest you tinker well ahead of the publication date, as I'm not sure how early <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a>, the Featured Article Director, finalizes the main page. In fact, if you have large-scale tinkering plans, for instance shortening a Lead section fairly drastically (as you did with CC), it would probably be a good idea to drop a line on Raul first in any case. Note that the texts on that page are already slightly edited, perhaps shortened, in relation to the live Lead sections as seen in the articles. Also, of course, there's a list of all Featured Articles (as opposed to mere FA <b>candidates</b>). That's <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">here</a>. The bolded titles on the page have already been featured on the MP, so the unbolded ones are your men. In principle, they will (nearly) all go on the MP eventually, though nobody knows when. The advantage of using that list, even if it's dauntingly long, is that you'd be editing the articles directly, and the main contributors will be watching them, so you'll get input. That's not so likely to happen with the <a href="../../../t/o/d/Wikipedia%7EToday%27s_featured_article_October_2005_3762.html" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article/October 2005">Wikipedia:Today's featured article/October 2005</a> page.

<dd>One would reply even sooner if it didn't take 25 minutes to get to the bottom of this page. I don't know. I think it's supposed to be Baroque with a capital B, we had all of thi with Palladian and palladian, I've no idea we don't capitalize like some people, I always think upper case is a little pompous myself - who do we know who would know?

<dd>Well it's 18th century architecture! I personally don't see why it needs a capital at all, it's only a noun, we are not German (at least I'm not), it's not a place, person or named after a person like say Palladian was after Palladio (who was a person) or Romanesque is after Rome (which is a place) - are you getting my drift, in fact it's names after "barroco" a foreign word (Ithink Portugese) meaning a deformed pearl - sod is! some-one will know different what ever we think.

<p>Why I don't sign off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainly, I don't agree with an NPA policy. I agree with it as a guideline and as a cause of refactoring talk pages (if links to archives are provided only).</li>
<li>Any time we get into "personal attack," we have to interpret, and that's the pisser. Is it the victim's assessment, the speaker's intent, or the mob's evaluation? Each of those has big problems. Uninvolved people can generally agree when something is a PA, but the moment "the community" answers, then it gets down to who has friends and who has helped whom in the past.</li>
<li>Disrupting Wikipedia really ought to be enough, and personal attacks do that. As a subspecies of "disruption," a person can and should go over to arbitration or mediation for being an insulting jerk. Yodler, for example, was making negative content. Sophie, too, is making negative content.</li>
<li>The problem with trolls is that they generate a lot of discussion, but all the discussion is about something other than the purpose of the website. If they can get a fight over brain death going, they have accomplished their jobs. Those users who generate insults (and those who cry wolf repeatedly, claiming that they're being attacked) are diverting the energies of the project onto an endless (because endlessly argued) debate over how insulting they are or how wounded. That, to me, is a reason to mediate, arbitrate, or annihilate, not the nastiness or sweetness of some words here or there. (If someone says something awful, but it doesn't get a tizzy going, I wouldn't want to see the effort of an RfC. It's only disruption that should be penalized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that's why I'm not getting into the insult RfC's. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:20, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Disruption" is quite a vague concept to me. Anyway, nobody need get into those RfCs any more, the subjects are highlighting their worst editing habits on them more effectively than even your eloquence could. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:22, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, "disruption" is vague, but I think it's far more empirical than "personal attack." They both require interpretation, but the latter is a question of affect, and the former is one of effect. We can pretty easily figure out if some monkey's antics have caused that monkey to stop doing anything useful and/or caused others to do less useful stuff. That's why I brought up Yodler and Sophie. They were both time sinks for everyone else, and neither of them wrote anything of serious worth. Most of the former's edits were <i>removing</i> things he didn't like, and all of the latter's edits were Mobius strip comments. On the other hand, Tuba saying that Giano had attacked him (when Giano had very much <i>baited</i> him but not <i>attacked</i> him) led to a lot of smoke and hostility, but nothing was decided. He has a lot of friends, and so the comments and "votes" on wp:an/i and elsewhere were all about emotions and not about statements, intent, etc. I think that any editor whose work leads to folks talking about the edits instead of the subject of them is, to some small degree, disrupting, and this includes those who protest as well as those who provoke. This is why I've always had <i>some</i> sympathy with the "act definitively" sentiment and with the idea of a greater hierarchy of power. It's only some sympathy, though, and not agreement. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:05, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I've already replied to FW, basically saying that I won't answer "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?" questions, and asking a more straightforward and urgent question of him, about his own behavior wrt the "endorsement" of my outside view. After all, it is an RfC on <b>his</b> conduct, and that aspect seems to get a little overwhelmed sometimes. I'm not saying FW is overwhelming it on purpose--he has every right to defend himself--but I wanted to bring it back up on the table. I do believe FW would do himself a favour if he focused more on his own conduct and less on SlimVirgin's, and if he made good faith attempts to respond to comments on it from the community. Responses by ad hominem insinuation only make him look bad. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:50, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You're welcome. While your reply to FW indicated you are not replying to a hypothetical (and the question I quoted is NOT a hypothetical), it appears the actual and quite sensible real reason is that you do not wish to be drawn into the side issue of "Was someone else just as bad" with him in this context. FW would serve himself better if he promised to act more friendly and stopped defending himself with "I'm only doing to them what they are doing to me" type arguments. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 14:32, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heavens to Betsy, if it weren't so soon after your comment, I'd have gone to "Oppose" on a recent RfA. I wouldn't have based on FAC actions, but on the arrogance and narrowness of the responses on the RFA itself. Wow. First, many of these things aren't "grammatical" problems at all. Second, many aren't even bad. They may be complex, but complexity is not an error. However, differences of opinion are fine: it's the way one acts about those differences that signals trouble. I see overwriting and death defying over them, and that's a bad, bad thing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:57, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

People have put up monetary bounties for certain articles reaching featured status - if the article makes it, the bounty lister donates the stated amount of money to the Wikimedia Foundation.

<p>Bishonen, this article seems to be fueling a number of controversies. Those controversies quite aside, can I interest you in a continuing effort to improve the article? However badly it needs improvement, I'm certain that it could be improved. I'm cautiously working on this, but another brain would be a great help. Thanks.

<dd>Hoary, thanks for writing, but I just find it difficult to <b>put</b> all the bad feeling, and the way everything about the article is up in the air, quite aside right now. I admire your persistence and equanimity in working on it, and of course I <b>am</b> interested in helping, very much. But with the ongoing unpleasantness, persistently associated with this lovely article&#160;:-( — look, almost at random, at the latest attack on myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pentawing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26764102" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pentawing&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=26764102" rel="nofollow">here</a>—and the FARC business—well, I'd rather wait a little. I'd like to work with you, but what do you say we both wait a little? I just don't feel good about it right now. (Hey, if you don't have enough to do—just kidding—might I interest you in taking a look at an effort I'm just finishing myself, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Relapse_0ee6.html" title="The Relapse">The Relapse</a>?

<dd>That last link of yours certainly provides an odd comment. To me, it doesn't look like an attack; but if I were to comment any more on it, I'd do so in the RfA page. By contrast, I try hard to put aside the continuing unpleasantness; but when I'm forced to consider it I take it as good reason to have the page fixed fairly quickly by the patient and sympathetic before it's fixed by the less patient and less sympathetic. So I'll persevere with it (and I'll try to take a look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Relapse_0ee6.html" title="The Relapse">The Relapse</a> as well). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:59, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's a wiki. I don't like the feeling that the less patient etc are quite likely to undo the work of the patient at this time; I don't have a scenario for that, just a feeling. "Vulture" isn't an attack in your book?

<dd>To me, it's a silly comparison within a rather silly message, by somebody who clearly is agitated. It's regrettable, but I wouldn't have regarded it as an attack, no. Anyway, it's in a separate compartment of my brain from that dealing with the Sicilian baroque. I have the same premonition as you, and this is why I'd like to stormproof the article. Stormproofing aside, I'd like to see it improved, but unfortunately I lack the architectural knowhow needed to make any but the lowest-level alterations. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:50, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to see an attack, look at the AOL anon vandalism of my page that Everyking reverted. It's an IP that has, like all AOL IP's, done vandalism and good edits, so it's likely a regular user logged out in this case. Nevermind that, though. I didn't think Tony1's complaint was an attack as much as a hyperbolic simile. The article itself would benefit from copyediting, and I hope it would be possible to do some actual rewriting without aggravating the primary author. The way I saw it, most of the negative voting came from the prose, not the information. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:46, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Appreciate your quick and ready reply.

<dd>Hey, I'm looking at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Donne_3c1c.html" title="John Donne">John Donne</a>. My message on the user's talk page was somewhat peremptory, but I find it impossible to imagine that the user is acting without an awareness of the amount of information being excised. Further, the "imposter" business can't help but be prejudicial. I can think of lots of old names to invoke that this is like, but none of that is to the point. All we really need to be concerned with is keeping the seals tight and watching carefully to see if this is the only thing the user does, and then proceed from there. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:50, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, remember that Iago's motivation was envy, and Dali thought that chaos betrayed the subconscious.

<dd>Umm, does the defense of plagiarism make anyone else worry? (I.e. could it be that these edits were to bring our articles into conformity with a print source?) Just a thought.

<dd>You can read Iago's very wordy and meandering defense on <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWilliam_Shakespeare_12b8.html" title="Talk:William Shakespeare">Talk:William Shakespeare</a>. Basically, he railed against the level of copyediting in Wikipedia, taunted us to make it better and noted that he received specific praise (and a barnstar) from certain editors like <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">User:Alabamaboy</a> for his work. Both Iago and Alabamaboy are in unison that a literary article should be useful to a 12-year-old doing research. I disagree vehemently (<i>that</i> should be kept for the Simple English version). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">User:The Singing Badger</a> is keeping very quiet, but she (I believed it's a she) seemed to have been won over by the two. Please feel free to comment on the state of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> on the peer review. I personally think Alabamaboy's rewrites lacks both depth and enthusiasm somewhat, and his style is too clinical and dry, but that's my POV. It's not <i>bad</i>, but it's not that great (as he advertises it) either. I basically cannot feel the article is safe in the hands of someone who names four plays as "classic" in the lead (since then removed very perspicicously by The Singing Badger). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMandel_be9b.html" title="User:Mandel">Mandel</a> 14:55, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your choice, of course, but I'm not of the same opinion when it comes to talk pages. Were there an RFC on him, there would be a reason for overriding his edits of his own talk page. Otherwise.... Again, your choice and not something I feel strongly about. I think there is something highly, highly suspicious about the user, but history is enough for me to know that a number of folks have complained and that he has interesting taste in friends (and no, I'm not talking about Tony the Marine). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:31, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bishonen. On wikimedia commons there is a "Flag of Sweden.svg".

<p>Oh, Bishonen - (I can get vocative here too) - no, I can't point to any particular point where you have lacked civility, but then I don't think I ever said that you did. What I said was <i>it seems to me that <b>more</b> civility, deep breaths and walking away from the confrontation on both sides would have helped in the past and would help going forward</i> (emphasis added). More civility always helps, as does taking deep breaths (short of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperventilation.html" title="Hyperventilation">hyperventilation</a>), and walking away from the confrontation, particularly in an impersonal written medium like this, where it is all to easy to take offence at bald words on the page, absent the non-verbal clues that would normally blunt or clarify their import. As I have said to Giano, far too much of everyone's time at this place is taken up with destructive in-fighting, and I have no intention of getting involved in that. But I don't feel I can stand idly by while a contributor walks away from the project over something as meaningless as whether a FAC has been copyedited enough, or whether people have said nasty things (justified or not) in his RFA. Which it not to say that I wholeheartedly support Tony in all that he has said or done. I am not picking sides here. I just wish we could all get along and just write this darned encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 16:25, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I prefer to respond on my own page in this instance, I hope that's all right. I note what you say, including your response to Giano, thank you for taking the time. I have to say I don't get the impression that you've followed what happened closely, and I totally understand that you'd rather spend your limited wikitime on something more life-affirming than reading the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Tony1_c088.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Tony1">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Tony1</a> page, or following Tony1 on user talk pages. OTOH, if I'm right in thinking you haven't, aren't you taking a lot on yourself with this fingerpointing? To encourage Tony to stay is a most humane impulse, I commend you for it, so please don't bring up that <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> again, as you do to Giano. It's not your encouragement that bothers me; it's that you choose not to answer my question about where I could have been more civil, or less confrontational, or walked away sooner (before asking my single question on the RFA? before posting my single vote?). And even more that you express disbelief in Giano's description of events. After all, you've been friends for some time, I assumed there wasn't basic distrust. He certainly trusted you, in taking the trouble to send you an account. It's a very moderate one, and, as I said, I have trouble believing that you've researched the subject in depth for yourself. You can't stand idly by while a contributor walks away from the project&#160;? You're doing it now. P.S., it would be appreciated if you would go back to Giano's page and sign your message there.

<dd>Sorry - only spotted this just now (you will see from my recent contributions that I have been doing next to nothing wiki-wise over the course of the last week or so). No, I have not been following closely nor researched in any depth at all - simply skimmed FAC and RFA when I had a moment, and was rather surprised at the dispute that had broken out. As I said to Giano, I haven't seen the vilification Giano refers to (please point me to it if you think it will help).</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From what I have seen, it seems to me that Tony and others' efforts to improve a page in good faith (are you suggesting that they deliberately set out to sabotage it?) were not appreciated, and then Giano reverted to his preferred version (which, to be blunt, strikes me as a fit of pique - yes, he may have written it; yes, it is certainly a tour de force; yes, he may feel the erosion of his prose to be an affront: but wholesale reversion is essentially a slap in the face and seldom merited). On the other hand, I find it rather surprising that Giano would react like that without some significant provocation, although all I can see from the page history (now I have looked in more depth) is a series of rounds of copyediting. In short, there seemed to be a shortage of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiLove_dbab.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiLove">WikiLove</a> all round.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>If I have an imperfect apprehension of the situation, then again my apologies (I have said as much directly to Giano). It does strikes me that including your name in my initial message to Tony may have been a mistake - probably arising from my skim of the RFA: from the FAC, the main antagonists would seem to be Tony and Giano.</dd>

<dd>I'm not entirely sure which straw man I have raised with Giano, and I've also signed my message to Giano (now archived - continuing issues with logging out are one of the reasons I have not been around much recently. I've been to an interesting talk on the <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755_Lisbon_earthquake_8243.html" title="1755 Lisbon earthquake">1755 Lisbon earthquake</a> this evening and wanted to add something about <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake_Baroque_d1da.html" title="Earthquake Baroque">Earthquake Baroque</a> in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guatemala.html" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> but keep getting logged out.)</dd>

<dd>If Giano is thinking of leaving, then I will be over to his talk page directly to encourage him to stay: none of this FAC and RFA business is worth a hill of beans compared to the contribution he has made here. And now I have spent a further hour composing this instead of writing articles; having finished work late <i>again</i>, it is time to go home and see my wife. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 22:34, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you don't have time to read (rather than skim) the RFA (rather than the FAC), there's not much I can do about it. I quite understand that you might not.

<dd>Well, my comments are worth the paper they are not written on. Perhaps they were precipitate, but all I intended to say to Tony was (i) from what I had seen, I didn't think the fault was totally on his side; (ii) his contributions are valued; (iii) don't go. If I have hurt peoples' feelings then I am sorry: I certainly did not intend to.

<p>Oh, ALoan, don't worry, I don't want to discuss it further either, and if you're content with your message to Giano, it's not my business. I'm sorry you felt obliged to waste all that time. I meant to enlighten rather than reproach, but I went about it the wrong way. Here are some links plotting the views of some other users during the RFA week. Please don't feel obliged to click on them, they're only for if you're interested and have the time to spare.</p>

<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Thanks for reverting the vandal the other day. No telling what they wanted, but it looked random.</p>
<p>I couldn't handle hanging around the IRC any longer. The age of the room seems to be regressing lately, and I'm not sure there are non-trawling speakers most of the time. The schedule I'm on leaves me fairly frustrated for living. I never seem to be awake for any entertainment or at a computer that will give me access to conversation. That's coupled with the fact that I haven't had any article ideas in a while. There are dunces to write about, but I want to start thinking (if I stay employed here next year) about actual scholarship and conference papers (we are encouraged to present one paper a year...this would be remarkable progress for the faculty). It's possible that I could do something with Jonathan Wild, the novel, but I'm not sure it would be anything new. Oh, for a research library and a rare book room! (RG would be for publishing, not presenting on.)</p>
<p>I <i>think</i> that I'll be home tomorrow before awfully late, but I definitely will on Friday. Once Friday comes, though, we're already at the weekend, and that will evaporate in about 4 hours of apparent time. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:24, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, an Outside view is meant to be just that, not a dialogue, and then other people get to freely make up their minds about whether to endorse it or not. AFAIK the standard is that all comments except actual endorsements go on Talk. I didn't want to argue about it, with the warning example of FuelWagon fresh in mind—look at the furious hair-splitting edit war about such matters that he's waging on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_FuelWagon_2_9fa1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/FuelWagon 2">his RFC</a>—so I just removed it.

<dd>Count to ten, Tups.

Assuming that this is a new user, they're very likely not technically capable of retrieving the original version themselves; I don't know about you, but I didn't venture anywhere near the History tab for months when I first came here.

<p>Bishonen, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like you not to alter my comments. If I don't have anything new to say, and I am repeating myself, I should be revising my comments, not adding repeated comments and wasting everyone's time. If you read the revision carefully, I'm not making new arguments but merely refining arguments that have been already made. If Uppland feels strongly about the PhD not making a difference, let him make his argument. I believe I have made mine. If you feel something needs to be added in order to make Uppland's comment understandable, do so. But if I am forced to repeat my "latest" version everytime I want to change something, there won't be enough room for the next person to disagree with me. Thanks for your consideration. We99 01:29, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With respect, We99, it's not you so much who are affected by your revision technique, it's the people you discuss with. As you can see on the AfD page, and on this page of mine, Uppland (an experienced and respected editor) is finding it impossible to deal with. Your present system is obviously wasting <b>his</b> time. It also flies in the face of Wikipedia policy. Please don't insist. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:57, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>P.S. OK, edit conflict--it would really be a help if you posted a note in one go, rather than add to it after I've started to reply. You're not forced to repeat your latest version, only whatever new thing you need to say. (Why, though, necessarily say <b>anything</b> new, if you "don't have anything new to say"?) As for "not enough room for the next person"--yes there will always be enough room.

<p>Bishonen, there is an upper limit to the discussion for deletion. If you don't believe me, try adding a bunch of text and you'll know there is an upper limit. We99 02:03, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is getting a bit surrealistic. I assure you the page has as much room as you and the next person could possibly need if there were 20 times as many of you. I'm sorry you find it inconvenient to leave your original input on the page, I can understand how it could be, but it's what you have to do if you're going to respect policy and other editors. Please try to adjust to standard Wikipedia practice. Now you'll have to excuse me, it's the middle of the night where I am. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:14, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--Second opinion, here: Bishonen is, in fact, being very polite. It is <i>policy</i> that one is not allowed to change the text of one's vote. If you no longer agree with what you had said, or if you believe that what you have written is inappropriate, you may strike out your previous comment, but you <b>leave it in place, exactly as it was</b> and then write whatever new you have to say underneath the original. To perform the strike-through, place &lt;s&gt; at the beginning of the text to be stricken and &lt;/s&gt; at the end of the stricken text. That way, it remains in place so that other readers/editors/voters can see what comment had drawn original comment. Again, <i>do not change the text of your vote.</i> If your vote contains a personal attack, and you wish to remove the insult, you are better off using the strike-through; however, if you had been particularly insulting and wish to remove the text of the insult, you may, but <i>only</i> if you put in its place text indicating that you have removed an insult <i>that you made.</i> (Do not remove insults written by others. Leave that for an administrator to do.) This is <b>not</b> optional behavior. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:37, 6 November 2005 (UTC) (Posted on the user's talk page as well.)</p>

<dd>Some surprises there: that Dragonfly blocked me at all, even though I only said "I <b>ought</b> to try being blocked, there's a lot of stuff I don't know about how it works", and the little... scalliwag blocked me for an hour even though I replied "not now, dear" to the whole storm of block offers that arose on IRC. And secondly, even though the autoblocker did bite me, it didn't add the usual 24 hours. Perhaps that feature has been discontinued, it wouldn't be any too soon. And thirdly, the thing i really wanted to know: no, I can't even open the edit mode! IOW, I can't copy it, IOW, I can't work offline, either. Hmm. This is all very useful information.

<p>In your edit summary for you current post to Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Silverback/Evidence, there is some kind of little arrow thing containing a link to the section you just edited.

<p>I didn't move Carnildo's post, I had an edit conflict with him when responding to your post, and so I moved my post and maintained the cronology via indents as is my practice. The attraction is to make sure admins know that this is a second violation. I looked at the intro and didn't see any instructions on where to add it, and since some pages instruct to add at the top, that is what I did. I admit I was confused about that.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 01:30, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, there's a vandalbot, the page had to be locked. Don't you feel like admitting the second heading was ridiculous while you're about it?

<p>These feebs are hitting it at a furious pace. I have to teach from 8-12, and I only hope that wakeful Europeans are noticing it, because I'll be unable to do much during that time. I have a feeling that what I'd really like to do is revert all the way back to Haeleth's replacement of dashes with emdash, but no point in even thinking about that until the thing's off the main page. People have 1) tried to turn all spellings to British (incompletely, of course), 2) <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link.html" title="Link">link</a> everything, 3) change hard words into simple ones ("dearth" to "death").

<p>Hey Bishonen.

<li>Replying to your comments on the RFC talk page, am I required to try to initiate some mediation or an ending to this problem? I still fail to see how I am really at fault here. The suggestion I have an overt bias is nonsense - I began the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesley_College%2C_Melbourne_d7f7.html" title="Wesley College, Melbourne">Wesley College, Melbourne</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_College%2C_Melbourne_54a1.html" title="Scotch College, Melbourne">Scotch College, Melbourne</a> articles, have contributed to or edited numerous school articles, run a portal featuring numerous schools - and I am being chastisied by persistent vandals who decided to take it more seriously than most. Please give me some advice on what I need to do next. Does RFC have any major consequences? I've never really been involved in the dispute process on Wikipedia. Your statement, and the amount of support it has received, seem to vindicate me. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 06:03, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Harro, RfC is a request for comments from the community. It isn't punitive (though if the community is unhappy with either party, it won't be a comfortable process for that party, obviously). It has the double purpose of a) making the people involved see how the community looks on actions such as theirs, and b) giving a basis of evidence for if the dispute resolution process is taken the next step, to a Request For Arbitration, RFAr. So far indeed the community seems to vindicate you. Insofar as the process is collecting evidence for an RFAr by anybody, it would be one by you, and you might want to consider that (though I have a better suggestion below). Badly-founded RFCs will do that, they bite the side that brought them. That happens a lot, since they're often brought by the most litigious members of the community, and those least aware of how their actions look to others. To answer your concrete question: no, you're not required to try mediation or anything like that, that's what the other side should do (should already have done, as I've told them, but they seem to be as suspicious of my motives as they are of yours). That's the formal situation, but there's another way of looking at it: You're an experienced editor, they're newbies, you might want to be the bigger man here, and try to ask for mediation anyway. There's <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">WP:TINMC</a> ...oh, no, there isn't, I just looked, and WP:TINMC aren't taking on new cases, they're too backlogged. OK, then, there's the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Committee_9b92.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Committee">Wikipedia:Mediation Committee</a>, take a look at their page <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a>. Your best bet there is to get in touch with the acting chair, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24">User:Redwolf24</a>, directly, he's very quick and decisive and would steer you right. If you're an IRCer, the easiest way is to speak with Red on #wikipedia, he's there most of the time. (Well, given the time zone thing, not most of <b>your</b> time, he's in Canada I think, but you'll get hold of him easily, anyway.) If not, use e-mail or a note on his page. It seems to me that mediation might have a good chance of working, and if it did, it would be an advantage to everybody involved. Not to mention a big advantage to ArbCom, backlogged and overwhelmed as they are. Plus, if you bring an RFAr, I can see the ArbCom recommending mediation as a first step.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>P.S. to Beyondcapricorn</b>: in replying to Harro above I'm trying to inform you as well, I hope you're reading this. Note especially what I say about the routes to mediation, I didn't know about <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINMC_f912.html" title="WP:TINMC">WP:TINMC</a> being backlogged when I discussed with your friend, the IP I've been speaking with on the RFC talkpage (this would be easier if he had a username). If you care at all about getting community support, as I assume you do (or why bring an RFC), I have two urgent bits of advice for both of you:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Stop insisting you have already provided evidence for "trying and failing to solve the dispute", in the face of my explanations. It shows disrespect for our practices, which annoys people, and disregard for truth and likelihood, which just makes a bad impression.</li>
<li>Stop referring to Harro5's "true motives", as you do yet again, above: that he's activated by school rivalry, hatred for your school, and such. In the first place it's <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">insulting</a>, I'm not sure if you can hear yourself and put yourself in the other person's shoes in that regard. Also it's just too childish, it erodes other people's respect for you (not him, you). Worst, it flies in the face of a really basic civility principle here, which is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">Assume good faith</a>. Motives aren't even relevant, because nobody but the person in question has access to them. Just don't go there. Talk about <b>actions</b> and <b>words</b>! And do it much more specifically than you've been doing. Give examples, give diffs. Those, if you have them, might actually impress people who are neutral on this issue, while your large, sweeping gestures in the direction of "obviously-this-is-the-case" just ... don't have that effect. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:33, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

It never did have any evidence of attempted resolution, and now it doesn't even have the requisite signatures, after beyondcapricorn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Harro5&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28292580#Evidence_of_trying_and_failing_to_resolve_the_dispute" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Harro5&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28292580#Evidence_of_trying_and_failing_to_resolve_the_dispute" rel="nofollow">removed</a> his own and also MacBandit's (hmmmm-sock puppetry?).

Anyway, I hope 220.253.48.90 is also finding something better to do, and I rather suspect he sees the pointlessness of going on with the RFC and is content to have it delisted. Still, in any case, I would point you and him towards <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedwolf24_a12e.html" title="User:Redwolf24">User:Redwolf24</a> and mediation.

<dd>I'm going to leave it up there as a record of my actions being vindicated. These sorts of disputes have popped up on occasion when students discover Wikipedia and are outraged that people from other schools are editing that info, so it might come in handy as precedent. Also, I have been approached tentatively about a future RFA, and while this RFC has shelved that for a little while longer (maybe till after Christmas provided no more problems), it alsways helps with full disclosure. Thanks for all your help, and for being a rational mediator while I tried to fight my way out of the corner I was being forced into. Lastly, and please just a quick note on my talk page, do you feel I should stay away from the St Michaels article or stay around to clean it up a bit? Having a look at it now - <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Michael%27s_Grammar_School_b90e.html" title="St Michael's Grammar School">St Michael's Grammar School</a> - its probably even messier than the Caulfield article was when you helped me out with it a couple of months ago.

<p>I'm hoping to take a look at it today or tomorrow. A little ennui over on my side as left me fit for nothing but squishing speedy deletes and thundering on VfD. (I do think <i>Station Island</i> is one of the finest single collections of poems I've read in ages, although none of Heaney's other volumes have been as moving for me. The article we have on him stresses his nature poetry, but <i>Station Island</i> is a very different book from all those -- much more Modernist.) (As for Plath, it hardly matters what one writes: desperate fans will rewrite it.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:11, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the message, we'll see in a second if the sig thing is fixed or not.Tricks aren't very good, I thought I might feel better about the place after a time away, but its still pretty much the same nicht wahr. The response to Rhe Relapse was disappointing, but frankly what were you realistically expecting, knowing the place as you do? FAC seems to have become a strangle place these days of increasingly new requirements, demands, and needs which I have decided I no longer wish to attempt to meet; in fact I shall not try to meet them. Rather than judging each subject on its own individual requirements everything is now required to conform to blanket diktats, often legislated by people who seem to have little better to do than enforce them, when their time would be far better spent writing a page themselves, rather than passing comment on anything from the legal validity of copyright to English grammar, both subjects on which they are generally and factually completely ignorant.</p>
<p>At least The Relapse was justly featured, and apart from the one mild objection (was that another new diktat?) those that read it seemed to like it, it just lacked the necessary tabloidness in the title to pull them in my new title should do that (although that's not why I chose it), but God the google hits do seem to be more gynaecological than architectural! Shame it's not going to FA, it would have been fun to see people demanding "Family" after the Surname section, it's technically correct as it is for an Italian family as it is. Wish I could make people read The Relapse, perhaps it will become heavily vandalised then you will know people are at least looking at it.

I shouldn't have meddled. I have not gotten involved in such a situation since so I did learn from it. Thanks again for taking the time to post the well researched commentary to qualify your vote.

<p>Salve, Bishonen!<br />
Thank you for your comments. First, I would note I was unable to return to Wikipedia for several days; thus there was no reply to the objectors on Bob McEwen. That said, I do not understand the objection to links. What is the issue there? I can think of other articles with many links which successfully passed the FAC process.</p>
<p>The peer review process doesn't work either, thus I do not use it anymore. For example, I give you two articles that were praised or received no objections, but lost at FAC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Bruce_Johnson_0490.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Bruce Johnson">Wikipedia:Peer review/Bruce Johnson</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Bruce_Johnson_ff29.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Bruce Johnson">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Bruce Johnson</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I believe the article review process is broken because there is no consistency and not enough participation, thus my suggestions. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 19:24, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>not in disgust, dear Bishonen, and I wish I would get a couple of days to address the concerns voiced. Wiglaf has said he is going to help too. If the nominiation is flushed off the list, I may take the liberty of re-submitting it as soon as I think I addressed all points. I must say, however, that our FA criteria seem to be in rather lofty heights these days; the article is at least as good as those featured on the other languages WP. I do appreciate, however, that en: has a somewhat more heavy burden of responsibility compared to minor projects, so I suppose the objections are fair enough. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:54, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OwenX pointed out that yesterday marked exactly two years since my first edit as Geogre. I pointed out that there had been 3-6 months prior to that where I had been convinced that getting an account would mean spam e-mail. I think 2 in Wikipedia years is like 40 in human years.

<p>Ah, the second kiddiehood! The funny thing is that I'm in the computer generation, so a lot of the kiddie slang is actually from pop culture that we had in the 1980s, when the PC moved out of the garage. Now, the "old timers" are about 40, and the kiddies revel in learning their dorm joke phrases. (I can't remember the movie that "esplode" came from, but it was a dumb comedy of the 80's.) Mine is the generation of the bastards of young: "No willingness to claim us/ We've got no war to name us.//We are the sons of no one/ Bastards of young," as the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Westerberg_9180.html" title="Paul Westerberg">man</a> sang. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:58, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Exactly so. Two may be 40, 50, or 60 -- it is whatever age it is for a person to have all her or his vitality sapped and hopes broken. Seeing youngsters saying that "AfD may collapse, but that collapse is a long way in the future" is almost touching.

<p>Hi Bishonen,</p>
<p>You've probably noticed already, but I've added a section to the RFC as you suggested.</p>
<p>Could I trouble you for feedback? Do you think it's adequate for the purpose?</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenAveling_8f0b.html" title="User:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 22:14, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I think you come across as a civil and respectful contributor in your comments to Dunc, but no, I <i>don't</i> think they qualify as attempted "dispute resolution". For that they would need to be both more elaborate, and more neutral. My advice to you is to get a neutral third party in, via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, for instance, before the 48 hours are up, and ask them to mediate. That's just my opinion, though. I don't suppose it's shared by everyone, and I don't have any plans for agitating to get the RFC deleted, or for insisting further on the points I've made. No telling what my post may prompt others to do, though, so I think you're wise to address the issue. What I was hoping to achieve, really, was to encourage to mediation. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:42, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Bishonen,</dd>
<dd>We could try to get a mediator. But I'm not sure what we would ask them to do. I don't think it would be useful to ask them to try find a middle ground on the issue of Dunc's incivility. Dunc has said that he knows that what he did was wrong, but that doesn't stop him doing it. It didn't even stop him being rude in his apology in the RFC.</dd>
<dd>But perhaps a mediator might be useful to bring some order to the RFC itself - lots of people (including me) have been writing all over it, which is not helpful. If people would agree to appoint a mediator for the conduct of the RFC, that would be useful, and I could propose that.</dd>
<dd>But I think you are thinking of a wider role in the dispute? And maybe you have a different view of the dispute to my own? For me, the dispute is about Dunc's behaviour towards people who disagree with him. I'm afraid I don't see a lot of room to negotiate that.</dd>

<dd>Hi again, I changed me mind. I stopped trying to discuss and reverted to telling Dunc how he should behave far too quickly. I agree that a mediator is needed, and I've got just the person in mind. Assuming Dunc agrees, would you mediate for us?

<dd>Hi, Ganymead. Mediawiki got updated in a way that broke sigs like yours (and mine). You can fix it by typing the exact wikicode for the whole thing in the nickname field in Preferences and ticking the "raw signatures" box. Cripes... yours is so complicated, I'm not sure what it looked like, but for my plain sig, with a simple talk link, I typed [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] | [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]]. You can do the mutatis mutandis on that, I'm sure, for your pretty colors and stuff. Unless something about those codes has also been broken, but I don't think so. Ticking the raw sig box is central. Please let me know if it still doesn't work, I know there's a help page somewhere that I may be able to unearth.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:06, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Bish-fishing for a second opinion (anyone else passing by is welcome to comment): <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html" title="Academia">Academia</a> is a featured article, but I don't think it should be, and consider nominating it on <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFARC_beb0.html" title="WP:FARC">WP:FARC</a>. Except for the sections on the ancient world and the medieval period, it is very U.S.-centric, partly by showing a lack of awareness of other perspectives (see section "<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html#Recent_economic_changes" title="Academia">Recent_economic_changes</a>"), partly by using U.S. examples, where, say, Italian, French or German examples would be more appropriate (as in the section "<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html#Rise_of_academic_societies" title="Academia">Rise_of_academic_societies</a>"). Where it is not entirely U.S.-centric, international perspectives are mostly limited to England. The section "<a href="../../../a/c/a/Academia.html#Eighteenth_and_nineteenth_centuries" title="Academia">Eighteenth_and_nineteenth_centuries</a>" is all about the U.S., despite America still being a backwater at the time. With all due respect for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> and Ben Franklin, in an 18th century history of academia, one would expect the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_G%C3%B6ttingen_076d.html" title="University of Göttingen">University of Göttingen</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Leiden_e2e9.html" title="University of Leiden">University of Leiden</a> and a host of other European universities (and other institutions) to be more approriate to mention. And whatever happened to the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, in fact the entire period from the end of the middle ages until the mid-18th century? Is the foundation of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> really the only thing worth mentioning from that period?</p>

<dd>I've never heard of such a thing, sorry. There seems to have been plenty of corporal punishment going on at Oxford and Cambridge in the Middle Ages and Early Modern period: the students were very young, and got treated the way children did. And the "sending down" was frequent for much longer, of course. But no prison, AFAIK. See how a google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22student+jail%22+history&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22student+jail%22+history&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">"'student jail' + history"</a> keeps throwing up Germany, mainly Heidelberg? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:39, 26 November 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I guess I will have to make do with "student prison" or "student jail" (not gaol?). The German student prisons are well-preserved and famous tourist attractions and get a lot of hits for that reason.

Recently I've been having difficulties in getting a sufficient amount of feedback from the top caliber editors of the history and politics articles-- needed in order to establish a consensus in the vote at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_modern_day_dictators_077a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of modern day dictators">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of modern day dictators</a>.

<dd>No way do I want to voluntarily get into that puddle, but my $0.02 is this. "Dictator" has a specific meaning from Roman law. The title was revived very specifically by Mussolini. In Rome, the "dictator" was something to be avoided (after Cincinnatus), and it had already shaded to synonymous with "tyrant" by the time of Augustus. However, none of the leaders of Italy or Germany or anywhere else has quite been a dictator ("word is law") with its full meaning, or none have since Mussolini. In English, the word was used as a full synonymn for "tyrant" beginning in World War 2. It has been since used solely to indicate "bad absolute ruler." Thus, it is <i>inherently POV</i> (and "inherently POV" is part of the deletion guideline for lists). It is such because there are alternative terms. Further, the alternatives are always (really, always) more precise than "dictator." For example, Idi Amin was a bad absolute ruler. I share the POV that he was a "dictator," but if I were going to be precise and avoid POV, which I have to do in an encyclopedia, I'd say he was a "president for life." Pol Pot did not bear the job title "dictator," either. The precise terms for these rulers is more descriptive of their cultures and societies, and they avoid POV. Therefore, the list is inherently POV and can <i>only exist as an expression of a POV,</i> since a more natural designation would avoid that POV. This is on top of the general uselessness of List of articles. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:34, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Meanies_bcd1.html" title="Blue Meanies">meanie</a>: I think lists are non-encyclopedic. Of course the list as a thing can be useful. After all, the cross index was a major advance in science and art. It's just that I don't think they belong in encyclopedias, even when they're good. (I told you that I'm a meanie.) I just think that these lists (list of dictators, of communists, of Jews, of Arabs, of Christians, of gays, of transgendereds, of porn industrials, list of greats) are not just not-encyclopedic (per lists), but deletable lists. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:27, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Defending my precious distinction, I would even say that many articles are encyclopedic without being useful. A list of Presidents would appear in an encyclopedia, although usually as a part of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_of_America_fa6b.html" title="President of the United States of America">President of the United States of America</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America_be6c.html" title="Presidents of the United States of America">Presidents of the United States of America</a>. <i>A problem</i> I have with lists is that they invite, inevitably, unsorted, undistinguished dumps of data and bar-bet trivia (List of songs that mention their title in the lyrics). These things get closer to <i>Guiness Book of World Records</i> than <i>Britanica</i> all the time, and they provide a perfectly cozy home for our Aspberger's contributors. At any rate, most articles are garbage, of course, and as long as we have those who believe that any deletion is criminal for hurting feelings and imposing elitist standards, we're going to suffer the dark proliferation of them. Even with more snobs and fewer Everything2 refugees, though, the bulk of them would be lumpen. Our age skew is one reason. Our demoticism is another. The demos hasn't used a research library, hasn't used a serious encyclopedia, and yet the demos writes what it imagines an encyclopedia is and writes information to the limit of its own curiosity (which is to the extent of "Able Baker is a store in Wales"). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because I edited <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linked.html" title="Linked">Linked</a>. When I changed it from an auto-redirect to a dis-ambig, I (being a good citizen) checked the backlinks to make sure that people who linked to the redirect wouldn't be suprised to find a disambig as opposed to a redirect. I came across a few "junk" links that weren't links to a subject, but were just links for the sake of links. To clean out the nonsense in the backlinks, I removed them. I didn't miss the point of "overlinking" -- but I think it'd be best if people made their points without doing the exact thing they want people <i>not</i> to do. From a constant user of "what links here," these junk links can add up to a fair amount of extra editing work. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 20:31, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure. It's a great way to get technicolor in black and white dreams, which is apparently something quite a few of the contributors to the debate there need. Then the codeine kicks in, making all the words slow down and dance, allowing them to stand there in isolation, but then the paragoric comes along to get a good purge going, which allows for writing expert opinions when you're a graduate student.

<dd>I seem to recall the German guy having some interesting cultural history that I lacked, which he added in that German way. I can read the French version, and it's almost a literal translation. I'm honored by it, of course, but its being "more professional" bugged me.

<dd>See, the system is a bit different. They apparently vote about two "grades" simultaneously. Anbefalt means "Recommended articles", which are defined as "spesielt lesverdige, og kan være til inspirasjon for videre artikler": "Specially read-worthy and can inspire your own article-writing." The higher grade is Utmerked, which means Featured, "det ypperste Wikipedia har av artikler", our best. The two votes under Utmerked basically say "No, I think it should be Anbefalt, not Utmerked." Note that those are cast by the first two people on the Anbefalt vote, and that one of them is the translator. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:21, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Bishonen. I'm just dropping you a note to thank you for your support for my RfA. What you said ("dives into the pool of conflict and emerges dry") was definitely the most poetic comment I got! I should have thanked you earlier, but I got a bit caught up with college work.

<p>Seems easy to me. Wrom:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Restoration literature is the literature written in English during the period commonly referred to as the English Restoration (1660–1689), corresponding with the last years of the direct Stuart reign in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. The following article is designed as an overview, and the reader is advised to consult one of the more specialized articles for further information (see references within the text). Please note that the dates for "Restoration literature" are a matter of convention, and they differ markedly from genre to genre. Thus, the "Restoration" in drama may last until 1700, while in poetry it may last only until 1666 and the annus mirabilis, and in prose it might end in 1688, with the increasing tensions over succession and the corresponding rise in journalism and periodicals. In general, the term "Restoration" is used to denote roughly homogeneous styles of literature that center on a celebration of or reaction to the restored court of Charles II.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Restoration literature includes extremes, for it encloses both Paradise Lost and the Earl of Rochester's Sodom, the high spirited sexual comedy of The Country Wife and the moral wisdom of Pilgrim's Progress. It saw Locke's Treatises on Government, the founding of the Royal Society, the experiments and the holy meditations of Robert Boyle, the hysterical attacks on theaters from Jeremy Collier, and the pioneering of literary criticism from John Dryden and John Dennis. It saw news become a commodity, the essay develop into a periodical artform, the emergence of the stock market, and the beginnings of textual criticism.</dd>

<p>The lead at this point is set up that way because of all the hemming and hawing over when it ends. Everyone knows when it begins, but I thought it was fair warning to set up in the lead that it wasn't going to end neatly. If it ends in '89, for example, then everyone writing under Bill &amp; Mary is lost to literary history, as they're not 18th century until 1700 (1701, if we want to be precise). The cuts off a lot of the most interesting poetry and almost all of the interesting prose. Heck, it leaves your year of drama (1695) out in the cold. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:44, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

However, you won't see all the arguments in glory. To do that, you'd have to go back to look at a version before Tony began withdrawing stuff, which means back to probably December 8th. Rather than trying to follow the complicated evolution of the withdrawing, refactoring, and restating, you'd be better off just reading the last clean copy before the massive refactoring.

<p>The best idea is not to start. I am virtually alone among the "Other Parties" in believing that there is so little ambiguity, so little evidence, so little cause, that this thing is going to be a very easy close for the AC and that the fewer words now, the better -- just let them go ahead and say, "There's nothing here" or, better IMO, "Oops."

Well done to Geogre Filiocht and Aloan not many people would sacrifice their Christmas in such a way.

<li>It's appalling but we have looked at worse, in fact she's looks very nice indeed to me. The problem is there aint much there (in the text I mean). As an FA it seems to have been passed on 7th September 2005, and the record shows it was unopposed, which means none of us bothered to even look at it! Perhaps we should all try to look beyond the few (in my case very few) pages which really interest us on FA, and put pay once and for all to all this drivel which is being featured. It seems the good pages (in my opinion) get honed to bland perfection on FA, while the dross seeps through uncontested.

<dd>She's purty. Absolutely no doubt about that. I saw <i>The Village,</i> and I thought she was real purty. Heck, most of the targets of ... interest ... are extremely attractive, and most have a very intriguing look rather than just some grotesque adolescent exaggeration (except for Gwen Stefani: I have no idea at all why people are fixated on her), but I have yet to understand why one <i>researches</i> a object of desire.

<dd>Madonna and child are both wonderful, I'm sure. As an avid gazer upon her early "bootleg" nudes (with European underarm hair!) in <i>Penthouse,</i> I must say that I've always been impressed by her physical beauty. That is as far as it goes. I cannot recall anything she has ever caterwauled that I have enjoyed, unless it was a cover song, and those I have always preferred in their original, un-cuted state. Her public antics, her music, and her image leave me cold. I knew a dozen like her in the punkrock days, and they all were fine to look at, but never to speak to or endure the company of. At this point, I prefer the art of her husband and the looks of herself. There have been no beauties of indescribable longing since Audrey Hepburn, that Dutch girl, Charlotte Rampling, and Catherine Deneuve.

<p>Hi Bishonen. You working tonight? Merovingian has blocked me from editing -- we seem to be starting into a new wave of blocks based on that rotating proxy.

<p>Please note that you have blocked an AOL proxy address -- which randomly rotates among users. AOL users cannot control which number they are assigned, and blocking the number for any length of time is ineffective in fighting vandalism. Please see my user page User:WBardwin/AOL Block Collection for a history of adminstrative discussion and action regarding these blocks. They seem to hit me often. Please release your block.

<p>So, there's my drake, all shrunken -- his masculinity threatened by yet another fearful viewer. Have you seen TFD and the debate over the "Maintained" template? Pretty active debate, if you're interested. (What is it with these templates?

<p>I'd like to thank you, first and foremost; if you're receiving this message, it's because I think you were one of the people I adopted as a personal mentor, and who helped to make the whole Wikipedia experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The fact is, I've got no choice but to leave. The recent sordid affair with <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">User:Deeceevoice</a> and my appalling conduct in that showed me that I have not the calibre required to maintain good relations with users on the wiki. Worse still, I violated almost all of the principles I swore to uphold when I first arrived.</p>
<p>I've now been desysopped, and I plan on devoting a little more time to what I am good at, which is developing. I don't fit in on this side of the servers, but perhaps I can still be of use to the project.</p>

<p>&lt;sigh&gt; Ok, I've now spent an hour or so in the lieberry attempting to find some facts. Miraculously, these Baptists actually had a book specifically about <i>60 Minutes,</i> although one that "exposes" it for liberalism. I found the facts in it and ignored the rest. Also, it turns out that Ambi <i>should</i> know something of it, as there is an Australian spin-off on Channel 9, or at least there was in 1984, when the book I used was written. Am I afraid of old information? Yeah. Will I be careful? Yeah. Do I have some lipstick to put on that pig?

<p>Bishonen, thanks for your comments on the outrageous move of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_phonology_a228.html" title="Ancient Greek phonology">Ancient Greek phonology</a> by User:Thrax. Well, now, clearly acting both against consensus (which he has been doing consistently for a long time) and your clear characterization of the previous move as a "stunt", he's done it again. Besides restoring the article to its original title, I suppose we need to open some sort of action against him. What a pain. Any advice you have would be appreciated. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:53, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

If the user should yet again edit war against consensus, as I have now explicitly warned him not to do, I will certainly consider it disruptive (=I'll block him).

<dd>Good grief, you've done some serious research there! Those seem constructive ok (I clicked on a sample), though some of them are pretty minor. But now put into the other scale all the time and energy and good will taken away from <i>other</i> editors by the trolling edits, and consider what a lot of constructive edits <i>they</i> could have used that wasted time for, and how much happier they would have been doing that kind of work. The "happiness" issue is a big deal IMO: I seriously believe that interaction with... somebody playing these kinds of mindgames comes high on the list of "things that make good editors leave Wikipedia in disgust".

<dd>Well, I just think it is important to look at problems from all sides. I just don't want people condemned before all the evidence is presented. But, yes, I'd agree with you that the happiness issue is an important one. But vandals and trolls have been turned around in the past, so I think efforts should be made to try and change their behavior before drastic steps are taken. Don't get me wrong, RfCs and RfArs are necessary in some cases, but we don't unnecessarily need to start RfCs or RfArs before other options are looked at. But in this specific case, PM <i>is</i> probably doing more harm than good, IMO, and you were right when you said that one may need to be filed, sooner rather than later. It's good to see my work appreciated though.

<p>Hi Bishonen, after commenting on the frivolous claim on the Administrator's noticeboard by <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">User:Huaiwei</a>, you may be interested in reviewing <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Huaiwei_d067.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Huaiwei">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Huaiwei</a>.

<dd>With the RFAR injunctions, the situation is so involved that I hardly know what to say there. I do understand your frustration, but I suspect that <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">User:Monicasdude</a> has it right that the best thing would be to withdraw the RFC and focus instead on whether Huaiwei has violated his probation. (If you believe that he has, I think <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> under the heading "Requests for clarification" would probably be a good place to post.) Meanwhile, if you do want to go on with the RFC, I've posted a note on its talkpage for you, about evidence and diffs. Good luck! <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:01, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks! I actually didn't know there was a section on RFAR on clarifications. I originally brought the matter to the Admin noticeboard but someone said move it to RFC. But I'll discuss with <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">User:Novacatz</a> and see if RFAR is the most appropriate channel. <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 22:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Enochlau, perhaps I should revise my suggestion, now that I've actually found the RFAR in question (it's <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Instantnood_2_01e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Instantnood 2">here</a>). As you can see, Huaiwei's one-year probation means that "any administrator ... may ban them from any article which relates to China which they disrupt by inappropriate editing." If you find that H's editing has disrupted <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_New_Years_greetings_5ed5.html" title="Chinese New Years greetings">Chinese New Years greetings</a>, I suggest you don't bother with <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, but post on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> asking other admins to take a look, and ban H from the article if they see cause. Naturally, "any admin" doesn't mean you, who're an involved party, and possibly not me either, since H has already managed to attack me on WP:ANI, with an accusation of "bullying" him to further some nefarious geographical conspiracy (a little amusing, that, since I'm in Northern Europe). I don't really agree that criticizing him and being attacked for it disqualifies me, especially since H seems so ready to spray attacks in all directions, but some people are very purist about this. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's exactly what I thought, I'd raise it with admins at ANI and let them deal with it, until I got this:
<dl>
<dd><i>This looks like a user RFC to me. It even follows the same format. This might be an attempt to smear someone without having to follow the certification requirements at WP:RFC. --Ryan Delaney talk 04:30, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</i> (now moved to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Huaiwei_Archive1_2958.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Huaiwei/Archive1">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Huaiwei/Archive1</a>)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, the opinion of that administrator was that I was trying to smear Huaiwei via a backdoor by posting this onto ANI. I think he had a valid concern, because due to the posts of other users, my original request that Huaiwei and friends be banned from those pages had ballooned due to continued comments from the others, so it looked like a RfC. Should I dare take it back to ANI? <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnochlau_9436.html" title="User:Enochlau">enochlau</a> (<a href="../../../e/n/o/User_talk%7EEnochlau_4ee5.html" title="User talk:Enochlau">talk</a>) 00:16, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Oh, yes! This is what the RFAR tells you to do, so just do it. I think Ryan may have failed to grasp the situation, and the key to that would be his comment "Really, you put just way too much information here, and it's not very well organized. I can hardly tell what is even going on." You need to post very briefly, emphasizing 1) the RFAR probation, and 2) your request for an uninvolved admin to take a look at the pages and form their <b>own</b> opinion about whether a ban would be appropriate. Don't enumerate the disruptions that you see, don't be drawn into arguing with Huaiwei! If he replies (as I expect he will, though he'd be wiser not to) and starts arguing about all sorts of details, just tell him that you have no more to say, as you want to leave uninvolved admins a clear field to make up their own minds, and so should he. Oh, and put a very clear heading, like "Request for uninvolved admin to review possible probation violation" or something.</dd>
<dd>Your biggest problem is probably that it's such an ungrateful task for an uninvolved admin to take on: they'd have to plow through a lot of bickering on the talk pages, no doubt come in for abuse if they do ban, and finally perform the bureaucratic nightmare that the ArbCom has decreed: posting the ban, in various specified ways, on no less than four different pages. A lot of hoops to jump through. I suppose it might help if you tried to formulate it so as to encourage people to take on <i>one</i> of the pages and review that? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:52, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I say it's OK to cite a well-reputed website, published by someone accountable and trustworthy. Say a university. By no means is it all right to cite somebody's blog, or a site put up by an anonymous or otherwise unknown individual, or one widely regarded as marginal. I do agree with you that the place is confusing and frustrating for newbies, but as you see, they do learn what they need eventually (most of us were new pretty recently.) Though as for learning ALL this stuff, you'll probably never find an editor who has! People tend to specialize in the wikicorners they're interested in. Naturally, it's easier if you start with something less challenging than editing a controversial page, but I do understand that your great interest is in editing the type of pages that you do, so I suppose that can't be helped. There is another factor: how much you're prepared to listen to other people, and try to learn. If you suspect those other people of not having good intentions in the advice they give, then that's an added difficulty, of course. Still, seriously, clicking on what you rather dismissively call "some link to read" and studying it <i>is</i> a very good wiki study technique. And just generally listening is, too. If you don't mind my reminding you, for instance, did you notice my formatting advice to you on <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBigfoot_ef17.html" title="Talk:Bigfoot">Talk:Bigfoot</a>? About using double equals signs, ==, for headings on Talkpages? See, the single signs that you're using make your headings bigger than everybody else's, and also mess up the headings hierarchy on the page. Take a look at how they're affecting my Table of Contents above, for instance. Getting that kind of thing right is admittedly pretty trivial, but it helps make a good impression on readers. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> is <i>vastly</i> more important, though!

<dd>From my perspective, the sockpuppet avoidance of the block is a very serious <i>technical</i> violation, but not the worst behavior overall. Thrax has been disruptive for months now, but mostly in ways that are not unambiguously forbidden: <i>extremely</i> repetitive Talk discussion, edits against consensus, etc. As the consensus has become stronger, he has taken more and more extreme measures. I don't know if he's just so ideologically driven that he think's he has the 'duty' to do this (from his POV) or if he is just playing a game on WP. But the result is the same -- he wastes huge amounts of time and energy of the cooperative editors, and discourages knowledgeable contributors. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 16:04, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Since Thrax' IP is now blocked, the socks aren't coming in from that any more, the way they did at first, but via "furious proxy-surfing", according to Kelly. You figure it: theoretically, CheckUser can no longer furnish absolute proof that these guys all live in Thrax's computer. But User:AskMelegi is either the sock of a user who has shown no conscience about creating them, or else a brand new user suddenly appearing and continuing the discussion where Thrax left off. <i>Via an open proxy.</i> That choice is more than enough for me to put the account on the list, and block it.

Maybe I should expand and improve... oh, yeah, Swedish 19th c literature, that's got to be the <b>one</b> thing that would bore an anglophone readership more than Restoration drama.

<p>That's Wiki-itis, alright. Every person just adds a bit she's heard in class, maybe, or what seems to be true based on stuff in the article (e.g. the Anarchist claim; in <i>The Red Room</i>, there are Anarchists-to-be, so someone thinks, "Well, not really a Socialist, so that means an Anarchist" and adds that). There is no "let's read a biography" spirit, because that would need a single, hard core editor, and the article instead has a hundred dilletente editors. These dilletente editors can do wonders, but when there never has been a major writer, the result is Wiki-itis. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:53, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just duck out if it starts getting complicated... The issue here is just that VMORO refuses to recognize the IPA handbook chart because it has two <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allophones.html" title="Allophones">allophones</a> in it (besides the six recognized <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoneme.html" title="Phoneme">phonemes</a>). I don't think he's actually reading any of the explanatory paragraphs, though. It's more an issue of not removing valid references than the detailes of phonetics. Essentially, I don't there's any difference between what VMORO and I are claiming, except that he doesn't seem to know about the allophones and therefor assumes that it's all wrong.</dd>

<p>I would appreciate it if you no longer communicated with me.

I will ensure that they no longer vote on any FACs I nominate, though I find this unfair, considering we are not the same people. But just so that it doesn't cause anymore controversy, I will make sure of it. Also, I will let you know that I do plan on running for RfA again one day (not anytime soon). Don't hold this case back on me when that time comes, because it isn't my fault. Remember to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, which I want to believe in with you yourself.

<dd>Bishonen is a friend of mine, as you can see. We were both appalled at the "Lola" comments on FAC. In the past I've voted against RFA's on people who showed inappropriate temperament on FAC or other places. Hence, as I rarely look into RFA, she knew that I'd be interested. I was. My vote there was in keeping with my previous habit. Regardless of <i>why</i> you were deceptive, being deceptive has ruined your credibility. If you deceive three times, few will believe you on the fourth time. More to the point, if you believed that you had to, you must either have had real life issues that prevented honest editing or misunderstood the site. Your comment that the whole site has been organized against you from the first day testifies to the latter. Honestly, there are few people watching carefully enough to hold a grudge. There are far too many people on the site for that kind of thing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:05, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hollow Wilerding, I'm going to assume that your talk of "bothering" you and "holding a grudge" is your way of thanking me for placing a link on your talkpage to the WP:ANI thread so that you could respond there. Don't mention it. I'll only communicate with you again if I should need again, for courtesy, to give you information that you need.

<p><i>Oy ve</i>.

As an administrator, do you know if spamming user pages for votes is comparable to sockpuppetry during FAC votes? Which is the worst abuse of the FAC process? Is FAC vote-spamming also a blockable offense? This has nothing to do with HW; it is just a question I've had. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaravask_6d64.html" title="User:Saravask">Saravask</a> 05:12, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, hi there, Saravask. There's no comparison. To spam talkpages is merely mildly frowned on, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SPAM#Internal_spamming" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SPAM#Internal_spamming" rel="nofollow">this guideline</a>. My personal opinion, shared by many, is that seasoned users with self-respect don't do it; but it's by no means a blocking or even scolding offense. More of a social faux pas, which, in the case of a newbie, should be pointed out <i>very</i> gently.</dd>
<dd>Sockpuppets, as such, are allowed, as long as they're well behaved. But abusive socks, i. e. secondary accounts used for deception, votestacking, creating an illusion of greater support, constitute a major and blockable violation. Well, just as common sense dictates. Few people are inclined to excuse even the greenest newbie for doing something like that. See the official policy at <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a>. Hope this helps. Did you want to throw the book at some talkpage spammer? Can't do that if it's got sharp edges, sorry.&#160;;-)</dd>

<p>To me, it's all about deception. Deceiving voters is blockable. Just calling on friends is irrelevant, especially if the friends are clueless. It only takes one substantial set of objections, after all, and it's easy to object to nearly any article. When a number of previously unheard of voters show up at FAC, a great many folks start <i>looking</i> for flaws to object to. That's a different class of offense from lying, and I disagree with the page on sockpuppets: I think they should all be blocked, without exception, that there is no excuse for them whatever. I'm kind of Catonian, though. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:47, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is going on with HW is a perfect example of poor handling of a situation. I don't pin all the blame on you, because HW has been very melodramatic and hostile, but surely you recognize that there was no good reason for this have come out the way it has. Don't you think she's a good editor? No one can deny such excellent content contributions, suspicions of sockpuppeting or not. An admin has to be able to think, when taking action in a case like this, what is best for the project? Majora's Mask needed to go to a revote, and all the suspected accounts needed to be lumped together as one for any future voting purposes, but that was <i>all that needed to be done</i>. We don't do away with good editors just because they get on our nerves.

<dd>Since you ask, no, I don't think she's a good editor. (Heck, I rather doubt she's even a she.) I think this may be a student of the real Courtni Wilerding, 24, English teacher in Toronto; I cannot believe an English teacher wrote the post above, which is neither better nor worse than her usual article style. Look at it, James. "I would consider you look back"? "This yeilds the fact that you've over-abused your sysop powers"? "Miserable like what you've demonstrated"? "You failed to communicate that"? A teacher? Heck, I can barely believe she's a native speaker. I looked at her articles when they were on FAC, and, no, I don't think their style was noticeably better than how she writes on my page; it certainly wasn't when she put in a new edit, before somebody else got to "copyedit" it. It wasn't just a matter of grammar and vocabulary, either, but the structure was bad on every level--inexpressive, unclear, illogical. I was all set to help out, I often do on FAC, and pre-FAC, even with articles where the content isn't interesting to me. (I just copyedited <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html" title="Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> a few days ago, on request.) But the way she spat at any criticism put me completely off the idea of trying to work with her. As for somebody needing to remaining to write articles, I think HW is exactly the kind of problem editor that's likely to make others—good contributors—leave the project in frustration.</dd>

<dd>Well, I won't make any guesses about the identity or sex of the user or anything like that. Normally I figure it's best to just take people at their word, unless they're somehow doing harm by assuming an identity. She could just be an elementary school English teacher, anyway, or maybe she just isn't a stickler about her English when she's not at work. I'm not too worried about any of that. My basic point is that Hollow (and Winnermario, claimed to be her predecessor account) has added a great deal of content to Wikipedia, got one article indisputably up to FA status (Cool) and raised several others to very high levels of quality. And she was working at an impressively fast pace, too, I should note. And I'm not at all convinced by the "driving other editors away" logic. You could justify a lot with that argument, if you wanted to. I don't know who these saintly editors are, impeccably polite and thin-skinned but as hard working as Hollow, that she is keeping at bay. I think you take what you can get, more or less.

<dd>James, do you have diffs for any of these great edits? I looked for some good editing during her RfA but couldn't find any. The edits she made to the FA were all minor (so far as I can see, but I haven't checked every single one), including edits like "Cool peaked within the top twenty ... on the ... charts on which it charted ..." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=28755794&amp;oldid=28658619" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cool_%28song%29&amp;diff=28755794&amp;oldid=28658619" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> Her work that I have seen was not good and her behavior was appalling. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was under the impression she pretty much wrote those articles on the Gwen singles. If she was just making minor edits, who was doing the major work?

<dd>What bothers me is the lying. I didn't read 'her' FA's, as I'm no fan of pop song articles under the best of circumstances (you may recall that I didn't agree with an article on "Hard Day's Night," much less an FA on a pop song). Since I don't agree with the <i>inclusion</i> of pop song articles, I certainly wasn't going to vote on FAC's on pop songs, but we can't assume good faith when someone <i>demonstrates</i>, and very clearly, that his intention is to deceive and to get his way in spite of the community's point of view. That is abuse. I feel the same way when it's an admin going around procedure and when it's a sock puppet and when it's a "Oh, that wasn't me: my cousin got my password and used my computer" and when it's a block evasion. The quality of the person's contributions is irrelevant, because lying and abuse and childish demands to get one's way is too high a price to pay for <i>any</i> edits of <i>any</i> quality. There are tens of thousands of editors out there who can write coherent English about pop culture, but this one user is going to sap our time and energy trying to find out what is true and what a reflection?

<p>According to Hollow, she, Winnermario and her brother, use the same computer. They all have their personal Wiki accounts. You say they are suckpuppets because all of their accounts lead to the same IP, but if what they say is true, then they are no suckpuppets. Is that correct? My question: is it against Wiki policy for people to use the same computer and use their own personal Wiki accounts, as Hollow claimed to do? Someone else who might be using Wiki, could log into their account from my computer and start editing. Could you then accuse us for being suckpuppets? What if someone edits from a public computer, such as one from a library, where others might have used it to access their Wiki account?</p>
<p>Well, I'm really not asking for your personal opinion, but for the Wiki policy. You don't seem to have any concrete evidence that they are suckpuppets, other than their IP being the same - which, in my opinion, is not evidence enough. It can only work as a lead. I also disagree with you when you said that she's not a good editor.

<dd>Winnermario and Hollow Wilerding share the same writing style and contribute to the same set of articles. What's more, it you check their histories, Hollow Wilerding was created and immediately started editing like wildfire <i>the very same day</i> Winnermario stopped: Nov 5, 2005. What else happened Nov 5, 2005? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AWinnermario" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AWinnermario" rel="nofollow">Winnermario was blocked</a> for incivility and personal attacks.

<dd>DrippingInk is a more circumstantial case, since they don't have that telltale one-stops-and-the-other-starts moment.

<dd>Policy-wise, people sharing a computer is allowed, but once a circumstantial case is made that they are sockpuppets (or meat puppets), the checkuser can clinch it.

<p>Hello. I have just registered an account on Wikipedia. I was searching for an administrator to help me become familiar with Wikipedia, and stumbled upon you, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>. In regard to the blocks of <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">DrippingInk</a>, Hollow Wilerding, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinnermario_90f7.html" title="User:Winnermario">Winnermario</a>, I must make it clear that the operators of these accounts was... questionable. You see, I was introduced merely <i>yesterday</i> (January 2, 2006) to Wikipedia. The woman known as Hollow Wilerding presented me with her computer as a late Christmas gift as she is ordering a new computer. It might be in your personal interest to know that these three accounts have not been operated by three separate people; these accounts have been operated by <i>two</i> people. William Wilerding owned the DrippingInk account, while Mariah Wilerding owned the Winnermario account, and the reincarnation of Hollow Wilerding. Blocking these users was certainly the best decision that any administrator could make — they are deceitful people with terrible attitudes. Also, they are very clueless when it comes to English, which is a shame considering Mariah is an English teacher. I, Cruz Nelson, served as an English student of Mariah's from 2004–2005. I must admit that it was like living in hell; I have no idea how she was capable of receiving her graduate diploma. All in all, I have come to announce that she literally gave me her computer in an attempt to return to Wikipedia under a new IP address. Although some of their contributions, namely <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cool_%28song%29.html" title="Cool (song)">Cool (song)</a> were generous and positive, overall these two siblings are not going to go far in life. Please understand what I am saying.</p>
<p>I must place emphasis on the fact that I, Cruz Nelson, am now operating the computer of a former Wikipedian Hollow Wilerding. The IP address, or from what I was explained to by Mariah, will be very identical. I would like to take this time to come out in the open, unlike Mariah and William, and announce that this computer is being operated by one user, and one user only. If I am having issues with anything related to Wikipedia, I will contact you <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a>.

<dd>Ok, so I may not be the brightest penny in the IT network administrator tray, but the computer doesn't carry the IP address, last time I checked. The ISP allocates the IP address, in the case of static IP's, and it's going to give a new IP address to a new account holder (at the ISP). The only way it's going to be the same IP is if it's the same telco address/provider address (provider account). A dynamic IP is going to be...dynamic. No one can see what computer you're using (unless they're also virus writers and plant trojans and things like that), so no one cares. Congratulations on the free computer, but there really shouldn't be an issue, unless you have the same IP. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A sock puppet of myself? Every single other account Cruz and I edited under are <i>blocked</i>. We cannot access them anymore. Therefore, this account is <i>not</i> a sock puppet because there are no other accounts that we possess entry to. The administrators had better start learning the difference between the words "main account" and "sock puppet". This is <i>my</i> main account and Cruz no longer edits on Wikipedia. That means I am not a sock puppet of myself. So, since we did not do anything wrong on Wikipedia, we are obligied to edit whenever we feel like. A surprise is in store for you people, actually — <i>a good surprise</i>. Kind of insane of me considering you are demanding that I never return to Wikipedia.

<dd>Bishonen, it dropped like a stone because all of this is <i>supposed</i> to be taken care of.

<dd>Well, for example, there is a description of, I believe, feminine onanism, and, as Cleland is having Fanny describe this, she quotes Horace. I have never seen Horace <i>there</i> before or since. (Kidding aside, Cleland somewhat invents (as much as there is ever an inventor for anything in pornography) the picaresque porn, where a poor girl is abused, discovers that she rather enjoys it, and, eyes (among other things) wide, goes on to see what <i>else</i> she can discover. As a pornographic <i>novel</i> (as opposed to just a bit of paper thrill), as a marriage of the 18th c. girl-in-distress-goes-bad with the male fantasy of male libido in female body, and as a well written (sentence level; variation of verbs, care with description, balance of figurative with literal language), it's a good novel and a notable achievement.) (Of course, there were so many other novels carrying the same formula that appeared so close to the same time that "innovation" is probably the last feature to credit.) (And, of course, Defoe's <i><a href="../../../m/o/l/Moll_Flanders_e20f.html" title="Moll Flanders">Moll Flanders</a></i> is <b>this</b> close to <i>Fanny Hill</i> -- just lacks the pornographic sex scenes and has a repentence (sort of) -- that Cleland is possibly only making explicit what had been enjoyed in fantasy before.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:00, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just reread the first chapter. (Yes, the pains I undergo for scholarship!) The Horace comes in a description of the "jade" who is ravishing Fanny in lesbian sex. Specifically, Fanny refers to pubic hair, "which Nature intended for usefulness as well as pleasure." That <i>utile et dulce</i> is from Horace's <i>Ars Poetica.</i> (What Cleland <i>does</i> know about female sexuality is equally surprising with what he <i>doesn't</i> know about it.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:11, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, Bishonen! (Remember Bishonen? This is her talk page.) When I re-read the first bit of <i>Fanny Hill</i> earlier, I noticed an explicit reference to <i>Pamela,</i> as Fanny is induced to go to London by a village girl who was a servant there and who told her of a famous girl who, by keeping her virginity, got to marry the lord and become a lady, complete with nice clothes and horses. I've ordered a new copy of it, as my present copy is a ratty tatty Signet Classic edition, but my present edition, for being on pulp paper, does have an introduction by J.H. Plumb from 1965. I'm sure <i>someone</i> has written scholarly work on the book.

<dd>Of course not. I'm slow, that's all. I've read what you wrote to HW. I don't think it matters if I ever mention her again or not; I can't believe the rest of the community would drop this in any case. But no, I'm afraid I'm not willing to do what you ask. I could not muster any faith in HW actually doing what you suggest, after what's been going down, even if she <i>seemed</i> to do it or said she was doing it. Have you really researched this case? For instance, the early stages of it? HW was never a bona fide user. She was a sock created in November 2005 to evade the (richly earned) block of Winnermario. James, I 'm not happy about the way you encourage HW to think of herself as a victim of my "very bad approach", or your telling her she's been, for God's sake, "wronged"—by me, of course, since it's me she so understandably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=33782999&amp;oldid=33782910" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&amp;diff=33782999&amp;oldid=33782910" rel="nofollow">"counterattacks"</a>. I dislike especially the way, in your message to her, you dismiss my critique of her contributions as yet another outflow of my unreasonable malice, after you didn't bother to respond to me about it at all. I'm altogether sorry you speak of me with so little respect. If you have more to say about my hounding HW off the wiki, how about telling the community?

<dd>Because I believe HW, or whatever name she wants to go under, is a very good editor, which is far more important to me than the personality issues that seem to be prevailing here. Maybe HW has now gotten too upset to ever attempt what I suggested to her, so the question may be academic, but I find it incredibly disappointing that the situation has been handled this way, and that Bish won't even consider that little bit of moderation I asked of her. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:49, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>User:Peter Isotalo keeps placing a vowel chart in <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_language.html" title="Bulgarian language">Bulgarian language</a>, which has nothing to do with the Bulgarian language. The Bulgarian language has six vowel phonemes (+ 4 allophones, in all 10), the chart has 8 vowels - which are all supposed to be phonemes. I have included one of the sources which I have used during writing the article (the English one), later today it will be followed by the Bulgarian one, which is the latest edition on the Bulgarian language by the Bulgarian Academy of Science. Both sources confirm what I say whereas the vowel chart (which is completely wrong) has an unknown origin as it has not been made by the user who keeps putting it in. I have reverted again the article because the vowel chart is wrong, on top of it, it has an unknown origin. You can re-block me again but sooner or later I'll get de-blocked and there are also other administrators to contact, and I'll pursue my case until the vowel chart gets expunged from the article or gets corrected accordingly.

<p>Ok, since this place is such a hopping joint perhaps you, Bish, or someone else may have something to say on this. I've been considering merging <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playwright.html" title="Playwright">playwright</a> into <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play.html" title="Play">play</a>. To me it makes sense to make this move as there isn't anything in playwright (besides the etymology of the term playwright) that wouldn't be repeated in play or perhaps under another topic like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_theatre.html" title="History of theatre">History of theatre</a>. I left a note about this on the talk page of playwright but I haven't recieved a response. Anyone have a sage opinion on this? Thanks! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 15:21, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I would favor leaving them separate, because there is content that <i>should</i> be on playwright that isn't. When someone does have the long view necessary to add that information, the two would need to be split again. What I'm thinking of is, in fact, what I cannot do, quite. I can <i>see</i> what needs to be said, but, if I said it, it would be fuzzy. Some things that need to be said: playwright as priest (Greece, where tragedy and satyr are both part of religious ceremonies and where the subject matter was the equivalent of what for us would be a Bible movie, as these were their holy texts; then to the fearful medieval passion play, where the playwright is anonymous as an act of devotion and humility; playwright as irresponsible intruder upon holy work in the reactions to the emergence of the professional playwright in England in the Elizabethan era); playwright as profession (emergence from actors needing scripts in the Elizabethan era, when playwrights were expected to be directors; development of the "dramatic poet" and Dryden's idea of a playwright who is an epic poet; producer playwright in the 18th c. (see <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_drama.html" title="Augustan drama">Augustan drama</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectacle.html" title="Spectacle">spectacle</a>), where the producer writes or hires whatever trash will put butts in the seats; playwright as professional reformer at the end of the 19th c. and the muckraking/naturalist/realist playwrights who see themselves as priests again, but this time as saviors of their nations and prophets denouncing hypocrisy; playwright as commercial profession in the 20th c., where the playwright is provocative as needed to get a payday); playwright as a specialized profession (divorced from the "poet" and the novelist and the screenwriter); playwriting as co-opted by film. Again: I can offer this outline and suggest that each roman numeral in it needs subheads, but I can't do it and be responsible. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:26, 4 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, damn, and Roman playwrights, who follow <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menander.html" title="Menander">Menander</a> and other late Hellenistic writers, who might represent the first non-priestly/non-religious play writing, as they allow themselves to endlessly reproduce the Greek tragedies and to move a <i>bit</i> away from religious celebration in their own plays. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:28, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Dam the damn: By "late Hellenistic writers" I don't just mean Menander, but all those playwrights who took their cue from <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophrastus.html" title="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> and developed "character" comedies. Some of those comedies are kind of dramatic (but they still couldn't be too dramatic, because Tragedy was still holy-only), but it sets the place for the Roman authors to write without the Olympiad and festival of Dionysus. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:37, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, hi there, Saravask. Yes, I saw your edit at FARC, nice job! Some 8 or 10 people, mostly arbitrators, have <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser" rel="nofollow">CheckUser</a> rights, that is, they're allowed to check for sock puppets. They can only do this as the clinching proof, in cases where there is already strong circumstantial evidence of sockpuppetry. Any user who has such proof can request a CheckUser check. Formally, you're supposed to put the request on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration</a>--I can't tell on what part of the rather long page--and anyway, I suggest instead putting a note on <a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">User talk:Kelly Martin</a>. Kelly knows the background to the case, and so will need less explanation. She's also very expert with such things, which they aren't all (ahem). Please check out Kelly Martin's "outside view" on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Bishonen_2b11.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen</a>; you will find it a helpful account of the Hollow Wilerding checking she has done at my request, and of what it takes for a check to be allowable under the CheckUser rules. It's good if you put an informative heading and edit summary on your note on her page--in fact, "CheckUser request" or something like that—and if you lay out your rationale for suspecting these IPs. Btw, do you IRC? Because an even better and quicker way would be to talk directly with Kelly Martin on <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/wikipedia" class="external text" title="irc://chat.freenode.net/wikipedia" rel="nofollow">#Wikipedia</a>, she's there most of the time (to put it mildly).

<dd>Thanks, but I'm not bothering any more. Blocking the IPs shouldn't be done for longer than 8 hours at a stretch, and will carry risks of collateral damage in any case. The range is too big for even a short range block, and it's obviously simpler for her to hop to a new IP, now that she's got the hang of that, than to for me to block, write a block reason, put a template on the userpage, protect the userpage (because she messes with them if I don't) etc. The whole idea of blocking people with dynamic IPs is a joke. What difference does it make, anyway? See 64.231.75.102 chatting away on Everyking's page?

<dd>"Legal lawsuits" are easily the second-worst kind of lawsuit there is! I plan to keep up blocking on sight.

<dd>Well, I didn't pull the 8 hours out of my you know what; it was Kelly Martin's recommendation, after she'd studied the first IP to appear, the one used for posting on ANI. Maybe it was to do with the size of that specific range (it's huge, apparently)?

<p>Let me point out to you that you have absolutely no credibility with me and with others I know. The fact that you saw fit to intervene in a scenario in which you are clearly closer to one person than another indicates a basic misunderstanding of the notion of conflict of interest.

<p>I have restarted the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strindberg.html" title="Strindberg">Strindberg</a> bio with childhood and education, but haven't gotten much farther than that. Life and work interacts a great deal, but one probably needs to separate them in the article, just referring back and forth between the parts whenever necessary. The amount of stuff written on Strindberg is overwhelming. Make a <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> search and you will find a couple of review articles by Alrik Gustafsson from about 1950, covering about a dozen major works published during the years after the war alone (including the biography by Lamm).</p>
<p>BTW, I had no idea until yesterday that Frida Uhl later started a cabaret club in London and was known for firing guns inside luxury restaurants. There are a few references to her as "Madame Strindberg" in the <a href="../../../o/d/n/ODNB_ace9.html" title="ODNB">ODNB</a>, as some important English artists worked on the decorations. (She is also called the "widow of the playwright" in one place, which seems odd considering they had been divorced for years at the time. I made a general search for "Strindberg". The article on the publisher Duckworth seems to claim that the Strindberg's <i>The Father</i>, which D. published in English translation, was called <i>Der Fater</i> in the original language. I'm happy that the moronic proposal to ban non-English references was unsuccessful.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 12:13, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it doesn't seem as if she was into porn modeling (but I wouldn't be surprised), just promiscuity, stalking and gun toting. From a review article in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>:
<dl>
<dd><i>Frida bolted to London, where she somehow managed to set herself up as an art dealer. Before long, she was toting her gun again, stalking the painter Augustus John. At the same time, she opened a German-style cabaret theater, the Cave of the Golden Calf, decorated by Wyndham Lewis, Spencer Gore and Charles Ginner. Ezra Pound dropped by and complimented the enterprising Mrs. Strindberg: "More brains than Gertie or Amy put together."</i></dd>

<p>Your block of HW went through no process, so it isn't like an ArbCom ban where you could revert on sight. This is getting to the point where I feel like I'm going to have to intervene and unblock her myself. We have a great editor prevented from creating more feature-quality articles because of all this foolishness. The whole point of Wikipedia is being defeated here. Please, I ask you, let's agree on some terms so that she can return to editing, and then we will see if she'll agree to those terms.

<dd>James, you're moving into harrassment country here. If you'd ever engaged with, or, heck, seemed to notice, <i>my</i> arguments, I'd have been happy to dialogue with you, but you never have. I've already asked you to take your campaign elsewhere. Why you won't take it to the community on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Bishonen_2b11.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Bishonen</a>, as I've suggested, is simply beyond me; do you really think "this foolishness" consists of me on a personal vendetta against an editor because (as she puts it) I don't <i>like</i> her? Did you click on the RFC and see what other people think? As for not reverting on sight, you don't seem to be getting what "blocked" means, any more than HW does. It means you <i>don't get to edit</i>. It doesn't mean "you only get to edit appropriately". Various injunctions mean that. "Blocked" does not. Oh, and "my" block of HW went through no process? What block is that? If you have even the slightest interest in my (extremely moderate) blocking of HW, you can read an account of it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34007621" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Bishonen&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34007621" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>Beyond which, if Everyking were to undo Snowspinner's block at this point, he would be enabling a fifth or sixth account for the user who was <i>formerly</i> editing under that name. If he had investigated, he'd know that "she" evaded the block, evaded the next block, evaded the next one, and is continuing to attempt to evade blocks. Not much point in lifting one of them, when all that would do is multiply the accounts this user is employing unnecessarily. These are crocodile tears. Whatever happened with the first block (which was a block of Winnermario), block evasion is reason for a block, and the user known as Winnermario evaded that block to become Hollow Wiledering. I.e. whatever anyone thought about the reason for blocking HW at that particular time, once it became clear that HW was Winnermario, there was a reason for an indefinite block. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

Are you by any chance ashamed of letting a wider audience see how ignorantly you speak of this case, or how cavalierly of me? I've requested an injunction against your posting any more on this page.

<p>I disagree, Bish. He's system gaming and boundary testing, as he always does.

The only way to deal with this is to tell him what the limits are, and what the response will be for trangressions, and then to stick very rigidly to those responses and not to waver no matter what he says. In the end, allowing him to manipulate us is very, very bad for him, apart from anything else, and there's also no reason Snowspinner should have to tolerate this constant sniping from the sidelines month and month. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:02, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Snowspinner is hardly a white-robed victim, either, you know. If someone were going to be a victim of a high handed admin, being a victim of Snowspinner is more credible than of Bishonen.

<p>Slim, the reason I don't see it quite the same way isn't especially flattering to EK. I feel very targeted by his campaign. It looks to me like you're giving him too much credit: after all, EK is notorious not only for attacking Snowspinner, but also for failing to inform himself and criticizing other admins' actions without knowing what he's talking about. The ArbCom enjoined him to leave Snowspinner alone, but it <i>also</i> enjoined him to do some research, already, before he opines about "admin abuse". Me, I think it was <i>that</i> ruling that he violated (and might just as well have been blocked for): he was lazy, he didn't click on any links, he didn't look at the RFC although I kept asking him to, and I'll bet you good money he didn't bother to look at the block log. You think he did a lot of research, I think he (infuriatingly) did none, and neither of us is in his head, so... Anyway, I realize I'm being thin-skinned about the whole thing. I'm finding the combination of being got at, and the other person <i>not apparently hearing anything you say</i>, peculiarly aggravating. But you've had to deal with a lot worse, from your friends R*****d*** and F***W**** and other delightful, uh, contributors.

<dd>REMOVE IT, and I will leave for TEN WEEKS. Following these ten weeks, I will return and attempt to compromise. Two and a half months is a good deal, so please take it.64.231.128.150 22:04, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, go away. How many times have you said you're not going to post on my page again? I'm not likely to believe anything you say, am I? Take it to the community. You know how to post at WP:ANI. I doubt that they'll make any "deal" with you, but you can try. I know you find this hard to believe, but you're actually <b>nothing to do with me</b>. I don't hate you, I don't persecute you, I don't have a vendetta against you; I just perform normal, and very uncontroversial, admin actions against your disruption. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do, thanks, Sean. I can't believe he did that without consulting me, after the comments by me and others on the talkpage. For one thing, I've exhorted Everyking to take his beef there—not that he's shown any sign of doing it so far. But I'd rather not give him any excuse for posting on <i>this</i> page again (see "Hollow 2" above). For another, it's a record of the way she acts, the ArbCom may want it. And thirdly, there are still some cookies left. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bish, I was about to post to ask what you wanted done with your RfC, as I was about to delete it. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_Bishonen_19c3.html#Certified.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Bishonen">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Bishonen#Certified.3F</a>. I see you want it kept and presumably also archived? I may semi-protect it to stop HW posting to it, unless you want her to be able to. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:58, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. I'm not especially against her posting <i>there</i>, I just think she should be prevented from posting at all (she's b-l-o-c-k-e-d!), though with such nimble IP's, keeping her off the air is a bit of a hollow (geddit?) pretence anyway. The main thing for me was really James being able to post there, and other people seeing what he posted. Not that I suppose he can <i>really</i> believe that I'm trying to prevent my original block from being discussed, when the discussion so far has brought me so much delicious baked goods... oh, what the hell, who am I kidding, I've been telling James to post there for days on end, he obviously doesn't care to. Please archive it, Slim, with those discouraging texts about not modifying it top and bottom, if you will, and the talkpage too. The whole thing deserves preserving, if only for being the most Mickey Mouse RFC in history, with all those bits of the template falling off. (As far as mere content, some of Rangerdude's and FuelWagon's are strong contenders, admittedly—you win!&#160;;-P) I don't think it needs to be protected, unless there's some sort of storm of new comments; I'll revert any new additions that I see.

<dd>I should probably offer an apology then.

<dd>Oh, did she, and did you? That's fine, Graeme, thanks. (Feel free to add <i>this</i> page to your watchlist, hint, hint—see the red box above?) I was actually thinking of listing it myself, it was in such an absurd halfway state. It's moot now, anyway, as it's getting archived. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:25, 7 January 2006 (UTC).
