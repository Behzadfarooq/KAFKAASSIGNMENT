<ol>
<li>Can't the bishops in the Eastern Orthodox church also trace their ministries back to the apostles via apostolic succession?</li>
<li>Don't Lutherans also have bishops?</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>, yep, but the usage "Catholic" to mean "World Wide" as opposed to "Roman Catholic" covers them, too (we have remarkably few Orthodox-oriented articles so far).</li>
<li>, yep to that, too, but they do not, with the exception of the Swedish Lutheran Church, I think, have apostolic succession. In the 17th century particularly many more protestantly inclined Anglican and Lutheran bishops refused to be ordained using the correct form (they used invalid liturgies), and in some cases were not ordained by bishops. Thus their lines are 'interrupted.' The problem of Anglican orders is much more than just 'transubstantiation' - there are a lot of problematic ordinations in there, and back in the heyday of the Anglo-Catholic movement there was a lot of research done to figure out if anyone could say generally if apostolic succession had been preserved. This discontinuity between Lutherans and Anglicans is one serious roadblock to their moves toward cooperation.</li>
<li>- the Methodists have bishops, too, but have never pretended to apostolic succession. --MichaelTinkler</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>I'm not happy with the first sentence, but want to make clear that a bishop is a person, not an order.

<dd>Actually, it can be both. As you point out, a person is a bishop. In Catholicism, and I believe Orthodoxy, a person is ordained (consecrated) to the Order of Bishops. Dave</dd>

<dd>They say that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were ordained to the priesthood and to apostleship by heavenly messengers in 1829.

<dd>Ok. I think that this notion of apostolic succession needs to be distinguished from the apostolic succession as used by Catholic and Orthodox. The key difference is that the LDS apparently believes in a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Apostasy_abfd.html" title="Great Apostasy">Great Apostasy</a> that made this restoration of authority necessary, while the Catholic and Orthodox maintain that no such apostasy took place, and therefore claim historical continuity from human to human, which the LDS apparently does not. This additional information probably needs to be added to the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_succession.html" title="Apostolic succession">apostolic succession</a> page as well. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 20:12 Nov 22, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to say I found the beginning of this article to be a beautiful example of NPOV. I'm a member of a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ_acd4.html" title="Church of Christ">Church of Christ</a> that believes in doing things exactly the way as described in the New Testament. I approached this article with fear, figuring I would see only modern definitions of bishop. I was really impressed with the section about bishops in the New Testament. It very accurately described what we do, and I feel it did a great job being NPOV about it; there didn't seem to be any value judgments at all toward the different ways that churches define bishop. I especially appreciated the delicate way the article stated that it is possible to read the New Testament as applying bishop, pastor, and elder to the same office, because we do indeed take it that way.</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain that all archbishops that head ecclesiastical provinces in those churches also hold the title <i>metropolitan</i>. All Roman Catholic bishops do, and the term metropolitan comes from the Eastern churches, which draw a distinction between an archbishop and a metropolitan archbishop. The only group I am uncertain of is Anglican churches, although the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> is the metropolitan bishop of his ecclesiastical province. Are there Anglican bishops that function like metropolitans but do not take the title metropolitan? <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmadrid_e3d7.html" title="User:Pmadrid">Pmadrid</a> 22:58, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Church_in_America_0e1d.html" title="Orthodox Church in America">Orthodox Church in America</a>, we continue to distinguish between metropolitan and archbishop. We have just one metropolitan: I believe Metropolitan Herman's full title is "The Most Blessed HERMAN, Archbishop of Washington and Metropolitan of All America and Canada. We have several archbishops who serve various cities and dioceses throughout the U.S. and Canada, while other dioceses are served by bishops. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 03:55, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a problem with the usage of these terms in this article. Technically speaking the Roman Catholic Church and the so-called Latin Catholic Church are the same. Rome is a Latin city. The Eastern Catholic Churches (in communion with Rome) do not refer to themselves as Roman Catholic. Rome is specifically western (Latin). It does not mean in communion with Rome. Please see the website <a href="http://www.east2west.org" class="external free" title="http://www.east2west.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.east2west.org</a> for an explanation of Eastern Catholic churches, and their relationship to their sister church, the Roman Catholic Church, all of which, together, form "the Catholic Church", under the authority of the successor of St. Peter, the Bishop of Rome.

<p>There is a large amount of reference to Suffragan Bishops, but there is no article, I feel there should be perhaps a small seperate article, explaining exactly what one is - and perhaps a small list of notable ones. Ideas? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthropax_beb2.html" title="User:Anthropax">Anthropax</a> 15:19, 5 February 2006 (UTC) I think we shouls ad a section on how the bishops came about. There is evidence that since, in the bible, there is little instruction on how to govern the church, that Christians took there "catse system" from the Roman government.</p>

<dd>I would strongly discourage merging this with bishops, but would rather encourage it to be deleted all together, at least under this title. "Valid" requires that some be "invalid", and although I believe that there are "invalid" bishops, they aren't those covered in this article; I'd suggest that the "invalid" bishops are those pastors who decide to tack "Bishop" in front of their names.

<p>Joseph, from a Roman Catholic and some Anglo-Catholic perspectives, an "invalid" bishop could also be, say, a Methodist bishop.</p>

<p>I infer from other articles in wikipedia that it was once (early middle ages) considered a serious crime for a bishop to leave his diocese to take up the episcopacy of another. I believe that a recently deceased pope was once condemned for doing this and for approving the practice in others. Obviously, this view is no longer followed in the Catholic church; bishops who do well in a small diocese are routinely "promoted" to a larger one. What changed? How and when did the change take place? <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 15:47, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nothing changed. It has always been possible for a bishop to transfer (if elected by another diocese) with the blessing of the synod to which he is subject. What he may not do is transfer on his own authority, without such a blessing. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 20:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe you may be talking about "pluralism," not in the sense of many ideas, but in the canonical sense of holding more than one job at a time. It was common in the Middle Ages for a bishop to hold more than one diocese at a time, and thus collect numerous salaries/have possession of numerous endowment funds/own numerous estates. This was made a crime by the Catholic Church a number of times, but was definitively cracked down upon by the Council of Trent.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvardOxon_da84.html" title="User:HarvardOxon">HarvardOxon</a> 01:21, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had assumed he was asking about the matter addressed by Canon XV of the First Council of Nicaea. <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.vi.xxii.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.vi.xxii.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 02:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, with the rise of a centralized administration in Rome, and more organized canonical bureaucracy, the Nicaea issue gave way to excardination as a matter of course, and translation of bishops at the direction of the bishop of Rome. I'm confused by his post, as translation of prelates and excardination of other clergy has been happily practices for centuries, Nicea isn't quite "early Middle Ages," and I don't know of a "recently deceased pope" who was accused either of pluralism or violating Nicaea.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvardOxon_da84.html" title="User:HarvardOxon">HarvardOxon</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect that HarvardOxon may be right. My confusion was over the charges brought against Stephan and Formosus as described in the article on the <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadaver_Synod_c26e.html" title="Cadaver Synod">Cadaver Synod</a>. <a href="../../../r/w/f/User%7ERwflammang_906f.html" title="User:Rwflammang">Rwflammang</a> 16:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It may be little more complicated. The prohibition is based on the "husband of one wife" passage in Timothy, interpreted as the bishop taking his diocese as spouse. In the Western church, for the case of bishops other than the Bishop of Rome, dispensation was always possible for those who recognized his authority. To what extent his authority needed to be confirmed by a synod remained disputable, and very much disputed--translations during the middle ages led to long-standing conflicts. The practical importance increased with the rise of archbishoprics, because an archbishop is the bishop of his city, and without dispensation a bishop could not be promoted to an archbishop. How and when this changed is worth some checking, which I'll do if I can.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the case of the Bishop of Rome, there was nobody to dispense him. The only body with possible authority over a pope was a General Council, and these were called on rare occasions to resolve stalemates. For much of the Middle ages, the Pope was therefore selected from someone other than a bishop elsewhere--as can be seen in the articles here on the various popes. Some were abbots. Most, in the early middle ages, were members of the Roman clergy, and there were a number of offices among them from whom bishops were often chosen. Again see the bios, which are ultimately based on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liber_Pontificalis_691a.html" title="Liber Pontificalis">Liber Pontificalis</a>. Again, it would be interesting to see how that changed. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The most conspicuous omission from this article is a mention of European Protestant churches alongside the American Lutheran church. Can someone fill in about, for example, the Church of Sweden, which I think is a Lutheran church with bishops? 193.63.239.165 10:16, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
