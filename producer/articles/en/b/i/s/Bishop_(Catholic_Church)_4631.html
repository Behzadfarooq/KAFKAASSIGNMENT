<p><i>Bishop</i> comes from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word <i>episkopos</i> (επίσκοπος, from επι "over" and σκοπος "seeing"). It can be generally translated <i>bishop</i>, <i>overseer</i>, <i>superintendent</i>, <i>supervisor</i>, <i>the first</i>, <i>leader</i> or <i>foreman</i>. From the word <i>episkopos</i> are derived the English words <i>episcopacy</i>, <i>episcopate</i> and <i>episcopal</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Bishops_in_the_New_Testament" id="Bishops_in_the_New_Testament"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_%28Catholic_Church%29_4631.html" title="Edit section: Bishops in the New Testament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bishops in the New Testament</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> uses the word <i>episkopos</i> five times.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a> 20:28</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Philippians_f81f.html" title="Epistle to the Philippians">Epistle to the Philippians</a> 1:1</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_Timothy_77fe.html" title="First Epistle to Timothy">First Epistle to Timothy</a> 3:2</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Titus_f38a.html" title="Epistle to Titus">Epistle to Titus</a> 1:7</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_of_Peter_355c.html" title="First Epistle of Peter">First Epistle of Peter</a> 2:25</li>
</ul>
<p>Words related to <i>episkopos</i> are used in two other verses. Some English Bibles translate this word as <i>bishop</i> (<a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">KJV</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Standard_Version_3dd6.html" title="Revised Standard Version">RSV</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Revised_Standard_Version_bdd6.html" title="New Revised Standard Version">NRSV</a>, etc.), while others, attempting to distance themselves from certain types of church <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, use an alternative such as "overseer" (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_International_Version_2847.html" title="New International Version">NIV</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Standard_Version_18a4.html" title="English Standard Version">ESV</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>The ministry of these <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> <i>episkopoi</i>, according to some writers, was not explicitly commissioned by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> as far as the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospels</a> tell, but appears to be a natural, practical development of the church of the apostles during the first and second centuries AD. Others maintain that the episcopal structure of the Church was present from the beginning, being a direct institution by Jesus, referring to the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">apostles</a> who clearly lead the first local churches, governed and laid on hands. Supporting this latter view, the portions of the New Testament that mention <i>episkopoi</i> do not appear to be ordering a new type of ministry, but giving instructions for an already existing position within the early Church. In places (particularly in the verses from the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Titus_f38a.html" title="Epistle to Titus">Epistle to Titus</a>) it appears that the position of <i>episkopos</i> is often similar or the same as that of <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyter</a></i> (<i>πρεσβυτερος</i>), or <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_%28religious%29.html" title="Elder (religious)">elder</a> and (or) <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>. The Epistle to Timothy mentions <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacons</a> (<i>διακονοι</i>) in a manner that suggests that the office of deacon differs from the office of the bishop, and is subordinate to it, though it carries similar qualifications.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, episkopoi are mentioned as being <i>shepherds</i> of the <i>flock</i>, imagery that is still in use today. The other passages from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> describe them as stewards, leaders or administrators, and teachers. In <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_Timothy_77fe.html" title="First Epistle to Timothy">1 Timothy</a> episkopoi are required to be 'the husband of but one wife'. Thus, it is clear that the New Testament has no prohibition against bishops being married and already having children. The most famous example of this is the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Apostle Peter</a> himself, who was married and had children. It remains unclear however, whether a kind of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a> or abstinence had to be practiced by these first bishops and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">apostles</a> after their appointment or <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Orders_63e3.html" title="Holy Orders">episcopal consecration</a> (see also <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_celibacy.html" title="Clerical celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in the second chapter of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_of_Peter_355c.html" title="First Epistle of Peter">1 Peter</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> is described as 'the Shepherd and <i>Episkopos</i> of your souls' (<i>τον ποιμενα και επισκοπον των ψυχων υμων</i>).</p>

<p>At the turn of the first century AD, the church started to acquire a clear organisation. In the works of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Fathers_b839.html" title="Apostolic Fathers">Apostolic Fathers</a>, and <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Antioch_9e29.html" title="Ignatius of Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a> in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Plainly therefore we ought to regard the bishop as the Lord Himself"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians 6:1.<br />
<i>"your godly bishop"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 2:1.<br />
<i>"the bishop presiding after the likeness of God and the presbyters after the likeness of the council of the Apostles, with the deacons also who are most dear to me, having been entrusted with the diaconate of Jesus Christ"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 6:1.<br />
<i>"Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him], either by Himself or by the Apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and the presbyters."</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 7:1.<br />
<i>"Be obedient to the bishop and to one another, as Jesus Christ was to the Father [according to the flesh], and as the Apostles were to Christ and to the Father, that there may be union both of flesh and of spirit."</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 13:2.<br />
<i>"In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a church."</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians 3:1.<br />
<i>"follow your bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the Father, and the presbytery as the Apostles; and to the deacons pay respect, as to God's commandment"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 8:1.<br />
<i>"He that honoureth the bishop is honoured of God; he that doeth aught without the knowledge of the bishop rendereth service to the devil"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 9:1.<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:right">— Lightfoot translation.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that, by this period, a single bishop was expected to lead the church in each centre of Christian mission, supported by a council of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyters</a> (now a distinct and subordinate position) with a pool of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacons</a>. As the Church continued to expand, new churches in important cities gained their own bishop, but churches in the regions around an important city were served by presbyters and deacons from the bishop's city church. Thus, in time, the bishop changed from being the leader of a single church confined to an urban area to being the leader of the churches of a given geographical area.</p>

<p>Duties of a diocesan bishop are to "teach, sanctify and govern": that is, to oversee preaching of the Gospel and Catholic education in all its forms; to oversee and provide for the administration of the sacraments; and to legislate, administer and act as judge for Canon Law within his diocese. He serves as the spiritual leader of the diocese and has responsibility for the pastoral care of all Catholics living within his ecclesiastical and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Particular_Church_4bfd.html" title="Particular Church">ritual</a> jurisdiction. He is obliged to celebrate <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> every <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday.html" title="Sunday">Sunday</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Day_of_Obligation_b107.html" title="Holy Day of Obligation">Holy Day of Obligation</a> with the intention of praying for those in his care (<i>pro populo</i>), assign clergy to their posts in various institutions, oversee finances, and make regular <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_limina.html" title="Ad limina">ad limina</a></i> visits to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_See_26a9.html" title="Holy See">Holy See</a> every five years.</p>
<p>Only a bishop possesses the power to confer the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacraments_of_the_Catholic_Church_d79b.html" title="Sacraments of the Catholic Church">sacrament</a> of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Orders_63e3.html" title="Holy Orders">Holy Orders</a>. The sacrament of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation.html" title="Confirmation">Confirmation</a> is normally administered by a bishop in the Latin Rite, but any priest has the sacramental power to do so and may under various circumstances. Moreover, it is only within his power to consecrate <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_%28building%29.html" title="Church (building)">churches</a> and bless <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">altars</a>.</p>

<p>Only a bishop or other ordinary may grant <i><a href="../../../i/m/p/Imprimatur.html" title="Imprimatur">Imprimaturs</a></i> for theological books, certifying that they are free from doctrinal or moral error, as part of his teaching authority.</p>
<p>In former times, it was also the duty of the bishop to consecrate the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paten.html" title="Paten">paten</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalice.html" title="Chalice">chalice</a> that would be used during the Mass. Today, a simple blessing is used which may be given by any priest.</p>

<p>In both Western and Eastern Catholic Churches, any priest can celebrate the Mass. In order to offer Mass publicly, however, a priest is required to have permission from the local Ordinary - authority for this permission may be given to pastors of parishes for a limited period, but for long-term permission recourse to the diocesan bishop is usually required. A <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebret.html" title="Celebret">celebret</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> may be issued to traveling priests so that they can demonstrate to pastors and bishops outside of their own diocese that they are in good standing. In the East an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antimension.html" title="Antimension">antimension</a> signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose <a href="../../../o/m/o/Omophorion.html" title="Omophorion">omophorion</a> the priest at a local parish is serving.</p>
<p>For priests to administer the sacrament of Penance they must have faculties, or permission and authority, from the local bishop (when the penitent is in danger of death, however, Canon Law gives any priest the right and obligation to hear any confession). To administer matrimony, they must have jurisdiction, either from general Canon Law or local diocesan law, or delegation from a competent authority. The other sacraments may be administered with at least the presumed permission of the local pastor or bishop.</p>
<p>Deacons and priests must also have permission, also part of their "faculties," to publicly preach.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral.html" title="Cathedral">cathedral</a> of a diocese contains a special chair, called a <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedra.html" title="Cathedra">cathedra</a></i>, in the form of a <a href="../../../t/h/r/Throne.html" title="Throne">throne</a> set aside in the sanctuary for the exclusive use of its Ordinary symbolizing his spiritual and ecclesiastical authority.</p>

<p>Bishops may fill additional roles in the Catholic Church including the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a></dt>
<dd>The <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> is a man who possesses the sacrament of Holy Orders as a bishop and who has been chosen to be Bishop of Rome. Because the Catholic Church holds that the "College of Bishops" as a group is the successor of the "College of Apostles" as a group, the bishops of the Church in general council have the authority to govern the Church. However, the Church also holds that uniquely among the apostles Peter was given a role of leadership and authority, giving him the right to speak for the Church and making his leadership necessary for the completion of the College. Hence, Catholics hold that the Bishop of Rome, as successor of Peter (Peter having been first bishop there and having been martyred there) today possesses this role: the Pope, uniquely among bishops, may speak for the whole Church, and a council of bishops is incomplete without the approval of the pope.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">Patriarch</a></dt>
<dd><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">Patriarchs</a> are the bishops who head certain ancient autocephalous or <a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_juris.html" title="Sui juris">sui juris</a> churches, which are therefore a collection of metropolitan sees or provinces. Some of these churches call their leaders <i>Catholicos</i>; the patriarch or the Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Egypt, is called <i>Pope</i>. While most Eastern patriarchs in the Catholic Church have jurisdiction over a "ritual church" (a group or diocese of a particular Eastern tradition), all <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Rite_0191.html" title="Latin Rite">Latin Rite</a> patriarchs, except for the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, have only honorary titles.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicos.html" title="Catholicos">Catholicos</a></dt>
<dd>Catholicoi are the heads of some of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Orthodox_4ce0.html" title="Oriental Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Catholic_Churches_730e.html" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_juris.html" title="Sui juris">sui juris</a>) (notably the Armenian), roughly similar to a Patriarch (see above).</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_%28religion%29.html" title="Primate (religion)">Primate</a></dt>
<dd>A primate is usually the bishop of the oldest church of a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>. Sometimes this carries jurisdiction over metropolitan bishops, but usually it is purely honorific.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_archbishop.html" title="Major archbishop">Major archbishop</a></dt>
<dd>Major archbishops are the heads of some of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Catholic_Churches_730e.html" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>. Their authority within their <i>sui juris</i> church is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honors.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">Metropolitan bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">metropolitan bishop</a> is an archbishop in charge of an <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical province</a>, or group of dioceses, and in addition to having immediate jurisdiction over his own archdiocese, also exercises some oversight over the other dioceses within that province. Sometimes a metropolitan may also be the head of an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocephalous.html" title="Autocephalous">autocephalous</a>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_juris.html" title="Sui juris">sui juris</a></i>, or <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_entity.html" title="Autonomous entity">autonomous</a> church when the number of adherents of that tradition are small. In the Latin Rite, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churhces, the title is "metropolitan," with some of these churches using "archbishop" as a separate office.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a></dt>
<dd>An archbishop is the bishop of an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese.html" title="Archdiocese">archdiocese</a>. This is usually a prestigious diocese with an important place in local church history. In the Roman Catholic Church, the title is purely honorific and carries no extra jurisdiction, though most archbishops are also <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">metropolitan bishops</a>, as above. In most provinces of the Anglican Communion, however, an archbishop has metropolitical and primatial power.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">Suffragan bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">suffragan bishop</a> is a bishop subordinate to a Metropolitan. This term is applied to all non-metropolitan bishops (that is, diocesan bishops of dioceses within a metropolitan's province, and <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishops</a>).</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_bishop.html" title="Titular bishop">Titular bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_bishop.html" title="Titular bishop">titular bishop</a> is a bishop without a diocese. Rather, the bishop is head of a <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_see.html" title="Titular see">titular see</a>, which is usually an ancient city that used to have a bishop, but, for some reason or other, does not have one now. Titular bishops often serve as <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishops</a>. In the <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecumenical_Patriarchate_1436.html" title="Ecumenical Patriarchate">Ecumenical Patriarchate</a>, bishops of modern dioceses are often given a titular see alongside their modern one (for example, the Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain).</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">Auxiliary bishop</a></dt>
<dd>An <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishop</a> is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop. Auxiliaries are <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_bishop.html" title="Titular bishop">titular bishops</a>, and are often appointed as the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar_general.html" title="Vicar general">vicar general</a> or at least as <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_vicar.html" title="Episcopal vicar">episcopal vicarof</a> the diocese in which they serve.<a href="http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/canon/c0330-0572.htm#par829" class="external text" title="http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/canon/c0330-0572.htm#par829" rel="nofollow">Source</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor_bishop.html" title="Coadjutor bishop">Coadjutor bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor_bishop.html" title="Coadjutor bishop">coadjutor bishop</a> is an auxiliary bishop who is given almost equal authority in a diocese with the diocesan bishop, and the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is often seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.</dd>
<dt>Bishop <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emeritus.html" title="Emeritus">Emeritus</a></dt>
<dd>This title is usually applied to retired bishops who are given a general license to minister as episcopal pastors under a diocesan's oversight. The title, in this meaning, is not used by the Catholic Church.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29_84c0.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29_84c0.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">cardinal</a> is a member of the clergy appointed by the Pope to serve in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Cardinals_49b1.html" title="College of Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a>, the body empowered to elect the Pope; however, on turning 80 a cardinal loses this right of election. Cardinals also serve as advisors to the Pope and hold positions of authority with the structure of the Catholic Church. Under modern canon law, a man who is appointed a cardinal must accept ordination as a bishop, unless he already is one, or seek special permission from the Pope to decline such ordination. Most cardinals are already bishops at the time of their appointment, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchs, and a substantial portion of the rest already titular archbishops serving in the Vatican. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them influential theologians, to the College of Cardinals and a few have been permitted to decline ordination as bishops.</dd>

<p>The Catholic Church has always taught that bishops are descended from a continuous line of ordained bishops since the days of the apostles, the <b><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_succession.html" title="Apostolic succession">apostolic succession</a>.</b> Since <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_XIII_c277.html" title="Pope Leo XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> issued the bull <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolicae_Curae_b407.html" title="Apostolicae Curae">Apostolicae Curae</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, the Catholic Church has not recognized Anglican orders as valid because of changes in the ordination rites and divergence in understanding of the theology of episcopacy and Eucharist. The Catholic Church does recognize as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic sects such as the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Catholic_Church_eaa0.html" title="Old Catholic Church">Old Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_National_Catholic_Church_f71d.html" title="Polish National Catholic Church">Polish National Catholic Church</a>.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>’’"To remove, then, all shadow of doubt, this holy Council solemnly declares that the Churches of the East, while remembering the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to govern themselves according to the disciplines proper to them, since these are better suited to the character of their faithful, and more for the good of their souls."’’<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, Rome does not recognize the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with core tenets Christianity (e.g. The Liberal Catholic Church which has a strong theosophist tendency) even though they use the proper ritual. The recent practice of Independent Catholic groups to ordain women has added a definite cloudiness to the recognition of the validity of orders by Rome. The act of ordaining women as priests is incompatible with Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.</p>
