<p>After almost a century of attempts by the Church to found a church secondary school in Enfield, Bishop Stopford's was founded on <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Polycarp_5c3b.html" title="St. Polycarp">St. Polycarp</a>'s Day 1967 and opened its doors to its first pupils on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_7.html" title="September 7">7 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. Its founder was the then Bishop Of London, the Very Reverend <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stopford_759d.html" title="Robert Stopford">Robert Stopford</a>. The school was founded to provide a Church school for the children of Enfield, who at that time had several Church primary schools but no Church secondary schools. The school was established in the buildings of the old Suffolk's Secondary Modern School. The three heads of Bishop Stopford's have been Head Masters the late Dr Geoffrey Roberts PhD, MA, BA, <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_of_the_peace.html" title="Justice of the peace">JP</a> (1967 to 1988), Mr. Brian Robin Pickard M.A. (1988 to 2001) and Head Mistress Mrs. Bridget Sarah Evans (2001 to date).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Stopford%27s_School_at_Enfield_4eb8.html" title="Edit section: Houses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Houses</span></h2>
<p>Every pupil and each member of staff belongs to one of the six 'Houses', known in short as Coventry, Georges, King Alfred's, Temples, Waltham, and Trinity. The first three are known by the acronym CGK and the second TWY. The full names of the houses are:</p>
<p><b>The four Foundation Houses</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The House of the Resurgent City and <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry_Cathedral_cbf3.html" title="Coventry Cathedral">Cathedral Church of St. Michael and all Angels</a> at <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a></li>
<li>The House of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_George_9b8f.html" title="Saint George">Saint George</a> the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">Martyr</a>, Glorious <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patron_saint.html" title="Patron saint">Patron</a> of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a></li>
<li>The House of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_the_Great_636c.html" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred The Great</a>, King of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">West Saxons</a>.</li>
<li>The House of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Temple_%28archbishop%29_0d8f.html" title="William Temple (archbishop)">William Temple</a>, Head Master, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a> and Servant of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The two New Houses</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The House of the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_cross.html" title="Eleanor cross">Holy Cross</a> of our Saviour at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waltham_Cross_4e4e.html" title="Waltham Cross">Waltham</a></li>
<li>The House of the Holy, Blessed and Glorious <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It was the intention that the houses should reflect attitudes and ideals rather than being a collection of six different examples of one type of thing.</p>
<p>Each house has its own colour. This colour has little modern significance other than the socks which pupils wear for games (in an earlier era, a football shirt and shorts of the appropriate hue were also required). Coventry wear green; George's red; King Alfred's yellow; Temple's light blue; Waltham purple and Trinity dark blue.</p>
<p>In September 2006 the new intake, Year 7, had colours added to their tie. A yellow diagonal stripe denotes their year group, below this is a stripe in the house colours (for King Alfred's this is a shade of gold). Future years will have a year colour, with their house colour below it. The new tie also features the Bishop's Crosier symbol of the school.</p>
<p>The champion house (until the end of the academic year ending in Summer 2007) is Coventry, under the direction of their House Mistress Miss Moynihan.</p>
<p>Each house has an area of the school which it occupies for registration and break time. These are as follows:</p>
<p>Coventry - Orchard Wing (Downstairs) Georges - East Wing (Downstairs) King Alfred's - Orchard Wing (Upstairs - Mathematics) Temples - West Wing (Downstairs) Waltham - South East Wing Trinity - West Wing/Orchard Wing (Upstairs)</p>
<p>It was utterly forbidden for pupils to enter another house's area during break or lunch. This was such a strongly held rule that a teacher and two house prefects were on duty solely to enforce it. In the last two years this rule has not been enforced so stringently.</p>
<p><a name="Choir_Form" id="Choir_Form"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Stopford%27s_School_at_Enfield_4eb8.html" title="Edit section: Choir Form">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Choir Form</span></h2>
<p>The Choir Form was founded in 1973 and takes boys and girls from all six houses from the second year to the sixth form. (First years may volunteer for the Junior Choir.) Whilst remaining members of their houses, pupils in the Choir Form attend registration together, sing in assembly, hymn practice, choir practice and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compline.html" title="Compline">compline</a> together. They attend a residential singing week every year, which has been at <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitstable.html" title="Whitstable">Seasalter</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walsingham.html" title="Walsingham">Walsingham</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester.html" title="Winchester">Winchester</a>. In 2004-5 the Choir Form was renamed the Music Form to incorporate a wider range of musical abilities and the modernisation of school worship. The intention is to give young musicians an opportunity to practice for participation in worship.</p>

The East Wing of Bishop Stopford's School at Enfield, a view across the yard.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bishop Stopford's is laid out differently from most modern schools. Its house structure and tradition lead it to be laid out with the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>East Wing</li>
<li>West Wing</li>
<li>South East Wing (Huts - soon to be demolished)</li>
<li>South West Wing (Destroyed by fire)</li>
<li>Orchard Wing</li>
<li>Jubilee Wing</li>
<li>Sports Hall</li>
<li>West Wing Art Block</li>
<li>Canteen (old Suffolks Building being demolished), temporarily in the area surrounded by the Sports Hall, Orchard Wing, Jubilee Wing and West Wing. The new Canteen is planned to be in the Orchard Wing by the year 2008.</li>
<li>New building project due to commence during 2007, comprising buildings for technology, English, the sixth form, and catering, as can be seen in the <a href="http://www.prparchitects.co.uk/skills/skill/Masterplanning/BishopStopford" class="external text" title="http://www.prparchitects.co.uk/skills/skill/Masterplanning/BishopStopford" rel="nofollow">architechts' plan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The East and West Wings are joined by the forbidden Chapel Corridor. The West Wing is joined to the Orchard Wing via a bridge overlooking the yard. This means that the whole school is accessible indoors via intricate corridors and passageways. Many a student has been caught on a rainy day trying to use the Chapel corridor to try to go from German to Mathematics. The sight of a master or mistress chasing after them with black gown billowing is something generations of Stopfordians will have seen, or been part of.</p>
<p><a name="Uniform" id="Uniform"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Stopford%27s_School_at_Enfield_4eb8.html" title="Edit section: Uniform">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Uniform</span></h2>
<p>The school remains one of the few educational instituitions still to use gowns however this has been reduced in recent years. The uniform is a white shirt, navy blue tie, navy blue V-necked pullover and blazer bearing the school crest, and black trousers for boys and blue pleated skirt or blue trousers for girls. The summer uniform substitutes short-sleeved shirt. The uniform has the advantage that most of it was widely available from a variety of retail outlets and hence affordable to most. Ties now also bear the house and year colours. In the past, pupils could also opt for <i>shirt sleeve order</i> in the summer, with sleeves rolled up, pullover and tie removed, and top button undone. Now students are expected to wear their tie at all times, and may only undo their top-button, and remove pullovers or blazers with express permission. There are strict rules for the length of skirts and height of socks for girls. Gowns are always worn by senior staff and certain pupils in assembly.</p>
<p>Unusually, teachers at Stopford's are restricted by a strict dress code, which is not enforced so strictly since the new Headmistress took over. Prior to 2001 female members of staff were forbidden to wear trouser suits and must wear skirts. Male members of staff should wear a suit. Some staff wore traditional black teaching gowns, which complimented the blue and grey gowns of the pupils. Until 2001 all staff were referred to as Masters or Mistresses, the term "teacher" did not enter the Stopford's lexicon. "Lesson" was not heard other than the religious lesson in assembly. What ordinary schools call a "lesson", Stopford's called a "period".</p>
<p>Masters or Mistresses are always referred to by the title "Sir" or "Miss". However in recent years the use of the teachers' surname preceded by his or her title is acceptable. Using first names to refer to teachers is forbidden.</p>
<p>Pupils' uniform is normally bought from the tailors S. Brigg and Sons. However, gowns are purchased from the robe makers <a href="../../../e/d/e/Ede_and_Ravenscroft_11a4.html" title="Ede and Ravenscroft">Ede and Ravenscroft</a> of Cambridge and London.</p>
<p><a name="Chaplain" id="Chaplain"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Stopford%27s_School_at_Enfield_4eb8.html" title="Edit section: Chaplain">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chaplain</span></h2>
<p>Bishop Stopford's School has had three <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaplain.html" title="Chaplain">Chaplains</a> since 1967. These have been the self-styled "Father" James Lowry followed by the Revd. Stephen Taylor. More recently, in May 2006, the school appointed its third chaplain, Father Anthony Homer. All chaplains have chosen to take the salutation "father".</p>
<p>Indeed, the last chaplain, who was ordained while serving as a teacher at the school was affectionately referred to by some as, Mr. Father Taylor. He was a chemistry teacher until he left the school in 2002 to teach in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. He returned a year later, much to the delight of the students. Father Taylor is a steadfast traditionalist and is said to be one of the many teachers who spoke against abolishing the houses when the idea was proposed by the current Head. His sermons in communion are often comical, and frequently have both staff and students in fits of laughter. However, he can be very serious at times, especially when defending tradition. He has instituted some traditions of his own and is the only teacher other than Dr. Roberts who has done this on such a large scale. He is also responsible for the restoration of the procession and of the collegiate seating arrangement after both were abolished for a brief period during 2004. Many Stopfordians believe that on the leaving of Fr. Taylor the last bastion of the tradition of the Roberts and Pickard era will have gone. Many other teachers like and benefit from the traditions but it is unlikely that many would defend them in quite the same way.</p>
<p>The new chaplain is 'Catholic' both in liturgical practice and in orthodox belief, and likes to be known informally as "Father Antony." He trained for Ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, in West Yorkshire. Father Antony is a member of the Society of the Holy Cross [SSC] and a member of the Company of Mission Priests[CMP]. He was formally the Assistant priest in the parish of Christ Church &amp; St Mary Magdalen, St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex which falls within the Diocese of Chichester. He was a secondary School teacher prior to Ordination teaching in a number of Schools in Hampshire. He has also taught for the University of Brighton as a visiting Lecturer in New Testament Theology, he has taught for the Diocese of Chichester and for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton in the areas of Adult Religious Education, Foundation Studies in Christian Theology and with the formation of Lay Readers and their training. He is passionate about the education of the whole person, the relationship between the Arts and Theology and the practice of regular spiritual direction and reconciliation. He clearly believes that the Eucharist should be at the very centre of our lives of discipleship which then serves as the springboard for all other activities. He has been a member of a number of round table discussion groups looking at issues of Youth Culture and Christian Faith and he has been interviewed for the "Fresh Expressions" Website of the Church of England as to how schools can be a fresh expression of church in this generation. More recently he appears as a contributor in a book by Margaret Withers, previously the Archbishop of Canterburys Officer for Mission and Evangelism amnong Children - entitled MISSION SHAPED CHILDREN published by Church House Publishing in May 2006. It is a very interesting time in the life of the Church of England as it rediscovers a new confidence in the education of young people and the role Church Schools has in the nurture and formation of our future society.</p>
<p>As well as presiding over school religious occasions the chaplain coordinates the pastoral side of the school, having frequent contact with the Senior Six, Heads of House and the Senior Leadership team of the School.</p>
<p>The chaplain is available to talk with students and staff. Chaplain is currently a part-time position, and Fr Antony is also the associate vicar of the parish of St Mary with St George in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornsey.html" title="Hornsey">Hornsey</a>, North London.</p>

<p>The Bishop Stopford's School Rule Book contains the school rules, and also the Church and School calendar. When the school was founded it was decided to have as few rules as possible, with new rules being introduced as and when required. Thus the rule book gradually expanded during the School's first twenty-four years. Since 2001 the rules have been simplified and can be seen at the <a href="http://www.bishop-stopfords-school.co.uk/id19_m.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bishop-stopfords-school.co.uk/id19_m.htm" rel="nofollow">School Web Site</a></p>

<p>All pupils must attend one assembly a week, normally with their houses, however the Sixth Form has its own assembly on Fridays.</p>
<p>The assembly at Bishop Stopford's School differs considerably from most other schools. It begins with triumphant organ music during which all pupils and staff present must stand. A house prefect from one of the houses whose assembly is being held then leads in the procession of all the prefects from the two house. Following the prefects are the senior staff, normally the Deputy Head Master and the Deputy Headmistress. Behind the deputy heads come the Chaplin. He is then followed by the Head Master's prefects, who are followed by the Headmistress. (The Head master's Prefects retain the male prefix even when there is a female head) The current Headteacher no longer observes the tradition of previous head Masters who have carried in their academic hat however gowns are still worn. It used to be customary for the Head Master's prefects to carry the school roll and the shorts rested upon a velvet cushion however with the abolition of the punishment called forgiveness and the roll now consisting of three quivers this has been stopped.</p>
<p>Following the procession the head instructs both sides of the great hall (one house on each side of the hall in collegiate fashion similar to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>) to take their seats. The assembly then proceeds in a more customary fashion including prayers and hymns. At the conclusion the organ is once again played and the procession lead out in the same order they came in.</p>

<p>The school observes six patronal festivals each year, one for each house. They are celebrated in the hall by the individual houses on days significant to their patron. The patronal festival includes the school Eucharist as well as performances in music and the arts by house pupils.</p>

<p>The school Eucharist is said on many occasions throughout the year. Most pupils experience the Eucharist at the three Holy Communions at the end of each term and at their house's patronal festival. However, the school Eucharist is also said every morning before lessons in the chapel by the chaplain.</p>

<p>The school chapel was formerly a small room on the first floor of the West Wing of the school, but is now situated in a <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestibule_%28Architecture%29_355c.html" title="Vestibule (Architecture)">vestibule</a> accessed from the corridor between the East and West Wings, opposite the great hall. The school Eucharist is said in the chapel every morning and so is the <i>Prayer for all Stopfordians</i>. This is a special prayer for all those who have a connection with the school, living or dead.</p>

<p>The corridor between the east and west wings of the school which is the only way to access the chapel and the great hall is strictly out of bounds for all students except prefects and the sixth form. It is one of the most strictly enforced traditions and even today it is rare for a student in the school to go through the chapel corridor other than for assembly or Eucharist. This tradition is perhaps one of the least popular amongst pupils and most popular amongst staff as it means pupils, on wet cold days, have to walk around outside to get to their lessons whereas staff have warm, dry and quiet passage to lessons.</p>

<p>The school's <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">pipe organ</a> was made from the remains of a church organ salvaged from Sandylands <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> Church in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morecambe.html" title="Morecambe">Morecambe</a>, Lancashire. Bought for £400, the organ is now insured for several hundreds of thousands of pounds. Two new <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manual_%28music%29.html" title="Manual (music)">manuals</a> and a new <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedal_clavier.html" title="Pedal clavier">pedalboard</a> were added during its installation, and additional pipes were bought and also built from wood. A new oaken enclosure was built and new wiring and electric bellows bought. The motor for the blower was purchased from from <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College_of_Music_cdc7.html" title="Trinity College of Music">Trinity College of Music</a>. As with many cathedral organs, the dummy pipes at the front of the organ are decorative and not functional.</p>
<p>Several notable organists have performed recitals on this instrument, including <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Curley_6388.html" title="Carlo Curley">Carlo Curley</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Hurford_e6a4.html" title="Peter Hurford">Peter Hurford</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Darlington_99fe.html" title="Stephen Darlington">Stephen Darlington</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Trotter_b464.html" title="Thomas Trotter">Thomas Trotter</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Scott_%28organist%29_0e0b.html" title="John Scott (organist)">John Scott</a>.</p>
<p>Since the organ was rebuilt, several pupils have learned how to play on the instrument, and from 2007 select students from the Music Form have been given the opportunity to learn the organ through funding from Gifted and Talented and Aim Higher. The intention is for those students to perform during assemblies and other school events.</p>

<p>Every year, on <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogation_days.html" title="Rogation days">Ascension Day</a>, a group of pupils went round the boundaries of the school whipping selected areas with special whips.

<p><a name="Merits_system" id="Merits_system"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Stopford%27s_School_at_Enfield_4eb8.html" title="Edit section: Merits system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Merits system</span></h3>
<p>A <i>Merit</i> is a house point awarded for good work or behaviour.</p>
<p>A <i>Demerit</i> is a subtraction for bad behaviour of a house point from a pupil's total.</p>
<p>A <i>Placet</i> is equivalent to ten Merits. In 2003-4, Placets (from the Latin for "pleasing") were replaced with <i>Commendations</i>.</p>
<p>If a student obtained three Placets they were given a <i>Public Commendation</i>. This was abolished in 2004 as it was too similar to the new Commendation which replaced the Placet.</p>
<p>The Placet involved, as is usual with anything Stopfordian, some ceremony. A master who thought one of his pupils had completed work worthy of a Placet would fill in a chit to be sent to the head master along with the work. If the work was in an exercise book a stamp was put in the book and the chit sent anyway. Then, during Placet week all those who had received placets would go to the head master's study and receive a personal audience with him, during which the work would be discussed briefly, the pupil congratualed and handed a certificate. Traditionally there was one Placet week per term, however under the new commendation scheme no personal contact with the head is maintained, however the names are read out at the final assembly of the term.</p>
<p>A pupil who obtained three Placets in any term was given a Public Commendation which involved the pupil's name being read out at the end of term <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triumvirate.html" title="Triumvirate">triumvirate</a> house meeting. The abolition of the triumvirate house meetings at the same time as the Public Commendation meant no change to this procedure was needed.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the new Merit system in 2003, Merits were no longer recorded by teachers but were given out by them in the form of blue stickers with the Bishop's <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crosier.html" title="Crosier">crozier</a> logo on it. These stickers are stuck into the homework diary kept by all pupils. Then, termly, form tutors total the Merits of each pupil and award bronze, silver or gold cerificates depending on the number of Merits attained.</p>

This has been going on for over a thousand years, and some of the old hats are now disintegrating. At Bishop Stopford's the programmes of all School productions are pinned to the beam above the stage facing the great altar. They hang there until "like cardinals' hats they drop in dust" as the first Head Master would say.</p>

<p>Since the school was founded, every new pupil and teacher at the school has signed his name on the School Roll. Originally a single roll of paper, kept in a leather quiver, this has now had to have additional paper added to the first roll and two new separate rolls (and quivers) made to accommodate new names. The roll was carried in the procession every morning in Assembly but as it now comprises three quivers this has been stopped. On special occasions one of the three quivers is carried to signify the roll's importance in the life of the school.</p>
<p>Some people are on the roll twice. This includes the second Head Master, Mr. Pickard, and all the Head Master's prefects who sign the roll for a second time upon being elevated to that rank.</p>
<p>At least two honorary Stopfordians are on the roll, Christoph Spital, who has run the exchange programme with <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> since 1985, and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a> , who visited the school in October 2003.</p>
<p>The Head Master's Prefects are the guardians of the Roll during their time in office and have to present the Roll on Founders' Day.</p>

<p>The school has a huge collection of in-house art work, mostly created by the sixth forms through the years and by the long time head of art, the recently retired Peter Webb. Mr. Webb was a highly regarded artist, and one of the most eccentric teachers in the school. He was famous for his round glasses, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatle</a> haircut and clothes.</p>
<p>Peter Webb painted many portraits of staff on their retirement. His huge painting of Dr. Roberts adorns the Great Hall, next to which is now hung a smaller portrait of Mr. Pickard, the second Head Master. One of the most influential deputy headmistresses, Mrs. Peploe, famous for her strictness, looks over the chapel corridor in art-form. Perhaps the positioning of this picture pays homage to her days trying to catch pupils trying to go through the chapel corridor. Webb also painted a very large <i>The Denial Of Saint Peter</i>, featuring a likeness of the then Chaplain Lowry in the role of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disciple_%28Christianity%29_8cad.html" title="Disciple (Christianity)">Disciple</a> <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Peter</a>, apparently in a drunken stupor. This painting was Webb's personal property and was removed from the School on his retirement. Mr. Webb's most famous artwork, completed with the help of the sixth form, is the statue of Bishop Stopford himself, made out of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9.html" title="Papier-mâché">Papier-mâché</a>, however it is so good that many students complete a Stopford's career convinced that it is a bronze.</p>

<p><i>Forgiveness</i> is an alternative to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal_punishment.html" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a>. If a pupil wants to choose to be forgiven rather than having the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cane.html#Disciplinary_Implement" title="Cane">cane</a> he may do so. A pupil who chooses forgiveness is made to perform arduous tasks or physical exercise for a period of approximately one hour, after which he is said to be 'forgiven'. To make the choice, a pupil is presented with a cushion bearing a pair of blue and a pair of black shorts. If he selects the blue shorts he will receive the cane, if he opts for the black shorts he will receive forgiveness. The shorts were carried on the cushion in procession in House Assemblies. With the abolition of corporal punishment in England the trial by shorts procedure is now defunct. In recent years Forgiveness has become less and less common however it remains one of the strictest punishments in British schooling.</p>
<p>Although corporal punishment is no longer used, the school displayed many canes in the Great Hall and the Head Master's study until very recently. These canes, along with special whips, are used in the beating of the bounds celebration.</p>

<p>Before the destruction of the South West wing due to fire, the Head Master had his study upstairs. When he did not want to be disturbed he would write on a blackboard the words, "OAK UP" to signify this. This came from the Cambridge tradition where those who did not wish to be disturbed would close the outer oak doors of their accommodation. This was known as 'sporting one's oak'. However, most of the Stopfordians did not know this so proceeded to walk straight past this sign.</p>
<p>The sign is an example of the so-called "instant traditions" of the first Head Master, Dr. Roberts. Indeed this remark was made by the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_London_50d5.html" title="Bishop of London">Bishop of London</a> during an address at Speech Day. Although many of the traditions were instituted rather than evolved, they are an integral part of the life of the school and loved by many.</p>

<p>The first Head Master was famous for keeping bees in the school. It was not uncommon to see the Head Master walking around the school in the full apparel of a beekeeper.

<p>The school is notable as one of the only educational institutions still to require its students to wear gowns. Although in 2003 the new Headmistress instituted blazers with gowns reserved for special occasions. The gowns vary in colour but all take the form of a long sleeveless robe. House Prefects wear grey gowns, School Prefects wear royal blue and Senior Prefects navy blue. House Captains also wear navy blue. The most senior rank of prefects, the Senior VI, wear navy blue Senior Prefect gowns with a coloured flashing to signify their rank. The Deputy Head Boy and Girl have a thin purple stripe and the Head Boy and Girl have thick purple stripe. The most senior and oldest rank of prefect, the Head Master's Prefects, have a thick red stripe on their gown. To wear a gown is considered a great privilege by the students.</p>

<p>Bishop Stopford's School has one of the most complex <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefect.html#Academic" title="Prefect">prefect</a> systems in operation in British schooling. It is generally regarded as a strength of the school.</p>
<p>The lowest rank of prefect is the <i>House Prefect</i>. This is open to the boys and girls in the fifth form and they are chosen by their house master or house mistress. The next rank up is <i>School Prefect</i>. This rank comprises students from the lower and upper sixth forms and are selected by the Heads of Houses, the Head of the Sixth Form, the Head of the Upper School and the Head Master. <i>Senior Prefects</i> are the next rank up. This comprises house captains and former house captains. House captains are traditionally selected from the lower sixth form and serve for a year. In the upper sixth they retain all the rights and privileges but not the title. The next rank up is the <i>Deputy Head Boy</i> and <i>Deputy Head Girl</i>. These are chosen by a poll of the entire sixth form. Then comes the <i>Head Boy</i> and <i>Head Girl</i>, also chosen by poll. It comes as a surprise to many that the <i>Head Boy</i> and <i>Head Girl</i> are not the most senior prefects in the school. The highest rank is the <i>Head Master's Prefects</i> who are chosen by the Head Master, or Head Mistress on the advice of the Head of Sixth Form and Head of Upper School.</p>
<p>The <i>Deputy Head Boy</i> and <i>Deputy Head Girl</i>, the <i>Head Boy</i> and <i>Head Girl</i>, and the <i>Head Master's Prefects</i> are collectively called the <i>Senior Six</i> or <i>Senior VI</i>. They wear special gowns and represent the school on public and state functions. They also have considerable rights, powers and privileges as well as the ear of the senior staff of the school.</p>

<p>The investiture of prefects is one of the pastoral and ceremonial highlights of the school year. House, school and senior prefects are invested in their own house assembly.</p>
<p>The Head Master asks the House Master or Mistress to stand and asks:</p>
<p>"Is there anyone in N house worthy of the rank of X prefect?"</p>
<p>To which the House Master or Mistress will respond, assuming there are:</p>
<p>"There are."</p>
<p>Head Master - "Have they been told of all their duties and all that will be expected of them?" Housemaster - "They have." Head Master - "Then I shall admit them."</p>
<p>The House Master then reads out the name and rank of each pupil to be invested. One by one they stand, and have their gown placed on them. They then have to go to the Head Master and kneel before him. He then asks them some questions to which the prefect-to-be gives certain responses. A prefect's badge is then pressed into the hands of the pupil, who is now a prefect.</p>
<p>The investiture of members of the Senior Six is twofold. There is a private conference with the Head Master in which the pupil has to place his or her hands on a bible and promise to uphold the ten commandments and the dignity of the school amongst other things.</p>
<p>The public ceremony of investing the Senior Six takes place in all the house assemblies and involves the passing of the gowns from the old Senior Six to the new Senior Six. A prefect's term in the Senior Six lasts the entirety of their final year at the school.</p>
