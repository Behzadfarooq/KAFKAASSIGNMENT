<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishop</a> Cotton Schools past extends back to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">British Raj</a> and the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>. The School had its humble beginnings in a house on High Grounds. It was started in the year <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a> by Rev. S. T. Pettigrew, the then <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaplain.html" title="Chaplain">Chaplain</a> of St. Mark's Church who had a vision of starting a school for the education of children of European and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indian_3dd1.html" title="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> families. In his own words, he wanted to "establish a day and boarding School for the Children of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> residents in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonment.html" title="Cantonment">station</a> and its vicinity." The school was given the name <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Cotton_b1cd.html" title="Bishop Cotton">Bishop Cotton School</a> in honour of Bishop Cotton of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, under whose stewardship a scheme of education was organized for the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> Churches in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. The School maintains its close ties with the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_South_India_5e7f.html" title="Church of South India">Church of South India</a> amongst other Indian organizations..</p>
<p>The first five years of the School could be termed as turbulent period during which time school had three principals. It was only with the arrival of Reverend <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Uglow_Pope_216a.html" title="George Uglow Pope">G. U. Pope</a>, a distinguished <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> Scholar acquired the present site and shifted to these premises. The Boys' school and the Girl's School functioned in the same <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus.html" title="Campus">campus</a> but under different administrative heads. Under the stewardship of Rev. Pope, the school grew from strength to strength. A collegiate section was started and the School obtained recognition from the University of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a>. He gave the School its <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motto.html" title="Motto">motto</a> - 'Nec Dextrorsum Nec sinistrorsum'. But when Rev. Pope left India in the year <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a> to take up the post of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">Reader</a> at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>, the standard of the School began to decline. By the year <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, closure of the school was contemplated.</p>
<p>It was <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverend.html" title="Reverend">Reverend</a> Whitehead, Bishop of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras.html" title="Madras">Madras</a>, who as the Chairman of the Board of Governors, as a last resort to save the School from closure, invited the members of the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>'s <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="Fraternities and sororities">Brotherhood</a> to prevent such an eventuality. Rev H. Pakenham-Walsh, of the Brotherhood of St. Peter, later to become Bishop, took the initiative to revive the school. The School is indebted to the <a href="../../../y/e/o/Yeomen.html" title="Yeomen">yeomen</a> service rendered by the brotherhood of St. Peter, the School till today celebrates St. <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Peter</a>'s day amongst other traditions such as <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guy_Fawkes_ff0e.html" title="Guy Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a> bonfires. A lot of improvements took place under the stewardship of Brotherhood of St. Peter. There was remarkable increase in the student strength and several buildings were constructed. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, the Girls' School was moved across the road. One who worked sincerely for a quarter of century for the growth of the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution.html" title="Institution">Institution</a> was Rev. Canon Elphick (it was hard to forget the sight of him cycling around).</p>
<p>The last living member of the Brotherhood of St Peter in India, Father David, died a few years back of natural causes (old age). He lived &amp; worked in the school as the school <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaplain.html" title="Chaplain">chaplain</a>.</p>

<p><b>Per pale, Dexter - per fess indented ermine and gules, in chief two palm branches in saltire proper, surmounted of a mitre or, in base an episcopal staff, in bend, gold, surmounted of an open book, also proper. Sinister - Azure achevron between three hanks of cotton agent.</b></p>
<p>The Rev. Pakenham-Walsh explained this in a lucid piece in <b>The Cottonian</b> of October <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>.</p>
<p>Such is the blazon or technical heraldic description of the arms of the School, which, following the usual custom of colleges and schools, has simply adopted those of its founder, Bishop Cotton, of Calcutta, and it is now proposed to give some explanation of these curious terms and of the symbolism conveyed.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motto.html" title="Motto">motto</a> <b>Nec Dextrorsum Nec Sinistrorsum</b> is connected with the school and is not that of the Cotton family, which is <b>En utraque fortuna paratus</b>, but it is the motto of Rev <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Uglow_Pope_216a.html" title="George Uglow Pope">George Uglow Pope</a>. Coming to the blazon, Per pale means that the shield is divided vertically down the centre, the sides being respectively termed Dexter and Sinister, from the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, but it must be remembered that these terms are always used with reference to the shield itself and not to the observer. This form of partition is used to allow of the arms of a man and his wife being placed on one shield, the man's arms being dexter and the woman's to sinister, and the same imagery is used in the case of bishops, who are held to be "married" to their <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dioceses.html" title="Dioceses">Dioceses</a>, the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">Diocese</a>, however, being given the place of honour to the dexter. The arms therefore in the dexter half of this shield are those of the sea of calcutta, and are used by each successive bishop impaled with his own. They will be also found with those of Bishop Heber (<a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Heber_f2ed.html" title="Reginald Heber">Reginald Heber</a>) in the School Dining Hall.</p>
<p>Per Fess means that the shield is divided in half horizontally, indented expressing the nature of the dividing line. Ermine is one of the furs used in heraldry and is always represented by black spots of a peculiar shape on a white ground, gules is a curios old Norman French term simply meaning red; various suggestions have been made as to its origin, one being from goolab (Persian) a rose, and another, gueule (French), the throat of a wolf. The latter seems most probable. In saltire means like a saltire or St. Andrew's cross, proper that they are painted in their natural color. Or, (lat, aurum) means gold, and in bend sloping dexter to sinister.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Bishop Cotton</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sinister half of the shield contains the personal arms of the ancient House of Cotton of Combermere to which family of the bishop belonged. The head of the family, <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount_Combermere_5256.html" title="Viscount Combermere">Viscount Combermere</a>, is descended from a distinguished general, Sir <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stapleton_Cotton%2C_1st_Viscount_Combermere_97ed.html" title="Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere">Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere</a>, a near relative of the bishop, who was ennobled for his services in the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsular_War_b8ff.html" title="Peninsular War">Peninsular War</a>, where his habit of going into action in full uniform with all his orders and decoration on earned for him the nickname of "The Golden Lion". Azure is the old Norman French for blue, and a chevron, an inverted V, is supposed to represent the gable of a house, and was in early days usually granted for distinguished services in a siege. The hanks or skeins of the cotton are of course an allusion to the family name, a very common practice in heraldry where <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pun.html" title="Pun">puns</a> are regarded with much favour. Argent is the French for Silver. The School Shield and Crest is an adaptation of the crest of Bishop Cotton of Calcutta, in whose name the school was founded in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>.</p>
<p>The crest is divided, vertically down the centre, the sides being called dexter (right) and sinister (left) having reference to the Shield itself. Thus the dexter is one on the left of the Crest as we look at it. The arms of this half of the Crest are those of the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">Bishopric</a> of Calcutta - the Bishop's <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitre.html" title="Mitre">mitre</a> (head dress), the Bishop's staff and the open <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>
<p>The other side of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crest_%28heraldry%29.html" title="Crest (heraldry)">Crest</a> (the Sinister) contains the arms of the ancient house of Cotton of Combermere in England to which Bishop Cotton belonged. The White figure-of-eight like shapes represent skeins of cotton. The chevron (the inverted V) is supposed to represent the <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gable.html" title="Gable">gable</a> of a house and was usually granted to a family for distinguished service.</p>
<p>While the heraldic shield of Bishop Cotton was adopted as the school emblem, it was Dr. Pope who gave us the school <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motto.html" title="Motto">motto</a> taken from the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Joshua_3669.html" title="Book of Joshua">Book of Joshua</a>, from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, <b>Nec Dextrorsum , Nec Sinistrorsum</b> - <b>neither to the right nor to the left</b>. School Anthem: On, straight on, On, Cottonians on, Like warriors to a fight, Cross thy heart, and fight with valor, Neither right or left, But on, straight on</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Cotton_Boys_School_a3cf.html" title="Edit section: The Houses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Houses</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_system.html" title="House system">House system</a> is a feature common to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_schools.html" title="Public schools">Public schools</a>. The House systems have great advantages of breaking a large community into smaller, more personal units, and thereby building a sense of loyalty and competition. A house is much more than a building (equivalent to the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="Fraternities and sororities">fraternities and sororities</a> in American Colleges) in which boys have their habitat while in school. It is a way of life. Loyalty to House often surpassed loyalty to school. Parents, sometimes, prefer the choice of the house for their children, based on their own loyalties, whether they attended school or not.</p>
<p>The formation of Houses in Bishop Cottons may have occurred during <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> since the Cottonian magazine of that year has reported "Puchi teams! Puchi marks!" . Puchi means <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Flies_1843.html" title="Lord of the Flies">flies</a>. There were 125 students in school then and six teams were formed. The Puchi teams were named - Jerrimangalams, Bloodsuckers, Scorpions, White ants and Cobras. Each team was led by a captain, and boys were grouped as 'big', 'Medium sized' and 'little'. The puchi teams were in place till <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. New houses were formed by combining -</p>
<ul>
<li>The scorpions &amp; cobras as Pettigrew House (Shoot straight and true...)</li>
<li>The white ants &amp; jerrimangalams as Pope House (There is a house...)</li>
<li>The blood suckers &amp; mosquitos as Pakenham-Walsh House (Purple and Red forever...)</li>
</ul>
<p>These names were assumed after the three pioneers of the school. Each team had a <i>Head</i> and a <i>Captain of games</i>. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, a fourth House was added which was named after canon Elphick who was Warden from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>. Many boys volunteered to join the new House and all new admissions to the school automatically were added to this House. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, a fifth House - Thomas House was formed to increase competitive spirit</p>
