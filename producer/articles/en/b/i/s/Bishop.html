<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p><i>Bishop</i> comes from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word <i>episkopos</i> (επίσκοπος, from επι "over" and σκοπος "seeing"). It can be generally translated <i>bishop</i>, <i>overseer</i>, <i>superintendent</i>, <i>supervisor</i>, <i>the first</i>, <i>leader</i> or <i>foreman</i>. From the word <i>episkopos</i> are derived the English words <i>episcopacy</i>, <i>episcopate</i> and <i>episcopal</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Bishops_in_the_New_Testament" id="Bishops_in_the_New_Testament"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Edit section: Bishops in the New Testament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bishops in the New Testament</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> uses the word <i>episkopos</i> five times.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a> 20:28</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_the_Philippians_f81f.html" title="Epistle to the Philippians">Epistle to the Philippians</a> 1:1</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_Timothy_77fe.html" title="First Epistle to Timothy">First Epistle to Timothy</a> 3:2</li>
<li><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Titus_f38a.html" title="Epistle to Titus">Epistle to Titus</a> 1:7</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_of_Peter_355c.html" title="First Epistle of Peter">First Epistle of Peter</a> 2:25</li>
</ul>
<p>Words related to <i>episkopos</i> are used in two other verses. Some English Bibles translate this word as <i>bishop</i> (<a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">KJV</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Standard_Version_3dd6.html" title="Revised Standard Version">RSV</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Revised_Standard_Version_bdd6.html" title="New Revised Standard Version">NRSV</a>, etc.), while others, attempting to distance themselves from certain types of church <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierarchy.html" title="Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, use an alternative such as "overseer" (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_International_Version_2847.html" title="New International Version">NIV</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Standard_Version_18a4.html" title="English Standard Version">ESV</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>The ministry of these <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> <i>episkopoi</i>, according to some writers, was not explicitly commissioned by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Christ_21ac.html" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> as far as the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospels</a> tell, but appears to be a natural, practical development of the church of the apostles during the first and second centuries AD. Others maintain that the episcopal structure of the Church was present from the beginning, being a direct institution by Jesus, referring to the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">apostles</a> who clearly lead the first local churches, governed and laid on hands. Supporting this latter view, the portions of the New Testament that mention <i>episkopoi</i> do not appear to be ordering a new type of ministry, but giving instructions for an already existing position within the early Church. In places (particularly in the verses from the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistle_to_Titus_f38a.html" title="Epistle to Titus">Epistle to Titus</a>) it appears that the position of <i>episkopos</i> is often similar or the same as that of <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyter</a></i> (<i>πρεσβυτερος</i>), or <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_%28religious%29.html" title="Elder (religious)">elder</a> and (or) <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>. The Epistle to Timothy mentions <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacons</a> (<i>διακονοι</i>) in a manner that suggests that the office of deacon differs from the office of the bishop, and is subordinate to it, though it carries similar qualifications.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, episkopoi are mentioned as being <i>shepherds</i> of the <i>flock</i>, imagery that is still in use today. The other passages from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> describe them as stewards, leaders or administrators, and teachers. In <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_Timothy_77fe.html" title="First Epistle to Timothy">1 Timothy</a> episkopoi are required to be 'the husband of but one wife'. Thus, it is clear that the New Testament has no prohibition against bishops being married and already having children. The most famous example of this is the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter_ace2.html" title="Saint Peter">Apostle Peter</a> himself, who was married and had children. It remains unclear however, whether a kind of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celibacy.html" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a> or abstinence had to be practiced by these first bishops and <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle.html" title="Apostle">apostles</a> after their appointment or <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Orders_63e3.html" title="Holy Orders">episcopal consecration</a> (see also <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_celibacy.html" title="Clerical celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in the second chapter of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_of_Peter_355c.html" title="First Epistle of Peter">1 Peter</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> is described as 'the Shepherd and <i>Episkopos</i> of your souls' (<i>τον ποιμενα και επισκοπον των ψυχων υμων</i>).</p>

<p>At the turn of the first century AD, the church's organization becomes clearer in historical documents. In the works of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Fathers_b839.html" title="Apostolic Fathers">Apostolic Fathers</a>, and <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Antioch_9e29.html" title="Ignatius of Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a> in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Plainly therefore we ought to regard the bishop as the Lord Himself"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians 6:1.<br />
<i>"your godly bishop"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 2:1.<br />
<i>"the bishop presiding after the likeness of God and the presbyters after the likeness of the council of the Apostles, with the deacons also who are most dear to me, having been entrusted with the diaconate of Jesus Christ"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 6:1.<br />
<i>"Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him], either by Himself or by the Apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and the presbyters."</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 7:1.<br />
<i>"Be obedient to the bishop and to one another, as Jesus Christ was to the Father [according to the flesh], and as the Apostles were to Christ and to the Father, that there may be union both of flesh and of spirit."</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians 13:2.<br />
<i>"In like manner let all men respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, even as they should respect the bishop as being a type of the Father and the presbyters as the council of God and as the college of Apostles. Apart from these there is not even the name of a church."</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians 3:1.<br />
<i>"follow your bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the Father, and the presbytery as the Apostles; and to the deacons pay respect, as to God's commandment"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 8:1.<br />
<i>"He that honoureth the bishop is honoured of God; he that doeth aught without the knowledge of the bishop rendereth service to the devil"</i> — Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 9:1.<br /></p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that, by this period, a single bishop was expected to lead the church in each centre of Christian mission, supported by a council of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyter.html" title="Presbyter">presbyters</a> (a distinct and subordinate position at least by this time) with a pool of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacons</a>. As the Church continued to expand, new churches in important cities gained their own bishop, but churches in the regions around an important city were served by presbyters and deacons from the bishop's city church. Thus, in time, the bishop changed from being the leader of a single church confined to an urban area to being the leader of the churches of a given geographical area.</p>

<p>The efficient infrastructure of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> became the template for the organization of the church in the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_century.html" title="4th century">fourth century</a>, particularly after the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edict_of_Milan_565a.html" title="Edict of Milan">Edict of Milan</a>. As the church moved from the shadows of privacy into the public forum it acquired land for churches, burials and clergy.

<p>The most usual term for the geographical area of a bishop's authority and ministry, the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">diocese</a>, began as part of the structure of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> under <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocletian.html" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>. As Roman authority began to fail in the western portion of the empire, the church took over much of the civil administration. This can be clearly seen in the ministry of two <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">popes</a>: <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_I_9fd6.html" title="Pope Leo I">Pope Leo I</a> in the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_century.html" title="5th century">fifth century</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_I_367c.html" title="Pope Gregory I">Pope Gregory I</a> in the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">sixth century</a>. Both of these men were statesmen and public administrators in addition to their role as Christian pastors, teachers and leaders. In the Eastern churches, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latifundia.html" title="Latifundia">latifundia</a> entailed to a bishop's <a href="../../../s/e/e/See.html" title="See">see</a> were much less common, the state power did not collapse the way it did in the West, and thus the tendency of bishops acquiring secular power was much weaker than in the West. However, the role of Western bishops as civil authorities, often called <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince-Bishop_e73a.html" title="Prince-Bishop">prince bishops</a>, continued throughout much of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>During the period of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> (or rather, Civil Wars), the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Established_church.html" title="Established church">established church</a> became a matter of heated political controversy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a> formulated a doctrine of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a>, which held that in the New Testament the offices of <i>presbyter</i> and <i>episkopos</i> were identical; he rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession. Calvin's follower <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Knox_74e0.html" title="John Knox">John Knox</a> brought Presbyterianism to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> when the Scottish church was reformed in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1560.html" title="1560">1560</a>. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy.</p>
<p>This vision of at least partial <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> in <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiology.html" title="Ecclesiology">ecclesiology</a> paralleled the struggles between <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">Parliament</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_England_5b1f.html" title="King of England">the King</a>. A body within the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritanism.html" title="Puritanism">Puritan</a> movement in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Marprelate_1ecc.html" title="Martin Marprelate">Martin Marprelate</a> tracts, applying the <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> name of <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Prelate.html" title="Prelate">prelacy</a></i> to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a> and her <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Whitgift_6c0b.html" title="John Whitgift">John Whitgift</a>. The <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestments_controversy.html" title="Vestments controversy">vestments controversy</a> also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as "unedifying" and even <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idolatry_in_Christianity_99ff.html" title="Idolatry in Christianity">idolatrous</a>.</p>
<p>King <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I</a>, reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted "No Bishop, no King" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> appointed <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Laud_ce91.html" title="William Laud">William Laud</a> as the Archbishop of Canterbury; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full Anglican liturgy. The controversy eventually lead to Laud's <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a> for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> by a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_attainder.html" title="Bill of attainder">bill of attainder</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1645.html" title="1645">1645</a>, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops%27_Wars_af4c.html" title="Bishops' Wars">Bishops' Wars</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1639.html" title="1639">1639</a>-<a href="../../../1/6/4/1640.html" title="1640">1640</a>.</p>
<p>During the height of Puritan power in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_England_2192.html" title="Commonwealth of England">the Commonwealth</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protectorate_1120.html" title="The Protectorate">the Protectorate</a>, episcopacy was abolished in the Church of England in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1649.html" title="1649">1649</a>. The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/6/1660.html" title="1660">1660</a>.</p>

<p>As well as traditional diocesan bishops, many churches have a well-developed structure of church leadership that involves a number of layers of authority and responsibility.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">Patriarch</a></dt>
<dd><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">Patriarchs</a> are the bishops who head certain ancient autocephalous or <a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_juris.html" title="Sui juris">sui juris</a> churches, which are therefore a collection of metropolitan sees or provinces. Some of these churches call their leaders <i>Catholicos</i>; the patriarch or the Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Egypt, is called <i>Pope</i>. While most patriarchs in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Catholic_Churches_730e.html" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> have jurisdiction over a "ritual church" (a group or diocese of a particular Eastern tradition), all <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Rite_0191.html" title="Latin Rite">Latin Rite</a> patriarchs, except for the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, have only honorary titles.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicos.html" title="Catholicos">Catholicos</a></dt>
<dd>Catholicoi are the heads of some of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriental_Orthodox_4ce0.html" title="Oriental Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> and Eastern Rite Catholic <a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_juris.html" title="Sui juris">sui juris</a> churches (notably the Armenian), roughly similar to a Patriarch (see above).</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_%28religion%29.html" title="Primate (religion)">Primate</a></dt>
<dd>A primate is usually the bishop of the oldest church of a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">nation</a>. Sometimes this carries jurisdiction over metropolitan bishops, but usually it is purely honorific. The primate of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Episcopal_Church_03b9.html" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and, while retaining diocesan responsibility, is called <i>Primus</i>.</dd>
<dt>Presiding or President Bishop</dt>
<dd>These titles are often used for the head of a national Anglican church, but the title is not usually associated with a particular <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_see.html" title="Episcopal see">episcopal see</a> like the title of a primate.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_archbishop.html" title="Major archbishop">Major archbishop</a></dt>
<dd>Major archbishops are the heads of some of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Catholic_Churches_730e.html" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>. Their authority within their <i>sui juris</i> church is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honors.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">Metropolitan bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">metropolitan bishop</a> is an archbishop in charge of an <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_province.html" title="Ecclesiastical province">ecclesiastical province</a>, or group of dioceses, and in addition to having immediate jurisdiction over his own archdiocese, also exercises some oversight over the other dioceses within that province. Sometimes a metropolitan may also be the head of an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocephalous.html" title="Autocephalous">autocephalous</a>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_juris.html" title="Sui juris">sui juris</a></i>, or <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_entity.html" title="Autonomous entity">autonomous</a> church when the number of adherents of that tradition are small. In the Latin Rite, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churhces, the title is "metropolitan," with some of these churches using "archbishop" as a separate office.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">Archbishop</a></dt>
<dd>An archbishop is the bishop of an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese.html" title="Archdiocese">archdiocese</a>. This is usually a prestigious diocese with an important place in local church history. In the Roman Catholic Church, the title is purely honorific and carries no extra jurisdiction, though most archbishops are also <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_bishop.html" title="Metropolitan bishop">metropolitan bishops</a>, as above. In most provinces of the Anglican Communion, however, an archbishop has metropolitical and primatial power.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">Suffragan bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">suffragan bishop</a> is a bishop subordinate to a Metropolitan. In the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> this term is applied to all non-metropolitan bishops (that is, diocesan bishops of dioceses within a metropolitan's province, and <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishops</a>). In the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, the term applies to a bishop who is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop: the Bishop of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwick.html" title="Warwick">Warwick</a> is suffragan to the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Coventry_d969.html" title="Bishop of Coventry">Bishop of Coventry</a> (the diocesan), though both live in <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>. Some Anglican suffragans are given the responsibility for a geographical area within the diocese (for example, the Bishop of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepney.html" title="Stepney">Stepney</a> is an <i>area bishop</i> within the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_London_06b9.html" title="Diocese of London">Diocese of London</a>).</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_bishop.html" title="Titular bishop">Titular bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_bishop.html" title="Titular bishop">titular bishop</a> is a bishop without a diocese. Rather, the bishop is head of a <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_see.html" title="Titular see">titular see</a>, which is usually an ancient city that used to have a bishop, but, for some reason or other, does not have one now. Titular bishops often serve as <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishops</a>. In the <a href="../../../e/c/u/Ecumenical_Patriarchate_1436.html" title="Ecumenical Patriarchate">Ecumenical Patriarchate</a>, bishops of modern dioceses are often given a titular see alongside their modern one (for example, the Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain).</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">Auxiliary bishop</a></dt>
<dd>An <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_bishop.html" title="Auxiliary bishop">auxiliary bishop</a> is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop (the Roman Catholic equivalent of an Anglican <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan_bishop.html" title="Suffragan bishop">suffragan bishop</a>). Auxiliaries are <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titular_bishop.html" title="Titular bishop">titular bishops</a>, and are often appointed as the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar_general.html" title="Vicar general">vicar general</a> or at least as <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopal_vicar.html" title="Episcopal vicar">episcopal vicar</a> of the diocese in which they serve.<a href="http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/canon/c0330-0572.htm#par829" class="external text" title="http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/canon/c0330-0572.htm#par829" rel="nofollow">Source</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor_bishop.html" title="Coadjutor bishop">Coadjutor bishop</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coadjutor_bishop.html" title="Coadjutor bishop">coadjutor bishop</a> is an auxiliary bishop who is given almost equal authority in a diocese with the diocesan bishop, and the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is often seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership.</dd>
<dt>Honorary assistant bishop or Bishop Emeritus</dt>
<dd>This title is usually applied to retired bishops who are given a general license to minister as episcopal pastors under a diocesan's oversight. The title, in this meaning, is not used by the Catholic Church.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/h/o/Chorbishop.html" title="Chorbishop">Chorbishop</a></dt>
<dd>A chorbishop is an official of a diocese in some Eastern Christian churches. Chorbishops are not generally ordained bishops – they are not given the sacrament of Holy Orders in that degree – but function as assistants to the diocesan bishop with certain honorary privileges.</dd>
<dt><a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29_84c0.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29_84c0.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">cardinal</a> is a member of the clergy appointed by the Pope to serve in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Cardinals_49b1.html" title="College of Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a>, the body empowered to elect the Pope; however, on turning 80 a cardinal loses this right of election. Cardinals also serve as advisors to the Pope and hold positions of authority with the structure of the Catholic Church. Under modern canon law, a man who is appointed a cardinal must accept ordination as a bishop, unless he already is one, or seek special permission from the Pope to decline such ordination. Most cardinals are already bishops at the time of their appointment, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchs, and a substantial portion of the rest already titular archbishops serving in the Vatican. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them influential theologians, to the College of Cardinals and a few have been permitted to decline ordination as bishops.</dd>

</div>
<p>Bishops in all of these communions are <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Orders_63e3.html" title="Holy Orders">ordained</a> by other bishops. Depending on the church, there need to be two or three bishops for validity (sacramental) or legality (liceity). <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> doctrine holds that any bishop, even one, can validly ordain another male (priest) as a bishop.</p>
<p>Apart from the ordination, which is always done by other bishops, there are different methods in different churches as to the actual <i>choosing</i> of a candidate for ordination as bishop. In the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> today, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_for_Bishops_0897.html" title="Congregation for Bishops">Congregation for Bishops</a> oversees the selection of new bishops with the approval of the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>. Most Eastern Orthodox churches allow varying amounts of more or less formalized laity and/or lower clergy influence on the choice of bishops.</p>
<p>Only a bishop can ordain a bishop, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>, or <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon.html" title="Deacon">deacon</a>.</p>
<p>In the Eastern liturgical tradition, a priest can celebrate the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Liturgy_b5ff.html" title="Divine Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> only with the blessing of a bishop. An <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antimension.html" title="Antimension">antimension</a> signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose <a href="../../../o/m/o/Omophorion.html" title="Omophorion">omophorion</a> the priest at a local parish is serving.</p>

This is the bishop's <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedra.html" title="Cathedra">cathedra</a></i>, which is often called the bishop's <a href="../../../t/h/r/Throne.html" title="Throne">throne</a>. In some other Christian denominations, other churches besides the cathedral will maintain a chair for the use of a Bishop when he visits their parish.</p>
<p>Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox Christian bishops claim to be part of a continuous sequence of ordained bishops since the days of the apostles, the <b><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_succession.html" title="Apostolic succession">apostolic succession</a>.</b> Since <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_XIII_c277.html" title="Pope Leo XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> issued the bull <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolicae_Curae_b407.html" title="Apostolicae Curae">Apostolicae Curae</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, the Roman Catholic Church has insisted that Anglican orders are invalid because of that church's changes in the ordination rites and divergence in understanding of the theology of episcopacy and Eucharist. Since the 1930s Old Catholic bishops (whom Rome recognises as valid) have participated in the ordination of several Anglican bishops, and this has muddy the waters somewhat as it could be argued that the strain of Apostolic Succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism. The Roman Catholic Church does recognize as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Oriental Orthodox bishops, and groups descended from them, and as valid and licit those ordinations done by Eastern Orthodox bishops,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (e.g. is an adult male) and an orthodox rite of episcopal consecration, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this gives rise to the phenomenon of <i><a href="../../../e/p/i/Episcopi_vagantes.html" title="Episcopi vagantes">episcopi vagantes</a></i>. However, Rome would not recognize the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with core tenets Christianity (e.g. The Liberal Catholic Church which has a strong theosophist tendency) even though they use the proper ritual. The recent practice of Independent Catholic groups to ordain women has added a definite cloudiness to the recognition of the validity of orders by Rome. The act of ordaining women demonstrates an understanding of Priesthood which is unacceptable to Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. It is highly significant that the relevant Vatican Congregations tend not to respond to petitions from Independent Catholic bishops and clergy who seek to be received into communion with Rome, hoping to continue in some sacramental role.

<p>In <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Methodist_Church_6a72.html" title="United Methodist Church">The United Methodist Church</a>, bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the ordained elders (Presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called Jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. In The United Methodist Church Bishops are not ordained as Bishops but, rather, remain members of the "Order of Elders" while being consecrated to the "Office of the Episcopacy." Within The United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the Annual, Jurisdictional, and General Conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, United Methodist Bishops function very much as Bishops in the historic meaning of the term. In each Annual Conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new Conference. United Methodist bishops may be male or female, with the Rev. Marjorie Matthews being the first woman to be consecrated a bishop in 1980.</p>

Among their duties, are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the Church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, are comprised of an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four year terms.

As with most Mormon priesthood, the Bishop is a part-time lay minister and earns a living through other employment; in all cases, he is married. As such, it is his duty to preside at services, call local leaders, and judge the worthiness of members for service. The bishop does not deliver sermons at every service (generally asking members to do so), but is expected to be a spiritual guide for his congregation.
