<p>There was no double entendre, really. So far as I can tell, Aaron had suggested that the creation of a user box, and adding it, that said X user is an opponent of Kelly Martin's was an example of uncivil editing. However, the diff showed only a last-edit. Someone replied, apparently and oddly, to that, seeing a double entendre that at least escapes me (and I defy you to find a more sophomoric and dirty minded thinker who can type). Aaron still didn't reply, when he probably should have, and so he replied to <i>you</i> in the "What was I thinking." "What was I thinking" was an answer and explanation: he'd gotten involved in the blocking of the person who had created the anti-Kelly-Martin box (or commented on it, when he shouldn't have or something). Both of the boxes are up at TFD, I believe. At any rate, there was no innuendo, and I think Aaron was worried about the impression you'd gotten. (You really should read <i>FH</i> just to know what the fuss is about. You'll find it a mixture of hilarity and style and erotica, I imagine.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:42, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting: there is an allusion to <i>Shamela</i> in <i>Fanny Hill,</i> where Fanny refers to her "vartue." The edition I just got has a 2001 preface, where the editor wants to locate it in constructions of the feminine (yawn) <i>and,</i> somewhat, McKeon's categories of empiricist and skeptic::Whig and Tory, putting Cleland in the Bolingbroke/Pope camp. Cleland's father, as I'm sure you know, was Pope's friend. I agree that the novel is somewhat satirical, but you just can't be stupid and ignore the fact that it's also pornography. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:37, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi there, Habj. En.wiki is now extremely strict about image copyright. One of those two babies has the kind of tag that'll get it deleted, and the other has no tag at all. Both of them could get deleted any minute. You'd better advise your friend to describe the situation on the image description page, with URLs to where he got them and where he's written off to. I mean right now. He can't wait till he gets a response to the query he sent off, he needs to <i>say</i> that he's waiting for it. Fortunately, it doesn't sound as if it would be an actual disaster if they did get deleted; presumably he could easily upload them again (with lots of info and proper tags). Still, it's simpler to avoid that.

<p>Calling logical wording "stilted" is more impolite and more a personal attack than is calling 'good-faith' corruption "vandalism". Further, there is an intrinsic asymmetry in what is permitted of each of us because the aggression began with you and because you are simply <i>wrong</i>. I simply didn't and now moreso don't expect you to <i>get</i> that, which is why I didn't bother to labor such issues and won't much labor them here, for much the same reason that I don't pour medicine down the throat of a corpse. Wikipedia will allow you to be wrong, abated only as your energy level flags.

<dd>You're mistaken. Calling wording "stilted" isn't a personal attack at all; calling good-faith editing "vandalism" is. The first is a (mild) criticism of a presumably unintended stylistic effect, while the second goes to intent, and thereby attacks the <i>person</i>. Please discuss the edit, not the editor. You seem to refer to some pre-history between us, where I initiated "aggression" and you refrained from laboring things because I wouldn't get them anyway...? I'm perplexed. Have we met before I posted on your page? Ever edited the same article? Perhaps you're confusing me with someone else. I'm Bishonen.

<p>Thanks for your message â and I must admit that I'm not entirely surprised that Hollow Wilerding has hit trouble. It seems pretty clear to me that there are at most two adolescent boys, one of whom is pretending (unconvincingly) to be two mature women. The claim (long denied) that the two mature women, HW and Winnermario, share a computer, and that DrippingInk (who has never denied being a young boy, so far as I know) lives across the road from them and is a friend... well, I'll say no more. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">ÎÎµÎ» ÎÏÎ·ÏÎ·Ï</font></a>) 21:43, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, Vardiman's famous syllogism. Rotten fish stink. My mother is dead. My mother has to be put in the box. Otherwise she'd stink. My mother is a fish. That's great marginalia for a high school. In my high school, all they'd have managed was "huh?" I had a story I wrote once, long, long ago, about a young woman writing a suicide note in marginalia. She took all the books she had taken out for her research project and wrote a bit in each book. Seemed like a cool premise, at the time. (I was in grad school. One works with the materials at hand.)

<dd>It's hard for me to say, really. I'm a fan of the Modernists, and I'm an academic, so I have two strikes against me already. Basically, I have never recovered from the dream of the poet as priest that the Modernists had. I still think that poets have to be philosophers, to some degree, as they can express a truth that is not rational but nevertheless real. Poets can express truth about perception, about psychology, about Society, about the nature of suffering, about the nature of justice, about social ills, etc. Now I realize as well as the next person that the super-compression of some of the High Modernists has disaffected poetry's audience. Further, I know that the "you must have a Ph.D. from Harvard and read what's on my bedstand to get it" stuff is not very helpful, but I think that a lot of what came <i>after</i> the Modernists lost poetry's audience just as effectively. The Confessionals, with their "this poem is about me, and you'd better know and celebrate me, because I'm doing my Whitman schtick right now" didn't help anyone (except po faced high school girls poised with a razor in one hand and Sylvia Plath in the other). Then the Black Mountain group with their "this is nature, and it's rock 'n roll, and we're hip" stuff said so damn little and managed it in such an annoying way that I'm cold. Then we get some of the Language people, and I simply don't have access to whatever cache of drugs they were taking. Finally, now, we have a big time damage control movement, where poets are trying to get back to the Folks -- the Folks who don't read poetry anymore. They sometimes say clever things, but they rarely say anything personally or socially dangerous. They rarely still say anything novel. Instead, they say amusing things, light things, things fit for a poster. Billy Collins is a step up from them, and he's highly skilled, and he's absolutely inoffensive and often charming, but ... well, I miss my tough minded, cosmically portentious, booming voiced Modernists. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:03, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Geogre, are you Zen today? George, sorry about your baby article! It looks very... uh... interesting.

<dd>Me? I just tried to transliterate, based on my ancient understanding of Ancient Attic, but I couldn't find the aspiration mark, and transliteration is all I can do now. I am now here nowhere, and that's totally Zen. I just got a dissertation in the mail, and it's very cleverly written so far -- good sense of style -- but I didn't see an important person thanked in the acknowledgements page.

<dd>Just got it yesterday, yep. I thought the introduction had great dynamism. The dichotomy it outlines is familiar to any American, but the English, in particular, seems first class, with a good sense of style. Mail has to first get to the US, then get inspected by George Bush, then get looked at by Condi Rice to erase the stick figures he drew in the margins, and then it has to go to the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_Foundation_f66d.html" title="Heritage Foundation">Heritage Foundation</a> for an opinion for Condi, and then it has to go to NSA to be scanned, and then it has to go back in the package and get sent to a regional center, and then it has to go to Baptistville to come to my mailbox.

<p>I caught it. Gray's Elegy is far too easy. See if you can work in an allusion to <i>Goldsmith</i> next time, or Pope, of course. Pope's always good.

<p>Competitive? Me? I'm less competitive than <i>you</i> any day of the week! (Of course not competitive. But part of the game is having someone continue to play by responding with a similar quote/allusion.) I did like the allusion. How could one not? And now "left to darkness and to me" has always seemed a sinister thing for Gray to have said. It's sort of like he plans to go peeping in windows (and he had a spot of trouble with a window, once, when some boys decided to get him for his...habits...and were, English boarding school-style, excessively harsh). Speaking of harsh, I managed to be the most Rhadamanthine of all on wp:an/i when it came to our Chinatown/Faulkner user (and he's back to being a roommate now).

<p>Precisely. Had he been at a stable IP and been sent through RFar, I suspect the verdict would have been -- certainly <i>could</i> have been -- an indefinite block.

<dd>Haha, you can mentor him, then, if it's Michael. Perfect. Seriously, I tried to explain (to deaf ears) to you-know-who that it wasn't <i>good</i> for this user to be encouraged to think of herself as an innocent victim of my "very bad approach" â I bet she took courage from that to carry on saying I needed to be desysopped because of failing to AGF in the face of her self-contradictions, and other such rampant foolishness.

<p>No worries. I thought that perhaps I had accidentally betrayed one of the secrets of the Cabal and that my question had to be removed for violating secrets. Then I realized that I <b>am</b> the Cabal, so if it's secret from me, it's not part of the Cabal.

<dd>Sigh. You know, some of us actually add Roman Catholic content to Wikipedia (my saint a day project, e.g.), even though we're not Catholics. Some of us add user boxes and edit war over f*cking pro-choice topics. Let's see people with that user box add articles on the encyclicals. We don't have coverage of most of the significant papal bulls. We're finally getting most of the diets and councils, but there are plenty of those left. I said recently on my user page that I personally feel like I pay the rent by writing content, and all the time that I don't add content, I feel like a freeloader. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:42, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Exactly!</b> There are over 10,000 saints. We have loads of them, but we don't have 10,000. I stuck to the saints because, as an Anglican Communion kind of guy, I find them interesting, and there are a ton of them that illustrate history delightfully (cultural history, most of the time, but political history quite often, too). In other words, which figures and which stories a society chooses to celebrate as holy tell us a great deal about the issues, thoughts, and values of that people at that time. This is a gap in history studies, IMO. The encyclicals tell us stuff, too, although at such variance with the historical moment as to require a delicate historical touch. In other words, these things are all inherently interesting. Do we get articles on them? No. However, as you point out, one that seems to suggest that sex is fun...well, stand back. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:37, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, let's see what personal invective has been betrayed. Bunchofgrapes doesn't like user boxes and implies that they create false alliances. I express irritation at people who call themselves defenders of the faith but don't do any research or writing. ALoan agrees that we don't have much, all things considered. I agree with ALoan that Wikipedia's editor population is shallow and unserious. Wow. I hope no one else gets to see these secret assessments! FWIW, I've put a week down on the Hollow account after the admission, in so many words, that "she" evaded the blocks because "she" didn't like them.

<dd>I suspect that you're being duped. That's about it. This editor is like Michael, in that many of the edits are fine and most are miniscule, but the behavior is wholly mendacious. You really would be poorly served by believing anything the user says about himself/herself, as he has been caught in at least four <i>sets</i> of lies. I wouldn't believe that the user is Roman Catholic, that the user is female, that the user is male, that the user is singular, that the user is plural, or anything else. All that I believe is what I know: the user was blocked for personal attacks and created a new account to evade that and, when that was blocked for voting for itself, created four more accounts to evade those blocks. Nothing else is germane, really. When we edit at Wikipedia, we accept its regulations, and one of those regulations is that we can be temporarily blocked for misbehavior. We don't need to keep proving the misbehavior. We can examine all that at ArbCom, later, <b>after</b> the block evasion stops. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:06, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am already violating my one-week block, but since you seem to oppose the idea of an Arbitration, why don't you unblock me and allow me to edit? I can't stop saying how much I'm not guilty of any crime and that it was you who started the controversy. By the way, since the block on <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_Serenity_6910.html" title="User:Solar Serenity">User:Solar Serenity</a> is about to lift, what is going to happen with that account? Can we leave it for my brother to operate in one-weeks' time? Let us put it this way: I will go away for one week, and I will not file the Arbitration if you let my brother operate the account. This way the community is allowing my brother access to Wikipedia while I do not violate my block for one week. My brother will not begin editing for one-weeks' time as well so that you don't suspect any block evasion. Is this deal fair enough? Would you finally be willing to compromise with me on this? 64.231.168.115 01:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Here's a real comment from me: "My block will be released on January 15th or 16th â whatever your timezone says"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=35238652&amp;oldid=35233110" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=35238652&amp;oldid=35233110" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<p>Just to let you know: I have put a one week block on the Hollow Wilerding account following "her" admission on wp:an/i that "she" was evading blocks. I have not blocked the dynamic IP, though I would consider blocking the whole dang range, if necessary. I am also considering calling the real life Courtni Wilerding in Toronto to find out if this editor's mendacity is as pervasive as it appears. (It's easy enough to get a Toronto phone book at the university library.) When the user suspends editing for a week, it will be possible to engage her in the next logical step: RFar. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:00, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I've been concerned about Courtni for some time, I wish you would. I accidentally undid your block, Geogre, or rather the software undid it (and Snowspinner's) when I unblocked my own original block of the HW account. My intention in doing that was to enable yours, not to annihilate it. But it shouldn't matter, I reinstated it right away, of course, and have stated in the log that it is a reinstatement of <i>yours</i>; that's the best I can do. It means the search facility won't find it if anybody searches for "Geogre", but, oh, well, it can scarcely matter. I hope you don't mind. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:52, 16 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>That's alright, except that it enables the user's continued paranoia that it's all a Bishonen vendetta, etc., if that matters. I doubt it will. I'm not sure the user understands, quite, that, although it's fine if he or she wishes to file an RFar against you, the ArbCom that we're discussing is a motion against her. I'll say at the outset that the result of it will be mentoring, and that's fine, but we have to have a mentor who hasn't weighed in and who has standing in a content area other than her own, at least to satisfy me, because there have been folks who have used the content area as an excuse for the other actions, and that's just not allowed. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:44, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But I believe the ArbCom would be quite likely to accept a request by her, except it would be in order to look into her conduct. They do that, I've seen examples. (So have you, FreplySpang, if you're there!) That's fine, in the sense that it would save me or whoever the trouble of drafting a request for arbitration against <i>her</i>. I only entreated her not to because it seemed too sad: the RFC forgotten, she's still "threatening" to make me feel the wrath of the community by filing yet another complaint! I don't get any pleasure out of watching this self-destruction. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:08, 16 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>
<dd>As I've said on my page, there is a kind of <a href="../../../e/v/e/Event_horizon.html" title="Event horizon">event horizon</a> involved. At a certain point, it's all suction, and there's no point throwing any more words in the graphemic hole. What will be, will be. Let's hope the user can stay away for the week and not reset the block <i>again.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Worth pointing out another deception? Well, if it is, let me make obvious something hidden up there. The Hollow Wildering editor asks what will happen if she goes away for a week, per the block, but leaves the Solar Serenity account for her brother, Cruz, to use. Well, on WP:AN/I ("Attempting to ressurrect..."), she announces loudly that her brother Cruz has left for good and will never edit again. (sigh) This isn't shocking for those of us who have been playing the home game of "spot-the-inconsistencies," but since we have people often tricked into taking part, it's probably wise to be explicit. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:29, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey folks, has it ever occurred to you that the main thrust at Wiki is not making good articles, it is really Who Blocks Whom, and Who has Power Over Whom.</p>
<p>Then, who Reverts Whom, and who Re-reverts Whom.</p>
<p>THAT is the big game here. Power tripping. Getting Barnstars and Merit Badges.</p>
<p>BTW, I am not Hollow Wieldering or whomever....</p>
<p>Carry on with your games.</p>
<p>Also, members of the WAFE group I started may overstep bounds now and then, and if any are rude, I am sorry. But as to whether this ip or that person gets blocked, do you really think in the MeatSpace that anyone, I mean anyone, really gives a damn? This is just a huge, absurd, game. Fair boggles the mind.</p>

<li>I didn't write that, or mean it like that anyway - I'm foreign you know.

<dd>Only just awake&#160;:-). Well, mine doesn't have any diffs, and I won't have any time do dig them out until after work tomorrow. I think you'd better leave me out until I can do that (unless you have a few diffs to add to my statement yourself?). Accusations without diffs are just huffing and puffing, they're useless and don't make a good impression. But I'll be happy to be a party to the request, and I can add my bit tomorrow night. I think it's sort of normal that these things grow while on the RFAR page. Another thing, though: the "Involved parties" shouldn't be just you and me, especially since my involvement is marginal (to put it mildly). I think the other guys â the main defenders of the wiki against Beckjord â should add their signatures under "Involved parties", especially DreamGuy, but really all of them. "Involved parties" needn't be limited to people who have written a statement. Check out some others on the RFAR page: the KDRGibby request doesn't have any statement by <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a>, for instance. And... hey! I just realized. You can't leave the confirmation that B's aware of the request blank. You need to post on his talkpage to tell him, then add a link to that post as confirmation.

<dd>This is a dilemma. I want to have good, reasonable people like Bishonen to police the place, rather than people who just like to exercise whatever little power they have. But I also think it is a waste when good writers don't get the time to write anymore. It is a systemic problem. Something has to be permanently done about the trolls and POV pushers to make them less of a drain of other people's energy. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 21:30, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Looks like he's up to some no-good. On <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> he has repeatedly reverted to a version prior to a page refactoring. His/her edit comments claim that this had something to do with a concern with POV; but the change is simply making one overly large page rather than two reasonable size ones. Both of the pages, on a controversial topic, definitely pose a POV quagmire, but this user doesn't even seem to be pushing any POV except that pages should be &gt;32k in size via this particular edit. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 22:53, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Bishonen. I actually don't care much at all about Fighterforfreedom's weird obsession with my sexual orientation that you warned him about. Of real concern to me is repeated "unfactoring" of the article. S/he's somehow got this obnoxious notion in her/his head that refactoring an article into proper sized siblings somehow comments on the "worth" of the topic (and he presumably thinks Churchill is "unworthy") rather than just on how many words the article(s) have. But I did some work in the refactoring (not huge, the general content was kept, but a few different sections were moved around, and lead in language adjusted a bit); it's really annoying to see it rolled back for something as idiotic as this (the POV-mongers who want to rail against Churchill are one thing... but this is just disruption for the sake of disruption itself). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't really suppose you cared â it's just such appalling behavior.

<dd>Oh well. The refactoring issue is pretty simple, actually. A section on criticisms grew really large, so I split it off into <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_%28misconduct_allegations%29_0f1a.html" title="Ward Churchill (misconduct allegations)">Ward Churchill (misconduct allegations)</a> with all the appropriate prominent links back and forth between parent and child. Actually, part of that is to try to isolate the POV-mongering to the latter article, so the parent can more straightforwardly say: "Churchill is an historian who wrote this bunch of books". Then the child/sibling can have all the publicized accusations. But quite apart from such content, it's really just a matter of size... the article was getting something like 60k before the split, just about evenly split between the main thing and the allegations. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 03:28, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, let me answer the questions. Is it OR? Well, it doesn't <i>say,</i> quite. It does report from her novels, and it could be sourced in the novels (i.e. I could give quotes). At the same time, the <i>DNB</i> author addressed the lesbian question by saying that SS and Lady Bab loved each other and that the marriage was never consummated and that one possible reason for her getting pulled out of her husband's house was sex that she wouldn't do. So it's sorta kinda always sorta talked about, and all I did was report (yes, from my own reading) from her work. Yes, I have presented on <i>Millenium Hall,</i> but I haven't published on it, so I don't think it's one of those "you need a footnote to yourself" situations. I defy and dare anyone to read <i>Millenium Hall</i> and not get grossed out by it. There is such a profoundly unhealthy sublimation of desire going on there that I don't think the most devout <i>or</i> the most dedicated "outer" of ancient authors could approve of it. Melvin New gave a great paper, once, on the Will of God in <i>Humphry Clinker</i> and titled it "The Grease of God." Well, that's how grace works in <i>Millenium Hall</i>: the miracle grease to make the plot go. (To be fair to myself, I've been waiting 2 years for someone else, someone maybe who likes SS, to write the article. I was going to write on Sedley, but I saw "Scott" in the DNB today and just figured that even an antagonistic article with full facts was better than no article at all, and perhaps I'll save someone two nights of misery with that novel.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:22, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

At least the few folks I've known who have been in combat have been kind of <i>quiet</i> about it. That whole run of obscenity was on the most primitive level -- really troglodytic -- and seemed about in keeping with someone in the "nineth" grade, and not a very bright someone in the ninth grade at that.

If there were other sources, it would be possible to FAC it, possibly, if some of the OR were de-fanged. At any rate, I found a picture of her sister (lotsa pictures, in fact, and I may make her my project for today, except that I so rarely venture past 1750) and <i>one</i> picture of the text. I feel iffy about copyright when I'm using someone's digital photo (copyright to the photo?), but there it is. You should look at the full sized book plate.

<dd>Mmmm. I use those scans of the fronts of 17th-century books from the Early English Books Online as illustrations without a second thought, and their stuff from inside the books also, like the cast lists in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Relapse_0ee6.html" title="The Relapse">The Relapse</a></i>. (Incidentally, about <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Relapse_0ee6.html" title="The Relapse">The Relapse</a></i>, talk about sinking without a trace â you didn't even link to it in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Charke_48ed.html" title="Charlotte Charke">Charlotte Charke</a>, and I sort of didn't even expect it, nobody <i>can</i> remember the poor thing.) The books are old, they're two-dimensional, the defence rests. That said, I do see what you mean about this one. It makes me feel a little iffy too. Not enough to want it gone, but ... it's not <i>quite</i> two-dimensional, it's recognizably a particular photo somebody took, it would look different in another photo taken by somebody else.</dd>
<dd>Sources, other sources? I can't even believe what a lot of hits Questia has if you type in "Sarah Scott", and how solid they look. 51 academic books!

<dd>My feeling is that popping this IP is sort of not here or there.

<dd>Sorry, no, I wouldn't, I've been spreading far too many "views" across the wiki and need to get back to actually editing an article occasionally. Giano tells me it was years ago.

<dd>Hey, ALoan, let's not mess with them with their August crawdad ceremonies. It's a major source of export income for Louisiana, Mississippi, and east Texas.

If I follow from my notes and write it at a first draft, I'll avoid wording similarities, of course (no plagiarist, I), but I'd be locked into the misplaced presentation of facts that the DNB author has.

<p>(And now here's our buddy back. Reverting edit. More later.)</p>
<p>I was trying to get rid of that copyvio, but I was blocked for having my ISP owned by AOL. It wasn't worth bothering, as no one on IRC other than Bishonen would even try to help. &lt;sigh&gt; Bish, 3:00 is fine. I may even have done the Charke article by then. It seems strange to me that people didn't list that article on AfD or CSD. I mean, seriously: forget the fact that it's a copyvio. It's a paragraph out of something longer obviously. It's not encyclopedic, doesn't establish context, doesn't explain the subject whatsoever, and <i>then</i> it's copyvio. A substub saying, "Daughter of Colley Cibber and notorious transvestite" would have been better. People delete far, far, far too little, believing "it's good enough."

<li>Thanks for the picture. It's lovely. I think your saying something about how minor her roles were, or what they tell us about either the image of the character or the actress, would be wonderful.

<li>Sure, gladly. You mention one "tomboy" role: Hoyden in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Relapse_0ee6.html" title="The Relapse">The Relapse</a></i>. But to do it right, I should get the relevant volumes of the <i>London Stage</i> from the library, so it may be a few days. Btw, one detail: what do you (what does your source) mean by Colley selling his share of Drury Lane to Highmore "instead of" to Theophilus or Charlotte? That he was mean to his kids? That wasn't it; Colley and Theo were most likely in cahoots to swindle Highmore. They were little better than crooks, really. See the True Story at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colley_Cibber_0789.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>, section "Cibber as manager". I suppose it's only tenuously relevant to Charlotte in any case? Shall I remove it, or do you have detail to contextualize it? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:09, 22 January 2006 (UTC).</li>

<li>I'd rather contextualize it, as "daddy hates me, and my brother is a shit" is a major part of her story. She thought, apparently, that she and Theo should have kept the theater and rolled merrily along. Remember that she was young and despised by those two, so she probably didn't know about the swindle. I can do the contextualizing pretty easily, in fact. The source's shock that she got nothing is a sign that that's how it's presented in the <i>Narrative</i> (since that's really the only source she used), and <i>that</i> is a sign of just how out of the loop Charlotte was. I suspect that a more sensitive reader of the <i>Narrative</i> could pick out quite a few things that the DNB author may have missed. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The deceit and taking advantage of us (me) was the worst thing; the vandalism isn't exactly egregious. But since the IP is capable of posting on my page, I'll block it for 24 hours. It <i>seems</i> static, since the person is so keen to get it unblocked, but I'm not sure it really is. Blocking an IP indefinitely is kind of hair-raising. And maybe the keenness to become an admin can be channelled into editing virtuously from a new account, like I suggest above? Let's give it a chance, anyway. It'll be easy to block it later, if necessary.

Yeah, well, when I'm rich, I can sneer at the AOLamers, too. Until then, I have to use the least expensive ISP there is, and that's Netscape, and that's owned by AOL, and so, instead of my reversing copyvio and writing an article tonight, I sit blocked. Yeah, this is worthwhile. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:07, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Geogre, sorry you got all that.&#160;:-( I suggest you copy and study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WBardwin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34900809this" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WBardwin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34900809this" rel="nofollow">this message</a>, with tips from JRM to WBardwin, and keep it available for next time. Being yourself both the blocked user and the admin with unblock powers should help. The thing to bear in mind is that nobody other than the blocked user sees the same, very complete, block message; if you get blocked, only you are told what the IP is. The IP helps a lot if the original blockee was an anon, not at all if he/she wasn't. Anyway, the point is, in your double role, you get the optimal info, better than other admins. I hope the link helps. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:52, 21 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>There was '<i>one</i> piece of advice that was worthwhile in all that. Block one's own IP with a time of zero. Other than that, JRM is wrong. When you know the IP blocked, you <i>still</i> don't get to see which IP was autoblocked. If my block says that IP 217.75.83.2 was blocked, the block log will not show that address, no matter. It will only show "block 8455" and "block 8456." That's that. I'm not at all happy with the industriousness of my fellow admins on IRC. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:53, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>? No, we're not communicating here. I know the block log looks the same for everybody, and so does JRM. What I tried to say was that you do get told the IP in your own <i>block message</i> â not in the log â the message that appears at the fateful moment of blocking. To have that info will help if the original blockee was anonymous: you can search the log for the IP, and if he <i>was</i> anonymous, you will find the original block. It will not help if the blockee was a name account. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:04, 21 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>They haven't been IP's. If they were IP's, I'd have been able to unblock myself without any hassle. Instead, they were all named.

<dd>Wow, what a lot of lovers and scandals in that short life, and it doesn't seem to have worried anybody, in the great era of primness and middle-class virtue! The fans don't mind at all. No, the notion of a transgendered show is quite new to me. Quel raffinement, in fact a little revolting, somehow. I'm betting they lingered on the love scenes. All women's companies now, OTOH, I've heard of those. Not maybe inside city limits â too much of a sideshow? â but outside London, at the summer fairs, or strolling. Sort of corresponding to the children's companies in Shakespeare's time. (Those are mentioned in <i>Hamlet</i>.) I don't know where I've read about the women's companies, but I'm pretty sure they were around from the late 17th century. Or <i>in</i> the late 17th century, at least. Such ventures could easily have gotten shut down as being fronts for prostitution, or closed by popular outrage, or the performances could have been fucked up by disruptive users ... er, I mean spectators. A vulnerable kind of undertaking. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:58, 23 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>So that really <b>is</b> a children's company that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Marston_0c19.html" title="John Marston">John Marston</a> wrote for and managed? Wow. How absolutely weird. Oh, and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Carey_317f.html" title="Henry Carey">Henry Carey</a> has now gotten a full going-over. (Cf the before and after links between the "inuse" edit summary.) Cargill's story seemed to be absolutely <i>perfect</i> for emerging Romanticism, and particularly its love of beautiful corpses. (Poe's dead female child excepted.) They were hot for how hot she was, and they expect some misbehavior from their wild child beauties, but then her death was simply too perfect for an age that would soon get to fall in love with a dead Chatterton. That revolting Romantic obsession with trembling dead folks was already begun, I think. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:26, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geogre, when you say "inline citations," do you mean footnotes? I'm assuming you do because they're the ones that make pages fragile (and I agree with you for that reason: I can't stand them either). But they're not required at all. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> is the relevant guideline, and it says footnotes, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_referencing.html" title="Harvard referencing">Harvard referencing</a>, or embedded links are fine (and in fact embedded links are preferred), so long as they're accompanied by a full citation in the Notes section if footnotes are used, or in the References section if Harvard references or embedded links are used. And you don't have to use any of the strange references templates either, which can also cause problems if citations are later added or removed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:36, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SlimVirgin, take a look at FAC just now. You will see every objector there, pretty much, saying, "Does not have inline citations, which are a requirement of all FA's." There was a camp, a few months ago, that began this absurd campaign. They liked little fragile numbers. We academic types were fighting them, tooth and nail. However, in one of those lovely little gaps, all of us seemed to turn our heads at the same minute, and now, it appears, "inline citations are a requirement of all Featured Articles." Given that Tony1 had a predilection for rewriting the FA guidelines without talking to anyone about it, I wouldn't be surprised if they changed the language and are now taking the "huh? no, it's always been that way" line. People who fight nationalist battles on a global encycloopedia, people who fight about categories with no articles in them, people who fight for boxes that must be everywhere, and people who fight over this MoS vs. that, always, always moving toward fewer choices and never toward more, always moving toward being Right and having the Truth, are an annoyance to me even more than they are a mystery to me. I have neither the patience nor the good will left to play with them. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:34, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Again, over time, this has hardened to make inline references mandatory for pretty much any statement in a FAC (there is an explicit recognition somewhere - <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>? - that any format is acceptable, although I have to say I am in the process of being converted by the &lt;ref&gt; thing).</dd>

<dd>I have raised the evolution point more than once on the relevant talk pages - yes, if you are contradicting widely-held knowledge, it makes sense to attribute your statement; but "the sky is blue (ref:look up)" is just daft, to me.

<dd>Yes, I agree with ALoan, the new "ref" is robust and is <i>much</i> easier to use than the one you've got, Giano â I fully expect Bunchofgrapes to weigh in and say the same at any moment, he introduced those notes at <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_Beckjord_11b0.html" title="Erik Beckjord">Erik Beckjord</a> and seemed to suppose, in a moment of mad optimism, than even <a href="../../../b/e/c/User%7EBeckjord_caa6.html" title="User:Beckjord">User:Beckjord</a>, who can't format a ==heading== would be able to use them â well, anyway, they're easy for <i>most</i> people.

<dd>Oh, uh, I see I have to weigh in. I am afraid I am one of those uncouth supporters of footnoting our articles liberally if they have more than one reference. This isn't a normal encyclopedia, where there's some reason to trust that the author isn't just making stuff up. Having as direct a beeline as possible from asserted-fact to place-the-fact-is-from is important for the integrity of the encyclopedia. I have nothing against Harvard referencing, either, but I think footnotes make for slightly less distraction. Embedded links, like Slim prefers, I don't like - mostly because you can't make an embedded link to, oh, say, a book. If you want to cite some books and some web sites, then, you have to start mixing citation styles in the article, which is awful... I used to use embedded links as I was working on "rough drafts", then convert them to footnotes all at once, but that was before &lt;ref&gt; made it just as easy to make it a footnote to begin with. I find the &lt;ref&gt; style quite easy to work with, but I acknowledge it does nothing help sway those who dislike footnotes for stylistic reasons. â<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 15:51, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well I completely agree with Geogre, it's now almost impossible to write a decent length article, that reads. Logic and common sense seems to have gone out of the window, and been replaced by increasing rules, regulations and bureaucracy, which is barely understood by the fools who invented it. Pop singers and football players younger than 30 who have never achieved an intelligent thought or action in their unlived lives become FA biographies, because their limited and few achievements are recorded on easy to read and link to web-sites, which cover up the lack of proper references. What happens when the websites disappear. God only knows. The whole FAC thing is going to pot, led mostly by people who have never written one. And as for refer to peer review don't tempt me! <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 14:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>ALoan, I think what Giano and I are objecting to is certainly not citation, nor Peer Review, but "This is a requirement. You must use this style. You must go to PR." The point is not whether inline citations are inherently bad or not (I don't like them: as John Barrymore said, reading a footnote is like running downstairs to answer the doorbell on the first night of marriage) (I believe notes are good as <i>notes,</i> when there is an emendation or annotation to make that carries verbiage), but that there are now people who vote and lodge objections over "You Must Do As We Say," when what they say is altogether not supported by citation elsewhere or previous practice nor guaranteed to produce useful help. I love getting help on my articles, but I've also seen the most useless stuff in "objections" before, and things like "cite the fact that she was a good musician in the lead" is just plain silly (concert musicians kind of <i>have</i> to be good musicians). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, thank you for reviewing the dispute between me and DreamGuy. I have attempted to collect relevant information at this page: User:Elonka/DreamGuy dispute.

<dd>I'm very glad to hear it. I've posted it on your page. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:35, 24 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bishonen, in reply to your messages on my talk page, I would like to explain why I have concerns about whether or not you can remain unbiased in this matter. Please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> on my part. I am not trying to attack you personally -- I am trying to explain why you may not be looking at the situation objectively.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, your first awareness of my dispute with DreamGuy was when you saw DreamGuy's <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html#Someone_harassing_me_and_another_person_pretending_to_be_a_mediator_or_something" title="User talk:Android79">appeal to admin Android79 for help</a>, in which DreamGuy gave a highly emotional, biased, and inaccurate view of the situation, referring to Petros' efforts in negative terms, and to me as "an emotional editor" who was "upset" and seeking "revenge".</p>
<p>In my opinion, a party seeking to act in a neutral manner would have then posted on *both* our pages, in diplomatic language that did not immediately assume fault on either side. A neutral party should seek to get both sides of the situation before taking action. Instead, you posted a sympathetic message on DreamGuy's page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36503893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36503893" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, and posted a threat of block on mine<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElonka&amp;diff=36508387&amp;oldid=36507059" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElonka&amp;diff=36508387&amp;oldid=36507059" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.</p>
<p>Your first action was to go to DreamGuy's page and tell him that you would be "happy to tell both of them that any continuing posting amounts to harassment". (I especially note the word "happy"). You also said to him, "she's not free to harass you about it, nor to badmouth you elsewhere". Again, this was a comment that implied that you had taken DreamGuy's claims at face value that I was "bad mouthing" him, without yourself first reviewing the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>What really struck me though, is that you made a point of mentioning how "Everyking was recently blocked for harassing" you, in your comment to DreamGuy. I know little about the situation with Everyking, but I believe the situation, your comment, and your actions all make a good case that you were projecting your own feelings onto DreamGuy's situation.</p>
<p>You also went to Petros and told him that he was to "butt out"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Petros471&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36511060" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Petros471&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36511060" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. You advised him to delete the page that he had made, and said you would "gladly delete it" for him. This too seemed odd to me. You also defended DreamGuy at the Wikiquette alerts page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36514571" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36514571" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>, and then went back to DreamGuy's page to tell him that even though you weren't reviewing the situation, you stood ready to block either Petros or me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36512646" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36512646" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. Again, I see this as completely taking DreamGuy's side, without having bothered to review the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>Please please do not assume that I am implying that you are a bad person. I have reviewed some of your other communications, and I see that you are capable of dealing with people in a civil and courteous manner, and that you work very very hard to reverse the damage that is caused to Wikipedia by a steady stream of vandals. I applaud these skills. I also know that it can be a thankless job being an admin (I manage other online communities, myself). And I know the dangers of burnout -- that when dealing with a constant flood of sockpuppets and others of poor social skills on Wikipedia, sometimes it becomes easy to see <i>any</i> user as having the same suspicious motivations as the other problem-causers.</p>
<p>In this particular dispute between DreamGuy and myself though, I think that you have mis-judged my actions. You did not seem to consider that I might genuinely be acting in good faith. As I tried to tell DreamGuy, I'm one of the <i>good</i> guys. For you to immediately threaten me with a block was excessive, especially considering that you had not yet reviewed the details.</p>
<p>It is my hope that you review your own actions in this matter, to ensure that you are doing your best to gather facts first, to review all parties fairly, and not to jump to conclusions. Just because some of the users on Wikipedia are problem cases, doesn't mean that all of them are. Thank you. <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 00:34, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't speak condescendingly to me, Elonka. Your notions that I'm "projecting my own feelings" or suffering from "burnout" aren't just inappropriate, they're inappropriately intimate â it's as if you believe yourself to have the privilege of a friend, or to be a psychiatrist analysing a patient. (Amateurishly, I might add.) You speak as if to a child. Yes, my first awareness of your dispute was when I saw DG's post on Android's page. I didn't know DG, I didn't know you: of course my first action wasn't to "jump to conclusions" and go to DG's page to post a sympathetic message. My first action was to review the situation, by studying the relevant pages and their histories, before posting to both of you according to my conclusions. You may well be a "good guy" for all I know. I have little interest in your motives, and I recommend you to adopt the same attitude to mine, or at least to avoid commenting on them. (Please see <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>: "Comment on content, not on the contributor".) I look only at your actions and how they affect others, because that's what matters to the community and the encyclopedia. This is what I've seen so far: your series of posts on DG's page are harassing and your discussion of my psyche is presumptuous. Even your compliments are offensive, though I'm sure they're well meant. Making all possible allowances for your good intentions, I hope you won't allow yourself such a tone to me again. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:49, 25 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

The man's house had been bought by the council (UK), and he didn't know it, and they just started building a Unity house on "his" property. He sadly stared at it until one day in 1954 he hung himself in the shed on the land in dispute. Sounds like the origin of Arthur Dent, Tuttle in <i>Brazil,</i> and a number of others.

<p>I knew it when I read it. I don't know it now. What's interesting is that there is no mention of him on the web that I can find (esp. since "pilgrim" pulls up every other thing than him, and "pilgrim council housing" comes up with council houses on Pilgrim Way, and "Edward Pilgrim" gets Edward Doty, Pilgrim on the Mayflower).

However, the DNB said that he mournfully stood by as the Unity house got higher and higher until it blotted out the sun and you needed an electric light even on sunny days. In other words, it appears that it was a skyscraper apartment building, and the suicide/incident was '54, but that doesn't mean the thing was finished then. Still, it must have been finished some time around 60, at the latest, so I doubt it's that particular one. Tomorrow, I'll jot down the very skeleton of the story. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:07, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am almost in your camp on this, as I find that it may be hard or impossible to block his contributions to the talk pages anyway since he seems to be using AOL at least some of the time. Perhaps the best thing to do is ignore him and he'll probably go away after awhile...but I'll go through the motions in the arb case just for practice as I have never been involved in one before...kind of a sour reason I guess. I'm not that bothered by the guy, and a part of me really feels sad for him as he may indeed have some mental problems.

<p>I'll send that off to Android79 or one of the others to allow them to post it as I think I banged the drum pretty hard already and don't want to use up more than my share of diff's.

After all, he is a relatively contemporary person who didn't get payed to play baseball and never released any charted pop albums. Anyway, there seems to be no explicit reference to Nygren in the encyclical. Is that because he is one of them Lutheran heretics, or do these things never explicitly reference contemporary or recent authors?

<dd>I think that she has been beatified but not canonized, so she's "the blessed Theresea" to be precise. Perhaps this is a sign of Benedict's intentions. I can't believe he's being sloppy.

<p>Hi, thanks for taking a look at this problem. The comment you mentioned on his page was only left by the administrator <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> <i>after</i> I made this latest complaint.</p>
<p>Here are the IPs I know of that he has used. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=211.30.205.254" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=211.30.205.254" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=202.147.110.6" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=202.147.110.6" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=203.222.154.162" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=203.222.154.162" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=211.30.215.91" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=211.30.215.91" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> These are the ones that started following my edits, starting in September (the second one is mostly a list of articles I had been editing). You will see the same pattern of articles that match my own by dates. I stopped editing between sometime in late October and early January, so I don't know what other IPs he might have used in the meantime.</p>
<p>The other connection running through the IPs is a focus on Chinese-related articles, specifically negative edits pertaining to the Falun Gong on pages like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Epoch_Times_4753.html" title="The Epoch Times">The Epoch Times</a></i>.</p>
<p>Now, September is when he first became a problem. Initially it was just a matter of his personal attacks and POV pushing, some of which I noticed and reverted. Because I didn't satisfactorily discuss a particular article with him, <i>I</i> was blocked by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">User:Rama</a>. I made a post on ANI about this, which mostly focuses on Rama's actions. I don't have the diff (it was in September) but it's archived. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive44#Don.27t_mind_the_committee.2C_there.27s_a_new_sheriff_in_town" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive44#Don.27t_mind_the_committee.2C_there.27s_a_new_sheriff_in_town" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the anon IPs started to follow my edits (and sometimes others') and harass and insult various users. Here are just a few examples. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803544" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803544" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803761" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:PainMan&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22803761" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22655733&amp;oldid=22633876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22655733&amp;oldid=22633876" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22802457&amp;oldid=22778332" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22802457&amp;oldid=22778332" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22733472&amp;oldid=22695237" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=22733472&amp;oldid=22695237" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=24236550&amp;oldid=24226036" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Epoch_Times&amp;diff=24236550&amp;oldid=24226036" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> Phrases like, "fuck off and die", "retarded", "Americocrap", etc. One that I recall (but can't find ATM) is, "I piss on your bloody Americrap flag." As you mentioned, one of the IPs was warned several times for this, and blocked. He evaded the block by using another IP, and never discussed or apologized for the remarks. Rama chose to ignore the whole situation once my block was over (and artificially extended), and after a few more weeks I stopped editing because I did not have time to mess with it.</p>
<p>A little later, <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">User:PatCheng</a> was created, and first edits on November 1 with <i>talk</i> messages to Rama's page and another user complaining about me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evilphoenix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27047069" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evilphoenix&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27047069" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27047250" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27047250" rel="nofollow">[37]</a></p>

<p>So the account is started to post talk comments which reference my dispute with him specifically, and is only used a few more times during the remainder of the year, reverting the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Cuba_8a0d.html" title="Human rights in Cuba">Human rights in Cuba</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> articles, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Apprentice_4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33549934" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Apprentice_4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=33549934" rel="nofollow">trolling</a> a talk page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PatCheng" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PatCheng" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> January sees the beginning of renewed activity for "PatCheng", when I started editing again. Both PatCheng and this anon start moving "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Gun_Ri_incident_7601.html" title="No Gun Ri incident">No Gun Ri incident</a>" to "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Gun_Ri_massacre_7755.html" title="No Gun Ri massacre">No Gun Ri massacre</a>".

The page warns that longer messages get ignored, which this was. Unfortunately, shorter messages mean "I need more evidence". So, happily, I have obliged.</p>
<p>It has gotten to the point now where, for a few weeks, I have been forced to revert several articles daily just for my edits to stay on the site at all. This has led several times to other users complaining to me that I am engaging in an inappropriate edit war and my having to explain every single time that something else is going on.</p>

<dd>Thanks for spotting that, Android! I've blocked Bishounen indefinitely as an impostor/too similar. I guess the confusing part came because I had already created the Bishounen userpages, long time ago, and redirected them to mine (in case somebody was looking for me and misspelled). The account may have been created without any bad intentions, though if so the redirects must have made them sense something wasn't right. Now to keep an eye out for the autoblocker and unblock if Bishounen tries to edit under another name. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC).

<dd>(Tearing up) You made a cheese stub for VÃ¤sterbottenost! Marry me! Yes, anything like that is the same cheese.

Google hits aren't everything, but. The W- spelling is an "olden" affectation, better not use it at all. <i>Westerbottensost</i>, incidentally, gets 693 hits, purely from being a protected (=stupid Ye Olde) brand name.

<li>Don't worry, Paul, the FAC discussion was sometime in Late Neolithic â August, I think. If it was on FAC <i>now</i>, I'm sure yours is far from the only objection it would generate.

<p>I must be out of the mainstream. It's astonishingly obvious, the things being debated and debated and debated on wp:ani. I mean, it's not even partially murky, and yet the glyph of silence is over the whole thing. I wrote 3 articles, and no one put categories on them, despite my leaving them off on purpose. No one even patted my head! Then I tried to tell that Elonka lady to calm down and that that's about all that's needed, and no one noticed -- might as well have passed gas in a hurricane. &lt;sigh&gt; Oh, I'm sure I'm just leaving them all in stunned silence. That <i>must</i> be it. Folks just need a way to save face. They can't admit that they were as wrong as the notorious airman who flew to Ireland from New York when he was trying to get to San Fransisco. Pride. I'm sure that's it. Why don't people think? Is it <i>that</i> painful? Hurts me, too, but I figure it's worth the pain. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:24, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dearest Bishonen,</p>
<p>Life's becoming very dull indeed around here. On behalf of us all I have been denobbling Dukes for most of the day. and dealing with those who are afraid I am personally spearheading a revolution of subterfuge to rid the world of the British upper class - heaven forbid!. Including <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> who is behaving rather strangely at the moment, I do hope he is alright, keeps agreeing a page has no content but apparently the subject's wife was rather big in robes - negligees presumably. That nice <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunch of Grapes</a> popped in from Idaho (he dives a horse drawn buggy you know and has lots of wives - which must be difficult for him) anyhow he came over to plead for one of your banners. Well, he was too shy to ask outright but I knew what he wanted - so I gave him one. Unfortunately he made a rather insensitive comment on my page implying the non notable members of the peerage may be rather stupid - of course I'm speechless. I've tried to help poor <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> too today - between ourselves I think he has a problem. Hardly surprising he's in ....er Georgia, and the Caucasus must be so cold at this time of year - he must realise it's just a side effect of the cold. And then just to crown it (pardon the noble pun) all poor <a href="../../../o/l/g/Olga_Rudge_ddd9.html" title="Olga Rudge">Olgababy</a> has disappeared from the FAC page - well as you know I'm not one to bear a grudge - especially when people have such problems already, one hardly likes to add to them. I'm sure ALoan will be better soon, least said soonest mended that's my motto. I'm about to start a new series on lesser known members of the Sicilian peerage can't let the Brits have it all their own way do you know poor old Xavier Stefano Jesus Maria Purgatorium - Marizini, 9th Duke of Chiaramonte does not have one single google mention - well we can soon fix that - c'mon all hands to the deck we have a peerage to write here. I see <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> has just started on my tail on the Duke's lets see if we can complete the Sicilian peerage before he thinks of suitable names for them all.</p>

<dd>Ruud, you make a great point. There is far too much cowboy attitude going on.

<p>I don't intend to provide the diffs. I don't think it would be fair. People can either try and find them themselves of have the admin. they deserve.

<dd>Are you talking to me? (This is my page.) Are you talking to Giano? Whichever it is, have you heard of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks</a> policy? You shouldn't say things like "evil" on Wikipedia, especially about people you don't know. We're not evil for saying what we think. What's wrong with R.D.H. in my opinion is that he's uncivil. Have you seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27284363this" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=27284363this" rel="nofollow">this rant</a> he posted? Do you think admins ought to talk like that? R.D.H. is a good contributor in some ways, but I don't think he has the right temperament, or judgment, to be suitable as an admin. I also don't like it that he has never been even remotely civil to me before today, but now that he's up for adminship, and has seen from Giano's page that I've spotted it (so that he can guess I may oppose him for his rudeness that I've seen so much of), he's suddenly all over me with fine compliments, and all over Giano, too. Look at <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">User talk:Giano</a> and you'll see these compliments. At the same time R.D.H. is insulting Giano on other pages. That to me is not a sincere person. Giano writes "That RfA" in the headline because he's replying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=37752832&amp;oldid=37750717" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=37752832&amp;oldid=37750717" rel="nofollow">my post here</a>. Giano and I use these mysterious headlines because we don't want to mention R.D.H. in nasty ways and embarrass him all over the place.

<p>Showing me what R.D.H. has written has changed my mind significantly. Thanks for showing it to me for I now know what's going on &amp; I agree with <i>him</i> totally! His comments are well put &amp; show no real personal attacks. As for the ranting, it sounded more like an annoyed exclamation to me... I said you sounded evil from the way you seemed to talk (Giano I mean) in a secret code with the "That RfA". R.D.H. isn't one to grease up to someone just because he's on RfA, which he doesn't really care if he gets in or not. You &amp; Giano &amp; everyone else who's names I can't remember are all blowing everything out of preportion. Let it go &amp; lets be civil. Forget the past, whatever it may be, but I'm suspecting it boiled up about the Tony1 RfA.

<dd>Not completely true...first, rope beds were common until the early twentieth century arrived and they were replaced by box springs. So, while yes, they were common in Shakespeare's time they were in use for a good while after that as well. Also, the matresses were not secured to the frame by the ropes, but the ropes are what the matress rested upon. I have lain on a rope bed and can attest that they are damn comfortable. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 17:40, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know, I've populated it with 25. I left Theophilus for you, but I had to jump in to grab Colley. It occurs to me that I won't run out of biographies to do for a long, long time. First, every figure in the category of Pope's Dunces (as soon as there are non-Pope dunces...read on) needs a <i>real</i> biography (some inexplicable 1911's remain like Elizabeth Heywood and Susanna Centlivre). Second, when I finish with the Pope dunces, I can open up my books of Swift. If I live long enough to finish all <i>those,</i> I can go back to Greene's edition of <i>The political writings of Samuel Johnson.</i> If I finish with <i>those,</i> I can take a summer trip to a real library where I can get my hands on Mist's Journal or the Bond edition of Spectator. Oh, and there are all of Fielding's plays! It's a big century with a big sky above it. People are surprised that I can find people to write about.

<dd>A <i>tillfÃ¤llesdikt</i> was a poem for a particular occasion, such as a death, marriage or something. It was sometimes written by a friend or family member, sometimes by a professional poet (well, as professional as they ever were at the time), for immediate payment or in the expectation of some later advantage if the occasion involved some influential family or person. Many Swedish poets of the 17th and 18th centuries supported themselves through writing that kind of poetry, including some of the best known ones such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Michael_Bellman_234a.html" title="Carl Michael Bellman">Carl Michael Bellman</a>, who would also parody the genre (as he parodied everything else) in his other poems and songs. (No point, I guess, in mentioning <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lasse_Lucidor_da09.html" title="Lasse Lucidor">Lasse Lucidor</a>, Johan Runius or Israel HolmstrÃ¶m, as they will all be red.

<p>Poor <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompe.html" title="Pompe">Pompe</a> used to have a substub here, but the page was redirected to a <i>disease</i> by somebody with no interest in the history of Royal Swedish Dogdom. There is actually quite a bit written on that dog both in contemporary sources and by later writers such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verner_von_Heidenstam_ef9f.html" title="Verner von Heidenstam">Heidenstam</a>.</p>
<p>HolmstrÃ¶m had a weakness for dead royal pets. He also wrote <i>Grafskrift Ã¶fwer Kung Carl XII:s BjÃ¶rn, som fÃ¶ll genom en glugg och slog ihjÃ¤l sig</i>, "Epitaph over King Charles XII's bear which fell through a hole and was killed"; apparently the bear had had a bit too much Spanish wine at dinner and stumbled to his death. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 15:14, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>He did a few dead pet poems, too. You'd have to go through the full <i>Works</i> to find them, though. He also did epitaphs on famous loves, like the Stanton-Harcourt Lovers, who were wooing when a thunderstorm came on. They sheltered under a tree and were hit by lightning and killed. He wrote three epitaphs for them. The first two are long and sincere and lachrymose. The last is:</p>

<p>Hey, Bishonen, I wanted to thank you for your support of my (unfortunately unsuccessful) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Matt_Yeager_6f76.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Matt Yeager">request for adminship</a>. The final tally was 37/16/5, which fell short of the needed 75-80% for "consensus". Your very kind words and thought-out reasoning for your vote really meant a lot to me. What really struck me was how even though my RFA was pretty much a lost cause at that point, you still gave a reasoned, thoughtful vote for me, which made me feel an awful lot better. I don't know if or when I'll go up for nomination again, but even if I don't, I will try not to betray the trust that you and 36 others were willing to place in me. Thanks for having faith in me... and happy editing!

<dd>Since you ask, I will share my thoughts bluntly. I approve of selfnoms. But you express a special regard for the (IMO) three most abused policies/principles in this place, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and "adminship should be no big deal", so you'll hardly find me or those who think like me supporting you. I never yet met a wikilawyering troll who didn't have his/her mouth hypocritically full of those three â indeed, those often seem to be the only polices they've heard of. If applied from good motives (which I'm sure you would do!) those three policies/principles may be beneficial, but I still believe them to be <i>less</i> important than half a dozen others. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:32, 8 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Cool, thanks for the blunt advice. BTW, I'm taking the liberty of correcting my original post for my new page location. I've also reworked it a bit. I would like to clarify though, I think that AGF and NPA in particular are so important because they're most often ignored. When you look at some of the users that on wikipedia that you most respect, do you ever even once or twice see them violating AGF and NPA? Not me. Hence my adoption of those as my role models. Rest assured I'm applying them from good motives. The no big deal is less of a thing for me, and I've edited my test application to reflect this.

<p>Rather than get into the discussion on the talk page, I thought I'd respond here. When I said tragedy, I meant that him being gone <i>at all</i> is a tragedy, as he does a lot of good work. As for "the last thing he'd want" I was referring to the edit warring; I'm sure he'd want his page returned to his version, but I think he'd rather have both sides discuss it rather than have an edit war.</p>
<p>Beyond just wanting to see the edit war stop, there was a call for stewards to get involved, and I was hoping to prevent a repeat of Sunday night.

<dd>Well, that was three <i>errors of date,</i> I should have said. It had errors of interpretation like you wouldn't believe. First, it had a list of her "best" plays (oh, that's good), and it characterized her as "crude, as was the fashion of those times." It managed three errors of chronology, two major NPOV violations, and a value-laden list all in an article that was about the length of a stub. Then there were errors of omission: it glibly took information for Jacob, which was her own version of her story, without acknowledging that it might not be reliable. It didn't explain how she went from poor dissenter girl to playwright. She was blasted by Pope on three occasions, I gather, although I'm only concerned with <i>The Dunciad.</i> Swift never swiped at her -- his enemies usually being more abstract and less personal -- but she was a big, juicy target for the Tory wits, as she not only took extremist Whig positions but rubbed people's noses in it after the fact. How could you <i>not</i> satirize her? I can't think of a satirical play that she features in and didn't run across any mentions (the DNB author was a fan, and it's dangerous to be anything else these days, lest one be the m-word). She's too late for my buddy Gould to have swatted, but he sure would have, if he'd been writing then (the three marriages would have been enough for him, and the breeches roles would have given him fodder, too). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:11, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both the onions and fruitcake are World Famous, and both are trademarked. The first is much sought after by chefs throughout the civilized world (and Sweden, too). The latter was formerly more popular than presently. Why, every year the former town producing 50,000,000 lbs. of granex onions from an unique soil condition rendered sweet to the taste.

<p>I wonder if you have any insight on how technically to deal with something. I think semi-protection should be used massively more than it is; but that's probably not going to happen. Anyway, I mentioned this certain vandal that I seem to have attracted to my talk page via maintaining the Ward Churchill page. The thing that was most troublesome about the vandalism is that this person (under ever changing usernames, but often related names along the lines of our friend "fighterforfreedom") would blank the page and replace it with, e.g. 500 copies of a picture of Bush.</p>
<p>The result, unfortunately, of this change is that I can <i>never</i> seem to load the diff to see specifically what the change is, presumably because the WP server times out before sending all that graphic data. Some other editors rolled back the vandalism of this type to my user page or user talk page, but I don't know if they had actually seen the diff, or just assumed the worst. The thing is that I <b>can</b> view the diff: "Vandal-&gt;Reversion" (because the page itself, below the diff, is reasonable); I just can't view the diff: "Good-&gt;Vandal". You were one such reverter, I think, so maybe you have insight.</p>
<p>I just found an example of the same thing on the Churchill page. A user, "Mr.Trezon" (but it'll be a different name next time), made this change, with the edit history comment like "minor spelling fix" or something innocuous seeming. I simply could not load the diff to see if it really was a proper change or if it was vandalism. As it happened, the same username had made a comment on the talk page that made me fairly sure (overtly claiming to praise Churchill, but obviously meant sarcastically). So I rolled back to the last version, but with less than perfect confidence I was reverting an actual vandal. Once I made the reversion, I could look at the prior diff, which proved my guess correct. But I don't like reverting blindly.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:29, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Insight, haha, that'll be the day. Sorry, Lulu. I never have reverted your page, at least not in the past month or two; I'm only in the history for writing you about Fighterforfreedom a few times. Indeed, if I couldn't load a diff, I wouldn't be bold enough to revert. I hope you get more useful replies from other people. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:12, 11 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Oh, sorry I remembered wrong about the reversion (it wasn't either praise or condemnation to say you had, just a mistake based on the fact we had chatted about FFF around the same time some editors reverted his/her vandalism on my talk page... of course, I hereby praise you in a general way for your fine adminship&#160;:-)). Anyway... maybe someone else will have a better answer; it's frustrating not to be able to load the diffs; and it doesn't really make sense to me. Even though 500 copies of an image (or whatever) is a long page, the image itself should only download once into the browser cache. So the timeout perplexes me (but it's very consistent for this situation). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 19:37, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Bishonen. I am curious on what attracted your interest to this article, as it has been a while since last round of massive edits. If the article reads as a hagiography, I would be the first one to want to know about it. I haver put too much effort in this article to let it be in a shape that can be challenged as non-compliant with content policies. I hope I did not scare your away with my commentâalthough I doubt that you are scared off easily if one is to judge by your contributions to the project:). So, could you please point out what other sections need improvements? It will be much appreciated. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">â jossi â</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> â¢ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 01:52, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bishonen, Hi from me too. I wonder if you would please take the time to read the argument between Jossi and me that started when Momento said that the only criticism against Rawat is that he's fat, has poor taste, etc. I answered that it was much more than that, that he once claimed to be the Lord and Saviour of Mankind. Jossi said he didn't, I provided the proof and Jossi kept denying that I had proven anything. I'm curious what you think of the relative merits of that argument. Thanks --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.69.14.159.html" title="User:24.69.14.159">24.69.14.159</a> 03:45, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, that was just a "typing at 7:00 AM" phenomenon. Christopher is who I meant, and my notes had "Ch Rich," relying on my memory to expand it properly. Well, not at 7:00 AM.

<p>Hey, I got a detail of the toilet paper spindle from Hogarth for that article, although I didn't contribute otherwise, except with hints. I have a book of Hogarth prints that I do scans from, sometimes. The advantage is that I can do some <i>very</i> high resolution scans, so one can make out the smallest feature in a crowded lithograph, but, of course, I'm lazy, and there are already scans of <i>The Rake's Progress</i> and <i>The Harlot's Progress</i> on the web, so why bother? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:22, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I think I'm done now. I might do two more, but that's it. I'm getting tired of writing new articles for a while. Then I'll look into buffing up. I think I'll finish <i>Dunciad</i>, start researching some of the 100's of secondaries, adding dozens of notes, and then move it forward. If it goes to FAC, no one will be able to read it. Everyone will say it's too long. At the same time, it'll be a good place for anyone actually studying the poem. We're already the best place to find out who all the targets are. I don't think anyone understands what's necessary for understanding a poem like that or a book like the <i>Tale</i>. A person can spend a decade just getting who and what the poem is talking about and then another half century dealing with the poetics involved. It's a thousand miles away from the plastic self-evidencies and disposable commodities of contemporary culture. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:21, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bishonen, thanks for your interest in Prem Rawat. I had and have endless disagreements with Jossi on this article. Numerous RFc have been filed without result.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:53, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the purpose of disclosure, please note that Andries has admitted publicly that he his a "POV pusher" (see diff: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19511011" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19511011" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>) as it pertains to articles related to purported cults, gurus and the like, due to a personal tragedy that he experienced with a guru in his past. The only reason for our disagreements is his attempt to advocate a negative POV in related articles. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">â jossi â</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> â¢ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 00:04, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>An outsider who wants to remain one, here: the NPA thing ("personal attacks are blocking offenses," I mean) isn't <i>quite</i> policy, and it doesn't <i>quite</i> govern talk pages. It is, of course, never a good idea to engage in personal attacks, insults, etc., but there are several statutory problems with the guidelines at present that make implementing it as a policy vexatious. While I would agree with anyone who says, "Cut it out, knock it off, quit it, and cease and desist," I would similarly urge those wielding the NPA knife to be aware that it is terribly blunt, has no handle, and has a tendency to increase rather than staunch the flow of blood. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:43, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments, Geogre. Have you ever been the subject of verbal abuse? Personal attacks harm the very basis of this project. FYI, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is an official policy of Wikipedia, and a crucial one IMO. I know that blocking for PA is controvresial, buit I would not hesitate in blocking any user that abuses other editors if their behavior is recurrent and disruptive. Hope that you would agree with me on this. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">â jossi â</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> â¢ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 03:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose I have, but I look at it differently from most people. As I was saying, though, user talk pages are slightly shady, and blocking is slightly shady, but I quite agree that it is policy not to make them. I also agree with you that you should not be the subject of them, and I condemn those making them. Again, we have no disagreement there, but I've seen the overuse of the policy's non-policy part, and generally what happens is that things get worse rather than better. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:58, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bishonen, I want to thank you for your courage to go into the hornet's nest and I fully understand that you could not endure it for very long. In relation to that I would like to ask you some questions about the article. What do you think that the ranking is of the Prem Rawat article in the following lists in the whole of the English Wikipedia.
<ol>
<li>Most disputed</li>
<li>Most abusive talk page</li>
<li>Most reverted</li>
<li>Article with the highest ratio arguing on the talk page divided by useful edits</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Another question, do you think that the Prem Rawat article is just an example of what is yet to come for many articles on Wikipedia or is it just an unfortunate exception?

<dd>Most abusive? You've got to be kidding me. Or else you don't edit much in topics touching on nationalism or Israel or religion or gender or, for god's sake, <i>linguistics</i>. You ain't seen abusive till you've seen a language talk page, or one of the nightmarish RFCs based on them &lt;cough&gt;<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antifinnugor_b73f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antifinnugor">Requests for comment/Antifinnugor</a>&lt;cough&gt;. Heck, <i>most</i> posts on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Talk%7EPrem_Rawat_f4e1.html" title="Talk:Prem Rawat">Talk:Prem Rawat</a> are perfectly civil! No, but your other three lists, yes, Prem Rawat would rank sadly high on those. I'd put good money on it in the arguing/useful edits stakes. I don't know how you do it, Andries, keeping on and on trying to improve such a well-policed, clamped-down, always-bouncing-back piece. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC).

Ahhhhhh! <b>Correction</b> from our earlier correspondence: it was Welstead who wrote <i>The Prophecy</i> that I read. That's good, because I thought at the time that the poem was quite good, and I was afraid that a bad poet like Tutchin had fooled me. Instead, it was a <i>good</i> poet who had fooled me with a good poem. (Anyone want to sponsor my editing a collection entitled "The Dunces?"

<dd>See, now <b>this</b> is the way to get me to finish the article. &#160;:-) Jossi has been fixing a lot of my dumber mistakes (thanks, man), and that makes me <i>read</i> it, and when I <i>read</i> it, I think of things to say, and I think of people I haven't explained, and that makes me want to crack the spine of the book again and do a quick jaunt through the end of Bk IV and then Explain It All before going back to grab secondaries (a storehouse of books in my head/ Forever reading never to be read). One thing is clear, though: before I do it, I have to fix <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza_Haywood_a322.html" title="Eliza Haywood">Eliza Haywood</a>. Until I do that, there is a hole in what has already been built, because the existing article is a 1911 dump, and it does nothing at all to explain why she'd have gotten herself into the Dunciad. (And now I have to remember who wrote <i>Harlequin Dr. Faustus</i> -- it was Theobbald, I think.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Harlequin Dr. Faustus</i> was written by no one (Wilks, Cibber, and Booth), but what I was trying to remember was that <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Carey_%28writer%29_59c1.html" title="Henry Carey (writer)">Henry Carey (writer)</a> (which needs to be <b>cleaned up</b> I understand to "conform to a higher standard of quality") wrote the music for it. I therefore had to amend <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dunciad_5549.html" title="The Dunciad">The Dunciad</a></i> to point out that plays that like were loathed by Pope, but that doesn't mean he wasn't friends or friendly with some of the stiffs who worked on them. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Last chance to read <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza_Haywood_a322.html" title="Eliza Haywood">Eliza Haywood</a> before I rewrite it.

<p>Is there a suitable template for images that do have both source and a license, but you doubt the license is correct?

What is the correct forum for this type of things?

<p>I've never been happier that I chose to go to Carolina for my doctorate. My leading alternative at that time was Rochester, where a certain person would have been my dissertation advisor. Well, that person wrote the <i>DNB</i> article on Haywood, and...words fail me. Then I read an article on <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Canning_c59e.html" title="Elizabeth Canning">Elizabeth Canning</a>, since the Haywood article mentioned that the Canning case would bother Henry Fielding until the end of his life, and that was written by a nice, antique, British positivist who told me the facts and <i>got out of the way,</i> as opposed to the Haywood author, who told the life entirely out of order (by genre instead of time) and kept quoting secondary sources for evaluations of how <i>wonderful</i> and <i>important</i> and <i>central</i> Haywood is, how elaborately Haywood is investigating gender, how everything she wrote was a pure invention, how all her works are pioneering, etc. Blug. It may take me a long time to rewrite the Haywood article, as I have to construct an actual article out of the information I got (which was incomplete, disjointed, and impassioned). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:12, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, she did that big Defoe biography. I'm glad she wasn't my advisor. I haven't read the Defoe biography, as all reports were that it suffered from over-reading and over-study, but the <i>DNB</i> article was a little less wide eyed than the Critics but not much. She showed <i>some</i> awareness of the rest of the world of 18th c. literature and so mediates some of the "she is the first woman to write a marriage novel!!!!!" stuff the critics want to pass off, but she still repeats it, ringing the bell and telling us to ignore it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With a title like this, <i>A Wife to be Lett</i> (1724) sure could be misogynistic. I found myself in difficulty in explaining Pope's attack. He seems to be suggesting that she's a whore in person as well as in writing. Given the way he treats the men, that's hardly a shocking attack (eating feces, urinating over one's head, diving in sewers? compared to that an allegation of whoring is a positive compliment), and I don't need to free him from charges of misogyny anyway -- he needs no defense at this late date when we eagerly forgive Nietzsche and Yeats. Still, I didn't find enough from the DNB to explain the particulars of Pope's inclusion of Haywood. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bish, I've been trying to follow up on my previous stuff, but there are a couple of WP pages that just don't work from my home machine. It's aggravating. These tend to be the long pages (reference desk), but not always (FAC): the pages get to a certain point and then just stop. Now, it could be a Mozilla issue. It could be a dirty code (someone's got an HTML code in their comment that effectively does a virtual divide by zero), but, whatever it is, it stops me. Oh, and then I get blocked again because of some twit on AOL. Blug.

<p>I've been thinking a good <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fool%27s_Day_5641.html" title="April Fool's Day">April Fool's Day</a> joke this year would be to move the <a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a> and replace it with a detailed, factual, well-researched article about Main Pages, conforming to every Wikipedia stylistic convention and clichÃ©.

<dd>The Criticisms section looks plausible, but not too accessible. Donât forget, though, that Wales, Pellegrini and I all say the article should be as factual as any other -- not something that would reside exclusively at <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> from April 2 on. In JW's own words:
<dl>
<dd>First, last year we had a big long ongoing fight between people who wanted to have a hoax front page or hoax story on the front page and people who didn't. It was icky.</dd>
<dd>Second, I believe that simply doing a hoax front page is too lame for Wikipedians. We're too smart for that! We need humor with layers of complexity.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, what I'm advocating for is a main page which is all 100% true in every respect, but filled with things which are so outlandish that people *assume* that it's a joke/hoax. We get 1,000 extra points if we manage to have a mainstream news source report that we had put up a fake home page for the day. Now *that* would be cool.</dd>

<p>Well, then never mind it all. I'm not particularly interested in the project. Satire is much more interesting than shuffling dullness about in new and fascinating ways.

<p>He does! How strange that whoever wrote it didn't take the opportunity to engage in a little criticism. I always regard articles on characters as being justifiable only when they have such a strong standing in culture as being symbols outside of their works, and Joseph K is certainly one of those. I.e. it shouldn't be merged, but only because Joseph K, like Gregor Samsa, is a semi-frequent pop allusion, but it's an allusion <i>because of his associations</i> with victimization by the faceless machine of the law, the meaningless of the individual, the alienation of the late capitalist civilization, the dissociation of the self inherent in a society with an overly developed ethical (not moral) sense, etc. Anyhow, it's one of those things. Some people create articles because they heard of the name, some because the name is important for contemporary cultural literacy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:42, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take a look at the cool piccie that's there now! See, this is my problem: the photos that were found in 1930 are half the story, and I'm in two minds whether it's ok to use them. Not that I care so much that the AndrÃ©e Museum in GrÃ¤nna asserts copyright; museums always do. Nils Strindberg who took the pictures died in 1897, so in that sense it's cut-and-dried: public domain by virtue of age. BUT, the photos had to be treated, perhaps extensively, certainly with expertise, to come out at all, after the exposed film had been sitting in the snow for 30 years. Nice special problem, huh? I've got the name of the guy who treated them, and his nationally very well-known institution KTH, in there now. I'm very unsure of this. I would so much love to be able to do an article with a wealth of great pictorial material for once!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, Tyrone Martinsson, that I also mention now, has recently made <i>better</i> versions of Strindberg's photos. Those are copyright, no doubt, but that's not a big deal, as long as I can use the 1930 versions. My lead piccie is one of those, in fact if I understand it right, it's been scanned from a 1930s magazine issue. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ãã¼ã</a> 13:55, 27 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>That is a special <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tutchin_3a80.html" title="John Tutchin">bloody pickle</a>. However, the question is whether print or photograph is at stake. Is it process or image? If the latter, you're well in the clear. If the former, you're close at nearly 80 years. Then again, is it "image" as in "artifact" or "image" as in "film record?" I think it may well be artifact.&#160;:-( However, if you wanted to make a case to a museum to GFDL 'em, it would be an easy case: "Let us have 'em, and you'll see your tourism from English speakers go way up." Then again, museums are known for being short sighted and officious and rule-bound. I don't know which way the cracker breaks on this one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:04, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Bunch, I will! If I understand it, the photos, 93 of them, currently exist in three versions: 1) the unretouched rolls of film, largely used by Jan Troell in the documentary <i>Their Frozen Dream</i>, getting mileage out of the "aesthetic quality of worn, damaged and dated objects" according to Martinsson, 2) the retouched paper prints produced in 1930, held by Grenna Museum which claims copyright in them, and 3) recent digital versions enhanced from the original negatives made by Martinsson, who claims, and of course holds, copyright in them. (Take a look <a href="http://www.biad.uce.ac.uk/research/rti/riadm/issue6/images/tm11.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.biad.uce.ac.uk/research/rti/riadm/issue6/images/tm11.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if you will, at the amazing <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panorama.html" title="Panorama">panorama</a> obviously planned by Strindberg but never discovered until Martinsson studied the material!) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ãã¼ã</a> 22:03, 27 February 2006 (UTC).

Except you <i>didn't</i> reverse it. You just blanked the "White Power", without reverting the IP's blanking of the warnings. Even without going into the question whether that IP was you (which seems overwhelmingly likely in view of the "conversation" you went on to have with it), you're responsible for the partial revert which endorsed the IP's so-convenient blanking.

<dd>Mmmm delish, thank you! It looks perfect, I can even see the little <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardamom.html" title="Cardamom">cardamom</a> spots in the bun. Is it from Ofvandahls?

<dd>I suppose there may be enough to say about Ofvandahls to warrant an article, if one finds some of the literary references. I know Ulf Peder Olrog wrote about it, but there must be others. Erik Ofvandahl (1848-1949) himself is also a figure of interest - I don't think any other person in Swedish literary history is as famous as he is for writing bad poetry (what is <i>pekoralpoet</i> in English?). The biographer in SBL explains the character of his poetry as deriving from "the lack of style that comes from a total lack of poetic talent and literary judgment" (etc.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 11:26, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's OK I have to go and do some proper work now, someone just came in unannounced and I had to slide a boxing book surreptitiously off my lap and into the paper basket underneath the desk, and from the look I could tell they thought I was doing something else in my lap! BoG didnt like one of the refs going to a message board, so at vast expense I have just bought Gilbert Odd's Encyclopedia of Boxing (Yes! - BoG I may well send you the bill, especially if the fact I want is not in the bloody book) Which means there will be a lot more boxing bios to come, in order to get my money's worth - the things I do for this project <i>winge winge</i> - I could have bought it the money I have spent on books - no wonder I'm so poor. So please edit, I am off to sudy defects in 1930s concrete, and laws on maintenance and inspecting it - real interesting stuff. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 11:16, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's all right, I'm really prepping for a class, I only wanted to do a couple of examples of references to show how short and simple the footnotes can then be kept. Look at the first three notes now. In fact they're so simple that many of them can with advantage be replaced by a mention in the text. I did that for one of the first four notes, removed the note itself and just mentioned Anderson. Assuming you don't actually <i>like</i> to have the thing peppered with 37 footnotes or however many there were, this can help you cut them by maybe half, if you like. Never mind, let ALoan or BoG do it... (Who said that?

<p>They didn't dig a hole to bury Strindberg. The SBL bio says that the Norwegians in August 1930 found "AndrÃ©es stora dagbok samt hans och Strindbergs lik, det senare begravt av hans kamrater i en bergskreva." Most of the SBL article is about the expedition rather than FrÃ¦nkel himself; he hadn't done much else in his life. Actually, it mentions that he painted ("Han var Ã¤ven landskapsmÃ¥lare."), but gives no details.

<dd>Ok, I'm going to say this, and hopefully I can say it only once. I'm conflict averse, so I don't intend to put it on any FAC's.
<dl>
<dd><b>Begin utterance:</b> The changes that Tony1 wants, in general, would make our articles far less compelling. In general, he asks articles to conform to a style sheet used in <i>business</i> in the US. These changes reduce sentence variation, alter the rhythm of the sentences, and reduce complexity. The goal of business writing is to achieve a fifth grade reading level, and the style sheet he is using is pernicious in that it would have all vocabulary, verb variation, and periodic structures squashed down to a predictable, and therefore <i>boring</i> level. Furthermore, his repeated calls for a "copy editor" are references to a particular economic position created by the capitalist classes to contain their superfluous intellectuals. The intellectual is a danger. Too many of them are very dangerous. Capitalism creates jobs that feign exchanging bread for intelligence in order to contain, to channel, and to control intellectualism. "Copy editors" who embrace their calling as a noble pursuit are fully integrated into the capitalist scheme, wholly owned, colonized, and impregnated by the values of merchandize and commodity. Were they thoughtful, they'd realize that their "intellectual" activity is mainly to reduce human variation. <i>No single style sheet can be applied to a large document.</i> This should be self-evident. The narrower and more prescriptive the style sheet, the less of a document it can comprehend satisfactorily, and the style sheets Tony1 wishes to apply are narrow even by the standards of the primmest school marm. It is not the man that I condemn, but the practice. All of this said, there is yet a final comment, however, on the practice that I have to make: SOFIXIT. It is easier to make stylistic changes than to ennumerate them in an objection, and the motivation one must have in expending all that energy on an objection cannot be salutory. <b>End utterance.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Sorry, Bishonen, for putting this here, but having seen Tony1's objections to <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a> on FAC, I reached a tipping point.

<dd>Well, sorry about that. Giano was complaining about the death by a thousand cuts being administered by some people with small knives (and no point), I think, and he mentioned the Tony1 editing standards. I don't know anything about the Mistress Magdaline of the Crumpets or whoever that is, but I tried to read FAC to get over doing a New Pages patrol, and obviously high quality articles were getting "object" from Tony1 over the most boring and counter-productive things that it was ticking me off. In fact, all of his "objections" seemed to be not on stylistic grounds but on style sheet grounds, and yet they were there as "not compelling prose." I just thought the paradox of claiming to want prose to compel when your changes reduce interest was too aggravating not to say <i>something</i> about. Not wanting another fifty interchanges that go nowhere and provoke petulance, I put it here, among friends. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:59, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, before anyone is disappointed, I saw one thing over and over again, and it needed to be said. Unlike the two of you, I didn't think the writing was <i>that</i> bad (no doubt all the voters have been editing out the stinkers), but it's ridiculous to have a verbose encyclopedia article. The length of the article should be related to the needs of the subject. I felt that like overrode anything else. (Perhaps this is part of some campaign I'm on about people who try to write five screen FA's on TV show contestants who got "voted off the island" on episode 2.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:54, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Ok, I see what is going on. I was annoyed that the nomination has gone on this long, I do not consider the FAC process to be fun. I was also annoyed to find oppose votes only hours after returning my library book (inter-library loans - to Chetwynd - take weeks to come through). Worldtraveller, most of your comments have not been actioned upon, <i>not</i> because they are invalid, but because they would require dramatic changes to the way the article is written and formatted. The version you would like to see is not the version that I nominated at FAC and not the version that others had already voted upon. Should this FAC fail, I will make those dramatic changes and re-nominate the new version (I do want to get it right). However, I do not agree with the opinion that there is too much detail. A town is a town, no matter if it has <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor%2C_British_Columbia_f10d.html" title="Taylor, British Columbia">1000</a> or <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">4,000,000</a> people. It does not suddenly mean they do not vote in elections or they do not have a infrastructure, culture or history. Please see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cities_0174.html#Structure_.28format_for_city_template.29" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities#Structure (format for city template)</a> for what sections should be there - you may find that I have been conservative with what I have included and how I formatted the sections. Should this nomination fail based on the length, I will switch to a summary style with links to sub-pages. This will of course create additional content on the insignificant town but this is how Wikipedia has decided to deal with articles that are considered too long. The moderate length (36 kb) of the article was a compromise, do not create sub-pages in exchange for a longer centralized article. Too many footnotes?? Have I been too transparent with the sources I have used? Try fact checking an article (seriously - try any one in the FAC line-up, except <a href="../../../g/l/a/Talk%7EGlacier_retreat_b64f.html#Questions_posted_to_my_talk_page" title="Talk:Glacier retreat">Glacier retreat</a> which I have already done), perhaps you will gain a new perspective of footnoting.

<li>You see "what's going on"? Excuse me? What <i>is</i> going on, according to you? I'm sorry I "annoyed" you with my oppose vote, another time I'll check the chrystal ball first to see how your library business stands. My advice above probably annoyed you some more, please feel free to remove it from your page, and thank you for assuming I have nefarious motives for spending time on your article. I have no idea what those motives are â watching you squirm? I'm supposed to hate you? I'm in some sort of alliance with Worldtraveller? What? Never mind, I won't bother you again, I can think of plenty of better ways of spending my wikitime than coping with this kind of suspiciousness. And, seriously, has it occurred to you that people who <i>were</i> doing some sort of plotting or coordinating of efforts (oh, wait, perhaps because they're anti-Canadian?) would doubtless use e-mail for it? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ãã¼ã</a> 07:06, 5 March 2006 (UTC).

<li>Stop...you're embarrassing me. Where did I day I was annoyed at you? You seem to be flustered and reading accusations into things. I said I was annoyed at my rotten luck at taking back the only published book about the history of the Chetwynd too soon.

<ul>
<li>I make no assumptions about you, why would I? I don't know you. I wrote on your page in (friendly) response to your question about notes and references and your reply is to inform me you were "annoyed" to find oppose votes at a late stage, that you "see what is going on"(?), and that as far as footnotes are concerned it's WT, Geogre and I who need to "gain a new perspective of footnoting" (or whoever you're talking to at that point; you did, rather strangely, put the whole thing as a reply to <i>me</i>, on my page). I understand that your FAC process has been frustrating, but biting me for coming late to it and for trying to help seems excessive. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">ãã¼ã</a> 11:12, 5 March 2006 (UTC).
<ul>
<li>Oh damn - apologies to all for inadvertently triggering a dispute. Maclean25, you do seem to be hinting darkly at a conspiracy when you say you see 'what is going on'. I didn't ask or even expect Bishonen or Geogre to agree with any of my comments, actually, and whether they had or not their commenting on the FAC was never going to be anything less than thorough, considered and helpful. We are all interesting in improving the quality of the article, after all. Probably best to discuss the length on the article's talk page or the FAC but I would just briefly say that first of all, is Chetwynd really a city? Are all those headings really necessary for even the tiniest municipality? Second, sure, it has history, culture, etc, but far far less significant, notable and worth describing than that of Sydney, Vancouver, or even Victoria. I think splitting off subarticles would be a bad idea as I would expect the number of people interested in reading or maintaining them would be very very small. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:23, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For my part, it's worth noting that I introduced something entirely separate, and mine <i>should</i> be the most controversial objection. I have taken the same stance elsewhere and will continue to take the view that there are some subjects that, when stretched to get to an FA, are inappropriate. Appomatox, Virginia, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterloo%2C_Belgium_0e87.html" title="Waterloo, Belgium">Waterloo, Belgium</a>, and <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Egypt_ea6a.html" title="Memphis, Egypt">Memphis, Egypt</a> may be large or small towns now, but they have hugely important contexts surrounding them. On the other hand, <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo%2C_New_York_cfe5.html" title="Cairo, New York">Cairo, New York</a> is a medium-sized town that doesn't have much in the past or present. Therefore, talking about a small, small town, one has to either amplify minor aspects or introduce irrelevant aspects. When that town is only 50 years old, there is nothing to do but spend a paragraph on such things as whether ten more people voted this way than that way (out of a population of 2,000) in a given election. Nothing in that article relates the particular to the general, nothing in this article places the article in the context of Canada, history, economics, or the world, and it's not shown to be illustrative in any given way. What there is, then, is a massive discussion of ... of... tourism. You really ought not to feel picked on, as I recently drew controvery over my stance on that Mariah Carey song and the Stargate SG-1 species. We have to obey the dicta of <i>encyclopedias.</i> If there is a conspiracy behind my comments, at least, they're a conspiracy of one. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:25, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
