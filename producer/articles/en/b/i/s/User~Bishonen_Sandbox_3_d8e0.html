<p>Several editors, including Tony Sidaway himself<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=77217778&amp;oldid=77217585" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=77217778&amp;oldid=77217585" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, have suggested merging the recently rejected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77657575#Ghirlandajo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77657575#Ghirlandajo" rel="nofollow">request for arbitration of Ghirlandajo</a> into this case. I agree, as many statements in it address the same matters of principle, and because the Ghirlandajo kerfuffle adds an illuminating perspective on Tony's blocking practices. Notably, Tony's three-hour block of Ghirlandajo on September 5 is the twin of his three-hour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway&amp;page=User%3AGiano" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway&amp;page=User%3AGiano" rel="nofollow">block of Giano</a> nine days later, which has been widely discussed in this case. Note also on September 7, chronologically between the two blocks, Tony's threat to block people for "precisely the kind of nonsense that I blocked Ghirlandajo over"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74426610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=74426610" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>â€”essentially, a general warning against talking back to him.<br />
These blocks + the block warning were all used in the context of dissenting voices in the matter of Carnildo's re-sysopping. Tony's block summaries and block messages suggest strongly that they functioned as "don't-contradict-me" blocks rather than cooling-down blocks. Empirically, they always inflamed rather than cooled down those they were directed at.</p>

<li><b>Block threat</b>. As soon as Carnildo was promoted, discussion broke out on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Carnildo_3_fd7b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Carnildo 3">Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Carnildo 3</a> where several highly-respected editors argued with Tony. He responded with invective, as even a cursory glance at the page will show, and by pointedly reminding his opponents (perhaps specifically Bunchofgrapes, the last person to speak) of Ghirlandajo's block a little earlier. "Hey guys, enough with the warring. This is precisely the kind of nonsense that I blocked Ghirlandajo over: the personalization of differences of opinion to the extent of open warfare."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=74427357&amp;oldid=74426610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_3&amp;diff=74427357&amp;oldid=74426610" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
<li><b>Block 2</b>. Giano posted copiously and angrily about the bureaucrats' decision to re-sysop Carnildo, including on Taxman's talkpage.

Tony posted the block for review on ANI, and it was quickly undone. Tony has implied several times that he meant the block summary to be the equivalent of an invitation to have a nice cup of tea.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop&amp;diff=77720105&amp;oldid=77719726" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop&amp;diff=77720105&amp;oldid=77719726" rel="nofollow">[18]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop/findings_of_fact&amp;diff=78635007&amp;oldid=78632757" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop/findings_of_fact&amp;diff=78635007&amp;oldid=78632757" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Giano's block has received a whirlwind of attention, so I'll just comment briefly on Ghirlandajo's. Since most commentators didn't think Ghirla's original posts uncivil at all, but merely expressions of his opinion in appropriate fora, I argue that Tony's actions in regard to these posts did not quell disruption and belligerence, but instead whipped it up. For a fuller discussion, please see my own earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77657575#Statement_by_uninvolved_party_Bishonen" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77657575#Statement_by_uninvolved_party_Bishonen" rel="nofollow">comment in RFAR Ghirlandajo</a>. I ask ArbCom to find that Tony unreasonably provoked Ghirla into a heated (though not incivil or unreasonable) reply which he, Tony, then blocked him for. Such an action against a prolific content contributor, who's widely regarded as much improved and improving in the way he works with others on the site (please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77657575#Ghirlandajo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77657575#Ghirlandajo" rel="nofollow">the Ghirlandajo RFAR, passim</a>) is quite destructive, however well-intentioned it may be. Also, more importantly, I ask them to find that <b>editors get to "defy" admins</b>; that they're not obliged to choose between meekness under (what they see as) injustice on the one hand, and a block on the other. It is intolerable for admins to present users with such a choice.</p>

<p>Pious platitude or reality? If Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia, content is surely king, and excellent content contributors like Giano and Ghirlandajo will be trusted and respected and nurtured and protected by the community, the admins, and the arbcom. In reality Giano has instead, after a long and cheerful wiki career principally spent at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, met with a series of indignities this year, from Carnildo's infamous "hate speech" block in February, via Fred Bauder's and Charles Matthews' proposal in July to <i>ban</i> him for an impatient remark to a notorious nuisance editor, followed by a 48-hour block and toe-curling condescension from a newbie admin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=72944334&amp;oldid=72909730" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=72944334&amp;oldid=72909730" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> in August ("You do good work here... but the attitude really needs adjustment, my friend." Note that I mean "newbie" as an excuse for the admin, not a criticism of her), to the three-hour block for "hysterical accusations" from Tony Sidaway in September. To see blocks, bans, or threats of this nature as mere potential <i>hindrances from editing</i> for a few hours or a few days is a grievous failure of imagination. Compare Bunchofgrapes on the workshop page: "<i>Blocks hurt people</i>. They are emotionally damaging, especially for long-time users. Undoing a bad block <i>does not undo that harm</i>. "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78190556" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Giano/Workshop&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78190556" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Some or perhaps most of these four events were not aggressively intended, but I believe they very amply explain any failure of equanimity in Giano, as well as his loss of enthusiasm for the project. (But then these are the days of many lost enthusiasms, as the pre-history of this RFAr suggests.) Here are specifics of the four events:</p>
<ol>
<li>February: <b>Carnildo's block of Giano.</b> Carnildo hasn't been in touch with the victims of his "hate speech" blocks, Giano and <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">User:El C</a>. . His position as stated at [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Carnildo 2|Carnildo 2] remains AFAIK his position of record: "I imposed a block and made a few hastily-worded statements. The block was reverted within ten minutes, and the statements were mostly ignored. I'd feel regret if the consequences had been more significant, but I don't see how a heated opinion and a few minutes of not being able to edit Wikipedia is worth agonizing over." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_2&amp;diff=44880397&amp;oldid=44878826" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Carnildo_2&amp;diff=44880397&amp;oldid=44878826" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> My impression, from reading the Carnildo RFAs, is that this was the reason so many opposed returning the block button to him, and the reason for Giano's anger at the bureaucrats' decision: not Carnildo's long-ago brief brainfart of placing the blocks (February 2006 is ancient history, counted in wiki-time), but Carnildo's ongoing dismissal of of the harm blocking can do: a loud signal that he shouldn't have the button.</li>
<li>July: <b>The proposed ArbCom ban of Giano</b>. In the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Eternal_Equinox_f686.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Eternal Equinox">RFAR on Eternal Equinox</a> (aka User:Hollow Wilerding, presently User:Velden, Fred Bauder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Proposed_decision&amp;oldid=72575270#Giano_banned_for_taunting" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Proposed_decision&amp;oldid=72575270#Giano_banned_for_taunting" rel="nofollow">proposed banning Giano for a month</a> for "taunting" Eternal Equinox with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=58273617&amp;oldid=58271260" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=58273617&amp;oldid=58271260" rel="nofollow">this post</a>. This was supported by Charles Matthews <i>pour encourager les autres</i>, but rejected by all other voting arbs. (Note the humiliating touch that neither Fred nor Charles proposed banning Eternal Equinox herself, Giano thus being singled out by two arbs as the only user in the case whose contributions the encyclopedia deserved to be relieved of for a space of time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Proposed_decision#Eternal_Equinox_banned" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Proposed_decision#Eternal_Equinox_banned" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.) Many people, a minority of them friends of Giano's, who were aware of how especially Charles Matthews' endorsement was affecting him, attempted to plead/argue with CM on his talkpage<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charles_Matthews&amp;oldid=70303455#Giano_-_pour_encourager_les_autres.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charles_Matthews&amp;oldid=70303455#Giano_-_pour_encourager_les_autres.3F" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, but clearly got off on the wrong foot (some of them being less polite than others) and were collectively written off as "a few buddies piling up on my User Talk".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charles_Matthews&amp;diff=70095247&amp;oldid=70091148" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charles_Matthews&amp;diff=70095247&amp;oldid=70091148" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> I'm not writing this to criticize CM, knowing his conscientiousness and also what an unreasonable burden of work all arbitrators shoulder, but I do believe the effects were unfortunate. It seems to me a good illustration of the consequences of the notion, when held even by scrupulous users such as CM, that blocks and bans are merely a matter of takingâ€”or being givenâ€”a <i>break from editing</i>. ("A one-month ban is a holiday."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charles_Matthews&amp;diff=70044104&amp;oldid=70043742" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Charles_Matthews&amp;diff=70044104&amp;oldid=70043742" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>) A number of people have asked what the problem wasâ€”Giano <i>wasn't</i> in the upshot banned by the ArbCom, was he? This IMO is again a failure of imagination. Giano was in fact found to have "taunted a sensitive user" (=Eternal Equinox). I would suggest that Ghirlandajo and Giano, and, heck, <i>most</i> of us (I suppose not all, since some like to boast about their thick skin) are sensitive users. And since it <i>is</i> an encyclopedia, I would put the need for supportiveness less on tenderness towards the pure nuisance editors draining our resources (Eternal Equinox, currently under various restrictions, is nevertheless keeping several admins busy containing her antics <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox&amp;oldid=76625542#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox&amp;oldid=76625542#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" rel="nofollow">[27]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox&amp;diff=77391177&amp;oldid=76625542" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox&amp;diff=77391177&amp;oldid=76625542" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77424864#Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FEternal_Equinox:request_for_clarification_of_clarification" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=77424864#Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FEternal_Equinox:request_for_clarification_of_clarification" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>) and more on allowing for the sensitivities and pride of productive editors. Users such as the extremely productive Giano and Ghirlandajo react well to trust and respect and belief in their good faith; badly to blocks, poking, patronizing, admin arrogance, and to being, in any disagreement, at the mercy of the man with the block button.</li>
<li>August: <b>The second block of Giano</b> (48 hours).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=72944334&amp;oldid=72909730" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=72944334&amp;oldid=72909730" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> This block was issued for Giano's insistence and anger with Lar, as narrated by Lar in the section above. Here Giano doubtless went too far in his surprise and outrage at seeing a supposed friend vote strong support and admiration for Carnildo, the unapologetic blocker of Giano and others in the Pedobox War. Lar's stated basis for his voteâ€”deference to the fact that <i>arbitrators</i> (superusers? demigods?) were supportingâ€”apparently got deep under Giano's skin as a poor amount of RFA research.</li>
<li>September: <b>The third block of Giano</b> (Tony Sidaway, 3 hours). Everybody knows this one.</li>
