<p>I tried to finally create a solid article on this topic. In particular, I tried to set down some stardard terminology for use on Wikipedia. My view is that the three most unambiguous terms are "bishōjo game", "ren'ai game" and "H game", so these are the primary ones I'm using. I know a lot of people are nitpicky about these things --- I hope this naming scheme will be acceptable for most people. If not, feel free to discuss it here. Note also that I'm using standard Wikipedia naming conventions, with the macrons over the "o"s and all that. I would've preferred "bishoujo game" and "ren'ai game" in the article title too, but hey, it's the standard. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShibboleth_3624.html" title="User:Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> 22:58, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>About Magical Drop 3: It's not purely bishōjo I'd argue. There are several male characters in the game, the text below the pic was misleading saying it was girls only... <a href="../../../k/a/j/User%7EKajtek_ac6e.html" title="User:Kajtek">Kajtek</a> 19:48, 9 Dec 2004 (CET)</p>
<hr />
<p>The characters in the Magical Drop games are based on the major arcana of the tarot. There are female characters in the game because their tarot counterparts happen to be female. I would not classify this game as bishōjo either. --Anon user.</p>

The art-style is pure bishōjo, emphasizing the femininity of the characters and baring a considerable amount of flesh in the arms. While the game can certainly be enjoyed for its fine puzzle gameplay alone, there is no way that this is not a bishōjo game. The tarot was chosen as a theme because it contains mostly female characters, not the other way around. 69.70.138.192 18:59, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your efforts. I think it isn't so important to be rigidly complete on these terms, because they are extremely temporary and rapidly changing ephemera --- e.g. people will still be playing bishōjo games ten years from now, but nobody will be saying "ugu". An encyclopedia doesn't necessarily have to keep up with that sort of stuff. As well, they are of no practical use to anyone except Japanese speakers, which isn't the main audience here on en. So their main benefit is providing some cultural color, and insight into the type of talk that goes on on Japanese websites. For this purpose I think we have plenty of terms already, so there's no need to add more if you find them dubious. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShibboleth_3624.html" title="User:Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> 03:45, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're probably right about there being more than enough slang terms here. However, seeing "ugu" there, I'm compelled to suggest adding "gao" from <a href="../../../a/i/r/AIR_%28game%29_f90c.html" title="AIR (game)">AIR</a>. In the places on the internet I frequent, it seems to be more popular than "ugu" (could be because the AIR anime is more recent, and more English-speaking otakus are familiar with anime than with bishojo games). Anyway, I didn't add it myself because I don't know how to write it in Japanese... - <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Nemet_ba9e.html" title="User:Commander Nemet">Commander Nemet</a> 18:12, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could I remove the female-targeted games from the section about bishoujo games today, to the genres that are related or derive from bishoujo games? Definitely they started from the idea of bishoujo games, but I have never seen them actually categorized as bishoujo games, only as ren'ai games, simulation games, or adventure games. Probably because there are few to no bishoujos in these games, just one or two normal females (the main character/s) and tons of good looking boys and men.Lijakaca 20:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I admit that I haven't played any bishōjo game in English translation (I bought the ones I had while living in Japan), but my sense is that the games currently out are poor stuff. It is hard to exaggerate the obscurity of most of them in Japan: googling for "さくらの季節　JAST" (<a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_of_the_Sakura_b69e.html" title="Season of the Sakura">Season of the Sakura</a>) results in all of 20 hits. And visiting Season of the Sakura's web page and looking at the screenshots, I don't get a good impression. That's why I didn't bother naming any of them aside from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Maker_786c.html" title="Princess Maker">Princess Maker</a>: I consider all of them pretty much non-notable in every sense except that they happened to be translated. (With one exception: I do get 5000 Google hits for "加奈いもうと" (<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kana_Imoto_3e48.html" title="Kana Imoto">Kana Imoto</a>), which is not bad.)</p>
<p>So English speakers are currently in the position of judging an entire genre based on a few of its third-rate clones. Imagine trying to form an opinion of first-person shooters without having access to the major players like Id software and Valve, or of J-RPGs without Square and Enix. No wonder <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> is so contemptuous of them.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not on a mission to advocate for ren'ai games to the West: even the most popular ones are not very good as games or as writing. They're mainly interesting because of what they reveal about Japanese sexuality, gender roles and attitudes to pornography. Still, I think it's important to make it clear that the games currently translated are poorly representative of the overall quality of the genre. <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanon.html" title="Kanon">Kanon</a> is poorly written, but it's still leagues ahead of Western pornography. I don't want people to apply Western preconceptions of pornography to Japanese works --- and unfortunately the bishōjo games currently out in English happen to lend support to the misconception that any work containing pornography must automatically be vapid in every other respect. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShibboleth_3624.html" title="User:Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> 00:51, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good and thought-provoking points, and I think you're basically right. Please do edit the sections I added if you want to clarify this - I'm not possessive of what I wrote, and I'm all for giving as accurate a portrayal as we can. I think that for an article on en, though, being translated is in and of itself something to render a game notable, to non-Japanese speakers. I'm also convinced that, even though they may be poor by comparison with what's out in Japanese, they also provide a near-unique combination of story, game decisions affecting the story, and romance and sexuality. Few as the translated ren'ai games are, there are probably more of them than of Western-origin computer games with any significant romantic aspect. I think this is the chief appeal to the "thinking" English-speaking bishoujo player.</dd>
<dd>(Who is in the minority: one of the best-selling translated games is <a href="../../../x/-/c/X-Change_a3d9.html" title="X-Change">X-Change</a>, which is agreed almost everywhere to be frankly awful and just a set of sex scenes strung together. It does still sell in large amounts even now, which is why I listed it as notable, but it reveals that the majority of the market for English-language games is still basically people after porn. I personally hate the way that the marketing in general will hype up the sex scenes out of all proportion to the romantic rest of the game, especially in cases like <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_Soul_4543.html" title="Brave Soul">Brave Soul</a> where there's proper gameplay and puzzles as well as romance and the sex is a tiny amount of the romance stories, but I tried to avoid my Wikipedia text coming out biased (please edit if anyone thinks I failed). There are a number of people who'd love to see the big names like <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokimeki_Memorial_322b.html" title="Tokimeki Memorial">Tokimeki Memorial</a> translated to English, but it seems that it ain't going to happen soon.)</dd>
<dd>It may be that games like <a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_of_the_Sakura_b69e.html" title="Season of the Sakura">Season of the Sakura</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_Soul_4543.html" title="Brave Soul">Brave Soul</a>, and the <a href="../../../a/n/i/AnimePlay_bea0.html" title="AnimePlay">AnimePlay</a> games are awful by comparison to those in Japanese, but it seems they're among the best available in English, and lots of those who play them do love them.

<dd>You're right that the mere fact of their being translated does make them worth noting, so I've left them in. But I think Wikipedia generally shouldn't say that a work is good or bad (unless it can be backed up by a quote from some notable critic), so I've just noted that they're obscure and said nothing else either way.</dd>
<dd>Yeah, I used to feel strongly about such things also, but I've come to grow detached. The more anime I watched and bishōjo games I played, the more I realized that with a very few exceptions, it's always the same old cliches over and over again. Japan's pop culture output doesn't really hold a candle to its serious artists like e.g. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haruki_Murakami_247a.html" title="Haruki Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a> or <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koreeda_Hirokazu_05a2.html" title="Koreeda Hirokazu">Koreeda Hirokazu</a>. So I've come to appreciate Japanese pop culture mainly as fodder for analysis of the country's culture, instead of for its own sake. I've been writing all these articles because as a disillusioned fanboy, I feel I have the unusual capacity to be both highly informed and NPOV&#160;:).</dd>
<dd>Tokimeki Memorial is one of the last games I can see being officially translated, because <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a> doesn't want to hurt its brand name in America by becoming associated with something potentially controversial.

<p>In the list of terms, the kanji 娘 appears a lot of times, and is translated as "kid".

<dd>Translating "meganekko" as "young-girl-with-glasses" wouldn't really capture the original ring of the term, I think, so the current translation seems like an acceptable compromise.

<dd>It is an odd cultural and language tid-bit and 娘 is used with a positive, somewhat sexual meaning to replace 子 in bishojo genre. 子 means child especially those under teen when used together with 娘 and this distinction let writers use <i>Onna</i> 女 to mean those older than the main character. It is somewhat like the use of "baby" or "baby girl" in a casual English conversation or a song. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 17:39, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found this article lacking in the fact that it describes the content and history of the games extensively, yet there is no section on the background of the phenomenon. Why is Bishojo so popular in Japan, and why is it so unpopular in other parts of the world. There are likely numerous sources that explore this part and I would like read about that in this <b>featured</b> article. -- [[User:Solitude|<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolitude_2d63.html" title="User:Solitude">Solitude</a>\<sup><a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESolitude_6179.html" title="User talk:Solitude">talk</a></sup>]] 07:52, Dec 8, 2004 (UTC)</p>

Good point, that's indeed a question of considerable interest. However, at a base factual level all we can really say is "Japanese people just like it because it's in their culture". They (or at least some of them) like young girls, they like anime-style art, they like highly feminine and cute stuff (and Westerners mostly don't). They just do. Any more elaborate answer explaining how this preference came about would be a theory, and inherently POV. I was actually adding my ideas about this to an early draft of the article, but ended up junking them because they were original research.</dd>
<dd>Actually, the sources are remarkably few; the only real scholarship I know of about this comes from Sharon Kinsella (one of her articles is in the references), and even she only spends a few paragraphs on the topic in the paper linked. As I understand her, Kinsella's thesis is that bishōjo is popular among Japanese males due to sexism. In her words: "Despite the inappropriateness of their old-fashioned attitudes, many young men have not accepted the possibility of a new role for women in Japanese society. [...] The little girl heroines of Lolicom manga reflect simultaneously an awareness of the increasing power and centrality of young women in society, and also a reactive desire to see these young women dissarmed, infantilised, and subordinate." As I said, very POV.</dd>
<dd>Now that you mention it though, it would be interesting to present her theories provided they're properly attributed to her. Also, Kinsella will be releasing a new book covering more of this topic soon, perhaps there'll be more to say then. The history of the general phenomenon maybe could be expanded as well --- as I mentioned in the article, this, as well as most gender-oriented <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, is really strongly tied in to <a href="../../../d/o/j/Dojin.html" title="Dojin">dojin</a> comics. However, maybe the general <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishojo.html" title="Bishojo">bishojo</a> article would be more appropriate for this stuff, since it's not specific to games.

So, I stand corrected. However, I do want to bring up an additional concern on this talk page: NPOV. For example, most of the article is rock-solid, but isn't there some North American cultural POV in terms of analyzing Japanese culture? This article has the slight but detectable air of "that exotic foreign topic," to it, IMHO.

<dd>Well, I wrote the article with the assumption that the reader knows nothing about the topic to start with, and also made several comparisons with North America with the assumption that this would be more familiar to the reader than Japan. That might account for your feeling. I am not sure how this can be fixed, though; if the topic is inherently unknown and "exotic"-seeming to 90% of its readers, the article has to adapt to its audience. That said, if you find any specific POV phrase, go ahead and fix it. 69.70.138.192 08:55, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Doesn't this kind of sick sado-sexual violent depravity sound similar to the things they fantasize about in their video games? I will forever be uninterested in all things Japanese. Some people get titillated by this crap but I don't. <a href="../../../z/h/_/User%7EZh_6968.html" title="User:Zh">Zh</a> 23:10, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh, I mention a game to show the history of <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enix.html" title="Enix">Enix</a> and you turn it into a sweeping condemnation of Japanese culture. You are hugely overgeneralizing --- most Japanese would also be repelled by this game. <i>Lolita Syndrome</i> probably sold no more than (my guesstimate) a few thousand copies, to porn fiends exclusively. Nor would it be releasable today under the new regulations established in the 90s. Do you also judge other countries by the content of their hardcore pornography? 69.70.138.192 00:55, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems you have absolutely no understanding of how a bayonet was used in Japanese Army during WWII. It was used like a spear attached to a gun to stub but never to slash. It actually looks like a knife but this is due to the fact that the design was copied from a French bayonet. In many fictions and nonfictions of Japanese troop in Southeast Asia, after capturing wild animals to eat, they were forced to use machete and officer's swords as well as privately owned knives to eat. Now, please read something beside propaganda to figure out how Japanese behave. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 06:11, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that this is inaccurate, as it presumes that characters with glasses are not considered beautiful.

<p>I have found that nearly 100% of the time japanese (this is from watching anime in which they name this type of game) call bishoujo games "galge". The japanese version of this page also has this name. The english page didn't even mention this name (I added it). Should we maybe use the more correct name? <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgzay_4ae0.html" title="User:Ergzay">Ergzay</a> 02:48, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Extrapolating from usage in popular culture is risky, as an encyclopedia can be expected to use more formal terminology. Google searches are very unreliable, but suggest that "bishoujo game" is more common in writing (美少女ゲーム gets 2,250,000 hits, compared to 1,510,000 for ギャルゲー). Even galge.com describes itself as a site about "美少女ゲーム". (The ja wiki page name is a counter-argument, of course...)</dd>
<dd>Moreover, as this is the English Wikipedia, we need to give consideration to the terminology used by English fans. <i>Purely anecdotally,</i> I don't recall seeing "galge" used very frequently in English discussions. I don't have any figures to back that up, though, and I'm perfectly happy to be proven wrong on this point! &#160;:)</dd>
<dd>To clarify, my personal position is that I'm not convinced the page needs renaming, but nor would I oppose it if it can be shown that "galge" is a common term for the genre in English. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:37, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
