<p>Let me be the first to say welcome back dearest Bishonen. Sadly though it is hello and goodbye. I am off to a place which has not yet attained the standards of civilization to which I am accustomed. I may be on the internet tomorrow, I may not. I may stay away longer and attempt tp discover on behalf of my great nation the lost civilization of <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidalia%2C_Georgia_62e7.html" title="Vidalia, Georgia">Vidalia</a>. The again I may stay in NY. Then again I may go on to Canada where I see a need for some charitable work. Speak whenever.

<dd>Well, since Giano has beaten me to it, <i>I</i> want to be the second. I'm not sure whether Wikipedia is feeling better or whether spring has come, but whichever it is, it's good to see you back. I owe you an e-mail, anyway, but I owe <i>lots</i> of e-mails to people, so you may have to wait a little bit. All is well with me.

<dl>
<dd>Now that I come to think of it, maybe it wasn't <i>Wikipedia</i> that was to feel better. I assumed that because of the "it", but you referred to the <i>page</i> as taking a wikibreak rather than to yourself. Are your pronouns a little sloppy, or am I being dense?&#160;:-) If you <i>were</i> referring to yourself, I hope you're feeling better. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 16:42, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh. Before I read up on it I knew the story vaguely, as a Swede will, especially since the 1982 movie, and I assumed that they only ate polar bear meat because they had to; but no, it turns out they liked it, they never tired of it. Andrée writes happily in the diary about the succulent rib meat, and has whole menus centered on it: frostbitten chocolate, sugar that's gotten wet so many times it's in liquid form and kept in a bottle, polar bear ribs. There's so much material in those diaries, I could do a Featured Article about the food alone. (With a great surprise ending about the respective merits of the trichinosis theory, the vitamin A poisoning theory, the botulism theory.) They had canned cheese, too.</dd>

<dd>The article is terrible. I just looked it up yesterday when listening to a radio interview with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Englund_523a.html" title="Peter Englund">Peter Englund</a> on his new biography of Christina. I removed some hardly legible nonsense on how Swedish supposedly had the same word for a monarch regardless of sex, that had survived in the article since <i>early november</i> last year. Despite some probably excellent articles on legendary baseball players and a complete coverage of pokemonology, Wikipedia 1.0 still seems far away. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 10:58, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bishonen! I've been sent by <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> to request your help. I understand you were a huge help on <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caulfield_Grammar_School_6987.html" title="Caulfield Grammar School">Caulfield Grammar School</a>, and I'm hoping to join your ranks with my own school, <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopkins_School_a1a7.html" title="Hopkins School">Hopkins School</a>. The article has already been through its first PR, an ill-advised FAC, and is closing out its second PR. After that and a few final dabs (I'm trying to get a good digital map of the campus, eg) I'd like to try my hands at the second FAC. Is there any chance you could give it a good once over, change what you can, and LMK if anything major needs alteration that you know of?

<dd>I've reformatted the references, listing all the web sources as retrieved today (having checked they still provide the proper information). I'll move the Hilltoppers section, and try to work out the boring bits of the Academics/Facilities section, but they are rather needed (if dull) in a school article. I think chronological order is the only way that will be clear to the procession of time in The Fallow Years, but the last sentence is a bit nonsensical. The reason is that the better source, <i>Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School</i>, is a pretty rare book at the librarian wouldn't let me take it home. Thus, I was forced to finish off the section with the more outline style manuscripts I have from the school archivist. Once I get back to Hopkins and get my hands on that book I can touch up the ending with more ref'd detail. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 04:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bishonen -- Have limited time here right now, but wanted to ask you about any history/information you might have on <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrunnock_1109.html" title="User:Brunnock">Sean Brunnock</a>. On the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottery.html" title="Pottery">Pottery</a> article, (see discussion page and archive) for the past couple of months, he has been a source of contention with other users. Since I've been mostly away, I've only been "hit" a couple of times. While citing Wikipedia rules, he follows by applying them to his own opinions and arguments, but not allowing the same courtesy to others. He also does not appear to understand the idea of concensus, or the fact that any given topic can be seen from differing perspectives by people in other disciplines. He also discounts any personal or professional opinions by editors, except his own, of course. I am not interested in censuring him, but I also do not see any way of working with him in a constructive manner. Any information or advice would be welcome. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 02:41, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, W. I've never heard of this user. I've now read <a href="../../../p/o/t/Talk%7EPottery_054f.html" title="Talk:Pottery">Talk:Pottery</a>, and understand your frustration: he seems to shift his ground a lot, apparently in order to not engage with the major point of the other side. I think, or hope, that that point is that an encyclopedia article is supposed to report, not solve, the disagreements between published experts in the field. But the talkpage discussion having gotten entrenched in certain details that I don't know anything about, I'm not sure I'm reading it right. Anyway, yes, as an outsider's opinion, the user seems to either have trouble grasping that important principle, or to simply not want to; it's hard to tell whether it's time to stop <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> or not. Theoretically, the thing to do for this content dispute is list the page (not the user—I'm sure that would be pretty pointless) on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, for "more eyes". Although that theory often seems to come up against the sad fact that interest in these listings can be pretty low. I'd still advise you to try it, as it's not much trouble—RFC'ing a page is nothing like RFC'ing a user—but not to get your hopes up too much. Sorry I can't be of any help. Real Life just hit me with a lot of delayed essay grading, I shouldn't be on wiki at all right now, and I need to reserve the time I have strictly for my new article <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897_30ad.html" title="S.

<p>It is peculiar to me, Bishonen, that you refer to "zealot patience" in regard to the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> article, but fail to make the same assessment about <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>, Andrie's life project here in Wikipedia. From my perspective, I am interested in having a solid, stable and NPOV article in Wikipedia about <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a>, the same I wish for about any other subject. I oppose any attempts to make any article a vehicle for the disparagement and criticism of a person, in particular when this criticism is made by rather insignificant small group of people that have made it their stated aim to destroy someone's reputation by means of using the Internet and projects like WP to amplify their usually tiny voices. If you want to help with the article, you are most welcome as I have made it very obvious in my communications with you. But injecting yourself in the controversy by praising an editor for "his relentless efforts in attempting to balance the article", without knowing much about the subject, the dynamics involved, etc. and then saying "I don't have the time", it is difficult to understand. Maybe you care to explain. As for your tiredness of "back and forth", believe me when I say that I am of the same feeling. I am working on Core Topics for Wikipedia 1.0 and have to go back again and again to the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> article to stop it from degenerating into a battleground yet again. Did you know Bishonen that we reached consensus about 2 years ago about the contents of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> article that Andries, the ex-premies and supporters all agreed to protect (with the understanding that no one what 100% happy with the article, but that we could live with it?). Do you know <i>who</i> challenged the consensus, Bishonen? Andries and his buddies the ex-premies (yes they are friends), They will not rest until their POV is asserted, and that is not a happening thing. NPOV a problem form them? collaborative editing too tedious? so they resort to writing "essays" and then link them to the article. Nice. So, if you are as tired as I am of all this back and forth, please don't encourage it further.

<dd>It is true that I made some changes, but no major changes after I founds new sources and after concensus had been reached. This is unavoidable if you ask me. And then suddenly editors starting behaving as if there never was a concensus version. You cannot blame people for not having the time and patience to edit that article and seek an alternative for that by writing articles and essays. And I do not think you need to know much about the subject to see that just mentioning the words "criticism and controversy" in the lead section without trying to be more specific is not very NPOV and quite unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 16:20, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear God! I had a very small one of those a few years back. Your experience must be different from mine, though, because when the pain hit me (somewhere in the small of the back) there was nothing to do but go straight to the emergency room in an ambulance. (Where I had the educational experience of learning that intravenous morphine has apparently no effect on me other than to induce vomiting.)

<dd>Mine may be smaller/better/whatever. In fact, I think I've dislodged it, but the pain is quite sharp (and I'm a veteran of pain). Since I already take morphine every day, that may be why I'm tolerating it better. My back hurts, but I'm also feeling really awful from the fever. Maybe it ain't stones. Maybe it's a kidney infection or a UTI. Expensive tests will answer the question, but I'm in no position to go through them at this time. Urinalysis nearly breaks the bank.

<dd>Never fear Giano is here! Deep sympathy. I've had 3, the last one had to be surgically removed through keyhole surgery - believe me you don't want to know where the keyhole is! You must drink the juice of a whole lemon in a glass of hot water every morning for the rest of your life, and then you will never have another one. Sadly that will not help you now so it's got to be pethidine and hope it's not the keyhole - actually it's not as bad as it sounds, just deeply embarrassing - but God it was worth it. My surgeon said that the pain of a stone is far worse than child birth - my wife said "Hah! so how many children as he had" (well she said it in Italian, of course) which just goes to show that women are very possessive of pain. Seriously Geogre have the surgery email me if you want the details they really are not too bad! <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 18:26, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh yeah, and drinking lots of water to flusg it through is a myth (my surgeon said) it just makes the pain worse as the fluid backs up, and doesn't flush it through any faster! <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 18:30, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Oddly enough, I've recently discovered an article that I may nominate for featured article.

Then again, maybe not... I may take a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiholiday_6f71.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiholiday">wikibreak</a>. Yes, a better idea. However, by no means when I return will I not be appealing this inappropriate ban. Anyway, for now, I'll be gone for sometime and have indicated as so on my user page.

<dd>Since you failed to provide me with the reasons why I deserve the block when I have re-checked my actions multiple times, the situation has become dead.

It should not be solely up to you to make such decisions. No one owns Wikipedia and we are an international community about international cooperation.

<dd>Don't play games with me. Should you "ban" me from anything when you <i>don't</i> provide reasons, are in the minority, and bother me anymore, I'm opening an RFC.

<p>You know what? Truth be told, I don't understand why we both have to be so stubborn. I know that you're just infuriated with me because you still believe I'm Hollow Wilerding, and I'm just being stubborn because I dislike these accusations. We really need to refrain from being so dark-blooded. Perhaps we should make a friendly approach instead of causing controversy everywhere we go. It's good that you're an administrator, actually, since you're not a fainthearted person and <i>will</i> block someone when they're disruptive; however, <i>sometimes</i> (not always) I think you should do it in a nicer manner. Why don't we accomplish something? I will comply with your "ban" as long as you don't put me out of place, insult me, or purposely refer to me as female. Ignorance is not the key, and I know that I've probably violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivilty_a2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Civilty">civility</a> already, so I should be ashamed. But really, there's no reason for screaming, and I will continue to stand on the grounds of <i>telling</i> me what I did wrong on FAC. I can't correct what I don't know. I could make the same mistakes next time without being aware of the circumstances and I'll be blocked all over again, which would definitely leave me perplexed. Is there a particular article you're working on? Do you want help? Should I assist you? Perhaps I could use some help? I'm not sure. Remember, this is an encyclopedia built to develop history — there is no reason why people should be making enemies. It isn't like we're ever going to meet each other personally and communicate through satillites (spelling?). Do me the favour complying with these words I write so that a pointless conundrum is not refueled in the future. Another thing, however, I still believe the admins who agree with this ban are clearly agreeing with it by bad-faith. Otherwise, there is no reason why we should be breaking the rules. —Eternal Equinox | <a href="../../../e/t/e/User_talk%7EEternal_Equinox_6bf0.html" title="User talk:Eternal Equinox">talk</a> 03:08, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That sounds quite encouraging. I do not wish to make you lose face at all; I accidentally used the word "she", purely out of habit and with being in a hurry. I really <b>do</b> believe you're male. Of course I've no way of knowing, I could be wrong, but it's what I believe. There have been no accusations from me that you're HW, you know. I don't have control of what other people post, but I have never incited anybody into accusing you of that, and never will. I fully understand your suspiciousness, and that you think I may come out with references to ancient history at any time, but I haven't the slightest intention of doing that. It would go against my own interests to tease or taunt you. I'd much sooner have you be a calm, productive user, than stirred up.</dd>
<dd>About what you did wrong on FAC, that you ask to be able to avoid inadvertently doing again: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=44738993&amp;oldid=44731131" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=44738993&amp;oldid=44731131" rel="nofollow">this post of mine</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=44809136&amp;oldid=44801489" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates&amp;diff=44809136&amp;oldid=44801489" rel="nofollow">this by Taxman</a>. If it's necessary for your dignity to argue every detail of every accusation, then I'm sorry, but I don't play that game, this is all I can do. Please just read my links with the eyes of good faith and you <i>will</i> see what the charges are. If you think someone like Taxman is in a conspiracy against you, well...

<dd>Thank you for finally answering my questions. It should have been like this from the beginning instead of controversial. But do not worry, I am all right with it. I'm not sure whether you truly believe I am HW or not, but it is all right if you think I am, because such as you said about me being male or female, you'll never know.&#160;:)</dd>

Do add something, please,that would be most helpful. I don't own a Svalbard history book, and know hardly anything about the high latitudes or the explorations. I just read up on this episode, in a shallow way; no stumbling over any archives, I'm afraid. For the rescue efforts, I think the Swedish govt just checked out the two depots a year or two after they disappeared, by icebreaker. Of course the ships had to wait for reasonable ice conditions, and they hadn't a clue where else to look, but it's a sobering thought: those poor miserable klutzes surely couldn't have kept themselves alive that long even at a depot: they would have died even if they'd made it to Cape Flora. A charged moment is when an expedition comes looking for <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umberto_Nobile_6508.html" title="Umberto Nobile">Umberto Nobile</a> and his <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">airship</a> on Kvitöya in 1928, and apparently walk all over Andrée's campsite without noticing it, as there was a lot of snow that year.</dd>

Have you planned of having a map <i>of</i> the island, as well as the map showing its position? I kind of missed something like that. Those are some great self-taken pics you've got. I don't suppose you and your camera have been to Kvitøya? Andrée said it was nearly all covered by a glacier, hence = the white island. (It wasn't me called it "White's Island".)</dd>

<dd>There are maps linked to from the article but I am afraid I can't upload them, as they are copyrighted. It is difficult to find good quality information about that desolate island, and even more so if you look for English language sources. In fact, most of my knowledge is from Norwegian books. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_Polar_Institute_1ba4.html" title="Norwegian Polar Institute">Norwegian Polar Institute</a> has a long list of books and publications on its web page, but very few are available online. I have not made the pictures myself, they are from a fellow German who has been there with his own yacht a few years ago.</dd>
<dd>The name "Kvitøya" is indeed derived from the geography and refers to the heavy glaciation. Sorry, no pictures and it will be difficult to find any, as that place is really remote (and also a nature reserve, I believe). A fascinating subject, the heroic (and grotesque) age of polar exploration. It is interesting to compare figures like Lerner and Andree with Amundsen or Nansen, who managed to overwinter unplannedly on Franz Josef Land and return in good health. Nansen's journey reports were bestsellers of their time and will probably still make a good introduction to the science of the time (have not read them yet). So much to read...</dd>

<dd>Nansen was a man of many gifts. The impossibility of communicating with the outside world must have been part of the glamor and the heroism, too. Nansen and his companion disappear into the unknown...they're gone... they're gone... they must be dead... they're obviously dead... good heavens [18 months later], there they are, as fresh as paint! My first thought when I read about Andrée was that Andrée vs. Nansen in the Arctic was a lot like an early version of Amundsen vs Scott in the Antarctic. Balloons and Siberian ponies.

<dd>No, I hadn't, thanks, Al. It was interesting in relation to my page too, especially the hard line on image galleries. Though when I posted accordingly on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897" rel="nofollow">"At least I got played by Max von Sydow" FAC</a>, Uppland suggested galleries might be becoming "reprecated". Anyway, the sense of the meeting seems to support my wish for lots of these remarkable images.

<p>Well you have asked two very different questions there haven't you. I hope this not only answers your questions, but makes Gmaxwell understand the Carnildo's behaviour and the Arbcoms response left a lot of anger and emotion behind which sometimes finds the wrong, or at least nearest target.</p>
<p>Tone? The tone sounds to me a little like that of a barrister discrediting the defence's star witness. Necessary? I don't suppose anyone can say with certainty. The problem is that like it or not this particular RFA is even more a trial than most, the fault for that must lie mostly with the Arbcom who in their original "trial" achieved the near impossible result of satisfying neither offender or offended. It is an impossible task to be both judge and jury. Jury's may (and indeed should) squabble legitimately, Judges have to be experienced and absolute in their conviction the sentence is appropriate. Sentencing by committee is always a weak affair of compromises.</p>
<p>Thus, Carnildo seems to consider himself still to have done nothing worthy of such unjust treatment, and the offended (I can only speak for myself) feel that before being eligible for reapplication he should have at least have had to realise how offended people were by his actions, or at least been forced to wait much longer than than the minimum two weeks specified. That the clerk of the court was on Carnildo's page asking him to apply for adminship at the immediate end of that period appeared to me tasteless. On that occasion Carnildo had the sense to decline, but in my opinion should have waited longer still. Let us not forget here Carnildo accused three experienced editors (2 of them admins) of "hate speech" a serious charge in any community, found them guilty and banned them all in the space of a few minutes. Then having caused the situation walked away and left others to sort his appalling mess out. That in itself, should have bought a further charge of is neglect of responsibility. Remember all three he banned were completely innocent, one has left and the two remaining seem to be very hurt still. None have received any explanation or apology from Carnildo.</p>
<p>So there you have it - a whole sorry saga of injustice still claiming victims. I'm truly sorry that GMaxwell has chosen to express in an edit summary he is "hurt" by my treatment of him. He should not have ever been able to find himself in the position of having to defend Carnildo - his loyalty to his friend is a credit to him and I hope he edits again, but he must realise there is far more at stake here than Carnildo being able delete a few images in the future. As for GMaxwell's suggestion about moving on - Certainly I hope so at some time in the future, but with no seeming atonement at all from Carnildo, and so many people voting for Carnildo and thus making light of one's own hurt on the matter it is very hard. I'm go glad you supported me there.

<p>Greetings, Bishonen!<br />
We haven't talked in a long-time. I hope you are doing well.

How did that happen, I wondered? Then when I saw that he was trying to get back almost immediately after being desyopped (and desyopped for very good reason), I of course voted no.

<dd>That's so great, what a good idea! You know, there's an FA waiting to happen, it's a subject just the right size.&#160;:-) Let me just check up on the <s>pre-Great Plague</s> early playhouses on the site, because there were two. Don't know if Beauclerk conflates them? That happens a lot. Yours, the "Theatre in Bridges Street" (although the site <i>was</i> the same), that seated 700, opened in May 1663 and burned down in January 1672. Then the big one, the "Theatre in Drury Lane", seating/standing 2000, opened in 1674. See <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_spectacular.html" title="Restoration spectacular">Restoration spectacular</a>, section "Changeable scenery". And I passively-aggressively re-embiggened the pencil sketch which, once upon a time, I lovingly scanned, and which somebody had shrunk before you got there. Grumble. With those light-grey lines on light-grey paper, you couldn't tell the subject from a hole in the ground, the size it was at. Much better not to use it at all.

<p>Can you find your copy of my edited version of <i>The Play-house?</i> If so, you might want to read it, because the poem visits every part of the theater, from the pit to the box to the gallery. It's quite logically ordered and easier to read for me now than once it was (more obvious). Some of the poetry is pretty bad, as poetry (first excerpt, above, is way too sloppy versifying), and some of it is excellent. Needless to say, the 1709 version is its superior in most respects, but not more honest or sincere. The 1689 version has all the marks of a hot wound on the sensibilities, and the 1709 a philosophical denunciation of the vanity of the Restoration stage. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have nothing to feel bad about, you are voting how you believe will keep Wikipedia in prime form. I would ask you to reconsider given the slightly retagged campus map and the fact that it <i>was</i> released for use on Wikipedia, and is simply of higher quality than any self-created one would be. As for the Heath Commons image, I have two requests out (one to release the current version into GFDL, another to a buddy with a nicer camera and better photographic sense to take a new shot under GFDL) to replace/tag it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 20:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, sure, I'm not expecting to have reason to keep opposing—you're going to try to deal with Carnildo's objection in any case, aren't you? No, I hope to withdraw that objection, but I had to make it, over the photo of the school: I mean, it's a building that's right there, today, you and probably other interested editors of the article are near it, there are cameras in the world...! That one's really the sticking point for me. Though I'm not happy about the new tag on the campus map, either. I mean, "Featured" means "Wikipedia's best", right? A tag beginning "If possible, please do not use this tag" doesn't give me that "best" feeling.

<dd>I have proposed some solutions I hope are suitable to sway your vote. Thanks for the advice! As for the re-tagging, I did so because it is the more appropriate fair use tag, as the image was released <i>with permission for use on Wikipedia</i>, it was not merely collected from a random place on the internet, as with most Fair Use images. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 20:59, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have removed the two remaining fair use images pending re-release of them under a free license, replacement with a free license image, or permanent removal with no free alternative.

<p>Hi. There are two things that we need to know to be sure that a work is in the public domain in the U.S. One is when the work was published. If the work was published before 1923, it is in the public domain. Many works are not published until long after they are created, and not every 100+ year-old work has been published. If it wasn't published, the work is copyrighted for 70 pma, so we need to know the date of the author's death. If the author died before 1923, the work is in the public domain. If not, it isn't. It is even conceivable that a work published 150 years ago could still be copyrighted, if the author of the work was young enough to live another <s>sixty-some</s> years. The template <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-art_cc11.html" title="Template:PD-art">Template:PD-art</a> is actually making an even stronger claim; that the author died more than a hundred years ago and the work is therefore out of copyright in every jurisdiction. I'm not about to go hunt down every hundred-year-old image and tag them as having no source, but they shouldn't be tagged <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-art_cc11.html" title="Template:PD-art">Template:PD-art</a> if we don't have any information on either publication or the date of the author's death. <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-old-70_4502.html" title="Template:PD-old-70">Template:PD-old-70</a> is likely more appropriate, but it would still be good to fill in the information we need to be sure of the claim. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 08:37, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Er... upon re-reading that, I clearly need to review basic math. The author would need to live for fifty years beyond having produced an one-hundred and fifty year old piece of art for the <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-art_cc11.html" title="Template:PD-art">Template:PD-art</a> tag to be wrong. <a href="http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm" rel="nofollow">Here is a chart</a> that explains everything better than I did above. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 09:13, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>For information on what plays were acted, and where, one turns to the Stationer's Register for the Tudor period. However, if I want to know what was put on at Covent Garden 1730-1737, what source do I get? I actually need to know. (Yes, I know that <i>The London Stage</i> has some, but isn't there a Wing and Redgrave like source?) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:51, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Afraid not. Collecting that information is so different from compiling a bibliographical list, because the sources are a lot more various. Consider the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane&amp;diff=45934761&amp;oldid=45930058" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane&amp;diff=45934761&amp;oldid=45930058" rel="nofollow">letter home from Prince Cosmo III of Tuscany</a>...&#160;!. There's a typical LS source. And the obvious format for it is a calendar, which is what LS is. The LS doesn't have "some", it has what there is. In the Restoration period what there is is extremely incomplete, and the sources are a ragbag, headed by Pepys and such as Cosmo. In the 18th century, the info fattens up amazingly just around the turn of the century, <i>most</i> performances get recorded, and the main sources are newspaper advertisements. I'm sorry, is LS not available to you? Not to me either, except I've got the 1660-1700 volume right here... [clutches it and scuttles off]... My preccccciousssss...! P.S. After the Licensing Act, I suppose there's some kind of list of licensed plays. But I haven't heard of it as being available or anything, no doubt because all its info plus a crapload more will be in LS.

<dd>Sure it is. I was just looking at it myself, thinking of mentioning it to Geogre, but it's still just 1700-1710, as far as I can see. In fact, I suspect Hume and Milhous (my lares and penates, look at the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_Spectacular_fcf0.html" title="Restoration Spectacular">Restoration Spectacular</a> sources) have given up on doing those .pdfs, the whole thing is looking exactly like it's been doing since forever.

<p>I suppose I'll e-mail the British Library to see if they know of a sourcebook. The information <i>has</i> to be compiled in primary sources somewhere. Because it's 1730-1737, I figure the information should be out there.

<p>You know as well as I do that the Master of Revels had to still record and approve plays before the Licensing Act. That's what I mean by a primary compilation. Until 1715, no one put on a play without a license (but the licensing didn't have any teeth, really), and when the change took place in 1715, it was because the Drury Lane folks figured that they had a Royal patent and therefore didn't need a license. If no one has made a compilation of all the MoR records, then that's a thing that still needs to be done. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gannymede, what a lot of people end up doing is asking these sorts of primary research questions. There is amazing, amazing stuff that was compiled in the 19th century, and we're all parasites on it, but those 19th century positivists didn't finish the job. They loved their Shakespeare, so, if you want the Stationer's Register, you're in luck. Later ones liked the Restoration a little, so some compiled spotty records there. Beyond that...well...one just hopes. Further, the game is up. Back in the 19th c., people could live in the British Library, touch and maul the original records, and take years to compile the data. These days, you make an appointment in advance with the herald of the college of arms of London special privvy gate, and then you get 2 hours to look through a telescope at the originals, so no one is compiling the data, and publishers cluck their tongues and say that selling to every library on earth isn't enough. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:45, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. When I had the page deleted, I offered to temporarily undelete it for any non-admin who wanted to have a look. (Admins can do it themselves, and I didn't like the idea that it'd be viewable by admins only.) Babajobu asked, so I did, and stuck it in his space. I was sort of assuming that I'd re-delete it in a while, but he wanted to hang on to it, and I didn't want to make an issue of it. I think it might become a sore spot if we were in any way protective of it, I reckon this anything-goes-it's-a-wiki approach is better. Do you mind? How did you come across it?

<p>Hi, I see you intervened against Bgully last time he tried to get Dbachmann, didn't you?

He's now been trying - with his usual lack of understanding of process - to bring an Arbcom case against us, including you. While he is clearly acting against your warning with this, we shouldn't maybe treat this attempt in itself as a renewed offence. If he wants Arbcom, let him get Arbcom, that's his right. However, I also think his repeated removal of the {unsigned} notice which I added to his earlier attack on me here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_Groups&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46289662" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Critique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_Groups&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=46289662" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> warrants the interpretation that he is persistently upholding and endorsing that attack. --<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 11:31, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Lukas, thanks for getting in touch. I noticed even at the time that what Antifinnugor called his RFC against dab was actually using the RFAR template, and included attacks on me, so I assumed he was, if anything, actually going for arbcomming us. That's fine. I don't remember warning him against that, have you got a link? If I did, I'm sure it must have been purely in his own interest: I'm betting he doesn't understand that if arbcom accepts his request, they'll evaluate the behavior of everybody involved, him included. In other words, *I* don't mind being arbcommed by him — I wouldn't dream of treating it as an offense — but I don't think <i>he</i> would like the outcome. In fact, if I wasn't so tired of wasting my time giving good advice to Antifinnugor, who always receives it with the darkest suspicion, I would tell him to get an advocate. As you say, he doesn't understand process. P. S. Uh, Lukas, maybe I'm clicking on the wrong things in his contribs here — what specifically is there that shows him doing anything different with his RFC-cum-RFAR now, as compared to last time (round about when I banned him from ANI)? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:53, 31 March 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>As for your "warning", I was just referring to your post on his talk page, where it says "Stop it with your everlasting lies about User:Dbachmann "vandalizing" or I will blank and protect this page, and anywhere else where you do it." Which could be understood as warning him off trying to bring those complaints forward again anywhere. But I think we quite agree. Just thought you might want to know that he's been trying to bring this to a higher level now by going directly to Arbcom. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 13:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, I never dreamed what I said could be taken like that, but I see what you mean. Of course I wouldn't object to any kinds of accusations that were made in a Request for arbitration, or on a userpage where he's working on such a Request — those are indeed necessarily privileged, and I guess I was just assuming nobody could think I was referring to them. I was just hopping mad at the way he was spreading his lies and his anti-dab venom all over the place. Gosh, being on PA parole must have been the same as being gagged for him — he doesn't seem to have any other register than PA. And AFAIC he's most welcome to take anything he likes to the Arbcom.

<p>In addition to everything I have been doing lately, i'm also trying to clear up some theatre image copyrights and such. I have noticed a number of images that are loaded to both Wikipedia and the Commons. When this occurs, isn't it usually common to delete the image on Wikipedia in favour of the Commons images or did I dream that? Thanks, as always!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is. Definitely if they have the same name. If they don't, it would be the deleter's responsibility to go to all articles that have the en.wiki image and insert the Commons image instead--to "orphan" the image before deleting it. Are you sure that's what it is, though? I mean, a Commons image will have an en.wiki image page as well. But you probably knew that. Are you an admin yet, or do you need anything deleted?
<dl>
<dd>Ah ha, well that explains why I keep finding images with both pages. But I must ask, what is the point? I have often found images in the Commons and used them directly from there without loading the image to en.wiki. I'm not an admin and while I don't have anything to delete now, I may need to soon. Thanks! <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 22:06, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm not making myself clear, I'm talking about images that exist only on Commons. They do nevertheless have a kind of ghostly en.wiki image page. Click on this one: <a href="../../../a/n/d/Image%7EAndree.boardgame.png_85d2.html" title="Image:Andree.boardgame.png">Image:Andree.boardgame.png</a>. I gave it that name and uploaded it to Commons, nowhere else. And yet when you click on it, for instance from an article, you get taken to an en.wiki image page. You might not notice that it says "This is a file from the Wikimedia Commons", but instead think that the file had been uploaded to both places; but it hasn't, and there's nothing that wants deleting. Were you thinking of those? (Whereas if they have been uploaded to both places, what you have is a mess, and the en.wiki one should be deleted.) As for <i>why</i> it's like that, search me. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:39, 1 April 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Heh, thanks... yes, aren't those 1897 photos a treasure trove? And I discovered at a late stage that I could even use photos from 1930, when the expedition was found, like the one with the schoolchildren in the museum, because the Swedish copyright law is really good about photos. I was ready to faint with delight... funny how engaged one becomes, isn't it?

<dd>Eklund was all over the Swedish newspapers last February-March or thereabout, when his book was released. I thought he was a sufficiently unlikely character to set off somebody's hoax or db-attack alarm if I created the article on April 1. I wonder if he was not nominated for deletion because a) nobody even noticed the page, b) it was sufficiently well-written not to be taken for a hoax, c) whoever did see it actually googled him and found some Börk börk börk hits that seemed more or less to corroborate what the article said, or d) I can't think of a fourth possible explanation but I'm sure there is one. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everything in my original version from April 1 last year is verifiable. As for some of the porncruft added later, I don't know. Even if it can be found on some pornsite (and one isn't afraid to catch spyware and stuff visiting those), such businesses are about as reliable as online diploma mills in the claims they make about their products. But I posted the article hoping that somebody would <i>think</i> it was a hoax. I was greatly disappointed when nobody did and thought I'd try again this year, although it was admittedly less elegant to actively draw attention to the page than just letting somebody believe they had exposed a subversive hoax.

<li>Excuse me Bishonen turn away for a moment. - Well Eternal Equinox it seems you have chosen to ignore the friendly advice I gave you - that's a pity. Meet Bishonen? You Holow Wilerding/Eternal Equinox or whatever you are currently calling yoursel - the most disgraceful editor that Wikipedia has seen in years would like to meet Bishonen? That audacity would make some people speechless, however that presumption is entirely in character for the multiple sockpuppet that is you, in short a non-person. HW you really need to meet me someday on a professional basis. Believe me the pleasure would be entirely mine. I have a true understanding of library services, Oh and random numbers - fascinating research, you wouldn't believe what one knows theses days. why some people even loose their jobs, student places, whatever for abusing and breaching their employer's or provider's trust - can you believe that? - well best try! Now, before the coldness and hostility that most decent editors of this encyclopedia feel towards you truly manifests itself - Go away and do something useful - preferably on another site. Do I make myself quite clear? In short many people here hold you in complete contempt. It is totally amazing to me that you (and I mean you in the singular) have not been permanently banned, and if I had anything to say in the matter that would have happened long ago. Now please (pretty pease - or whatever it is that is said in the backwoods you inhabit) leave and go an play elsewhere, before this all becomes very unpleasant indeed.

<dd>On a related note, I was looking at the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">Airship</a> and <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> articles the other day and was lacking more on the internal construction of the ships. The latter says: <i>"A comparatively small compartment for passengers and crew was built into the bottom of the frame. However, it is important to note that the small structure on the bottom of the large Zeppelins is not the entire habitable space of the craft; they often had crew or cargo space internally for aerodynamic reasons."</i> I was wondering what these internal compartments looked like. Did they have windows of any kind? There is something vaguely windowish at the front of the "cigar" part on <a href="../../../l/t/a/Image%7ELTA8G10_by_centennialofflight-gov.jpg_160a.html" title="Image:LTA8G10 by centennialofflight-gov.jpg">this image</a>, but it isn't that good. Most pictures aren't. <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> is a FA, but it really needs a good cross-section showing what the construction looked like inside. (To continue this rambling stream-of-consciousness reply with something completely unrelated, I have also been wondering in the last few days why there seem to be no easily available images on the web of <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stig_Wennerstr%C3%B6m_d7c6.html" title="Stig Wennerström">Stig Wennerström</a> from before the magic year of 1944.

<dd>August S., right. He was living in Paris at the time, and was interviewed by a French mag during the pre-expedition media furore. Asked what he thought of their chances, he replied very sensibly that a hot-air balloon like that of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgolfier_brothers.html" title="Montgolfier brothers">Montgolfier brothers</a> would have been safer, and that he was concerned about whether the drag-rope steering would work.

<dd>There's always Linné's disciples too, those young guys who went off plant-collecting to the ends of the earth and died like flies from strange unfamiliar germs. And scandals are good, you've got the idea. "Murder" in an article name is almost on a par with "balloon" as a draw, I reckon. (Maybe that one should be "assassination", though?) I was thinking, daringly, of the Hajby affair. Gustav V being gay and a blackmail story and Vilhelm Moberg trying to make it public, or have I got it wrong? And some squalid stuff about the Court plotting to get Hajby (sp?) incarcerated without a trial. Though I doubt there's enough information available even now. The Helander thing may by contrast be of perfect proportion for an article, nice and self-limiting and pretty self-structuring. (Why don't <i>you</i> do it?)

<dd>It would be nice to have a FA on Linnaeus for next year which is the 300th anniversary and will be celebrated in various ways in Sweden. There is certainly potential for a number of related articles on things such as his disciples (the ones who died gruesome deaths from strange parasites in exotic locations, but also on some survivors such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Peter_Thunberg_339c.html" title="Carl Peter Thunberg">Carl Peter Thunberg</a> and his stays in South Africa and Japan.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:38, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you put a cleanup tag on <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wise_Blood_df34.html" title="Wise Blood">Wise Blood</a>? The article is very well written, as far as I can see. (It's mostly the work of <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">User:Geogre</a>, author of many Featured articles.) And a Cleanup template branded on its forehead is very disfiguring and shameful. I think you ought to put an explanation on the article's talk page when you add that tag — certainly when the reason for it is far from obvious, as here.

<dd>Love your <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Whenstone_4dbb.html" title="Thomas Whenstone">Thomas Whenstone</a>, some life!&#160;:-) As for the nepotism, the interesting thing is how differently it was regarded (for lots of good reasons, of course). People would have thought Cromwell was horribly immoral if he <i>hadn't</i> looked out for his nephew — it wasn't optional, it was what a decent person did. Things like that wouldn't have suddenly changed just because the world was turned upside down. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:32, 5 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Well, he is like Mompesson, in that regard. It's always interesting to read plays where a king is criticized for giving too much to favorites (<i><a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_II_c9bc.html" title="Edward II">Edward II</a></i> comes to mind), as picking unworthy favorites is a sign of bad character, and so is rewarding nephews in a particular way when they show their incompetence or unfitness. You have to look out for them, but you're supposed to show how clever you are by realizing that they'd be better off at the Admiralty Office than with guns under command, and you show yourself magnificent and wise beyond all the ages if you punish your bastard son, the Duke of Monmouth, after he does a little thing like organize a revolt against your brother. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:23, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a thought. Thanks, guys.

<p>They're kind of the heart of it, at least in my view, since what I see happening most is the identification of the words with the person and the totality of the person. I know that tends a bit toward the psychoanalytical rhetorical, but <i>in effect</i> that's both the cause and the mode of the problem: identifying the truth with the words, the words with the person, and therefore the jarring of words as the jarring of ideas and the warfare of people.

<p>Ok, now that I understand the situation regarding the "ghost image" pages for images in Commons let me ask something else... Here's what I'm doing, I've created a commons account and I'm now organizing theatre images there. I would like to start adding eligible images to the commons. I've been looking around and have come across discussions on deleting images here on Wikipedia that have already been uploaded to commons. What is the current (if any) admin consensus regarding this? Thanks!</p>
