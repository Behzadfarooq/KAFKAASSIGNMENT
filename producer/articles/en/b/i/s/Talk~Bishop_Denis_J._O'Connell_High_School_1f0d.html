<p>I will try to keep the site updated with current information.

<dl>
<dd>In what sense is the "thing about the girls calling the radio station" "a little much"? It used to be pretty salacious but has been edited to reflect an impartial perspective. For my part, since this is not the first time this has come up, I'll say that it was an event that gained the school significant public attention at the time, whether positive or negative. If only for that reason, it's worth being documented. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkellystyle_5148.html" title="User:Johnkellystyle">johnkellystyle</a> 19:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was thinking about things to add to a potential "<b>history and folklore</b>" section of this page. One of them I thought of was the story of a <b>plane crash</b> on the O'Connell football field, maybe about 20 years or so ago. I was told tha some kind of small aircraft like a <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cessna.html" title="Cessna">cessna</a> crashed into the football field behind O'Connell. If anyone can find any sources that corroborate this story or have anything to add, including other such stories, please let me know. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkellystyle_5148.html" title="User:Johnkellystyle">johnkellystyle</a> 07:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The health teachers are still talking about that one. Maybe also add in something about the school starting out divided by gender originally and how you weren't allowed to cross this one white line painted on campus. Not really appropriate for that section though. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutside_Center_195d.html" title="User:Outside Center">Outside Center</a> 03:04, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The gender division might be appropriate for the history part of that section, actually, so not totally off base. I never heard about the white line, but I can confirm, based on testimonials from family members who went to O'Connell in the 70s, that the genders were divided by building. As they explained, areas in the front (roughly from the cafeteria forward) were for one gender and from the cafeteria back was for another. I'm not sure which was which. Feel free to correct me on this one or clarify. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkellystyle_5148.html" title="User:Johnkellystyle">johnkellystyle</a> 03:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It doesn't really seem as though that belongs here, as it deals with what two students did and how the school reacted to it in a normal way. There is no "controversy" that surrounds the school because of it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the issue was relevant school and the school's public image. The focal point of the controversy, and I think, what ultimately resulted in a fine was that Elliot essentially slandered the school. Whether or not you think the school administration's role was relevant, it was the most significant media exposure the school has had in a long time. So, given that fact, it deserves to be recognized.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you think the heading "controversy" isn't appropriate, then that can become a point of discussion. In any case, there's no excuse to keep deleting the text. Nobody here is trying create a negative image of the school, just to state the facts and let history be written. If you object to that, then you'd best take your argument elsewhere. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkellystyle_5148.html" title="User:Johnkellystyle">johnkellystyle</a> 06:24, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a DJO alum, even though I'm not overcome with pride for the school, I'm a bit disappointed in the lack formatting and thoroghness of the page. I'll be working on updating it during the next few weeks. If anyone has any suggestions or things they'd like to add, let me know... or, just put it up there! --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkellystyle_5148.html" title="User:Johnkellystyle">johnkellystyle</a> 19:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>- Maybe add a section of famous sports figures for O'Connell. Scratch that just a famous graduates section. <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutside_Center_195d.html" title="User:Outside Center">Outside Center</a> 19:28, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>- So far, I've been able to add a "<a href="../../../o/27/c/O%27Connell_High_School_2fd8.html#Notable_Alumni.07UNIQ20f6e21b37c4848c-nowiki-0000002D-QINU5.07UNIQ20f6e21b37c4848c-nowiki-0000002E-QINU" title="O'Connell High School">Notable Alumni</a>" section to the <a href="../../../o/27/c/O%27Connell_High_School_2fd8.html#Boys_Varsity_Team" title="O'Connell High School">Varsity Basketball</a> section. I am going to try to look through the <a href="http://www.bishopoconnell.org/pages/sitepage.cfm?page=4621" class="external text" title="http://www.bishopoconnell.org/pages/sitepage.cfm?page=4621" rel="nofollow">O'Connell Atheltic Hall of Fame</a> and start adding some of those names, but that will take awhile. Also, I've looked around and I'm not sure where to find a listing of non-athletic notable alumni. If you are willing ot help at all with this, let me know. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnkellystyle_5148.html" title="User:Johnkellystyle">johnkellystyle</a> 06:43, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
