<p>CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHETHER THEY STILL WRITE "With My Duty", as when I was there we used the acronym, "WMD". I don't thinik Ofsted would like seeing Weapons of Mass Destruction at the top of every piece of work. Further more, can anyone tell me where I can get a copy of Treading on the Camomile? User:152.78.254.243 02:36, 7 November 2005, I always wrote With my Duty, this was heavily enforced early on right up until Mrs Evans turned up, when it was not seen as being so important. (Nathan P. Bridle) 01/04/2006</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/f/a/AFAIK_d7af.html" title="AFAIK">AFAIK</a> They still write With My Duty - the recent revisions were done by someone with current knowledge of the school - so I guess if this had been abandoned this would have been changed along with the loss of the Choir Form and the Beating Of The Bounds.

<p>Yep, I'm a current pupil in the school and they do ask that you write WMD or With My Duty, however it's not very strictly enforced. (James Maul)</p>
<p>It should be "With my Duty" in full! WMD is weapons of mass destruction and not permitted by traditional teachers at the school. (A Teacher)</p>
<p>A Teacher, whoever you are, uphold the traditions of the school and do not let Mrs Evans meddle with them. Bring back full academic dress including hoods on foundres day for more than just SLT.</p>

I think forgiveness varied over the years but on the two occasions I had to do it I was made to carry bricks round the Yard for about an hour, and had to do lots of press-ups.

<p>Alas, the new Headteacher, Mrs. Bridget Evans, has got rid of a lot of the traditions which made the school so special. This can only be a sad thing. The School's traditions should be upheld at all costs. (comment moved from article to talk page) 86.137.172.17</p>
<dl>
<dd>That may be so but we can't put our opionions in the article as it just has to be factual. My view is that it is principally the traditions which keep the school notable, in the absence of any academic distinction. Therefore, to ensure it has a place in wikipedia, where a tradition has been abandoned or modified, the former practice should be set out with additional wording setting out the current practice. I am pretty sure they would have abandoned the blue and black shorts thing, as corporal punishment is frowned upon these days, so perhaps someone who has attended or taught at the school during the last twenty years can update this section. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 12:19, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am thinking of revising the page on Stopford's to make it truly first rate. I left in 2003. I am very interested in what traditions existed before i was at the school as i can only remember the Pickard/Evans era. If someone could list a comprehensive set of traditions with details i would much appreciate it. Be as broad as possible, include assemblies, punishments, notable teachers etc...</p>
<p>Also, any old memorabelia, such as Speech Day Programmes, or old photos that could be put on the site would be good. If anyone fancies taking on this task with me i would appreciate an experienced voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I left in 2001 and remember distinctly seeing two pairs of shorts, one blue, and one black, in Pickard's study when i went to collect Placets. Now i know what they were for! Do students at Bishops still have the opportunity to attend Chapel every morning at 8.15?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes they can. The Chaplin is Father Steven Taylor who look over after Father Lowery left in 1992.</p>

<p>Is there an old Stopfordian society, there should be</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/f/a/AFAIK_d7af.html" title="AFAIK">AFAIK</a> <i>Bishop Stopford's Old Boys</i> which was the original alumni organisation changed to <i>The Stopfordians</i> in about 1990, and is a going concern. They haven't issued a newsletter for a while. While we're on the subject of old Stopfordians, are there really only two famous old Stopfordians? That is pathetic compared with <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonyhurst_College_b072.html" title="Stonyhurst College">Stonyhurst College</a>. What about that old boy who came back and donated some of his 'art' to the school. He was supposedly famous, does anyone remember his name? Also is Benedict "<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny.html" title="Benny">Benny</a>" Huggins (brother of Warren "Woz" Huggins) really presenting a programme on Sky TV as stated in the Friends Reunited Famous ex-pupils section? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 10:06, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>..Why is it suprising that Stopford's does not have as many famous old Stopfordian's as Stonyhurt? It is much more recent. And also i'm sure there are some more from the old Suffolks which i guess could count.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I was not surprised by the difference, I wasn't comparing the performances of the two schools' ex-pupils, more the information that was posted here about them (even if you ignore Stonyhurst's pre-1967 existence). Suffolks pupils could count if they transferred to Bishop's. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 12:04, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The reference to the Mathematics and Computing specialism has been deleted - They still put this on their letters so I believe it still applies. any thoughts on this?</li>
<li>'Voluntary-aided' has been removed, but it still has 'Voluntary-aided' on its sign (and in the most recent OFSTED report) so I presume that hasn't changed - comments please?</li>
<li>Regarding uniforms - there is a reference to a dress code among staff. can this be correct? When I attended (78 to 85) there were some smart teachers, but many adopted teacher-style clothes (mis-matching jacket and trousers, scruffy tie, elbow patches, and see also Worzel below). Perhaps this was tightened up during the Pickard era.</li>
<li>I am not sure that the fact that Miss Doré used to dress unconventionally should be included here - yes she was known as <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worzel_Gummidge_0a04.html" title="Worzel Gummidge">Worzel Gummidge</a>, but that's really what <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends_Reunited_e76f.html" title="Friends Reunited">Friends Reunited</a> is for - so I have taken out the reference and instead put a link to the FR Bishop's site. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 13:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>--The school is still voluntarily aided in the terms that it owns it's own building, but the tag no longer applies. --The Pickard era saw teacher dress code much more strictly enforced, although there were still some Wurzels. Namely Mr. Geary and Miss. Dore. --The was a staff dress-code during the Pickard era, which is now gone i believe. Alas.</p>

<dd>Re forms of address, be it noted that in the days when I had principles, I refused to address any master as "Sir" unless I believed he deserved the honorific, instead referring to them as "Mister X". I never had any problem with staff over this. Also I'm not sure that "lesson" and "teacher" were absent from our lexicon. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>. 19:21, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>During the Pickard era teachers were still referred to as Sir or Miss, although i believe that has subsided now. Master and Mistress were used when describing a teacher, such as one's Maths Master, or saying Miss. Dore was a Maths Mistress.</dd>

<p>The Raymond Solly prize for lower school English - Given to students in First Year, Second Year or Third Year for English. Mr. Solly, a former teacher and school legend, presents the trophy.</p>

I can't believe they would be destroyed if the legend that is Mr. Solly was still there.

<p>'Tis a curse of modern corporate-speak, and the school website suffers from it. The elevation to proper-noun status of positions, groups of people and places that are not place names are the vanguard of the movement. Thus, for example, "The current Head Master addressed the assembled Pupils about the Rules governing Home Visits." (Not a direct quote.) We are in a position of weakness because such entities as the School Song, may, I think, be correctly capitalised in that usage, but not in others. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>. 12:51, 14 February 2006 (UTC) (In due course governing will doubtless inherit a capital from Governor, assembled from Assembly and so forth.) <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>. 12:53, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The use of capital letters at the beginning of non-proper nouns was more widespread before English became standardised. It is used a lot by lawyers, primarily because of their habit of using capitals to indicate defined terms. Whenever Dr Roberts would send a letter or other written communication from the School (or do I mean 'school'?), he would have it checked by the head of the English Department (No, that's a title!), Nick Mills. Perhaps the current administration is also untroubled by such niceties. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 11:25, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having said that, I have just gone through capitalising <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. Is this never referred to as communion any more in the school? I think we may also need to capitalise Chaplain as it's a title. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 10:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sadly grammar is something no longer focussed upon at Stopford's. The former English master Mr. Solly famously taught grammar from Fowler's Modern English Usage right up until his retirement, long after the book had gone out of fashion. The current head is an English teacher and therefore one would expect her to have a reasonable level of competence with the language however this does not appear to be the case. I would think that the only English teacher capable of proof-reading properly still at the school is the wonderful character, Mrs. Hannan. The terms Eucharist and Communion are used interchangably. I believe that the rule book uses the term Communion but the blue books containing the service order, replaced now with white cards, use the term Eucharist. USer:152.78.254.243</dd>
<dd>There is some subtlety about what constiutes a title. I went through <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">pope</a> making substantial changes from capital P to lowercase, expcting to get torn to sherds, but everyone seemed happy with it. Certainly we talk about Queen Elizabeth, or the Queen (possibly The Queen&#160;?) coming to tea, but it should be "crowns are worn by kings and queens". And while it is Miss Smith, Sir Rumpley-Wumply or Lord Splodge, I have my doubts about "staff should refer to their Manager" or "their Head of Department" - this is a position not a title. Similarly the School Rules are a book, but pupils break a school rule. I would only urge a little thought, and we will all doubtless change anything we disagree with, and discuss if it's a problem as per. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>. 10:48, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What hymns do you guys remember singing at Stopford's? I always enjoyed singing along with the bellowing organ in the background played by the amazing Mr. Smith, whose hair never stayed still.

<dd>I remember Lowry's delight in "Christian doest thou see them" -also in the (spoken) line "goeth about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour". The last song in the book had an optional "amen" at the end. In hymn practice it was always the last hymn we sang. The distinction being that with one pianist, Mr Mills, we avoided the amen, with the other (I forget who) we sang it. The pupils weren't clued in on this however until some months into the school year, having been shouted at by both pianists, one of the masters took pity ,and explained the situation. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>. 11:34, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I was at Stopford's we used the numbering system 1 - 5 for year groups. In the Mr. July section 11G is mentioned, does this mean the school has sadly moved to the new 7-13 numbering system or was it 1G mistyped?</p>

<dd>I think this has been done all over the country. The number is supposed to represent the number of years you have been in the education system, but is flawed because you have the same form number at the start of the academic year as at the end of it, and also because you have some children starting at 3 and others at 4 or 5.

<p>Does anyone remember the Stopford run for boys at the start of every term?</p>
<p>And WINTER SPORTS, across Fawlty Hall.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the cross-country run was a bit of a waste of time, although it wasn't for me, as I managed not to do it after that first year.</dd>

<p>I think it's Forty Hall, rather than <a href="../../../f/a/w/Fawlty_Towers_370c.html" title="Fawlty Towers">Fawlty</a> Hall, but I don't remember any sports there during 1978-1985. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 17:44, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for adding the additional info. I have tweaked this to wikify but can't find "Steven Hanness" on the IMDB list of cast and crew for "The Importance of Being Earnest". Does anyone know what role he played? Is there a source for this? Lucy Bolster may have married one of Blue, but which one? I couldn't find details of the wedding in the BBC news archive, nor any details on Blue's home page. Got a lot more on Benny Huggins, who seems to have done well for himself - he used to be an estate agent in Enfield. "Stuart Taylor - Journalist" is a bit brief - do we know for which publications? Also, did David Kort become successful as an actor in the end? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 14:02, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The school's website says that from May a new Chaplain will take over, Father Anthony Homer. Does anyone know why or whether Fr. Taylor has left. This is most worrying, as without him Mrs. Evans will be free to abolish all the traditions the school has held dear for 40 years.</p>

<dd>Assuming you're correct, it may be possible that the new Chaplain will be similarly minded to the present incumbent. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 11:40, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Isn't there rather too much about the new chaplain? He needs his own wikipedia article. Can somebody do the appropriate editing? (A Teacher)</p>

<dl>
<dd>A. Teacher is quite correct. The information should be boiled down, and if necessary moved to a sub-section under "noteworthy teachers". Only information about the post of chaplain should be kept in that section. The information about the possible controversy relating to the school traditions should be moved to a seprate section , and considered in the light of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERich_Farmbrough_7642.html" title="User:Rich Farmbrough">Rich</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERich_Farmbrough_93a5.html" title="User talk:Rich Farmbrough">Farmbrough</a></i>, 12:31 <a href="../../../2/7/_/27_February_b90b.html" title="27 February">27 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT).</dd>

<p>Is it true there were some dodgy goings on at the school, particularly involving Dr. Roberts.</p>

<p>any ideas on the clean up? i corrected some unhelpful edits and thanks for the info on WMD and the new uniform although i though it proper to include the line re. gowns as for many they are an integral part of the school. shame the new headmistress seems to intent on abolishing everything that makes stopfords great.</p>

<dd>I removed the clean-up tag because I odn't think it needs clean-up in the wikipedia sense.

<p>The article presently states "Male members of staff should wear a suit." I would have thought a dress code for the teachers unenforceable. In (79-85) some male teachers wore suits, but the majority wore the usual teachers' mis-match of jacket and trousers. Anyone at Bishop's during Charles Chaplin's teaching time will remember his navy blue blazer over a blue or maroon pullover, for example. So my question is, at what stage (if ever) did a Head Master or Head Mistress actually tell masters that they had to wear a suit. I would suspect never. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 13:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am unaware of specifics but I distinctly remember being told by Mrs Melhuish and Miss Glennie during the Pickard era that only recently had they been permitted to wear trousers rather than skirts, thereby implying a staff dresscode.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>The school song is known to bring some masters and mistresses, as well as students, to tears. Mrs. Chalmers, who was a student at the school and went on to become Head of Geography, found it hard to complete the hymn without crying. This was by no means uncommon. Pupils have always been expected to learn the school song in the First Year and many will have memories of the former Director of Music, Mr. Smith teaching it to them. - - Mr. Smith taught at the school since it opened in 1967 and was the Director of Music up until his retirement in 2002. He played the school organ in every assembly and was one of the most loved teachers by many. His organ playing was first class, he is a Fellow of the Royal College of Church Musicians and is the only man in the country to have played on every Cathedral organ. Every Stopfordian will remember his interpretation of the hymn "Christian Dost Thou See Them", during which he added an extra two notes to which the hole congregation proceeded to bob up and down once. He was famous for singing and playing the organ at the same time and he ran the choir form. Since his departure there was one more Director of Music, Mr. D. Bruton, however all since then have not taken this title, and have, alas, not been able to play the organ. This has meant that on numerous occasions throughout the year Mr. Smith returns to play the organ however it does mean that pupils today do not get the daily dose of organ music they used to.</p>

<dd>I think it was removed because it is what is called 'school-cruft' - not quite right for an encyclopaedia. It's OK to say that someone was 'loved by many' on Friends Reunited, but difficult to substantiate. Would this also lead to a list of teachers that are despised by many? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidFarmbrough_2f59.html" title="User:DavidFarmbrough">DavidFarmbrough</a> 14:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
