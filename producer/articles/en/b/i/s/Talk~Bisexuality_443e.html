<p>"In most parts of South East Asia, bisexuality became a trend specially with adolescents. They encounter such change in sexual preference since they are very much curious about their sexual orientation and their exposure to wide range of media."</p>
<p>This is an interesting claim both on a semantic and syntactic level.

<p>To return to a subject mentioned on an older (and now-archived) discussion, I find it hard to understand why this comprehensive article does not even mention last year's joint study from Northwestern &amp; The Center for Addiction and Mental Health into bisexual arousal patterns. It is high-profile and generated a lot of headlines. More importantly, it is the most physiological-based study (direct measure of genital arousal) to date and, as such, should be referenced in an encyclopedic treatment of the topic. I appreciate that, since the study casts doubt on the existence of male bisexuality (feeding into the old saw about gay, straight or lying) and that the reseachers (or their sponsors) may themselves be potentially subject to accusations of bias, that it is a difficult topic. But this is an encyclopedic discussion, and <u>not an advocacy page</u>. Surely, then, the latest research (with caveats as needed) should be accorded an important place in the main body. Is there consensus as to how to incorporate the information? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 19:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you mean that discussed at <a href="../../../b/i/s/Talk%7EBisexuality_Archive_1_b84c.html#Recent_research" title="Talk:Bisexuality/Archive 1">Talk:Bisexuality/Archive_1#Recent research</a>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the study <i>claimed</i> to cast doubt. As for inclusion into this article, a measure of genital arousal is not the same as a measure of sexual orientation. And we might just as well place it in the <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a> article as a claim of doubting heterosexuality, since 1/3 of these men showed no arousal (and also it suggests that those who did showed attraction towards <i>both</i> genders, thus if anything, confirming the existence of bisexuality - the conclusion seems to be based on the flawed assumption that bisexuality implies 50/50 attraction).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is perhaps notable that people claimed that this meant bisexuality doesn't exist. In fact, this is already included in the <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biphobia.html" title="Biphobia">biphobia</a> article. So the question is, should that text be transferred here? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 21:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even accepting all that (and see below), I am not clear why it is not included in the article. The study received media attention because of the explicit references it madeto patterns of (male) bisexuality. As a result, the study should be mentioned in a discussion of the subject. The concerns you have raised can cerainly be addressed, but how is that grounds for not making reference to it in an encyclopedic treatment of the article.</dd>
<dd>Further, your point <i>and we might just as well place it in the <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexuality.html" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a> article as a claim of doubting heterosexuality</i> is unclear. The NYT article notes: <i>But the men in the study who described themselves as bisexual did not have patterns of arousal that were consistent with their stated attraction to men and to women. Instead, about three-quarters of the group had arousal patterns identical to those of gay men; the rest were indistinguishable from heterosexuals.</i> Does that mean the article should state that bisexuality doesn't exist? Of course not. But the isues raised by the study should at least be mentioned as germane to the topic. It could indeed be ref'ed elsewhere as well. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 20:40, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>OK, those are fair points, although I assume you would agree it is a stretch to suggest that editors would accept a denial that heterosexuality exists. Since this study was, in the media and (some of the) scientific community, at least, principally associated with bisexuality (and not biphobia) , this article would presumably be a good place to cover the subject. Agreed? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 04:36, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think many editors here would accept a denial that bisexuality exists, either. I'm not too bothered which article it goes in, though I think (along with several editors at <a href="../../../b/i/s/Talk%7EBisexuality_Archive_1_b84c.html#Recent_research" title="Talk:Bisexuality/Archive 1">Talk:Bisexuality/Archive_1#Recent_research</a>) it shouldn't be included on the basis of "research" as such - but on the basis it's only notable due to the criticism and attention it received. Possibly a "criticism of bisexuality" section(?). Though I feel this article should be a place to discuss bisexuality itself, not dubious studies trying to discredit it. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 14:47, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Saying bisexuals face criticism from homophobics only is unfair. Not all people that criticize gays are nessecarly afraid of them.

<p>This is a bit glib. In many cases, bi people are not fitting seamlessly in to gay or straight society, we are closeted in them. Many bi people, on coming out as bi, face exclusion and rejection from both straight and gay culture, and many more bi people are reluctant to publically self-identify as bi because they fear that reaction.

<dd>I just wanted to add my personal views on this topic.</dd>
<dd>First; let me start off by saying that I too have experimented with the gay/bi community and became very active in puersuing this feeling. I was 14 at the time. First, it started off by liking girls, wanting to go out on dates, feelings of being bisexual, and than even escalated to thinking I was a lesbian. But.... I am now 16 and have had a chance to explore my feelings and go into more depth onto what it is I am attracted to. At this time, I can tell you that I am not gay and that I am not bisexual. At the same time-I am attracted to men, but am not "sexually active" with either men nor women. I feel that as a pre-teen, feelings and emotions rise that we aren't in complete controll of. Hormones escalate, and thoughts overcome our minds and we start to experiment. Find out what we like and what lifestyle were more comfortable in living. For some, being bi-curious is just the start. For others, it goes on to confirm ones own feelings about their sexual orientation. One may consider themselves bisexual, but will later become lesbian/gay, whatever. OR one may like myself experiment, go through "phases" and learn that the lifestyle wasn't one for you. What I'm trying to say is that its not always what it is. Don't be frustrated if you can't make up your mind or if your confused weather or not you are curious, gay, lesbian, bi, whatever... don't even try and label yourself. It's not worth the social pressure that comes along with it. So you like the same sex. SImple. Leave it as that. If your not sure if your bi or gay, than don't worry, and let life take its course, and you will as you proceed through life learn what it is you are most comfortable with.</dd>

<dd>Yeah, but you forget one thing: society. Nature abhors a vacuum. If you don't label yourself, society will. Look at Alan Cumming, who refused to label himself and got made into "a frolicky <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-sexual.html" title="Pan-sexual">pan-sexual</a> <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_symbol.html" title="Sex symbol">sex symbol</a> for the new millennium", when really he's just bi.

<p>Thanks for your replies. They both make sense, but neither is really what I was getting at - what I meant was that for bi people, not people who are experimenting or unsure, there's a lot of pressure NOT to come out as bi (from being perceived as being either straight or gay), and the threat of being part of neither culture is enough to keep a lot of bi people in the straight AND gay closets. So it's not so much a matter of 'fitting in' (and certainly not seamlessly, since as both straight and gay biphobics will tell you, bi people cause a lot of trouble), as being threatened with exclusion if we don't shut up.</p>

<p>Thank you zappernapper - all I'm suggesting is that the 'fitting seamlessly' part should change a little to accommodate the idea of closeting for bi people. Gay men and lesbians aren't assumed to fit seamlessly into straight society when they're closeted.</p>

<p>Hi there. I wanted to ask here before changing the article. I'd like to add a few lines about how bisexuals may feel pressured to be either gay or straight, as conventional thinking has it that if bisexuals are attracted to both sexes, they must have more than one partner, thus defying society's value on monogamy. I'd also like to add info about how bisexuals may internalize this social tension, and maybe even a line about how psychologists help bisexuals to face these issues. I have sources too. But this might be more adequate for an article about bisexuals and mental health, I don't know. I don't wish to add something that exceeds the articles' purpose. I thought I might add it on the 'social status of bisexuality' section, but... And I don't think I have enough info to start a new section. Suggestions?

<dd>I see no reason why this shouldn't be in the article (others may disagree!), provided it's kept pretty short &amp;mdash it should probably link to an article on bisexuality and mental health with more information though. I'd be especially careful, however, about concepts like 'conventional thinking', since it's very difficult to find good evidence for that sort of thing. Ideally there'd be a well organised survey that suggested most people had this (obviously flawed) conception of bisexuality. I know of no such poll, however; if you do, great, because this is just the sort of thing that needs good support. But you say you've got sources, so provided they cover all the different claims, that's fine. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 13:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think I'm actually the one who added the fact template to what you are talking about.

<dd>I had a similar discussion with someone else about this issue. I claimed that we don't need a citation to show that Sean Connery is Scottish. The other person said we did. They were right and I was wrong. Now, I agree with you that we don't need to cite things like "During daylight the sky has the appearance of a deep blue surface". Though we might want to add "often" or "usually", since in my experience the sky can be only a very light blue, or even something approaching white. However, the sentence "Although observed in a variety of forms in human societies and in the animal kingdom throughout recorded history[citation needed]..." falls into the Sean Connery category, not the blue sky one. If someone doubts the claim about the colour of the sky, they can go outside and look. This is not true of Sean Connery's nationality and it's not true of claims about recorded history and non-heterosexual behaviour among animals. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 17:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's pleasing: of course, there is a difference between citing <i>why</i> the sky is blue and citing the fact that it often is. Of course, I might add that Sean Connery's Scottishness isn't cited specifically, though the article does at least have plenty of references that do confirm the fact. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 18:17, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. I think the most important issue is that just because "everyone knows" he's Scottish, doesn't mean that he is. Plenty of things taken to be facts turn out not to be true. I have to say, I've never personally observed bisexual behaviour among other animals. I'm sure it does occur, but I'd still like to see a source for the claim here. A further issue, of course, is that sources often contain more detailed information. Wikipedia doesn't have to be just about providing direct information about things. I sometimes find it most useful as a source of references to follow up. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 18:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Coming back to the tags - what can we consider "citable" and what isn't?

<p>See <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">here</a>. A lot of it is common sense. I'd say a good rule of thumb is that if something can't be checked very easily by the reader, there should be a source for it. Obviously some claims are less controversial than others. I think it's especially important to have good sources for articles such as this. So many claims are made about sexuality that are questionable. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 19:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
