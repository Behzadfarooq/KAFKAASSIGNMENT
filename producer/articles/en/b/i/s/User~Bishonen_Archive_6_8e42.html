<p>Damn it, people keep "correcting" the title of her novel. &lt;sigh&gt; It reminds me of the newspaper that used a search and replace routine and then had to issue the following retraction: "Last week, the article should have read 'The company hopes that the new actions will help get the finances back into the black,' not 'back into the African American.' We regret the error." Anyway, I was expecting more herring chasing after my comments on the "Brave Admins" talk page, too, but I guess I was either clearer in my intent or more Johnsonian in my dilery than I expected. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:28, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My dilery. You know, as in "what's the dilery, yo?" (Actually, it was supposed to be "delivery." It's hard to speak of one's clear or Johnsonian delivery when one has a typo in it.) (And Johnson was known to compose while <i>walking to the printer,</i> so I can't say, "He did it, too!") I love your collective warnings. It ought to stop people not using -bots, but, then again, the longish Talk page comment should have stopped them, too, esp. since there was already a history edit summary saying that Scott was the one with the spelling problem in this case.

<p>Welcome back, dear! I do hope you're feeling better!</p>
<p>I've been working on S's reputation a bit, but i've gotten a bit side-tracked. I just noticed the travesty of an article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Garrick_e60b.html" title="David Garrick">David Garrick</a> and I immediately set to righting the situation, which will lead back to S's reputation (which will now include Garrick's contribution to performance of S) once finished. Turns out that Mr. Garrick, being one of the wealthiest men in Britain, was also one of the most painted and I've discovered a great cache of paintings of him including a marvelous painting of him in Vanbrugh's <i>The Provoked Wife</i>!

"Lintott" is a Swedish word, maybe a little oldfashioned but perfectly current: it means "towhead", "blond boy". (Sw <i>lin</i> is indeed = flax or <i>tow</i>.) What do you know about that?

<dd>Thanks. I wonder, too. Lintott got convinced that he was related to the royal printer Lintot, so he changed the spelling of his name. However, there were loads and loads of Scandinavian names in the east of England (the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danelaw.html" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>, after all), so not all the Linders and Lindens were recent. No telling how far back Bernard went. His pa was British, but I don't know about the grand daddy. I was impressed by reading the biography that Lintott was really just a guy who started out poor, liked literature, and climbed reasonably well. He never could hide his "common" background, but he knew his limits and yet wanted to overcome them. Curll was a <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>-like creature, and Tonson was a <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Paley_6c0c.html" title="William Paley">William Paley</a> sort or a <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Randolph_Hearst_c64a.html" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> sort. Lintott was somewhere between. Also, it looks like Pope was the dunce in all this, and yet Lintott got <i>blasted</i> more memorably even than Curll, though not as often. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:30, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for your congratulations, I had no idea - how do you know? I disagree with you though it is not my most attractive work, Sic Bar is still (IMO) that; and BP has been much edited and altered, so will probably be FARCd while on the main page, unless one of the zealots spot it first. To be honest I would rather see <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanssouci.html" title="Sanssouci">Sanssouci</a> there on 21st as that exemplifies the wiki community spirit and is also a very attractive page, but it still has to complete FAC, so may take some time.

<p>Speaking of Quixotic quests, there is an IP editor who has one mission in life: ensure that Wikipedia talks about the "hit television show <i>The Mint.</i>" It has insisted, contrary to a "widely respected administrator"'s advice, that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mint_0826.html" title="The Mint">The Mint</a> must disambiguate, and not <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mint.html" title="Mint">Mint</a>. &lt;sigh&gt; Then someone is editing <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hylozoism.html" title="Hylozoism">Hylozoism</a> with extremely learned material -- truly top notch -- but in the weirdest possible way.

<p>Well, the anon is wrong. Did you see how the anon originally wanted it? The top line would have read, "For the smash hit British TV show, see...." I smell marketing. One of the time honored principles of disambiguation is who gets there first, unless the situation is hopelessly illogical. In this case, I think logic is on my side, and I definitely got there first. (Logic is on my side because of 600 years of "the mint" being a district, tons of literature with "the mint" as a reference, vs. 6 months of hype; to have a structure that doesn't mess us up entirely, we shouldn't rename our articles every time a new creature appears. Further, at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mint_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Mint (disambiguation)">mint (disambiguation)</a>, there are other pop culture ephemera that are known as "the mint," but the authors of those articles didn't get to rename either the plant article nor insert lines nor make the disambiguation the default link nor rename the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mint_0826.html" title="The Mint">The Mint</a> article.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sjöman won't be in <i>SBL</i>, as he died too late. They passed Sj- a few years ago. He should have changed his name to Tjöman or Ujöman in time before he died; now he will just have to wait for the supplement, whenever that will be. But there is stuff on Sjöman in the culture sections of the Swedish newspapers these days. I have to admit that I haven't seen <i><a href="../../../i/_/a/I_Am_Curious_%28Yellow%29_91ac.html" title="I Am Curious (Yellow)">I Am Curious (Yellow)</a></i>. According to Wikipedia, it is "starring <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lena_Nyman_c824.html" title="Lena Nyman">Lena Nyman</a> as herself"? What does that mean? She is an actress. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 06:10, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"As herself" sort of makes sense. She wasn't an actress then. I'm pretty sure her real name is used in the film, and — I'm a little fuzzy on this part — the real Lena Nyman at the time may well have been a sociology student. Lena as an actress was "discovered" by Sjöman, anyway, I'm sure of that much. There was a kind of (surely fake) documentary frame story: the young student Lena does a project, and also tries to satisfy her own "curiosity", about social class in Sweden. See how Sjöman himself is also billed as starring? <i>As</i> himself, is seen to follow her around with a camera, and talking with her some, right there on screen. It's the story of a young person coming to terms with her disillusionment about Sweden as a class society. The American rep of the film is moronic, I have to say.

<dd>Again, not <i>really.</i> I mean, a docudrama starts from a record of events that have already occurred and then dramatizes them. There is avant garde documentary, especially <i><a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_Cool_d34f.html" title="Medium Cool">Medium Cool</a>,</i> but even that really started out as a New Wave film and accidentally became documentary. I'd leave it as New Wave and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metafiction.html" title="Metafiction">metafiction</a>. To some degree, even Bergman was doing New Wave metafiction with <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Persona_%28film%29.html" title="Persona (film)">Persona (film)</a></i> and definitely with <i>Hour of the Wolf</i> (a fake documentary frame to a reenactment that is entirely surrealist, all feigning horror film). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:52, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill O'Reily said that there was a study from Sweden that showed that, since they had gay marriage in Sweden, marriages have fallen off by 80% and therefore marriage has been destroyed there. (Now, there was no study. Sweden doesn't have gay marriage.

<dd>Of <b>course</b> it was of IKEA. They never said it was Danish, either. "Oh, Mom, everyone beats up the kids with the purple pøpli." The "make your own dinner" was the only hollow bit of the satire.

<dd>Yes, anyone who would question Shøp as a play on IKEA is very, very confused. (Although that doesn't have much to do with whether it was Danish or Swedish, perhaps).

<p>Are there possibly any guideline anywhere saying that a word redirected to an article, should be explained or at least mentioned in that page? I clicked "Carlos V]], and found myself at an article called "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor". I spent some time checking it was the right king, then added the name in the article. Now people keep saying it shouldn't be there, since he wasn't called by that name in Spain. Apparently he was in other places though, since there are 14 wikilinks to "Carlos V". I know pretty much nothing about the king in question, but IMHO it would be commons sense to make sure readers should not have to experience regarding my confusion. The principle not to mention what someone was called in all the countries in the world is valid I guess, but there has to be a limit. Do you think there is any kind of guideline I can point to? Where should I look for it, do you think? // <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 12:51, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the reference is unobtrusive, why are folks arguing? I should think the number of links is sufficient to have something like "<b>Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</b> (also, Carlos V, Charles V, and Charlieboy #3)" wouldn't be the end of the world. It's either that or have Carlos V redirect to a disambiguation page that lists all the nations that had a fifth Carlos as king, as well as anyone known only as Carlos V (the letter, not the number). Presumably there are no other Carlos V's around and that's why the redirect goes to the HRE. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The change in text was liked, however, by both me and <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYossarian_a081.html" title="User:Yossarian">Yossarian</a>, insofar as: (a) it's more orthographically correct (i.e., it's simply wrong to say "This user is <i>Waiting for Godot</i>", with the title used in the sentence, which would mean "This user is the play <i>Waiting for Godot</i>"); and (b) the new text directly references a word used in the play ("surely"). Thoughts? —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 12:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Woops. Jumped the gun again. I see you took care of point (a)—sorry about that. But surely we can put the "surely" back in? —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 12:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I realize it's in the play, almost a refrain in the play: "Godot will surely come tomorrow." But what I liked about the template, when I put it on my page the other day as my only userbox ever, was that, without the "surely", it sounds like I'm actually <i>sure</i>. I know Godot will come tomorrow, so I'm merely making a neutral announcement of what <i>will</i> come to pass. (Whereas when it's qualified with "surely", I'm merely expressing a hope, and some obviously shaky optimism.) I found that amusing; there's no accounting for these things. Using "surely" because that's the way it is in the play is more of an excluding in-joke, to me. But it's obviously not up to me, if several people like the other version. I'll remove it from my page; I'm fine with that, as I'm against boxen anyway, on the whole. Thanks for being so polite, Saposcat. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:52, 18 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I was a bit surprised by this reversal of my tagging an image "no source". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Oil_painting_of_the_Greek_Parliament%2C_at_the_end_of_the_19th_century%2C_by_N._Orlof.jpg&amp;diff=42292377&amp;oldid=41163342" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Oil_painting_of_the_Greek_Parliament%2C_at_the_end_of_the_19th_century%2C_by_N._Orlof.jpg&amp;diff=42292377&amp;oldid=41163342" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. What source is mentioned? "at the end of the 19th century, by N. Orlof"? Is this really enough?

<p>I know I have pestered you with image copyright stuff before, and you showed me someplace else.

<dd>Er, well, you're most welcome to ask me about anything, but I'll admit image copyright is something of a least favorite subject.&#160;;P Meanwhile, that's odd, the way you were reverted. There is clearly no source. A source would be something like "Downloaded from <a href="http://etcetc" class="external free" title="http://etcetc" rel="nofollow">http://etcetc</a>", or "Scanned from the book such-and-such, p.xx", or "Photo taken by uploader". The kind of info that you mention, when the picture was painted etc, wouldn't be a source either, but would be needed for correct licensing. IOW that image page has not one but several problems — what there is isn't enough by any means. Maybe <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESCEhardt_7145.html" title="User:SCEhardt">User:SCEhardt</a> meant to say something else. I'd message him if I were you. Link to this post of mine if you like, or simply to these examples of image pages for old oil paintings (though I bet Nemesis will get me for offering my own uploads as some kind of ideal — I'm sure I've left stuff out — but they're the only ones I can easily find).

<dd>Please see my message to Pm shef above. I'm not in the business of researching all possible abuses over the entire site, you know: like other admins, I deal with the ones I come across. And unlike you, Pm shef hasn't alerted my warning system by deleting other people's comments on article talkpages and ignoring the 3RR. (As far as I'm aware.) You say you got a warning not to return your vandalism counter when somebody removed it? From who? Not from me, and not from anybody else that I saw. You got warned for removing <i>warnings</i>, not for returning the counter. You got <i>appealed to</i> about the counter. By me. I explained to you, nicely, why things like that counter, and your overuse of the word "vandalism" altogether, would make other editors think the less of you and tend to make your time here more frustrating. Please don't come out with these random, poorly considered accusations, and don't make silly "tests" at other users' expense. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>See, that's the thing. I know some folks who post here who are writing things that they <i>have</i> published, but they can't refer to it. After all, having a reference to a thing you yourself have written is...well, it's tacky, and it's a big sign post to the amateur detectives. I'm referring to one now-missing Wikipedian in particular who had sufficient fame in real life to be found quite easily by anyone who wanted to search. Me, I'm in such a wasteland that folks coming to pay me a visit will be surrounded by 100 gun barrels of relatives in a flash, but still, it's the principle of the thing. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:10, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article <a href="../../../f/e/v/Fever.html" title="Fever">fever</a> mainly uses original scientific articles as references. This is how you do it if you write a scientific review article, but IMO a couple of textbooks would be better references on Wikipedia when the subject is as basic as this. In general, it takes insight to the field to decide what original articles to pick; you can do that in many ways, and end up with several different conclusions. I am not questioning this pick of orginal articles - how can I do that without reading them? It might well be a good pick made. I do not know if I do not read them all (honestly, I do not plan to). (<small>Addition: well, actually I would not know even if I read them all. I am not that initiated. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">Habj</a> 10:32, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</small>)</p>
<p>My problem is, I do not really understand how to edit the article in more than minor details - not unless I do a complete rewrite, throw all references out and add new ones instead. Let us say I rewrite half of it, but leave the other half of it as it is. If I do that and just add a couple of more references, probably half of the references mentioned are not actually used as sources for the text. However, I would have no clue which ones to remove. I could do it, but do not feel this should be a prerequisite for editing an article on a simple thing like fever.</p>
<p>Actually, the whole references section was added by one editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fever&amp;diff=19924070&amp;oldid=19882563" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fever&amp;diff=19924070&amp;oldid=19882563" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> who no longer is active here.

<dd>Haha. Well, those particular ISBNs wouldn't hurt anybody, as they're not exactly paperback bestsellers, and the Smith is probably too old to have one anyway (did you know there even <i>were</i> gay couples in Restoration comedy? lol); but in principle I'm against ISBNs in wiki references. They direct the reader to one particular edition. That's just plain wrong. Also it sours my temper to have to provide diffs and argue on FAC about this, that, and the other being <i>obligatory</i>. Every clueless newb is happy to tell the world an article can't be Featured because it "must have ISBNs" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_your_sources#Complete_citations_in_a_.22References.22_section" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cite_your_sources#Complete_citations_in_a_.22References.22_section" rel="nofollow">not at all</a>), or "didn't go through Peer Review yet" (love the "yet"), or "lacks footnotes" (arrrggghhhh).

<dd>First, this is a website. Second, <i>whose</i> reference system? The people that I loathe so much are, first, insisting on notes, and notes are not done in humanities journals. Second, they're wanting the most complicated system on purpose as a way of making themselves feel better. Third, there is the moronic trans-Atlantic querrulousness that will show up sooner or later ("quote," or "quote", or "quote1," or "quote,"1 or "quote"1, or 'quote1', etc.). Let all that whinging take place on the print version. Until the print version stops being vaporware, let's just give references, and to hell with the gnat inspection. (Sorry about the Geogre Boots, and mean no offense to Ganymead, but I can't countenance the rejection of hard work, good writing, and a positive contribution to the world because some alum-puckered teenager has convinced himself that anything without his favorite ref system must be rejected.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:50, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No offense taken. Of course I'm hardly an "alum-puckered teenager" *grin*, though I know I have been guilty of crying "Inline cites!" at FAC. Though I do concur that the requirement that ALL article possess them is a bit much. Certainly, I do think they should be used if one is quoting statistics or even if they are quoting someone verbatim, but not for every little fact in an article. Perhaps this is the price of all the MLA stylistic procedures forced down our throats in high school?

<dd>If you insist. Page numbering is a swamp. Sometimes people refer to the edition they see in the library catalogue, complete with ISBN, while actually quoting from, and getting the page number from, the £1 Wordsworth paperback they picked up at Amazon. Sometimes (often) they get the ISBN from Amazon's site but actually read the book in the library. With weird old scholarly never-reprinted books like the ones I mostly refer to, they have no option but to get it right, taking the edition, the page numbering, the ISBN, and the text from one and the same book. And if they're in grad school and careful about stuff like that, they also get it right even though several editions exist. It's the Black Lagoon, and it's full of rotating dismembered heads of cartoon monsters. This isn't specific to wiki, it happens in dissertations too, only not as often. A website with a retrieval date is, in this sense, a better reference. P.S. I would also say that with scholarly books it's not a big deal. You can usually find the passage via the index. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:13, 23 April 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Can I finally comment? I've been blocked most of the day. The block message was that there had been AOL vandalism, so someone blocked the whole flipping range! Then I'd unblock whichever number I was at, find that I could no way force the browser to *really* refresh, etc. What a pain. I was going to say that MLA format shoved down high school throats should only be a problem if we insist that we must have something more obsolete. There's no reason for insisting on something more arcane and less manageable than MLA format. After all, MLA format exists because we all <i>used to use arcane systems</i> and found that they didn't work.

<p>I think the "four months" thing was just bad arithmetic/a stupid mistake on my part. I was in a hurry and didn't look closely enough at the dates. As for the other edit...I don't know what the hell I was thinking when I did that. Thanks for fixing it. I tend to be rather obsessive-compulsive about wording everything just right and sometimes become entirely too fixated on being able or not being able to include certain bits of information...yeah.

<dd>Hardly "mine", is it? (Though I did upload it, and the book I scanned it from isn't particularly easy to get hold of again, and I would hate to see it deleted, Jossi.) A white background seems like a good idea, to make it show more clearly, without having to display it so very large. People will probably prefer to use such a version in articles, at least most articles — not, say, if there's ever an article about the original draughtsman! Deleting the original seems like a really bad idea to me, sorry. It <i>is</i> the original (apart from more philosophical questions of how far the book has changed color with age and what difference my scanning did — though it was designed to retain the appearance of the drawing in the book), it has an artistic quality that the doctored one doesn't, and it's in genuine 1813 style, just the way the coloring is. If I were using the new one in an article, I would on the contrary make sure to point out in the caption that it was a "treated" version "after" the original such-and-such. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:41, 26 April 2006 (UTC).

<p>I've gotten the onliest two books our library has on Fielding and his dramatic career (and I <i>still</i> can't find his plays in print). One is by Battestin, from about 1988, and the other is some dude's dissertation (and it's tedious). At any rate, Battestin cites Hume from 1985 on the theaters, and he gives details of the founding of Little Theatre, Haymarket, so there may be enough he borrowed for me to construct an article. (Forget finding Hume here.) I also re-read <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Scott_c34c.html" title="Sarah Scott">Sarah Scott</a>. You know, the OR in there is actually pretty calm and inarguable. Shoot, it makes me wonder if it's worth re-investigating the woman to establish the Mysterious Revulsion of Sexuality that takes place 1750-1780. I wonder if her connections to the high class (as in Class) world is a hint of competitive prudery, as I mentioned to you. Also, I'm wondering if I can ship out my papers to Bangalore for grading.

<p>Translating the Andrée expedition article, I am unsure about a couple of things - well, more than just a couple, and my "first draft translation" is not through more than a third of the article. Normally I would just cut out everything I see as even remotely unclear from the translation. In this case however, there is the possibility to ask you about it so I kept the unsecure stuff in the raw translation waiting for a comment or a change.

<p>Why on earth do they always break out when you least want to play? Your new bete noir is at Jimbo's talk page, explaining herself. AN/I has suddenly erupted for me, and I'm seeing statements that have to have come from a bottle or sleep deprivation, they're so bald in their inappropriateness, and that on <i>two</i> fronts, and at this point I decide to be a good citizen of the State of Georgia and take a hand in making sure that two politicians don't mess with each other via Wikipedia. Didn't I have some papers to grade? Didn't I have two finals to write? Grrrr. (I notice that the politician I'm 'helping' with is an alum of my old university. I didn't know that before. Heck, we may have even overlapped.) Wanna grade my essays? I'll pay $0.25 per paper. I'm sure the exchange rate works out to make that a lot of money, what with the wise economic policies of the US resulting in an ever more powerful dollar. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bish, just wanted to offer some, ah, moral support, in your disputes with a few new users lately.

<dd>No, I most certainly am not. I feel absurd doing this, especially after already making myself ridiculous by posting <i>two</i> views on that RfC.

I try and give a half hour or so a week to a random article search -- placing categories and stub markers on otherwise unsorted articles. A small way of improving our index and search system.

<p>Hi Bishonen.</p>
<p>In response to your request to participate in the RfA concerning Sam Spade, unfortunately I think I must decline.</p>
<p>I had only been a Wiki user for a few days when I stumbled upon what I regarded as some irresponsible edits on the Socialism page. From there I discovered the ongoing dispute with Sam. I encountered his objectionable responses to people on the talk page and then looked up some of his other contentious edits, and decided that he did have, at the very least, an attitude problem, if he wasn't an outright troll. However I didn't add my voice to any of requests for endorsement because I am a new user and because I personally hadn't been involved in any dispute with Sam.</p>
<p>It was only when another poster asked for endorsement for an immediate referral to arbcom on the basis that Sam refused to discuss his conduct that I decided to add my endorsement, since it was clear up until that point that Sam was showing no willingness to co-operate at all.</p>
<p>At that point however Sam DID start to discuss his conduct - with me! - which not only kind of negated the reason for my endorsement, but also unwillingly drew me deeper into the dispute. I then tried to negotiate some sort of compromise between the parties but Sam's critics weren't interested and it seemed at that point that Sam again lost interest in the discussion himself.</p>
<p>So although I have certainly witnessed some of Sam's disruptive and disingenuous behaviour, at the same time I think it would be hypocritical of me to endorse arbcom when in fact I thought he did show at least some willingness to discuss his conduct. Don't get me wrong - I think a dispute as long running as this is probably best handled by arbcom anyway.</p>
<p>But basically, since I'm a new user and have not personally been involved in any dispute with Sam, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to take my involvement in the matter any further. I hope you can appreciate my feelings in that regard. I wish you luck with the RfA - <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoclass_aee7.html" title="User:Gatoclass">Gatoclass</a> 16:31, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, of course I appreciate them, thanks very much for taking so much trouble to explain! I wasn't making a request, really, just trying to find out if people were still interested. And I hope you'll feel absolutely free to weigh in in favor of Sam, if you think his critics are commenting unfairly, after your experience of him being more willing to discuss than some people give him credit for. That can be done either now or when/if the ArbCom has accepted the case and set up an evidence page.

<p>Hi! I don't really mind about your reverting my changes to the WIFA and FAC instructions, and it was nice for you to say "sorry" on the talk page, but I find a personal note on someone's user page to be a better method of defusing anger. Everyone has their own view, I suppose. One thing I did want to mention is that the two specific criteria I used as examples, and which you noted bothered you somewhat as seemingly random criteria to emphasize, are probably the most frequent deficiencies in FACs. Dozens and dozens proposed w/o inline citations and with inadequate leads. I had a previous disagreement w/Raul about inserting an instruction to check refs before submitting a FAC, but he disagreed that it should be emphasized. I still think it would save us all a lot of time, but if I'm in the minority on this, that's ok too. Thanks again for your feedback, and sorry if I screwed up the instructions. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 13:03, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you didn't screw up at all, I appreciate your testing the waters. Those instructions shouldn't be static, or sacred, by any means. I think you did quite right to change them boldly — no need for any initial posting on Talk for that — but it's also part of the "Be bold" principle that you may get boldly reverted (<i>once</i>). And once you've been reverted, why not put your side of it on Talk? Anyway, you have absolutely nothing to apologize for, as I see you do! You do seem to be in a minority right now, but perhaps you can change people's minds, with a bit more explanation. Personally, though, I have to say I'm in love with the principle of keeping the instructions really, really concise, and technical rather than advisory or hortative (instead giving links to the FAC advice); and of <i>not</i> emphasizing any particular criteria. The trouble is everyone's got their favorite criteria, so that could really snowball. Instructions always tend to grow rather than shrink, especially if everybody's too polite to revert additions — look at Peer review for an example.

<dd>If inline citations become a requirement, I'll never nominate an FA again. I will put parenthetical references in, provide editions, list page numbers, etc., but I will <b>never</b> put in inline citations (little footnoteries). (Bish, I got a wild hair and decided that I really, really wanted to re-read <i>The Art of Political Lying</i> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Arbuthnot_1f24.html" title="John Arbuthnot">John Arbuthnot</a>. I know that someone excerpted it for a textbook that I had when young, but I know not who, so I decided I wanted to find an edition of Arbuthnot. (Oh, it is to laugh!) So there hasn't been an edition of his <i>Works</i> since 1892, that's not a deterrent to people like me, is it? I went to alibris, and I can get a copy for $175. That's not that horrible, probably, esp. since the d*mned thing is a 1st ed. Why don't people train textual critics anymore? We <i>need</i> them! Why aren't I at a good rare book room?

<dd>Geogre, calm down, restrain the wild hair, "inline citations" is the superset of parenthetical references AND footnoteries. You're fine with the Harvard system or similar. I don't do a strict Harvard system, and you prolly don't, either, as it's not appropriate in our field, or customary, to put in all those publication years. "Smith, p. 79" is a perfectly fine parenthetical reference for us. Well, it's a bit old-fashioned — by today's lights, it ought to be "Smith 79" — but I avoid that, since it seems to make people think the book was <i>published</i> in A.D. 79.&#160;:-) Anyway, at ease, as you were, "inline citations" does not equal "footnotes"! <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:26, 1 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I noticed that an RfAr had been opened regarding Sam Spade. In my opinion, it's long overdue. I long ago stopped trying to keep the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypnosis.html" title="Hypnosis">Hypnosis</a> article free of Sam's bizarre claims about hypnosis and Egyptian healing trances... but I've always suspected that a CheckUser request to check Sam's IP against that of User:Hyp and <a href="../../../c/g/a/User%7ECGameProgrammer_02cd.html" title="User:CGameProgrammer">User:CGameProgrammer</a> <i>might</i> just get some interesting results. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:46, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you. Could you request a CheckUser check based on the specific reasons you have for thinking so, or alternatively tell me what the reasons are so I can request it? The CheckUser people will only perform checks if you have fairly specific suspicions (though naturally you don't need to have something <i>conclusive</i>). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:12, 5 May 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>I have fairly specific suspicions that one or both of them was actually a Sam sockpuppet. Each of them showed up abruptly and with their very first edit made a declaration on the talk page about how very bad the article was in the version not preferred by Sam. According to Hyp, we should wait for a "more expert writer" to take an interest; CGameProgrammer also thinks "a real hypnotherapist [should] eventually rewrite it" because "If someone wants to learn about hypnosis from this encyclopedia, they are obviously not primarily interested in the arguments against it; they are interested in it itself." These are both arguments that Sam had been making previously. In Hyp's case, it was his only contribution ever; CGameProgrammer, five months after that sole edit to <a href="../../../h/y/p/Talk%7EHypnosis_9f28.html" title="Talk:Hypnosis">Talk:Hypnosis</a>, started sporadically making posts elsewhere (never again to <a href="../../../h/y/p/Talk%7EHypnosis_9f28.html" title="Talk:Hypnosis">Talk:Hypnosis</a>), so my suspicions that he was a Sam sockpuppet were slightly decreased (not fully allayed, however.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:48, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please check your e-mail, AF. Geogre, you realize all the Outside Views have been removed now that the request is accepted? Only people who signed as "involved" are left.

<dd>One can move comments removed to the talk page of the case, right?

<dd>You too? (Yeah, my view and the other "outside" views are on the talk page now.

I don't talk to SS because I know what will happen, and so his typographical halitosis, as it were, clears out a space around his interests. We <i>all</i> carve out our areas, so that's no crime, but the way he does it by resorting to personal references isn't cricket.)

<dd>(edit conflic) There was no typo, you did write "<i>i</i> don't know what is". I wasn't quoting you, but using my own words: you call yourself "I", I call you "you". My point wasn't that you'd said something bad to <i>me</i> — you hadn't — but that the statements you were complaining about were in no way personal attacks. (Especially not ROFL.) If you think they were, I hope you grow a thicker skin, or life on the wiki is going to be very painful for you. Your foolish remarks about El C , on the other hand, <i>were</i> personal attacks. If you think they weren't, I hope you acquire a keener sense of what is due to others, or you'll keep running into trouble. You are still banned from WP:AN and WP:ANI. If you want to try to get the community to rescind the ban, you may post in the same thread one more time, to apologize fully to El C and to undertake not to waste the time and patience of the admins' noticeboard the way you've been doing. Try to show that you <i>understand what the problem is</i>, and people may be lenient. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 06:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC).

<p>man you're kinda funny. well, for the record, i did know how to use the diff. link, i just didn't know there's a difference between the two. i guess then your comments on my talkpage was apparently made in good faith (although the wording was a lil angry) but anyway, about my talkpage, i'm gonna remove the comment in a sec. so yeah, i mean i'm not trying to be a "dick", but there is a bit of a double standard existing on wiki. Like, when I unknowingly removed Guanaco's name from the mediation committee because he had been desysopped (in good faith for i didn't know non-admin can be mediators), he was like seems like your edit is based on personal vendetta (Guanaco previously blocked me). It's sorta frustrating when ppl always look at your block log and stuff to determine whether your a good/bad person. 'cause i mean sometimes even if you're tryin to contribute, others interpret it as bad faith. well anyway just to letcha know. keep up the good work.--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 07:10, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I think you probably do mean well more often than it appears, but I do think you need to try harder to distinguish between things that are really different, and only look the same on the surface. For instance, you can accuse somebody of a personal vendetta for good reasons or bad reasons, and your reasons for speaking like that of El C were far-fetched, also insulting, also against common sense. Using the same term as somebody else doesn't make it all right, when the background is totally different. Anyway, you keep speaking of my post <i>on your page</i>, but I hope you noticed that it was a post <i>from</i> WP:ANI? I posted it there first, so the community can object to my unilateral ban if they want. (But nobody has so far.)

<dd>You can believe that, but it wasn't gray. Plays were illegal. Players could be arrested. Additionally, there was official censorship of the presses, so play-like works wouldn't be printed, either.

<p>Hi Bishonen. Ok, I admit the Sw. Wikipedia Notice Board didn't work out so well when you asked for a favour recently, --- I myself have been busy recently with administrative stuff such as deleting loads of NowCommons images, maintenance of the Commons server and similar ungrateful stuff. However, I'm going to start writing some proper articles now, and I started with <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malm%C3%B6.html" title="Malmö">Malmö</a>, Skåne, and the such. May continue with Stockholm and Gothenburg.</p>
<p>Would you mind having a look at <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malm%C3%B6.html" title="Malmö">Malmö</a> and see if there is something seriously lacking in the structure or in the information? If there is anything disturbing in the language, you are welcome to fix that too...</p>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../m/a/l/Malm%C3%B6.html" title="Malmö">Malmö</a> looks good, including the English, though perhaps a light grammar copyedit might also be in order. I'll try to find the time for it. (I mean, you have to admit that those would be the famous <i>Swedish</i> couple of minutes, as in "Just a minute [leaves the phone for half an hour]" At least they would be for me. I'm slow.) I'm sure you know much more than I do about what's supposed to be in a city article, Fred, it's not my strong suit by any means. No, I don't see anything lacking. Though I can't remember ever seeing a line of references immediately below a section, in the middle of an article; what's that about? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:20, 7 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Raphael1, I explain that in detail in my statement "View of the validity of this RfC by Bishonen" on the RfC itself, please take a look at that. Anyway, why did you remove the part of the RfC template — the instructions at the top of the page — that tell you about the need for the two people certifying to have attempted <b>dispute resolution</b> first? Please read those instructions now, if you haven't already; I've restored them to the top of the RfC page,, where they should have been all along.</dd>
<dd>How is he supposed to certify? He isn't. A blocked user isn't supposed to do anything on the wiki. If you need one more, and that particular person will be blocked for more than 48 hours, then you'll have to find somebody else. Why would he be the only other person who could certify it? It doesn't have to be somebody involved, it only has to be somebody who has tried to resolve the dispute. As I explain in my statement, you'd much better try to find someone to try to resolve the dispute who <i>isn't</i> personally involved, anyway. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:25, 7 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I'm concerned about a courtroom conversion. One reason that there isn't much prosecutorial evidence being presented is that the bile is on one side only. No one wants to "get" or "get dirt" on the defendant, so, when he stops editing and calling names and trying to smear a person, that person wants to forget the whole thing and hope for the best. This is the behavior that has led to attrition. This is the behavior that has led to his "owning" a considerable number of articles. Indeed, in the evidence page, the defendant is saying that everything has been taken care of. Why, look! no insults since the RfC! In other words, "I stopped for the time being, so I'm innocent, and there is no case to bring." This is repentance before the bar. If it's repentence of heart is another matter, and for that we have to consider the past, consider the history. So long as everyone else is less bilious, less angry, and less interested in making issues personal, the defendant will get another chance and another and another, and a never-ending stream of new users will hit upon a controversial page and get ground into the dust by him, as all the experienced users simply stay away, ceding part of the project to his corner. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:47, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for writing. I don't actually think there's any great hurry, the cases stay open kind of ad hoc. But, yes, I'm a little surprised too. I hope a few people are working on it. If not, it's their choice (shrug). If you check out the post just above, you'll see that Geogre is concerned too, and has a theory to account for it (wouldn't you know it&#160;;-)).

<p>Hey, you probably don't know who I am, but I'm - or I was trying to be - a friend of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">User:Thewolfstar</a>'s. Don't worry, she didn't send me to talk to you or anything. She's blocked and that's that as far as I'm concerned. In fact, I was astonished by the lenience shown her, what with being unblocked half a dozen times or so by different administrators.</p>
<p>What I wanted to ask you was, is there any way this could have been prevented? This is the second or third time I've seen a newbie editor (well, *ahem*, newer than me ^_^;) flame out and get blocked over personal attacks and rude behavior. I spent quite some time, and probably several thousand words, trying to advise Maggie against doing the sorts of things she did, which as far as I can tell she went right on doing. &#160;:(</p>
<p>The next time I see this start to happen with a new user, is there something you can recommend I do, other than just pointing them at <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and praying they read them? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 03:47, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bishonen knows the answer to this but Bishzilla, her nefarious alter-ego, won't let her tell the rest of us. Because we sure don't know. Personally, I don't think the PAs are really the root of it. Rather, it's the sure belief that one <i>knows</i> the truth, so one's edits are by definition good, right, just, and NPOV. Pointing at WP:CIVIL or WP:NPA is trying to put a band-aid over one symptom of this syndrome, and it rarely works. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:44, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I saw that Esperanza was mentioned/involved somewhat. Unfortunately they seem to be having their own problems over the past few days. Are there any other groups around like that?</dd>
<dd>I know that when I needed help editing I put the 'Help' template on my page and someone showed up like magic. It would be nice if there was an equivalent group for people who need help with 'WP:There *really* is no cabal' and 'WP:Please don't bite the old editors either'.</dd>
<dd>Sigh. As with Kasreyn, I don't have any complaints and I'm not going to call Bish a rouge (sic) admin, it just seems like that could have gone better. Is there a policy or guideline or even essay anywhere that says newbies who are having trouble shouldn't listen to people who have been blocked a lot for causing trouble?
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, that bugged me <i>a lot</i>. As soon as she started openly warring with admins, a horde of freakin' <i>vultures</i> descended on her talk page to tell her <i>no, you're in the right, they're all wrong, anyone who tells you you're wrong is <b>in on the cabal</b>, but us? We're your <b>friends</b>.</i> Bitter jerks. And naturally, when I tried to suggest that <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tinc.html" title="Tinc">TINC</a>, she immediately brushed me off.

<dd>Nothing interesting, sorry. "Dutch" was just an unsuccessful attempt to entertain a Dutch editor, and in its turn inspired the illegal smile.

<dd>The Dutch manage to have a <i>legal</i> illegal smile. [BTW, folks, as for preventing the flame out, one of Geogre's Laws is "Wikipedia is not a venue for negotiating ultimate truth, revelation, or the secret history of the world." Wikipedia is a summary of what other people say, with the most "other people" beating the least "other people." It's not a place to set the record straight, so to speak, and anyone who comes to the project with an idea that they're going to fix the world's perceptions of, oh, one of the major political parties, or, oh, some ethnic group, or, oh, some world language, is going to end in frustration or a block.

<p>Hey, Miles. Sorry, I only have a Bishzilla answer to give about your valiant efforts to present TWS with a clue. It's the first impulse of the best users... but, sadly, I'm coming to the conclusion that Aggressive Clueless Newbie Syndrome is a serious condition with poor prognosis.&#160;:-( I've never seen an ACNS case in remission. And there's a logic to it: they discover the site and that Anyone Can Edit. They read the articles on their favorite subject --politics, or religion, or their pet branch of pseudoscience--<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptozoology.html" title="Cryptozoology">Cryptozoology</a>. They see that the articles are full of "lies", and set out to "fix" them. They're happy and feel useful, and expect praise; imagine the shock when their edits won't stick because an obvious liberal mafia or sceptics conspiracy or atheist cabal VANDALIZES their work! And if the user was already in a bit of a troubled state when they arrived, well... I won't go on. But nothing good follows, and I agree with Unca Bunch that Knowing the Truth has a lot to do with it. The nightmare outcome is when these "contributors" stick around for so long that they become familiar with policy and are able to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikilawyer_70eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikilawyer">wikilawyer</a> it to some effect, as opposed to brandishing irrelevant guidelines at random the way TWS does. Because then you have... shudder ... the rare but monstrous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Sam_Spade" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Sam_Spade" rel="nofollow">Aggressive Clueless But Wiki-Savvy Old-Timer</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:24, 10 May 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Dear Bishonen (the sublime),</dd>
<dd>Yes, I could see the progression too. It was like a train wreck in slow motion. That's why I hadn't been involved for a while. TWS was editing in good faith *as she knew it*, but... Yeah.</dd>

<p>Thanks for dropping a line on my page concerning Thewolfstar's AN/I thread. I spent the past two days driving from North Carolina to Texas, which was the longest break I've had from Wikipedia for a while... sad. At any rate, it seems that the issue has already been settled. I agree with the admins and support the decision (although I hope to review in a few months if possible), but at the same time, it comes with disappointment. She had potential to make some great contributions, but... got distracted. At any rate, I appreciate your seeking community consensus before indef blocking, and taking the time to notify concerned parties. There's probably an admin barnstar somewhere that I'd give you for doing all that, but I'm too lazy to track it down. Just consider yourself having received it, along with my thanks.

<p>Bishonen, sorry to bother you again - I don't really know whether you are the appropriate person to point out vandalism to - but there's a guy who has been repeatedly dropping a block of rightwing drivel onto the Socialism and Criticisms of Socialism page over the last few days.</p>
<p>I just checked his edit history and it appears he's been deleting entire Wiki pages and vandalizing others. He's changed his IP at least once but this is his latest version: 130.216.191.184 Here's a link to his edit history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.216.191.184" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.216.191.184" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=130.216.191.184</a> .

<dd>I may not always be here, indeed, and I sleep sometimes, so <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> is the best place to report straight vandalism, it's supposedly watched round the clock. Unfortunately that won't do much good with 130.216.191.184: there's not a lot anyone can do about about an IP-hopping POV-pusher who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:130.216.191.184" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:130.216.191.184" rel="nofollow">operates</a> out of the University of Auckland...! An IP like that can only be blocked very briefly. That's why you see a bunch of experienced users, such as CBerlet, simply reverting the pest. As long as controversial articles are well watched, that's what we can do to keep bastards like this at bay. The next step would be reporting him to the university. For not-so-obvious cases of vandalism--"bad users"--report on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. Busy page, though, and everybody hates dealing with these IPs, so you may not always get much joy there.

<p>Dammit I thought I had the guy by the short and curlies. Obviously if he's posting from Auckland Uni there is no way of knowing whether he is responsible for the vandal edits.</p>
<p>However, he does also post under another nic and IP, they are Michael40 and 60.234.157.64. I'm guessing the last is his home IP.</p>
<p>If he isn't perpetrating outright vandalism I'm not sure what to do about him. What he <b>is</b> doing is making continual, blatantly POV rightwing edits on a number of articles, including Socialism, Criticisms of Socialism, Hugo Chavez, Criticism of Hugo Chavez[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez&amp;diff=52826445&amp;oldid=52289603" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez&amp;diff=52826445&amp;oldid=52289603" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] etc. I note also that while he was lecturing us on allegedly trying to "filter...valid, relevant, verifiable" information, he hypocritically went to the Central Intelligence Agency page and whitewashed [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_Intelligence_Agency&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52073827" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_Intelligence_Agency&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52073827" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] a number of well established facts from the "Historical Operations" section.</p>
<p>The problem I have is that I don't know how to deal with a user like this. He isn't an outright vandal, so I can't get his IP blocked at the Wiki page you mentioned above. But he's clearly inserting outright POV/scuttlebutt into articles. And while he's responded on the Talk pages a couple of times, it hasn't stopped him in the least from repeatedly inserting his POV rants into articles regardless of consensus. Basically he just ignores consensus.</p>
<p>Now my understanding of Wiki is that we are supposed to make every effort to integrate a new user into the system, but this guy is showing little if any interest in co-operating. I'm also pretty sceptical, quite frankly, that someone with as clear an agenda as this can ever be integrated into a consensus framework.</p>
<p>So what do I do? Do I just continue to revert him, hoping he eventually goes away? (this seems problematic to me for a number of reasons). Should I get a formal or informal RfC started on the guy? I mean, what's the usual way of dealing with this sort of problem?</p>

<dd>Response to your message - Obviously I'm not as good at searching the block log as I thought. When I first responded I couldn't find anything with that user's name on it. I assumed that meant that the IP had been blocked automagically and that you had to be an admin to see it (for IP privacy reasons).</dd>
<dd>It was another user who said the block was clearly a mistake. I just saw the 'helpme' message and was willing to assume good faith. Once I realized Danny was involved I decided that it probably wasn't something I wanted to be involved with&#160;:) (I've read the mailing list).</dd>

<dd>Well, it's a redlink now, so maybe you won't check it. Blocked for WP:NLT and oblique maybe or maybe not physical threats. &#160;:/ Wait a second, 100 *different* autoblocks?

<dd>I was wondering if I needed to notify anyone that another sock appears to have made it through, but one of them has already vandalized Woggly's page and the other has posted a message on Danny's page complaining and threatening him over the deletion of the puppet-master's vanity article.

I happened to be watching his talk page because a comment of mine was summarily removed from there as well, recently.

<dd>That still wouldn't be a very strong argument. &lt;sigh&gt; Look, I'm a Christian and I believe that evolution is an accurate theory, so I'm not a fundamentalist, but I play with fundamentalists every day, and finding a transitional form wouldn't do anything to their objections. (One argument they could mount is that evolution, to be a valid theory, has to be testable by recreation under controlled circumstances to eliminate other causes of change, and that hasn't been done.) My problem with the literalists is that they're reactionary and don't even know it. For centuries and centuries, Christians regarded Genesis as 100% true and 0% literal. The article on <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah%27s_Ark_8421.html" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a> discusses this a little bit. Long, long before Darwin, Christian thinkers were pointing out that the stories are true, that they're not "just symbolic," that they're not "just stories," but they're also not history. It took the triumph of empiricism and <i>then</i> Darwin to stir a reactionary position that was, in fact, unnatural for Christians. However, they can never cease to be reactionary if people taunt them. Their position is not a rational one, but an emotional one (and not a religious one, either). So, given that it's emotional -- a reaction against certain attempts to deny faith that leaves them in the false dichotomy of "every word literally true" or "it's all a joke" -- taunting does nothing but keep them from the position of freedom and comfort such as used to be found in Christian communities, when it was possible to discuss truth as four fold living words and not just history and annals. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:55, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, Lar, I was just reading it in the context of the fellow next break up who was being baited for being a creationist, he says. I have no truck with the creationists. I think they're silly. At the same time, there is a <i>lot</i> of baiting of fundamentalists that just doesn't seem productive. (I was just going on and on about it on my talk page -- the trollish change of the userbox "Christian." Again, I have no patience for the userbox, would never use it, don't think it's important, etc., but the changing of it was an overt attempt to poke someone in the eye.) My apologies for thinking you were tweaking the feeb. BTW, now that you mention it, it <i>does</i> look a bit like a Barney the Dinosaur tadpole -- complete with inevitable non-threatening grin. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:10, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi there, Kawai neko! Not sure what "the number of users" refers to? But let me break down my offences for you:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>If you read thewolfstar's talkpage archive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Thewolfstar/archive_1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Thewolfstar/archive_1" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you will get a goood picture of my crimes. I know it's long and, uh, kind of repetitious, but just do a search for "Bishonen". As you can see, the posts <i>from</i> me are few; I soon decided that arguing with TWS was too surrealist for me, I'm impatient that way. But the discussions <i>of</i> me are pretty comprehensive!&#160;;-)</li>
<li>It was me who blocked TWS indefinitely as having exhausted the community's patience, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thewolfstar&amp;diff=52330209&amp;oldid=52294213" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thewolfstar&amp;diff=52330209&amp;oldid=52294213" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Do click on the link I give there to the block log, it's kind of hair-raising. The ANI thread, which is linked to in the message, is also very telling. Unfortunately it's been archived from the ANI page, so you'll have have to use the diff to the first post that's supplied in block message.</li>
<li>And thirdly: yesterday I blocked <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamb_of_god_42d7.html" title="User:Lamb of god">User:Lamb of god</a> as an obvious sock (or possibly meatpuppet). It's not editing from the same IP, but the CheckUser arbitrator that I consulted laughed at the idea that it would <i>not</i> be a sock. And indeed, I'm convinced the community will uphold the block. That reminds me I need to go post it on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>.</li>

<p>Bish, I hate to ask you every time I think something needs attention, and I have asked Geogre to take a look, but hopefully there is someone among the people with either page on their watchlist who knows something about German literature. The author of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Heller_5fde.html" title="Erich Heller">Erich Heller</a> has asked for comments on the talkpage.

<p>...Now here's the answer:</p>
<p>Ways are what people will do in order to ensure advantages for themselves, while won'ts are the opposite, although commonly people do not conduct this in a manner that will lead to disadvantageous situations; it frequently occurs without realization.</p>

<dd>EE, frankly, if you're unhappy about my page, how about just taking it off your watchlist, hmm? Just a suggestion. Didn't I see you just above mentioning that you were leaving now? Perhaps you have some friends of your own to banter with? Your replying to my question was nice, but replying <i>here</i> as well as on WP:ANI where I actually asked seems a bit excessive in the first place. And I really like for people to be able to spread themselves here without having the "necessity" of their "silliness" questioned.

<p>I hope you can reinstate me from my ban. As you might've noticed, I already posted an apology on Elc's talkpage. thanks--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 06:42, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bh, actually I asked you to post once more in the same thread on ANI, to put your apology there and ask if other people were ready to reinstate you. But I do understand that we had an honest misunderstanding about that, and, yes, I noticed your apology to El C. It's fine, you're welcome back, I'm sure you don't have any time-wasting posting in mind. Feel free to use the noticeboard. If I don't remove your posts, I bet nobody else will either--they probably don't even remember there was a problem. Or if you like you could add a note that this is OK by Bishonen now, if you prefer. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:16, 14 May 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Bishonen, did you miss my post to you above? Under the "More Vandalism" heading. If you don't have a suggestion that's fine. I guess we'll eventually work out something collectively if he continues to make a nuisance of himself anyhow.

<dd>Gatoclass, indeed I did not miss it. I apologize. I've been thinking about it and trying to pull myself together to write a responsive answer. (In the meantime, I know you see me bantering with the guys, but that doesn't mean I'm taking time off, as such--that's something I do with my toes while simultaneously grading papers!) See, the problem is so difficult, and so common. It's exactly the place where the "dispute resolution process" crumbles. The next step should be either mediation or an RfC; the trouble is, only good users are interested in taking part in them. You get worn out trying to RfC guys like that, because:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Writing up an RfC is a lot of trouble, while responding to it is easy, and why would he even bother to respond at all, when it's even simpler to go on just as he's been doing?</li>
<li>His political opinions and POV--I warn you I'm a bit cynical here, and <i>my</i> bias may be showing--mean that there are lots of users around the place who'd be ready to support him at the RfC, on the principle that "You're just saying he's a bad editor because of his decent godfearing patriotic opinions, OMG liberal cabal!" I hasten to add that I don't mean all, or even most, politically conservative editors behave like that! But the ones that do are a big group and a suspiciouos, confrontational, aggressive lot.&#160;:-( So an RfC is likely to be unbalanced by people with an axe to grind.</li>
<li>Finally, since the case is so common, it's hard to generate constructive interest in an RfC in an unknown editor with that editing pattern. It's not like when it's Sam Spade!</li>
</ol>
<p>So altogether I see an RfC as being a lot of trouble with most likely little result. Mediation might be better. Mind you, I think he'd be unlikely to agree--why would he, presumably the present situation is fine by him--but at least there you'd have the advantage that requesting mediation is dead easy, you wouldn't be investing a lot of time and frustration, and who knows, it <i>might</i> go somewhere. You might take a look at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Wikipedia:Mediation</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a>.</p>
<p>But my most practical advice to you is to discuss the issue with the other editors of the articles. CBerlet comes to mind as a highly experienced and dedicated editor, who's been through the wars on the politically controversial articles. (I haven't--I know my temperamental limitations--I'm very interested in the articles as such, but I can't stand trying to work against the hostility and filibustering one always encounters at them. I try, and then I leave, like a coward.&#160;:-() I hope you find some way of either working with, or dealing with, that guy. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:41, 14 May 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't really see an RfC as a valid option either. I was really just trying to get a handle on how this sort of thing is usually handled on Wiki. To tell the truth, I just hate reverting people cold, even if they are POV. And it's not something I want to make a habit of.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, I'm not going to worry about it anymore. Sooner or later, this guy is going to wake up that his edits are futile. Then he will either leave, or start participating in the process like a responsible user. And either way, the problem will be solved.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>As an established Wikipedian, I was hoping for your assistance regards a particular article. Specifically the article on NPA Personality Theory - it is a new article, but was submitted in a very much complete state. It now has properly sized imagery, is professionally written, expansive and all emcompassing regards it subject, is NPOV, of a good length - and cites references. The subject matter is, to my mind, interesting. Thus, should it be nominated as a Good article? Or, as a featured one? If you feel the former, then by all means add the "Good" article tag - along with some advice if you can. If you believe the latter should be appropriate, again any advice regards this would be great - if you could leave a response on the linked articles Talk page, that would be great.

<p>Actually, urine is used by some yogis as an aid to meditation, and medical science has shown that there is indeed a chemical in urine that (from memory) distorts the sense of time, thus allowing longer meditation sessions.

<dd>Seems pretty funny to <b>me.</b> Since the thing was invented and used solely as a joke, I can't understand how anyone would even <i>find</i> it unless they were in on the joke, much less <i>use</i> it. Therefore, I can't understand why its mere existence is an issue unless folks are simply going through every template and evaluating them as if they were articles. If they're doing <b>that,</b> I need to hear about it, because I'm convinced that about 90% of the templates on Wikipedia need to be deleted, along with the user boxes, and all the little tags that litterbugs drop on articles when they have no intention to help the article in any way but still want to show that they like to pass a judgment. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok. I was unaware that it's a joke. Perhaps it should be clearly labelled as such.

<p>I feel the need to make <b>this my final response</b> because of what you posted on my talk page. One: no more communication would be pleasant. Two: an RfC was filed against you before, yes, I see. But there is no mention of HW there, so, uh, I don't understand. Three: I <i>promise</i> this is my last post since I felt the need to respond to you. But this is it, this is it, this is absolutely 100% <i>it</i>. Now if everything really you conducted was under the assumption of good faith, then excellent effort. I cannot argue with those words.</p>
<p>I wish you no harm either.

<dd>So are you making two points: a) that Moby Dick is a sock of Davenbelle, and b) that the sock is hounding you? Or what? I looked, and I think it's obvious that MD wasn't a new user when he started editing. That edit at your RFA is even professional in more ways than you mention. That doesn't prove he's Davenbelle, of course; but I think the circumstantial evidence for that is good enough to request a CheckUser check. Have you done that? I'll do it if you like, as soon as I see someone with CheckUser access on IRC (there's nobody at the moment). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>I have requested a checkuser. Davenbelle last edited early december. Logs making checkuser posible is only kept for a month and due to that technical nature a checkuser is not possible hence the checkuser was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_CheckUser&amp;diff=52619136&amp;oldid=52580323" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_CheckUser&amp;diff=52619136&amp;oldid=52580323" rel="nofollow">'inconclusive'</a>. Hence I only have his edit behaviour as evidence and cannot 'confrim' with a checkuser...</dd>

<p>...I'm an "encourager" now? I'd be kind of flattered if this wasn't connotative. XD. After all, it's not every day that I get promoted from regular user to encourager. Maybe I'll put it in my sig. Hmm. Anyway, I just wanted to remind you that while I do believe that some administrators are megalomaniacal and corrupt (although the jury is still out on you, LOL!), I originally defended Thewolfstar because I believed that people were not assuming good faith on her part, and also because she was a fellow Esperanzian. Because of paralanguage, this comment probably reads like it's annoyed and frustrated, but in honesty I'm just very amused. I can't wait to see what happens next!

<dd>I didn't think the username that bad myself — perhaps all the "bitchonen"'s and other wolfstar variants have blunted my sensibilities, you know — but considering Essjay's reaction to it, I blocked for username. However, I thought it also worth while to point out the sock suspicion. Even though CheckUser wasn't conclusive, Essjay seemed very sure that a new user with that IP had <i>something</i> to hide. And considering all the circumstantial suggestiveness of her few edits, this is the kind of case that would have been blocked as a sock "beyond reasonable doubt" before there <i>was</i> any CheckUser. I'm sorry to see that people keep assuming Macai is the same user; I hope you'll help me defend his right to edit.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry if "encourager" sounded bad, I didn't mean it like that at all. You weren't encouraging her to go on insulting people, AFAIK, but more generally to "hang in there"; that's fine by me. I was merely trying to speak economically in using the word. However, since I'm about to vote on your RFA, I might as well mention here that I do have a problem with some of your other input in this case, notably your vague but far-reaching assumptions of corruption and conspiracies among admins, your ... well... I'm trying to find a polite way of saying this, you understand ... no, there isn't one ... ok, with what looks, to my perhaps jaundiced eye, like heroic posturing on WP:ANI, "daring" to speak out in favor of the courageous underdog critic who has been blocked by admin conspiracy, for which signal act of integrity you obviously risk being blocked yourself... sorry, but that's how your tone reads to me. I find it far more objectionable than your message above, which doesn't look rough to me. My problem is with seeing you as <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emile_Zola_78bb.html" title="Emile Zola">Emile Zola</a>, or Thewolfstar as <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Dreyfus_b173.html" title="Alfred Dreyfus">Alfred Dreyfus</a>.

<dd>Eh, there's a lot I want to say, but everybody's heard it already. Basically, the reason I keep picking at little suggestions of corruption and abuse of power is to be extremist. After all, without extremists, there is stagnation. It's entirely possible that there are no corrupt administrators and that everybody else simply has a better grip on reality and policy than me. Administrators are given power through a social contract with the community, and it is my firm belief that administrators should answer to the community when they have to, and it frustrates me sometimes to see the kind of power that you guys have being tossed around lightly sometimes. That's why I won't reapply for administrator when my current RfA fails — if the community really trusts me with power, they'll give it to me when the time is right. As for "encourager," don't worry; the word is decently neutral, and has a very cool denotation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACorbinSimpson&amp;diff=54362860&amp;oldid=54273814" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACorbinSimpson&amp;diff=54362860&amp;oldid=54273814" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> Turn that frown upside down, LOL! *hug* - <b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a> </b><i><sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Be excellent</font></a></sup></i> 22:14, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't checked the mailing list, so I didn't realize she was complaining there. Regardless, I second the comments about trying to give patient advice in the face of abuse. You tried to give her advice and it didn't work; I tried to give her advice and it didn't work either. (And maybe I was too blunt, but I think she needed the reminder that she was exhausting everyone's patience.)

<p>I want to add my thanks as well. Some may think it's a waste of time, but I agree, always give editors the benefit of the doubt. Even if a disruptive user just goes back to his or her old ways 95% of the time (an arbitrary number, of course), we still gain the 5% as members of the community. Besides... there's always reverts and edit histories to correct any mistakes.

<dd>No, no, you didn't make a mess — did you not mean for it to show up that big on <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leigh_Hunt_f1a8.html" title="Leigh Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a> either? See, it's perfect to upload it big. You're supposed to always upload the best and biggest images you can lay your hands on. Don't try to shrink them. Then you can determine exactly what size you want displayed in the article by putting in the number of pixels (for width) in the image syntax. Example: type [[Image:LeighHunt5.jpg||thumb|150px|right|An artist's rendering of James Henry Leigh Hunt]]. That'll make it show up 150 pixels wide. In fact, uh, I see you removed the pixel indication, 100px, that was already there in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leigh_Hunt_f1a8.html" title="Leigh Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:39, 23 May 2006 (UTC).

<p>Aye, but ha' you got a £20,000 inheritance (x30 for year 2000 values)? I just got <i>A Miscellany of the Wits.</i> Alas, it has <i>The History of John Bull,</i> which is happy happy, but it doesn't have the <i>Treatise on Political Lying.</i> Then again, it has quite a bit of William King (the funny one, not the Jacobite one), but not his funny stuff. This is what you get when the book has gothic typeface and was edited by someone "M.A." in 1920. The unfunny bits of funny people. Still, beggar's mustn't be choosers. (The book came to me from a Houston bookstore, and it got to them from a <b>Special Collections,</b> of all things. It's a 1st ed.

<dd>On mine, actually, but, what's more, you began and ended with something I worked on today. Having just gotten the <i>A Miscellany of the Wits,</i> I had access to Arbuthnot's "epitaph on Don Fransisco," which is about Charteris. I began the day writing Molloy and ended it adding a few lines from Arbuthnot to Charteris.&#160;:-) Charteris prompted <i>me</i> to scan the engravings from <i><a href="../../../a/_/h/A_Harlot%27s_Progress_5b08.html" title="A Harlot's Progress">A Harlot's Progress</a>,</i> and the gallery there got me writing paragraphs about the plates, and that got ALoan and me looking for some of the scandalous figures. The <i>DNB</i> of 2004 has huge holes in it. It didn't have <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dalton_94f7.html" title="James Dalton">James Dalton</a>, for example, and ALoan did that one. A lot of my recent mini-bios have been the result of my not finding the interesting figure I've sought in the DNB and deciding that I can't come back empty-handed and therefore seizing anyone 1660-1790 who looks slightly interesting or literary. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:53, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I know the Norns (aka Palestinians), but Morn? I could never watch that show enough to know who the characters were, except for the astoundingly pretty Molly O'Brien (and she's even more astoundingly pretty in <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What_Dreams_May_Come_c8f1.html" title="What Dreams May Come">What Dreams May Come</a></i>). The fact that they had a Morn is kind of what was wrong with that show.

<b>Thanks for voting in my request for administrator rights, even though it failed (13/30/4).</b> Sadly, work has forced me to respond to you all using a substituted message rather than a personalized response. Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that administrators, to me, should be chosen and approved by the community, and I will continue working to become a better editor and Wikipedian. No matter what the alignment of your vote was, I will take your comments seriously and use them to improve myself. If you wish to discuss your comments personally with me, I would be more than glad to talk about things since the RfA is now over; just leave your concern on my talk page and we will sort things out.

<dd>Oh.... Hmmm. Hmmm. Pretty much A7. There really isn't much of a claim of notability, and comic book studies.... Yeah, well. <i>Charges</i> aren't notability. A complaint isn't notability.

<dd>Ok, I've seen it. The principle mistake -- believing that doodads are important -- is replicated by arguing about the lack of importance of the doodads, IMO. I may be anti-MFA, though (for non-Usonians, that's the "master of fine arts," even though Phil's in a combined program). I've known too many earnest youngsters caught in the poisonous cycle of writing to celebrate themselves. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:53, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe I was a little too sarcastic in my response to the image tagger on my talk page. (Someone doesn't like the picture of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Joseph_Labre_9bcf.html" title="Benedict Joseph Labre">Benedict Joseph Labre</a> because it's too sissy looking, I think.)

<p>Hey Bishonen. I really appreciate the help that you gave me in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plano_Senior_High_School_4e24.html" title="Plano Senior High School">Plano Senior High School</a> peer review. Your eyes helped me to see the US-centrism with which I was writing. I am hoping to send PSHS up for FAC soon and I would appreciate if you could take a brief look at the article, particularly the lead, as it is the part that has changed most since you saw it last. I really appreciate any help you could give.
