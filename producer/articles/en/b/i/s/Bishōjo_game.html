Most bishōjo games involve some kind of romantic or seduction element, some becoming pornographic in the process.</p>
<p>This sort of game is a phenomenon in Japan and thus comprises an important segment of the gaming industry in that country, with games that have sold more than a million copies. However, in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> countries and most of the Western countries, there is a clear separation between the pornography industry and the film and gaming industry. The Japanese bishōjo game industry has little presence outside of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>. Nevertheless, due to noticeable cultural differences, only a few titles of this sort have been translated or commercialized outside of Asia. In the West, bishōjo remains one of the least-known genres in the video game industry.</p>
<p>Commonly, bishōjo games also fall into the category of <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sims</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eroge.html" title="Eroge">eroge</a>, and/or <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">visual novels</a>.</p>

<p>Since bishōjo elements can be present in practically any type of game, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gameplay.html" title="Gameplay">gameplay</a> in bishōjo games varies drastically within the genre. For example, <i><a href="../../../g/a/l/Gals_Panic_5ee7.html" title="Gals Panic">Gals Panic</a></i> is a variant of the classic game <i><a href="../../../q/i/x/Qix.html" title="Qix">Qix</a></i> where the objective is to uncover 80% or more of a picture of a girl. <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_Idol_Exchanger_8060.html" title="Money Idol Exchanger">Money Idol Exchanger</a></i> is a puzzle game comparable to the <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magical_Drop_5975.html" title="Magical Drop">Magical Drop</a></i> series (which is also categorized as a bishōjo game). In some cases, images of girls are used as prizes for skilled play, as is the case in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striptease.html" title="Striptease">strip</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahjong.html" title="Mahjong">Mahjong</a>.</p>
<p>In other games, the bishōjo aspect can be integrated more tightly into the game: in most <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sims</a>, the objective is to select the correct conversation lines while speaking with a female character to increase their "love meter". This type of game resembles <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing</a> or <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_game.html" title="Adventure game">adventure</a> games. Many are very linear and are essentially interactive romance novels for men (sometimes called <i>visual novels</i>).</p>
<p>Nowadays, most bishōjo games remain <a href="../../../2/d/_/2D_computer_graphics_3c75.html" title="2D computer graphics">2D</a>, in contrast to the rest of the gaming industry in which the majority are <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_computer_graphics_c308.html" title="3D computer graphics">3D</a>. The main reason is that bishōjo games are centered mainly on characters instead of landscapes, and for this intention, 2D <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitmap.html" title="Bitmap">bitmaps</a> continue to look better than 3D models (which tend to be blocky when seen up close). The main advantage of 3D models in this context is more clear and realistic animation, although this is usually discarded by the unfinished and sometimes false aspect of the 3D characters, in addition to the additional cost of production for this type of work. <i><a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokimeki_Memorial_322b.html" title="Tokimeki Memorial">Tokimeki Memorial 3</a></i> (2001) was the first bishōjo game to have all its characters modeled in 3D, although the sales were smaller than hoped, perhaps discouraging other developers from the possibility of changing bishōjo games from 2D to 3D. Many bishōjo games nowadays are essentially a slideshow of 2D pictures plus voice and text.</p>

</div>
<p>An erroneous concept common in the West is the relationship between bishōjo games and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>. Frequently it is assumed that all members of the genre include sexual scenes and images. This is not necessarily true; although a considerable amount of entirely pornographic titles exist, including titles based on hardcore pornography, the great majority of popular titles, including all those available for <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">home video consoles</a>, do not contain pornographic material.</p>
<p>The pornographic titles can be divided into two types: those based completely on thematic pornography, and those that use pornographic images as a way to compensate the player. Whereas the games with hard sexual content include constant sex scenes, in the same way as pornographic films in the West, most of the commercial titles avoid showing sexual scenes until the very end of the plot. For example, the pornographic version of the popular game <i><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanon.html" title="Kanon">Kanon</a></i> has sexual content in 10% of its scenes. Another example is <a href="../../../t/o/h/ToHeart2_%28game%29_4168.html" title="ToHeart2 (game)"><i>To Heart 2: X Rated</i></a>, which contains 458 individual scenes, of which approximately 170 are explicit. The total result — near 37% — is somewhat high for commercial games of this type, but is still only a subset of the game in its totality despite its promotion as an adult title. Therefore, even when a game contains pornographic content, it is not the main attraction. One usually pays greater attention to the development of an engaging storyline, like the aesthetic appearance of pictures of attractive girls, even when fully clothed.</p>
<p>The pornographic content of bishōjo games is regulated by the EOCS (Ethics Organization of Computer Software), the organization in charge of classifying the content of video games in the Japanese industry. Pornography is prohibited in all console titles, and computer games are assigned a special classification alerting the public of its content. Also, as in all legal Japanese pornography, the explicit images are normally censored, showing mosaics or bars on the genital areas in order to satisfy Japanese decency laws.</p>
<p>Pornographic bishōjo games are often catalogued as "<a href="../../../h/e/n/Hentai.html" title="Hentai">hentai</a> games" in the West. However, this term is usually not used in the Japanese language. In Japan, they are usually called ero-games, or frequently <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eroge.html" title="Eroge">eroge</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The representation of women in bishōjo games varies, but two generalizations can be made. First, most of the girls are almost "perfect", according to the definition of perfection given by the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_designer.html" title="Game designer">designers</a> of video games. Therefore, it is rare to find, for example, an obese or unattractive character in this type of game. Secondly, the majority of the characters are highly <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femininity.html" title="Femininity">feminine</a> (according to prevalent tendencies in Japan): in the cases where a girl shows a "boyish" appearance, she can be found to be pretty or feminine under a pseudomasculine façade.</p>
<p>Two particularly common settings exist: Japanese <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">secondary schools</a> and medieval-atmosphered, pseudo-European fantasy lands. This reflects their pervasiveness within Japanese <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_culture.html" title="Pop culture">pop culture</a> (especially <a href="../../../d/%C5%8D/j/D%C5%8Djinshi.html" title="Dōjinshi">dōjinshi</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>-derived forms), although another possible reason is probably the opportunity to provide interesting outfits to the girls. In secondary education settings, characters wear the idolized <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_school_uniform.html" title="Japanese school uniform">Japanese school uniforms</a> (which tend to be presented in unrealistically bright colors), whereas fantasy setting outfits range from witch robes to princess dresses, not to mention fantastic creatures like <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy.html" title="Fairy">fairies</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catgirl.html" title="Catgirl">catgirls</a>. When the game takes place in some other setting, it tends to explore other fashion possibilities, for example, the game <i><a href="../../../p/i/a/Pia_Carrot_aa65.html" title="Pia Carrot">Pia Carrot</a></i> is located in a restaurant, probably to dress up the girls in elaborate waitress uniforms.</p>
<p>The girls in bishōjo games are perceived by most Westerners as younger than they would prefer. The characters frequently act like children, their voices are commonly high, and it is possible for them to be frustrated easily and given to throwing infantile temper tantrums (it is possible to say that this is a phenomenon common in Japan, even for young adults around 20 years of age). The fictional girl characters who are endearingly childlike are described by the Japanese slang term <i><a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe_%28slang%29.html" title="Moe (slang)">moe</a></i> (萌え), a characteristic that is often looked-for in bishōjo characters. The reasons for this characteristic are not always merely sexual: sometimes it is used to present a pretty and affectionate character who is dependent on and supported by the player. In fact, "little sisters" are a recurring fixture of bishōjo games. A very popular game that emphasizes the characteristic of <i>moe</i> is <i><a href="../../../s/i/s/Sister_Princess_59d1.html" title="Sister Princess">Sister Princess</a></i>, based on the premise of the player acquiring no less than 12 little sisters.</p>
<p>The majority of bishōjo games involve <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> girls and not pictures of real-life girls. Several reasons for this exist. First, the artistic style of anime allows a noticeable sense of femininity and a great sense of fantasy, something that is not obtained with images of real women. Second, since many characters in bishōjo games are minors (or at least have the behavior and physical proportions of minors), the use of the anime style allows the studios of bishōjo games with adult content to avoid the penalty of Japanese <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> laws, which do not prohibit the simulated representation of characters under 18 years of age. Even so, it is common to find the packages of these games affirming that, theoretically, all the characters are over 18 years old. More circumstantial reasons also exist: for example, anime girls showed better on computer screens in the beginning of the video game industry, when colors were more limited.</p>

<p>Although masculine characters are not infrequent, they receive less time on-screen, and the character that represents the player almost never appears; when this happens, his face is usually hidden outside the screen or otherwise. Sometimes, this is taken to the extreme, where the only appearance of the man is in sex scenes being the penis that enters from the side of the screen, or with no visible parts, commonly called the "invisible penis syndrome". The men in bishōjo games are not necessarily extremely masculine, in fact they can be <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effeminate.html" title="Effeminate">effeminate</a>. Two archetypes common in the character representing the player are the stingy <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macho.html" title="Macho">macho</a> and the lovelorn weakling, both managing to be adored by women in spite of their defects.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bish%C5%8Djo_game.html" title="Edit section: Industry">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Industry</span></h3>
<p>The industry of bishōjo games is closely related to the industry of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> and Japanese <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>. They share many conventions in common: for example, it is common to find in many bishōjo games, as in anime, a brief opening video that shows the main characters, in addition to pornographic content that can be found in the games as in anime and manga. Many popular games have been adapted to anime and manga, and many games are derived from bishōjo anime. The three industries are sustained by the same base of talent, the Japanese artistic community of <a href="../../../d/%C5%8D/j/D%C5%8Djinshi.html" title="Dōjinshi">dōjinshi</a>, at the same time having the same profile of assiduous clients, sometimes called "<a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">otaku</a>".</p>
<p>Some dōjin groups produce bishōjo games, many with the objective to later form a real company or to be contracted by one of the great companies in the industry. Due to the short programming time and relatively small amount of content required in a bishōjo game, barriers to enter this industry is somewhat low, and is the reason why every year dozens of new companies emerge. Nevertheless, like in many entertainment industries, those with greater dynamics are the winners, the reason why a few studios are at the top of the industry and collect a greater amount of money in sales while the rest obtain little more than nothing. In order to survive in the competitive market, companies need to be much better than their competitors, or satisfy an individual market. This explains the continuing production of bishōjo games with adult content in spite of being a much smaller market. A substantial part of the revenue of the industry comes from merchandising. Many fanatics idolize particular characters of their favorite games, and are arranged to pay great sums for articles like posters, wrists, and accessories that represent them. Several conventions also exist where articles oriented to the bishōjo fanatics are sold, like the popular dōjinshi market Comiket in <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, Japan.</p>
<p>Due to the representation of woman characters in the majority of bishōjo games, a great majority of the market is men. Nevertheless, from the year 2000 some developers began to expand their market creating games directed to girls and presented attractive young men in their cast (<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishounen.html" title="Bishounen">bishōnen</a>). The most well-known and commercial of these titles is <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a>'s experiment <i><a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokimeki_Memorial_322b.html" title="Tokimeki Memorial">Tokimeki Memorial: Girl's side</a></i> (2002). There have even appeared a small amount of erotic games that present man-man homosexual relations (<a href="../../../y/a/o/Yaoi_game.html" title="Yaoi game">yaoi games</a>), which take their bases from the parallel subculture of <a href="../../../y/a/o/Yaoi.html" title="Yaoi">yaoi</a> anime and manga. In spite of this, the feminine population of the bishōjo market only occupies a very small part of the industry.</p>
<p>Bishōjo games for personal computers are usually sold in special stores or sections reserved for clients more than 18 years old. Nevertheless, console bishōjo games, which are generally less explicit, are sold next to other video games. At the present time, dozens of bishōjo games are released every month, and practically all the video game stores in Japan maintain a sizeable stock of these. The games are initially relatively expensive compared to the Western market of videogames, fluctuating between 8000 and 10000 yen (approximately $75–$95) each, although soon they can be bought more cheaply second-hand.</p>

<p>Bishōjo games began to appear in Japan in the beginning days of personal computers. It can be said that the first bishōjo game commercialized in Japan appeared in 1982 as <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Life_4482.html" title="Night Life">Night Life</a></i> by <a href="../../../k/o/e/Koei.html" title="Koei">Koei</a> (<i>Kōei</i>) (although it had little similarity to their games today). At the beginning of the genre almost all the games were pornographic. The first bishōjo games were not too popular, being limited to graphics of 16 colors or less.</p>
<p>A notable landmark was <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jast.html" title="Jast">Jast</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenshitachi_no_gogo.html" title="Tenshitachi no gogo">Tenshitachi no gogo</a></i> (1985), a precursor to the modern <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_simulation.html" title="Dating simulation">dating simulation</a>. Among early bishōjo <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_game.html" title="Adventure game">adventure games</a> it had a degree of polish that previous games lacked. It was also the first to have recognizably modern <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>-style artwork: its characters had very large eyes and a tiny nose and mouth but were otherwise basically normally proportioned, characteristics which today are found in virtually all bishōjo games. Prior to 1985, girls were generally drawn either as normally proportioned adults or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_deformed.html" title="Super deformed">super deformed</a> children.</p>
<p>Some games involved elements of forcing and brutality. These came to national attention in Japan in 1986 with the release by dB-soft of <i><a href="../../../1/7/7/177_%28video_game%29.html" title="177 (video game)">177</a></i>, a game where the player takes the role of a rapist. (The game's title originates from the number of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_law.html" title="Japanese law">Japanese law</a> criminalizing rape.) <i>177</i> was not actually the first game designed around this premise, but it was unusually explicit. The game caused debate in the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diet_of_Japan_d12a.html" title="Diet of Japan">Japanese parliament</a> and was eventually recalled and re-released with the most controversial scenes removed.</p>
<p>A little-known fact is that some major mainstream Japanese game companies got their start by publishing shady bishōjo games. <a href="../../../k/o/e/Koei.html" title="Koei">Koei</a> is best known today for action/strategy games like <i><a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty_Warriors_2baa.html" title="Dynasty Warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></i>, and <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enix.html" title="Enix">Enix</a> for role-playing games like <i><a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Quest_b339.html" title="Dragon Quest">Dragon Quest</a></i>. But one thing they do not mention on their websites is that they both released half a dozen pornographic games in the 1980s. For example, one of Enix's was a 1983 game entitled <i>Lolita Syndrome</i>, which consisted of five mini-games with cutely drawn girls appearing to be about ten years old. One of these mini-games involved throwing knives to remove the girl's clothes.</p>
<p>Some of the main industry players in the 1980s were <a href="../../../k/o/e/Koei.html" title="Koei">Koei</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enix.html" title="Enix">Enix</a>, PSK, <a href="../../../a/s/c/ASCII_%28company%29_17a8.html" title="ASCII (company)">ASCII</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jast.html" title="Jast">Jast</a>. The two main systems for playing bishōjo games throughout the eighties were the <a href="../../../f/m/-/FM-7_2065.html" title="FM-7">FM-7</a> and <a href="../../../p/c/-/PC-8801_6d9d.html" title="PC-8801">PC-8801</a> and variants (the latter being dominant), early computers that were never released outside of Japan. In the late eighties, some games were also released for the <a href="../../../m/s/x/MSX_e216.html" title="MSX">MSX</a>.</p>
<p><a name="1990s"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bish%C5%8Djo_game.html" title="Edit section: 1990s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1990s</span></h3>
<p>The industry gradually moved away from proprietary Japanese hardware to the burgeoning <a href="../../../d/o/s/DOS_a58e.html" title="DOS">DOS</a> platform, and then later in the decade to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>. Throughout the nineties, bishōjo games underwent an evolution from being one of the most technologically demanding types of games (because their detailed 2D graphics required a large amount of storage space by the standards of early computers) to one of the least (they rarely use 3D graphics). Thus, more than regular games, the main employees required by bishōjo game companies today are not programmers but artists and writers.</p>
<p>In the early nineties the atmosphere in Japan became more and more hostile towards bishōjo games. In 1989 <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_killer.html" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsutomu_Miyazaki_437f.html" title="Tsutomu Miyazaki">Tsutomu Miyazaki</a> was arrested and was revealed to be a consumer of <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolicon.html" title="Lolicon">lolicon</a> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>, causing widespread opposition to pornographic manga, <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">otaku</a> and anything similar. In November 1991 there was an incident where a middle-schooler shoplifted an adult bishōjo game, resulting in increased police scrutiny for makers and retailers. Several prefectures began classifying games as obscene and pulling them off the shelves.</p>
<p>Faced with the threat of being forcibly censored out of existence by the government, in 1992 the bishōjo game industry formed the <i>Computer Software Rinri Kikō</i> (meaning "Ethics Organization for Computer Software", and often abbreviated <i>EOCS</i> or <i>Sofu-rin</i>), setting industry guidelines for acceptable content and packaging. This organization tamed down the most objectionable content in the "wild west" of the 1980s. Thus free from controversy and fueled by continuing improvement in technology, in the 1990s the bishōjo game industry underwent a decade-long boom.</p>
<p>A turning point was <a href="../../../e/l/f/ELF_Corporation_d7b4.html" title="ELF Corporation">ELF</a>'s <i><a href="../../../d/o/k/Dokyusei.html" title="Dokyusei">Dōkyūsei</a></i> (1992). <i>Dōkyūsei</i>, whose gameplay focused on meeting girls and seducing them, established the standard conventions of the dating simulation genre. Another major release was <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konami.html" title="Konami">Konami</a>'s <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porting.html" title="Porting">port</a> of <i><a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokimeki_Memorial_322b.html" title="Tokimeki Memorial">Tokimeki Memorial</a></i> to the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3f6f.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> in 1995, which sold over a million copies. <i>Tokimeki Memorial</i>, the first <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sim</a>, featured good graphics, full voice acting, and a <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a>-like gameplay system. To be accessible to a more mainstream audience, it contained no erotic elements, seeking instead to create a "romantic" atmosphere. <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a>'s popular bishōjo game series <i><a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakura_Wars_2747.html" title="Sakura Wars">Sakura Wars</a></i> also first saw publication in 1996 for the <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Saturn_833e.html" title="Sega Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>; like <i>Tokimeki Memorial</i>, it contained no erotic elements. However, it was unique in that it contained not only adventure-game elements but also a combat system borrowed from tactical combat games such as <i><a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactics_Ogre_0c39.html" title="Tactics Ogre">Tactics Ogre</a></i>.</p>
<p>Since the late nineties, there has been a trend towards better storytelling in mainstream bishōjo games. Particularly notable in this respect are <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaf_%28company%29.html" title="Leaf (company)">Leaf</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Heart_f43b.html" title="To Heart">To Heart</a></i> (1997), and <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_%28company%29.html" title="Key (company)">Key</a>'s <i><a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanon.html" title="Kanon">Kanon</a></i> (1999). Even though their gameplay involved little more than scrolling through text, they became hits largely due to the quality of their writing and characterization. Both were first released on the PC with erotic scenes, which were subsequently removed in their console ports.</p>
<p>Today the industry has grown very large, with most publishers making releases for <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a>, but some of the least pornographic and most successful also branching off into the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">console</a> market (the main consoles used for bishōjo games in the nineties and today are the <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Saturn_833e.html" title="Sega Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Dreamcast_d404.html" title="Sega Dreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a>). Indeed, with regular Japanese game publishers focusing almost entirely on the console market, and with American PC games being unpopular in Japan, today the majority of retail single-player PC games in Japan are bishōjo games. However, unlike the rest of the Japanese game industry, this genre has never cracked any major foreign markets.</p>

<p>In the West, especially in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the popular discussion of bishōjo games is widely plagued by disagreement and disapproval of pornography. The debate tends to be remarkably divided: on one hand, critics condemn the genre as totally pornography, while on the other hand, enthusiasts deny this generalization. This question does not cause as much controversy in Japan.</p>
<p>The attempts to massively trade bishōjo games in the West have caused a certain degree of public controversy. An example of this is the attempt to trade the game <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Maker_2_ec9e.html" title="Princess Maker 2">Princess Maker 2</a></i> in the United States, which was never officially released, but a few newspapers critically accused the game of sexism, and adding to the uproar was a pre-release screen-capture containing nudity. <i>Princess Maker</i> attracted negative attention due to the fact it was widely promoted as a mainstream video game. Other releases have so far avoided it by presenting themselves as entirely pornographic.</p>
<p>The dōjinshi <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> <i><a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a></i>, popular between Western followers of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>, especially in the United States, was inspired in a large extent by dating sims. <i>Megatokyo</i> idealizes bishōjo games while simultaneously expresses another criticism commonly used in the West against them: that players resort to them as a form of escapism because they are socially inept (This type of criticism is also found in Japan, though in a quite different form: see <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">otaku</a>).</p>

<p>There are a number of terms roughly equivalent to "bishōjo game" in use, both in Japanese and English, and there is considerable disagreement and confusion about their proper use. There is no clear consensus on the precise meaning of many of the terms below. The naming difficulties reflect the fluid boundaries of the genre, as well as embarrassment caused by the pornographic nature of some of these games.</p>
<p>In general, "<a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_game.html" title="Anime game">anime game</a>" can be considered the most general term, and other names designate subgenres. Here are the most common terms currently in use:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bishōjo game</b> (or <b>Girl game</b>, <b>Gal game</b>): This term designates any game involving pretty anime girls. The Japanese word "<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bish%C5%8Djo.html" title="Bishōjo">bishōjo</a>" literally means "pretty young girl". "Girl game" and "gal game" are also used to describe these games.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Boy's Love game</b>, <b><a href="../../../b/l/_/BL_game_da28.html" title="BL game">BL game</a></b>: Girls' "bishōnen" game where teenage boys and young adult males engage in homosexual relationships. Most such games are <i>visual novels</i> (see below). See also <a href="../../../y/a/o/Yaoi_game.html" title="Yaoi game">Yaoi game</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">Dating sim</a></b>: Strictly speaking, this term designates the small subgenre of bishōjo games specifically focused on dating, the most famous being <i>Tokimeki Memorial</i>. However, this term is frequently used by English speakers to describe any love simulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../e/r/o/Eroge.html" title="Eroge">Eroge</a></b> (エロゲー), <b>H game</b> , <b>Hentai</b> (変態) <b>game</b>: These terms are used in English to designate anime games with explicit erotic or pornographic elements. "H" is a letter used in Japanese to refer to sexual content, and "erogē" is an abbreviation of "erotic game". "Hentai", meaning "pervert" in Japanese, is not used to describe these games in Japanese, but it is common in English. In Japan, H games are almost always sold for the PC, because console manufacturers such as <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo.html" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> generally refuse to license pornographic games for their systems.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Raiser sim</b>: This is a subgenre where the goal is to "raise" a female character, training and educating her to improve her (usually numerically quantified) attributes. This resembles <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing games</a> except that the goal is to improve another character rather than yourself, not unlike a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_pet.html" title="Digital pet">digital pet</a>. The classic example is <i>Princess Maker</i>, where the player's task is to raise a girl into a queen. Another is the <a href="../../../n/6/4/N64.html" title="N64">N64</a> game <i><a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Project_J2_e551.html" title="Wonder Project J2">Wonder Project J2</a></i> with an orphaned robot girl. Many hardcore eroge also start from this premise, in which case the character to be "raised" is usually some kind of sexual slave. (This sub-genre is called "chōkyō" (調教 "training" (animals) / "breaking" (animals).)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Romance game</b> (恋愛ゲーム) or <b>Love ADV game</b>, <b>Love sim</b>: This term describes <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_game.html" title="Adventure game">adventure games</a> focusing on romantic interactions with anime girls. This term is generally used to describe games which have little or no pornography, or for which erotic content is not the main focus of the game. To describe hardcore pornographic games, <i>eroge</i> is preferred.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novel.html" title="Visual novel">Visual novel</a></b>: This is used to designate a type of game which is particularly story-focused, or containing novel-like narration in its writing. Often text appears on the entire screen (covering the background image) instead of sitting in a small textbox at the bottom of the screen. Examples of visual novels include <i>To Heart</i> (only available in Japanese) and <i>Kana Imōto</i> (translated to English).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, note that many Japanese games which are not strictly bishōjo games contain elements of the genre. Many mainstream Japanese role-playing games feature attractive anime girls (such as <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VII_f2ee.html" title="Final Fantasy VII">Final Fantasy VII</a></i>'s <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tifa_Lockhart_39ec.html" title="Tifa Lockhart">Tifa Lockhart</a>), but they are usually not considered bishōjo games unless this is a central aspect of the game.</p>
