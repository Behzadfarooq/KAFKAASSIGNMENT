<p><a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Partridge_8c2d.html" title="Edward Partridge">Edward Partridge</a> became the first man ordained to the office of Bishop in the early <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_da0a.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saint</a> <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_b5db.html" title="Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)">church</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">February 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a>. The duties of the office were to oversee the temporal affairs and accounts of the Church. Partridge emigrated to the Church's growing colony in <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_County%2C_Missouri_4f40.html" title="Jackson County, Missouri">Jackson County</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and continued to act as "First Bishop" of the Church there. <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newel_K._Whitney_7e65.html" title="Newel K. Whitney">Newel K.

<p>When the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saints_f81e.html" title="Latter Day Saints">Latter Day Saints</a> were headquartered in <a href="../../../n/a/u/Nauvoo%2C_Illinois_87c2.html" title="Nauvoo, Illinois">Nauvoo</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, the membership was separated into "<a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_%28Mormonism%29_d662.html" title="Ward (Mormonism)">wards</a>" or geographical precincts and a Bishop was called to oversee the temporal affairs of each ward. The role of the "First Bishop" was expanded to preside over Bishops of the various wards (and thus became known as the office of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presiding_Bishop_6073.html" title="Presiding Bishop">Presiding Bishop</a>).</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_crisis_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_2605.html" title="Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)">1844 succession crisis</a>, the offices of Bishop and Presiding Bishop developed separately in the various resulting denominations of the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_movement_08ed.html" title="Latter Day Saint movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a>.</p>

<p>In the largest <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_da0a.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saint</a> denomination, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church), Bishops are <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calling_%28Mormonism%29_62a0.html" title="Calling (Mormonism)">called</a> from among the members of a local congregation, known as a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_%28Mormonism%29_d662.html" title="Ward (Mormonism)">ward</a>, and traditionally serve, without pay, for four to seven years (the actual length of service can vary). A Bishop must be a married <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_052c.html" title="High Priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a> in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek_priesthood.html" title="Melchizedek priesthood">Melchizedek Priesthood</a> and serves as the Presiding High Priest of the ward. A Bishop simultaneously serves as the President of the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaronic_Priesthood_2eef.html" title="Aaronic Priesthood">Aaronic Priesthood</a> and President of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_e646.html" title="Priest (Latter Day Saints)">Priests Quorum</a>. In a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_%28Mormonism%29_d662.html" title="Ward (Mormonism)">branch</a> (a congregation not large enough to draw the full complement of leadership positions from its own ranks), the Branch President fulfills the same functions listed below for a Bishop; however, a Branch President does not need to be a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_052c.html" title="High Priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a>. See <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek_priesthood.html#Hierarchy" title="Melchizedek priesthood">Hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>The Bishop is often called "the father of the ward"<sup id="_ref-LDS_Newsroom_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LDS_Newsroom" title="">[1]</a></sup> as he is the priesthood leader who is most intimately involved with individual Church members. The Bishop is not paid for the time he devotes to serving his ward. All ward and stake level callings in the LDS Church operate as a lay ministry; members donate their time to perform the duties assigned with each calling.</p>
<p>The Priesthood leader of the Bishop is the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stake_%28Mormonism%29_3a8e.html" title="Stake (Mormonism)">Stake President</a>, who provides direction, training and counsel to the Bishops of the Wards within his stake boundaries; the Stake President is assisted in these duties by two counselors and the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Council_%28Mormonism%29_ab50.html" title="High Council (Mormonism)">Stake High Council</a>.

<p>The Bishop holds the primary responsibility for everything in the ward, both spiritually and temporally. Although he can delegate specific assignments to his counselors, the ultimate responsibility falls to him. His duties include presiding over and conducting meetings and worship services, serving as President of the ward's Quorum of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_e646.html" title="Priest (Latter Day Saints)">Priests</a>, acting as a "Judge in Israel" or "common judge", providing temporary financial relief for ward members, serving as the Presiding <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_052c.html" title="High Priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a> of the ward, and organizing and managing the ward's auxiliary organizations. After being called, a Bishop is ordained a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_052c.html" title="High Priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a> (if he does not already hold that priesthood office) and then set apart as the Bishop and as Presiding High Priest of the Ward. He is also given the priesthood "keys" which authorize him to serve as a representative for the Lord in performing his duties.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Conducting Services</b> — Each Sunday, the Bishop is responsible for organizing the primary worship services, called <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament_meeting.html" title="Sacrament meeting">Sacrament meeting</a>. The Bishop and his counselors select speakers from among the members of the ward, assigned <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Council_%28Mormonism%29_ab50.html" title="High Council (Mormonism)">high council</a> speakers, and, on occasion, guest speakers. Infrequently, the bishop or his counselors also speak in Sacrament meeting. A member of the Bishopric conducts the meeting, introduces the speakers and occasionally concludes the meeting with a few remarks. Once each month, normally the first Sunday of the month, a "Fast and Testimony Meeting" is held and no specific speakers are assigned. Instead, those attending the ward that day are invited to stand and bear <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testimony.html#Religious_testimony" title="Testimony">testimony</a> of the Savior and His work and influence.</li>
<li><b>President of the Priests Quorum</b> — The bishop is the President of the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaronic_Priesthood_2eef.html" title="Aaronic Priesthood">Aaronic Priesthood</a> and the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_e646.html" title="Priest (Latter Day Saints)">Priest Quorum</a> in the ward. He selects two priests to serve as First and Second Assistants to the Bishop. The Bishop is responsible to prepare each <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_e646.html" title="Priest (Latter Day Saints)">Priest</a> to worthily serve as a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_missionary.html" title="Mormon missionary">missionary</a> and to prepare to receive the ordinances of the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_fbc2.html" title="Temple (Latter Day Saints)">temple</a>. He is also responsible for the spiritual and temporal learning of every young priesthood holder. As President of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_e646.html" title="Priest (Latter Day Saints)">Priest Quorum</a>, he is responsible for new member baptisms and missionary work in the ward.</li>
<li><b>Judge in Israel</b> — Members are interviewed by their Bishop in order to receive a <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_fbc2.html#Requirements_for_entering_LDS_temples" title="Temple (Latter Day Saints)">Temple Recommend</a>. The Bishop signs the Recommend to indicate that the member is following basic tenets of the Church and is worthy to enter the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_fbc2.html" title="Temple (Latter Day Saints)">Temple</a>. Additionally, members seek out guidance from the Bishop in overcoming personal challenges. Serious sins must be confessed to the Bishop who helps members through the repentance process. In some cases, the Bishop presides over a Church Disciplinary Council where the outcome can include admonishment, probation, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html#The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="Excommunication">disfellowshipment, or, excommunication</a> depending on the severity of the sin and the attitude of the wardmember. Additionally, the Bishop also has the authority and duty to counsel members on spiritual matters, and sits as a “common judge” in the event of disputes between wardmembers. Bishops typically withdraw from involvement in matters which have been taken to the law.</li>
<li><b>Provide temporally for the members of the ward</b> — Bishops also have the responsibility to oversee the payment of <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tithing.html" title="Tithing">tithes</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_offering.html" title="Fast offering">offerings</a> in a ward, including the duty to accurately account for all money donated within his ward. The Bishop also has the authority to authorize financial assistance, specifically the disbursement of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_offering.html" title="Fast offering">fast offerings</a> donated to help the poor, and other assistance to wardmembers according to the guidelines of the Church. The other assistance a Bishop can provide is "in kind" assistance in the form of food and household goods from the Bishop's storehouse (which is managed by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presiding_Bishop_6073.html" title="Presiding Bishop">Presiding Bishop</a> (see below). The Bishop disperses funds, authorizes distribution of food from the Bishop's Storehouse, or provides other appropriate assistance after evaluating the needs of the family and the resources available in his ward.</li>
<li><b>Serve as the presiding High Priest for the Ward</b> — As the presiding <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_3c45.html" title="High priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a>, the Bishop leads meetings and has the priesthood authority to issue callings, approve the performance of ordinances such as baptisms and the administration of the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_ca5c.html" title="Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)">sacrament</a>. The <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_3c45.html" title="High priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priests</a> that reside in several wards that form a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stake_%28Mormonism%29_3a8e.html" title="Stake (Mormonism)">Stake</a> are part of a Quorum led by the Stake President. In each ward the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_3c45.html" title="High priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priests</a> are organized into a Group. In the Ward, the Bishop gives direction to and coordinates the efforts of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_3c45.html" title="High priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a> Group leader and the <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_250e.html" title="Elder (Latter Day Saints)">Elders</a> Quorum president in performing their duties.</li>
<li><b>Organize and manage the other organizations in the ward</b> — The Bishop is responsible for calling the president of each auxiliary organization. These organizations are: Sunday School, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief_Society_1861.html" title="Relief Society">Relief Society</a>, Young Mens Presidency, Young Womens Presidency, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_Association_475b.html" title="Primary Association">Primary</a>, Aaronic Priesthood Quorums and Young Womens Class Presidencies. Additionally, he approves the recommendations made by each auxiliary president for 2 counselors, a secretary, instructors (if applicable) and other callings within the organization. In doing this, the Bishop manages the time donated by members of the ward.</li>

<p>The LDS Church also has a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presiding_Bishop_6073.html" title="Presiding Bishop">Presiding Bishopric</a> which oversees the temporal affairs of the Church (including its Welfare Services) and provides assistance and instruction to the various bishoprics worldwide. However, there is no ecclesiastical or priesthood reporting relationship as the Bishop's ecclesiastical priesthood leader is the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stake_%28Mormonism%29_3a8e.html" title="Stake (Mormonism)">Stake President</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, according to Latter-day Saint scripture, a Bishop does not need to be a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_3c45.html" title="High priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a> nor does he need counselors if he is a <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levite.html" title="Levite">Levite</a> and a direct descendant of <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron.html" title="Aaron">Aaron</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>' brother. In the LDS Church, there is no current Bishop serving under this doctrine, and such a Bishop could not fulfill all the duties enumerated above (such as the serving as the Presiding <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_priest_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_3c45.html" title="High priest (Latter Day Saints)">High Priest</a> of the Ward).</p>
