<p>Well, my red pencil and I visited the page. See what you think. There were a few rephrasings, but generally I was omitting commas used before coordinating conjunctions that didn't have independent clauses after them, and I wiki linked some things that are usually a bit dumb (like years) and a proper noun. Feel free to revert anything that isn't right. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:17, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>We try to be very open on most things, but certain things we restrict to veterans. There are indeed some votes for which you need to be here for three months before participating, but these tend to be</p>
<ol>
<li>votes on major community management issues</li>
<li>not stuff most newcomers would be interested in anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first example that comes to mind is the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_July_2004_de06.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections July 2004">Arbitration committee election</a> that's starting soon. There are two reasons we close these votes to newcomers. First, we don't want people to create a bunch of new accounts just to vote. Second, newer users won't usually know the community well enough to understand all the issues involved in these votes, or know the people involved. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 23:28, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sure. Thank you. I wasn't asking in a critical spirit, just wondering if/when I'd be eligible to vote on certain nominations that I've been reading about. A three-month rule seems reasonable, in fact "we don't want people to create a bunch of new accounts just to vote" was exactly what I meant by suggesting that it might be a precaution against coups.

<p>You [wink] toffee-nosed git! The nerve of you, dropping a note to giggle at my heart-wrenching confession of how i let Barnes &amp; Noble play upon my credulous simplicity, and make a laughingstock of my innermost feelings!</p>
<p>I don't know how i'm going to get over this ... but perhaps either "The Silk Chinchilla", or "A Boy's New-Year's in Waleston, Montana". Hmmm.</p>
<p>But a little more seriously, i hoped to flesh out a little the abstract image of how it is that so much crap gets published, that is not worthy of a $100 advance, let alone a $100K one or a WP article.

<p>At my reply to your comment on the high school teacher and expert on "C changes." The one that stung more was the comment about our being ogrish to the Manga kid. I thought we were voting right on. While it is possible to write an article on the manga, as it came to us it was a review, and reviews are out. I don't think we were being mean, although in cleaning it you are being nice. As for making fun of the Engrish...well, sometimes it's funny. You know that I always realize that a person making those mistakes still knows one more language than I do. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:19, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a joke. Turns out there is a <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julmust.html" title="Julmust">Julmust</a> article. That's something.

<li>Do people still drink that stuff? Sorry, I meant to say, julmust is a must. Big cultural icon. I trust Ikea changed the name of the product at Easter while keeping the liquid the same, in the approved fashion. The Julmust <b>article</b> may itself be notable in that Larry Sanger edited it, although it was a bland little edit and, I think, no improvement. -- 31 support votes and counting.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 21:42, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi there Bishonen—thank you for your kind message. Please don't feel bad: I wasn't put off as I knew I was bound to make some mistakes while I got used to the style here. When you pointed out the error I really could see the point and how dumb I was! Anyway, I am glad it's all sorted; and I thought the crack you made was really funny! (BTW if you're curious on how I wound up typing Swedish things, I was following links while surfing and different stuff came to mind. But as you may have guessed, I am in New Zealand and moving ahead with putting in stuff about my country.) Hope to have more fun here—I enjoy sharing what I know and researching for this project. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStombs_27f9.html" title="User:Stombs">Stombs</a> 13:16, Aug 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks again, Bishonen. It looks like I need to sift through a bit more of what's marketing hype and what's not—down here, we only hear so much about Sweden (through places like the Scandinavian Business Association, which was how I started getting to the Swedish links). Thank you for explaining the context of the Swedish prankster comment but also thanks for your kind comments on my other edits. I hope I do more good than harm here, even if I have created a few VfDs for you!

<li>Never heard of the song, never heard of Nils Hansson, and I have Scania, or Skåne, roots and am quite into these things. "The unofficial national (!) anthem"? Give me a break. I've just learned that Nils Hansson was a very, very, very minor poet, younger brother of poet Ola Hansson (Ola's notable). The poem/song is a typical late nineteenth-century patriotic effort in praise of Scania, very harmless in itself, nothing inflammatory there. Describing it as a "national" anthem is either a slip of the keyboard or a political statement, I'm guessing the latter. See, Scania, the southernmost tip of Sweden, has a "patriotic" secessionist movement in the form of marginal political parties on the extreme right. Marginal and marginalized - even though Scania politicians are generally noted for conservatism, all other parties <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunning.html" title="Shunning">shun</a> these guys. You know what's interesting? That the user has posted Scania and this song on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_national_anthems.html" title="List of national anthems">List of national anthems</a> today. I'd say that makes it a political statement. Hey, do you have the means for checking what IP users post through (I mean, when they're not posting anonymously?) I'm thinking of a guy.

</ul>
<p>Hmm. In this case, it seems like a VfD listing is in order, with a note. It's probably not a Wikisource issue, because the work is too minor, and the user is trying to score a political point. As for the second question, I don't. That takes a developer. Hypothetically, I can ask a developer, but I'd need a fairly strong reason. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:58, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, right. No, I don't have strong reason at all. No, no, not Wikisource. It's not only stunningly minor, it's in <b>Swedish</b>. I'll check Nils Hansson's publication credentials on LIBRIS and Project Runeberg if you like. That's easy.<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 17:05, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I got nothing, except a claim in a Skåne magazine from 1955 that "Vackra hembygd, du som vilar" is, uh, generally thought of as the, hmm, "regional anthem". This 1955 article goes on to enumerate several other contenders for the honor, though. Swedish Google for phrases from the song gives no hits. Nor does international Google, btw (isn't that odd, if it's in a Wikipedia article?). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 18:12, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>That last isn't surprising. Google takes a while to find and crawl our pages. This one was a brand new page that I was nipping. I note that people are suggesting Wikisource for it.

<p>I edited the Shayne Sweeney section to add my VfD notice. When you saved your entry, whether you edited the entire page or just the Shayne Sweeney section, you naturally created a new section for Biblical studies below the current Shayne Sweeney section but separate from the Shayne Sweeney request. Then I saved my proposed deletion, and it naturally created a new section for Indo-European Alphabet within the current Shayne Sweeney but now a separate section which of course was placed just before your Biblical studies request which had just appeared. All quite reasonable and no harm to anyone. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 00:55, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I also wasn't aware of Jimbo's recent announcement regarding limited-use material. I've always strived to contribute only original work to Wikipedia, so I know there will be no license problems. Photos of celebrities seem to nearly always be copyrighted; we've gotten away with fair use on most of those for quite some time, and I've been thinking about the potential for original portraits as replacements for these for almost as long. I've no idea what general reaction to them might be; it is likely to seem a little strange to have sketches or other portraits of the most-photographed celebrities of our time, though I suppose the more often someone is photographed, the greater our chances of finding a public-domain photo of them (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>, for example, a U.S. government photo). But I digress; a good place to discuss it might be <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Illustration_de00.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Illustration">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Illustration</a>, though there are likely to be other copyright/fair use discussions around somewhere that would apply, under <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> or <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a>.</p>
<p>To your second question, I'm afraid I am fairly inexperienced in portrait illustration; 3D models, diagrams, technical illustrations, sure! I think the last photo-to-portrait I did was back in high school (10 years ago, wow), but I could probably pull it off, unless a better candidate volunteers for the job.

<p>I would really, really like to add a photo to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelis_Vreeswijk_3264.html" title="Cornelis Vreeswijk">Cornelis Vreeswijk</a> (Swedish singer-songwriter, deceased in 1987), but I know there isn't a hope in hell of getting one under GFDL. It just might be possible to get more limited permission, though. I have talked with the Swedish Cornelis Vreeswijk Society, whose <a href="http://www.cornelis.se/" class="external text" title="http://www.cornelis.se/" rel="nofollow">website</a> has a few nice pics, and it turns out they have the photographers' permission for free, but only for their own use — the copyright is retained by the photographer. I think it might be worth contacting one or two of these photographers and asking for the same kind of permission for Wikipedia. They're professionals, they live by selling the rights to their images, and Cornelis Vreeswijk portraits are in limited supply (Cornelis being more famous and popular now than in his lifetime), so forget GFDL. But since they weren't averse to having their work shown for free by the Cornelis Vreeswijk Society, why not Wikipedia, too? That's what I think, but I have two questions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Is this kind of limited permission any use to Wikipedia? I could have sworn I'd seen a reluctant admission in some policy document that occasionally this was the best we could do and in such a case it <b>was</b> acceptable to use images with those conditions attached. But I can't find it again.</dd>
<dd>2. If it is any use, how should I ask the copyright holders? (Boilerplate request for permission, anyone?) I've been trying to formulate a request in my head, but the harder I try, the more it sounds like something <b>shady</b>.&#160;;-( (I should preferably ask in Swedish, too, which always makes any request sound a little shadier. But if I had a template to work with, I could deal with translation issues.)--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 14:34, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Limited permission is definitely second best. Ask the photographer for GFDL if possible.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for replying, but my problem is that it's not possible. Or, well, it's possible to <b>ask</b>, but I think it's impolitic to lead with a request that's bound to be refused. It's not that I don't realize that GFDL is totally the recommended option, infinitely preferrable, etc. I do realize it. Also, I only see the familiar boilerplate requests for permission under GDFL at the link you give (am I missing something?). Sounds as if the answer is no to both, then. I've been roaming Wikipedia for weeks looking for a solution to this, but, well, I guess the reason I couldn't find it is that it doesn't exist.&#160;:-( Thanks for trying, Gdr.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 15:41, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to throw cold water on the idea, but because Wikipedia is committed to providing open content, we can't accept images if our only basis for using them is a non-free license such as this. Jimbo Wales has stated that images restricted to noncommercial use only, or with permission specific to Wikipedia only, are not allowed.</p>
<p>I think what you're referring to with "a reluctant admission in some policy document that occasionally this was the best we could do" is our policy on fair use images. See <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. Currently we do allow images if we can make a good case for fair use and have little prospect of obtaining a truly free substitute.</p>
<p>So the answer is, if you believe the image can be justified as fair use, it may be acceptable. Fair use is not based on permission, but of course it would still be useful to obtain whatever permission you can from the copyright holder, even though with fair use you are claiming permission is not needed. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:33, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right. I understand the concept of fair use, and, no, that wasn't what I was talking about. It was something different, that would have fitted this case ... well, I must have dreamt it, or else it was obsolete. I certainly couldn't in good faith claim fair use, since there aren't any PD photos of Vreeswijk out there. I'll forget the whole thing, then, and not trouble those copyright holders. I do understand that we need a transparent policy, rather than a jungle of exceptions, and thank you both for your prompt replies. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 18:57, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've often wondered, in cases such as this, where all of the available photography of a subject is unlikely to be GFDL-compatible, if it would be helpful for some talented sketch-artist Wikipedians to produce an "artist's rendering" of a subject based on one or more photographs. Such a sketch would certainly constitute original work, and could then be licensed as GFDL or public domain. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 01:19, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

:-) I bet they regretted giving us all that fine free Swedish info in Robin Karlsson. Mind you, I knew before then that they were posting from a school, it was obvious. Didn't know which school, though. Btw, I have a nephew by marriage named Niklas Modigh, but he's only seven, so I soon stopped suspecting him. ;-) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 19:35, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for your comments, and thank you for catching that problem. I'm doing my best write now to expand on his history and work with the SDS in the hopes that people will accept it. Unfortunately, I only joined a week or so before we found this article, so I'm pretty sure my objections are going to be ignored. Would you consider voting on it once I get that history section expanded?</p>

<p>Your <b>vote</b> will count less because of your being a new user, but not necessarily your <b>comments</b>, Che. I'm sure voters will be interested in those, especially ... well, I hope you'll take it in the spirit that it's meant if I tell you that you made kind of a bad start by telling Terrapin and Geogre they stink. (Well, technically, you told them their comments stink. ;-)) If you wanted to apologize for that, it might make people listen better still, but it's up to you entirely — I'm not trying to tell you what to do. Redstar2000 is interesting, but I'm not sure about the notability.

<p>Woops, I didn't even remember that. Yeah, like I said I'm new here. What I meant was that they all came on talking about "proletarian vanity" and debating his marxism, which has nothing to do with the article.

<p>Ok, the VfD debate for that article has long rolled off. The article was deleted before the VfD templates were in use. It turns out that it was deleted not for vanity, as Anthony claims, but for copyright violations. Indeed, the new article contained copyright violations, too, in that it lifted huge quotes. Those are being removed. The figure is terrifically minor, but it may well be that it would be kept. Since the deletion was for copyvio, if the text of the current one is not copyvio, it is not appropriate for a speedy. It's not a great article, though. Also, you couldn't have seen the VfD decision -- it's gone -- or the dispensation, since that was only in the deletion log, which is available only to administrators. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:22, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the people who are watching A. are all over, and I'm letting them know about this case. It took a ton of work to find anything on this particular article because of how long ago it was. Thing is, if the deletion vote has rolled off, but we know it was deleted, I think it can be speedy deleted. The question is whether the user RK is the one who recreated it. A. has come back trying to rally every discontented person, even though none of them are discontented the same way, for an assault, and that is a danger. You've seen the mess I'm in on VfD. Again, it's a kind of "We'll fix them" thing. A. can sometimes say a valid thing. Fine. Then, though, he decides that no one else has anything to say and starts acting upon it. That's not valid. That's vandalism or trolling. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:11, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You should note that Morgenbesser died August 1 and the article was created August 5. It wasn't some grand conspiracy. Someone recognized that the famous professor deserved an article, probably after hearing of his death. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> (see warning) 12:04, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, Anthony, but of course I noticed the timing of the article creation, especially since the external links were mainly to recent brief obituaries. A grand conspiracy theory literally never occurred to me — I always assumed that the death and the obits were the reason Gzornenplatz created the article in the first place. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 12:19, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, right. I didn't see that you were talking to Geogre on my page, but now that I read the whole context, I do see it. Better talk to him directly, if you want. Incidentally, I asked Geogre what "user RK" above stands for, but he missed replying (because we were mainly talking about unconnected things), and I <b>still</b> don't know what it refers to. Something to do with you, it seems ... don't get it, though. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 12:35, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was talking to both of you. And what would be better is if you two wouldn't get together behind my back trying to get me in trouble.

</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't see the point of the user RK, reference, then. It would be better if you didn't obsess about old stuff, too — see the date on the message you replied to? I got the copyvio issue wrong, I misread, and I apologized, all of it a while back, what more can I do? I'll also add that my opinion of you has gone up since then, Anthony (not that I suppose my opinion is anything that keeps you awake nights). I've come to appreciate that you say things because you mean them, and in my book that's <b>not</b> trolling. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 13:02, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>I didn't expect this to become a long conversation. I just wanted to note a couple facts for anyone reading this page. If it were my talk page I'd just delete the whole thing, as it is old stuff which is already resolved.

<p>Sorry if I gave the wrong impression when I chose not to reply to your earlier comments on my Talk page. There was no personal intent. As I said in another thread recently, I connect via dial-up and have to be fairly choosy about what I reply to or I'll be at it all night. I'll always answer a specific question though.</p>
<p>From your evidence, it sounds like you have a good case. That's evidence that would generally be well received on VfD and might even be strong enough to start a thread in Requests for Arbitration. I'd ask others for advice on that, though. I've never participated in an Arbitration process. You're right that it may just stir up emotions without really changing behaviors. The best answer may be a simple renomination.

<p>David Remhal got a request to phone Viktor, subject of the vandalism, and he did. For follow up, see what he has to say (as user chmod007). It happened while he was on IRC when I was, so he mentioned it there. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:12, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did, yes. He left a note on my <a href="../../../c/h/m/User_talk%7EChmod007_2342.html" title="User talk:Chmod007">talk page</a> and also sent me a mail. I'll ask if I can forward it to you. Basically, he is very concerned that the vandals will bring bad publicity for the school. Apparently they have some kind of IT agreement with Sandvik which could be threatened by such publicity. He's also uneasy about the fact that some of our good-faith discussions implicate him (Viktor) and his friends (for the main part, Niklas) as possible vandals.</dd>
<dd>He asked if it was possible to remove (edit out) the school and their names from the past discussions. I said that it was probably possible, but that I would have to consult everyone else involved first. I also informed him that even though it is edited out, it will still stay in the page histories. He agreed that wouldn't be a problem, considering that they're not spidered by Google and other search engines.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I told him about the related vandalism on sv, and he said he'd look into it. He claims that he has no knowledge of who really committed the vandalism. — <a href="../../../c/h/m/User%7EChmod007_2959.html" title="User:Chmod007">David Remahl</a> 16:54, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, David. Yes, indeed, the school and the individual students get to use Sandvik AB's net, and it was a very stupid thing the two students did who posted vandal edits and articles directly from it. Compare OlofE shaking his head pityingly over that particular aspect — uj uj uj — on Swedish wiki Bybrunnen (Headline: Pågående vandalisering?), after I had told them about the IP's and the info I had found on the school homepage. For latest events on sv, see also messages on the Bishonen Talk page from Niklas Modigh, Johan, Martin and Lamré (Swedish sysop).</p>
<p>I'm not really happy about our editing stuff out, except maybe my mention of the school on 3 September (see my message to Martin below). Anyway, I don't think they should be worrying very much about things like Google hits on our pages. They're in much hotter water with Swedish wiki, which is more likely to make trouble as far as the school and the deal with its sponsor goes. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 17:32, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I won't argue for it. I'm not that happy about removing information potentially useful for the future either. However, we must add the information that Viktor and Niklas and other people who were perhaps implicated as vandals were probably not involved. So that someone who googles their names does not misconstrue the situation and gives them more trouble. What do you think? — <a href="../../../c/h/m/User%7EChmod007_2959.html" title="User:Chmod007">David Remahl</a> 18:03, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, absolutely. As I've pointed out a number of times, on sv. and en. both, this aspect has worried me the whole time: that some of the names may be those of victims rather than perpetrators. Do please do whatever you can to un-implicate anyone you have talked with and have faith in, David. However, you might care to take a look at the message from Niklas Modigh on Swedish Bishonen's Användardiskussion, before you decide he wasn't one of the writers. That message sounds pretty genuine to me. Does the real Niklas Modigh, by phone, claim it's a fake, by any chance? Not that I want to go on hounding even the perps, far from it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 18:27, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hej.</p>
<p>Jag har sett mitt namn figurera i diverse inlägg som handlar om vandalism. Jag kan villigt erkänna att jag skrivit ett fåtal inlägg som kan betraktas som vandalism. Det har jag dock slutat med och bett om ursäkt för. Jag tycker det är beklagligt att det inte kunde räcka med det. Vem som har fortsatt "vandalisera" wikipedia efter min ursäkt har jag ingen aning om. Jag tror knappast att det är någon av mina vänner. I fortsättningen ser jag helst att ni slutar nämna skolan och företaget som gemensam nämnare för de här "vandalerna", då jag inte tror att så är fallet. Jag ser då hellre att ni kontaktar "vandalerna" personligen så att de själva kan få stå till svars för sina egna handlingar. Vill någon prata med mig eller någon annan av eleverna på skolan hänvisar jag till David Remahls diskussionssida, där Viktor Johanson givit ut sitt mobil tel. nummer.</p>

<p>Hi, Martin, are you talking about the Swedish or the English Wikipedia? Only one mention has been made of the school on en.wiki after those messages from you that I saw on my page and David's. (Incidentally, have you posted messages on any other pages than those? I'm only asking because you state above that you've apologized, which I can't say I've seen.) That single message was from me to David, telling him that I had raised the matter on sv.wiki, where it turned out they had had some interesting contributions — "Bluffpoker" comes to mind. I'm happy not to have seen any more articles in the Famous Unknown Swedes Series on en.wiki since 1 Sept. We very much regard the matter as closed, and would be more than happy to welcome you and your friends as legit contributors, if you're interested.</p>
<p>I've read your identical message and those from your friends on my Swedish userpage. Could you please tell the guys that I don't have time to respond on sv. (this whole thing is taking much too much time for me), but I'm quite prepared to believe you about "Fred flygare" being a copycat posting. Lamré and OlofE seem less convinced (see Lamré's message on the Swedish Bishonen Talk), and the Swedish side is really up to them, so it might be better for you to address them directly, or Bybrunnen.</p>
<p>I do agree with you that it's much better not to mention your school or its sponsor on en.wiki any more, thanks for pointing it out. I'm sorry I named them in my 3 Sept message to David, it was just thoughtless habit.

<p>Ok, I've added some of the background to the poem to the article now. It was in my eME book, turns out, so the background information the editors gave me was confined to language, for the most part. Nevertheless, it seems that an Oriental origin is probably out -- that was just one critic saying so, and Medievalist critics are some of the dumbest creatures on earth (because they're scholars).

<p>Wow! He was really busy! Yeah, I can fix it. It looks like he created a new category and moved a bunch of articles to it. I'm not sure from your note if this is what you mean, but if in the future you want to change a category, all you have to do is go to the article in question (or in this case, the many articles in question) and find the category you don't want (in this case, Category:Short Stories) and change it to the one you want (in this case, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShort_stories_9359.html" title="Category:Short stories">Category:Short stories</a>).

<dd>Thanks a lot, Seth. Yes, that was exactly what I meant. Are you saying that by changing the category in the article itself (in the many articles themselves), I'd be changing the category?

<dd>Yup, changing the category in an article changes the categories it is listed in. If you create a new category, though, it will show up as red until you go in and assign the <i>new category</i> to other categories, which is where the describing gets a little messy. Anyhow, Category:Short Stories has been fixed and is now listed on Categories for Deletion. It turns out to have been for the best, too. There was a little recategorizing and alphabetizing that needed to be done, so the category looks a little nicer now. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 21:01, Sep 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can take care of wikisource. But, it ought to be deleted from wikipedia anyway (as non-encylopedic). From reading your link, I'm not clear on whether there exists a non-copyvio English translation. If so, I'd rather replace the wikisource rather than delete. Or, I wonder if some kind Spanish speaker involved in the Allende page would re-translate it — it's not long.</p>
<p>Or, is the claim that the speech itself (rather than translation) is copyright and so automatically a problem? That seems unlikely to me, as he was speaking in his official capacity as President.</p>

It's kind of a subtext in his message that he downloaded the two texts plus the audio file from somewhere on the web himself, deciding to assume they were Public Domain, as academics do (I'm a prof myself). He doesn't mind us using anything we like from his site, but it's obvious that permission for it isn't his to give.

<p>David, you're stalking me! No, I appreciate the date wikifications, actually, at least in the sense that I know they must be, while I don't like to do them myself, because I hate the policy that dictates them. On the other hand, I agree that such things should be uniform, so thanks for fixing them. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 22:43, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the policy could be better...It seems like the main reason for linking dates, is for the software to be able to identify and localize them more easily. However, many articles are overwhelmed by lots and lots of links to years, to the point that it becomes difficult to find the "real" relevant links. There are some other issues with the policy too, that I brought up on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_9d65.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia_talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)</a>.</dd>
<dd>The good thing about the fact that the software now easily can identify dates, is that it will be relatively simple to migrate to another date link policy in the future, in a highly-automated fashion.</dd>

Thanks for italicizing the list of book titles on my <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montague_Summers_be85.html" title="Montague Summers">Montague Summers</a> article. I put a note on the talk page there about why I reverted a couple of your alterations them.

<li>Actually, just a note on the Buffy thing. I don't know about the last name, but there was a movie first. "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" was a "Valley Girl" type of comedy, and it's actually quite funny. I quote it sometimes: Paul Reubens plays the vampire henchman in it, and he says of Buffy's boyfriend, "Kill it a lot." I love that line. Sorry for snooping.

<li>Oh, and Bishonen, had you heard the thing about Aphra Behn being a Rosicrucian? I heard a paper delivered on the subject, and the paper was virtually incomprehensible. Its author was speaking as if her Rosicrucianism was well known ancient scandal, but, well, it was impossible to prove. It's like proving that someone used Freemason symbolism. Since you can't know what the Freemason symbols are, how do you know they were used? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:26, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Interesting research project I had from your article <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucus_a_non_lucendo.html" title="Lucus a non lucendo">Lucus a non lucendo</a>. My <i>Cassell's</i> suggested your translation was correct but I didn't find the phrase in either of Jon Stone's books <i>Latin for the Illiterati</i> or <i>More Latin for . . .</i> I did find it in my trusty <i>Brewer's Companion</i>, however. The 15th edition (p. 655) says "An etymological contradiction. The Latin phrase was formerly used by philologists who explained words by deriving them from their opposites. It means literally 'a grove (so called) from not producing light,' from <i>lucus</i>, 'grove', and <i>lucere</i>, 'to shine,' 'to be light.' It was the Roman grammarian Honoratus Maurus (fl. late 4th century AD) who provided this famous etymology . . . " Honoratus I had trouble tracking down because, like so many Romans, he can be listed in several ways. I did learn from my <i>New Catholic Encyclopedia</i> that there are two saints named Honoratus, but tracked our man down in <i>Brittannica</i> (1974). "Servius, also known as Marius (or Maurus) Servius Honoratus," is how they list him. He did a big commenatary on <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>, "a precious source of knowledge about Roman antiquities" and my 1944 <i>Brittanica</i> calls him "the most learned man of his time." Aside from the attribution question--<i>Brewer's</i> certainly could be wrong--and some clean-up I think it's a useful addition here. I'd never seen it and will have to shoehorn it into my discourse. <i>Ave atque vale</i>! <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 14:56, Sep 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, you know how to get my attention -- making a Middle English literature article cat. :-) I didn't even look at the history to see who wrote it.

<p>Do you know anything about John Webster being an informant against Dekker and/or Jonson? I know I know it to be the case, but I can't for the life of me think of anyone who says it. I have it as hearsay, I think. From Greenblatt, maybe? Anyway, it's not important, but am I right that he informed on his friends? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:25, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, no, I don't. My, ah, <b>field</b> is the 1696-1697 season, you know. At Drury Lane. Especially the casting repercussions of actor Hildebrand Horden getting killed in a duel in May, that's my <b>specialty</b>. You got any questions about Horden, I'll be fine. ;-) Sorry. Are you writing about Webster, or about the other guys? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 12:54, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, I added something to the Webster article, and I added that he had informed. The Singing Badger, who <i>is</i> a Ren. fan, removed the informant bit &amp; asked for my source. Well, my sources are secondary, so that's no good. Horden? I've never even heard the name. I looked for what the DNB costs, by the way. It costs more than a car. I looked for used, beaten copies of the Concise DNB, and the used bookstores on Amazon are entirely clueless. They sell individual volumes of the 3 volume set as "the Concise DNB," and you can't even figure out that it's just one volume except that they say, "The book is in good shape." There are three books. The one book seller that has all three volumes wants $500, and the Concise isn't even that good for people like us. Compared to all that bother, a trip to Johns Hopkins library is cheap and easy. Anyway, it's not Webster making me wish for the old days of biking to a well stocked library -- it's everybody else. I also have discovered that the Mafia Movers who brought me to Baltimore neglected to deliver at least one box of books. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:29, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, no, I was kidding about Horden, I just wanted to mention the most minor figure I could think of there, to satirize my own shortsighted peering at these ephemera of history. I'd be flabbergasted if anybody <b>had</b> heard of Horden. (Mind you, he was a promising actor, so for all I know he might have become the next Betterton, if he <b>hadn't</b> been killed in a duel at a young age.) You're describing the very same Amazon phenomenon I was complaining about before. What's the point of offering books for sale in such a way? Who's going to buy a single volume without even knowing <b>which</b> volume? Bah. And each time, for a dizzying moment, one thinks they <b>are</b> talking about the whole set, and at such a reasonable price, too. Bah bah.</li>
<li>A whole box of books ?? Say it's not so. You're sure the box isn't, uh, somewhere? There are four unopened movers' boxes in my hall, where they form a convenient surface for putting down odds and ends on. What books are you missing, that you know of? --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 15:06, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You know, on my talk page, I didn't figure out that the title of the talk subdivision for Short View was a link to the article. When I read it, I was very impressed. Anyway, at least one box is gone. I already knew that they failed to deliver at least one table, though they delivered the legs for it. There are far, far, far too many missing books that I'm now discovering, particularly reference and particularly therefore a <i>heavy</i> box, that aren't around for it to be just my imagination. I have no unopened movers' boxes. I did a better job, when I moved in, of unpacking everything. I wonder if I can get a government grant to get a Segway scooter. That would be the perfect way to get to Hopkins to do research. I no longer have a laptop, but I still have paper and pens, and that's all I need.<br /></li>
<li>I assume you saw the invitation to work on Addison and Steele. How do I explain that journalism of the period is something you either jump into over your head or not at all.

<p>Hi Bishonen,</p>
<p>Thanks for your note on my page. Indeed, I'm no native English speaker, and just tried to follow the content of the former "dramatist" article - assuming that Wikipedia can't be wrong ;o) - only extended it a bit to theatre directors too.</p>
<p>Just two minor questions still to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the usage of the word "Dramatist" and "Playwright" as you describe it <i>identical</i> in all English-speaking countries? If that is the case I would make the "Dramatist" article a "redirect", without further commentary, to "Playwrights"...</li>
<li>In English language, can "librettists" be considered either "Dramatists" or "Playwrights", or both, or neither?</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding categorization in general: if you have particular problems or questions: just ask - not sure whether I'd be able to answer, I go only from my personal experience too, and from the three "basic" guidelines regarding categorization, i.e.:</p>

<p>Reply to additional post on my talk page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please make sure all English speaking people would experience "Dramatists" and "Playwrights" as covering the same. What I understood by now is that "Dramatist" is a <i>posh</i> term for "Playwright" in English.</li>
<li>In Dutch (my native language) a "librettist" is someone who derives a text for a musical production (Opera, etc...) from e.g. a <i>play</i>: a play is written by a playwright, while a libretto can be made by either a "composer" or the playwright him/herself (who then becomes librettist in addition to being a playwright) or a by a "third party" librettist. E.g. <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janacek.html" title="Janacek">Janacek</a> worked as well with librettos produced by the "original" playwright (such libretto is nearly <i>never</i> identical to the original play), with librettos produced by "third party" librettists, and with librettos he derived from plays (and other books) himself. If what you assume is true, then Janacek (and <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagner.html" title="Wagner">Wagner</a>, etc...) could be categorized "Playwrights" (besides "Opera composers") - does that feel right to you - for me it still feels odd?</li>
<li>Regarding clicking on a "category" at the bottom of a "category" page: what opens then <i>is</i> the <b>parent category</b> you clicked. In fact the categories in the box below on a category page are all the (direct) parent categories. For "higher-up" parent categories you keep clicking on the Categories below in the category box, for every new category that opens, till you reach a "top" category. Now that's theory: categories are still in expansion, and major hick-ups occur. See also Graph/Tree comparison on <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">wikipedia:categorization</a>.</li>

I'm thinking of putting up a call for help on the Pump or something. Though I'm sure people (e. g. Giano) have better things to do, this would probably take some reading-up. The only Vanbrugh-as-architect thing that I like is the tease couplets: Swift's "Van's genius, without thought or lecture,/Is hugely turned to architecture, and somebody elses epitaph, "Lie heavy on him, earth, for he/Laid many a heavy load on thee".

<li>You're right: Prophane. I've been using this antique Oxford Companion for material, and it always fussily provides exact titles. Whatever was en vogue in 1920 is what it uses. In general, that's not bad, but it can lead to problems with, for example, Elizabethan play titles, where they've all been modernized in editions and classrooms. I like the longer version of your article, as well as the original short version. I haven't looked at Restoration Comedy. I should probably stay out of your way on that for a while, since I'm nothing but a fan of it and certainly not a student of it. I'm good at culture around the world of, politics near, and that kind of thing, from my Gould work, but even there I'm more of an 80's and 90's person. As for Van's architecture, you'd be better off with some of those interested in Olde Englande, I think. Now that I've characterized them thus I'd better not name names, but there are people who really, really obsessively note every building. I've encountered quite a few rave reviews of his architecture, though, in art history texts. Perhaps an art history site that's popularizing would have adaptable material? I had never heard Swift's comment before (to my shame), nor the epitaph. (There are so many popular elisions of 18th c. verse that "everybody knows" that it's annoying. They most often clip a foot of the verse, for the popular mind seems to like quatrameter. Maybe that's a sign of the general IQ or something -- people can now only remember 8 syllables in a unit.

Hadal rolled it back (one minute had elapsed between attack, reversion, attack and second reversion). Ah, well. I was going to ban the user, but the IP's history shows erratic and sane stuff, meaning that it's a floating IP and probably AOL, so banning is a bad idea.

<li>The contributor means to say <b>yard</b> as in <b>shipyard</b> or <b>dockyard</b>, except referring to a small place that used to build sailboats, not ships. It's the same word in Swedish no matter the size. "Famous" would mean famous in the population of "Swedes interested in sailboats". I have vaguely heard of the Vindö boats as classic long narrow handcrafted wooden boats that sailed well.</li>

<p>Ah. There is a Norwegian patriot on the loose, editing from an IP. He is very industrious, and no matter seems to be too small, if it's Norwegian. (BTW, "Cool and Crazy" was on the cable TV last night, so I saw it again. Odd movie.) Haven't heard from you in a while (by our standards). I keep trying to e-mail you pictures, but my ISP cuts them all off. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:45, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, as you know, I wish you'd correspond via e-mail. But I've given up on that. The Wikipedia site is now so slow to load that I'm completely frustrated. For a large part of today, for me to a) go to a page, b) open the edit field, c) post a message, d) preview, e) save, has meant at least 20 or 30 minutes pure waiting time. Actually more, as I also need to keep checking that I haven't been logged out (=more loading). That's provided I don't get an error message that the whole process has crapped out. I don't know if it's the Atlantic divide or if it's the same where you are. But I'm sorry I haven't written, I would have done if I'd noticed that you replied to my "Ping" message, but I only just saw you did. See, another inconvenience of conversing via Wikipedia is that only the latest edit to a page, as it might be to your talk page, appears on my watchlist, so if there's been an earlier one higher up on the page, it's extremely easy to miss. Anyway. Good night, "Geogre". I wish you'd be George again.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 00:32, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it a pity you have chosen to revert your edits at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, I have been watching the page for some time, and could no longer bear to look at the many mistakes and errors on the Blenheim Palace section. I have played the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">Devil's advocate</a> really, as I am not a great admirer of his architectural skills, but his many talents deserve better than they are receiving at the moment on that page.

<p>Funnily enough I didn't know you and Wetman were planning a re-write until I contacted him to have a look at Blenheim this morning, (and saw your messages) as I felt I was becoming Vanbrugh's apologist rather than editor. Wetman would do a better job on the section than me as he is more detached and takes a more intellectual approach. I just like to dispel some of the myths of 'haute' architecture and make it (hopefully) more explicit to the ordinary man. I'm always nervous about editing other peoples input unless there is a gaping error.</p>
<p>Hence, I was reluctant to do the arrogant thing and rewrite so many other peoples edits; but to be frank, I wish I had started from fresh on that section as it is becoming more and more disjointed, but it is now more or less a rewrite. I don't think that section can be from EB as it had too many mistakes (Floors Castle for one) also it was too negative and badly written, and ill-informed (rather like the rest of the page!). The <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blenheim_Palace_08e6.html" title="Blenheim Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> page itself is appallingly awful too, and I might go there sometime, but at Vanbrugh I wanted to write the design of Blenheim from the architect's's point of view and explain the reasons behind that bizarre design, and put into context the famous row with the Duchess, as the page is supposed to be about Vanbrugh the person as well as his works, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> is the place to counter criticism rather than <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blenheim_Palace_08e6.html" title="Blenheim Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> - or so I think!</p>
<p>The second I have saved this message I'm going to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> to clean out all the rubbish left in that section, didinfect it if you like! - Don't give up on the page or it will stay the mess it is, Wetman will probably tweek what I have written and then be encouraged to rewrite the main architectural section - which would be the best solution. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 11:34, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may well be right, although it has been heavily edited, I don't think 'CV' was a word in 1911. I have just done a drastic thing to architecture - it's no loss as the section was in places incoherant and the dates contradicted each other, if some kind person just copy-edits it now, it will suffice untill some-one (!) who knows something avout the subject delivers the facts. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 12:31, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>NOW!!!!!!!!! will you revert your reverts? I'm not happy with the piece about the theatre at the bottom of architecture, I'm not even sure if its true, I just tidied it up, perhaps that belongs in your department. Does anybody know what happned to this theatre? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 09:09, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I'm thinking.....(sometimes a slow process) at the moment the architecture is not in chronological order, I was going to do that today (but time ran out) and check the dates and put some more in, the old ones were mostly wrong; what if, (and this is an if)you get the plays in chronological order, amd me the architecture (I'm planning a bit more on the other houses) and perhaps his relationship with <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Hawksmoor_f6c2.html" title="Nicholas Hawksmoor">Nicholas Hawksmoor</a>, then we do away with these headings, and have new ones for example '1700 - 1710' because at the moment it sounds like he stopped writing, designed a few houses and died, which is not so. I hate the Vanbrugh in London section, so what if a pub is named after him, did he have his Sunday lunch-time pint of beer there? - I doubt it!</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see the portrait of Vanbrugh has disappeared altogether - was that intentional? I don't mind if so, it was the best I could find and not brilliant, move the pictures where you like, I don't know how to, I just dumped them in and hoped for the best! - but I do think pictures help to grab peoples attention and make the whole thing readable.</p>
<p>The meeting between Vanbrugh and Duchess, I found in an old guide book to Blenheim Palace. I'll do the sources later, its mostly just stuff I have absorbed over the last few years working in England. Whatever happens we need to sort these two main sections first, then if you like the new heading idea, we can intersperse our paragraphs, though it wont be easy as he often did two thing at once - I'm not completely sold on the idea. so if you don't like it, or can see the problems that'a fine <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 17:35, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Again, I'll sort the picture out later, wish we could find a colour one though. Have to spend the day (most of it) taking ungrateful children to various sporting activities and then social occasions - Oh to be young. Not happy with architecture at all,Castle Howard, Blenheim and (to be done Seaton Delavel) need to be chonological in the same section, but individual, then a couple of lines on the rest, it has to be architectural theory and concepts though otherwise the info. belongs on each buildings own page. John Vambrugh will be a brilliant page, but its going to be a long process. Yours reads really well. London has to go! And be incorporated elsewhere!Regards <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 09:42, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It WILL be featured article even if it kills us! - Have played about with Blenheim datewise (what do you think? - we can always revert) and sorted out who appointed Vanbrugh, which I was pleased to find. Think perhaps we still need to keep seperate compartments for drama and architecture but in some sort of chronology, yours is fime mine still needs sorting but this is supposed to be a biograophy, we need some personal stuff, relationship with wife, mistress/es? children etc. I'll see what's about, I want to do abit on Seaton Delavel, as its his most architecturally pleasing house (my view). I would like to bring all the houses under 1 banner sort of sub-sub headings can that be done? Perhaps it will have to be architecture 'an intro', then three headings for the 3 hmajor houses and a conclusion with mention of the rest - I don't know. Will think!

<p>Glad you like the bolded bits, I wasn't too sure at first, it can easily be changed to '1066: ...' rather than 'In 1066'. Do call in Geogre, he's a great guy, he and I did a joint effort once before, nothing as monumental as this though. Regarding you reference to quotes: I have many (I think)witty quotations, do you think there is room for them all, One from 'Pope' mocking Vanbrugh's bridge at Blenheim: <i>The minnows, as under this vast arch they pass, murmer how like whales we look, thanks to your Grace</i> and one which made me laugh out loud, Vanbrugh's suggested siting of the collumn of Victory to commerate the site of the former Royal palace, where a King had kept his mistress, bought this reply from the Duchess:<i>If there are oblesisks to bee made of all what our Kings have done of that sort, the countrey would be stuffed with very odd things</i> Do you really think there is room for all this?

<dd>Sorry about fanciful, sometimes I run out of adjectives and type an italian one into my package to see what comes out, I've just asked my adolescent (English speaking) what he made of fanciful and he stuck his finger down his throat, enough said! I like the idea of quotes section have you heard: 'that thing called an object of great beauty, that HE hath designed......' The Duchess on the subject of a tower at Blenheim; she was better than Nancy Astor and Margot Asquith combined. Vanbrugh to the Duchess: 'If you find a house in the bridge, pray go and live in it' (these are from memory I would need to check them out for accuracy) but we could be in danger of indulging ourselves here! Yes, some twit will come along and link all the years, we will just have to risk it, I can't see why people have to do that. If some one wants to know about a year why not just type it in anyway. I still think it may look better '<b>1066:'</b> rather than '<b>In 1066'</b> The sub-subs I like the idea of, but we need more fotos etc!!!</dd>

<p>Hi Bishonen, I'm a student of art, this is a copy of an old master I have done, I'm new to Wikipedia, and have been following the convesation and brilliant work you and Giano are doing, I'd like to help so have loaded it on your Vanbrugh page - hope you like it. Best wishes <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlessandro_19a1.html" title="User:Alessandro">Alessandro</a> 21:37, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Bishonen, Gosh! Alessandro has been a great help, what a talent. Perhaps it needs moving on the page - I have altered things about a bit, and done some rather theatrical headings (change them if you like, they are only an idea) The last two sections need to be expanded, can you do a little (or lot) on effect on subsequent theatre and today etc for legacy section. I'll look up my sources, and may be do a little on Seaton Delavel the last great house built from nothing, and then, I think we are done, and someone else can come and edit to death. I don't mean to sound bossy, please do what you want with the page, I seldom take offence <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 08:38, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there is something wrong alltogether, it is taking me ages to edit too, and (I think) I'm on the other side of the globe to you!) My email page won't open so I don't know if you have seen the one I sent this morning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To recap: JV has been nominated for featured article, no-one seems to like it (apart from Wetman who kindly put it on) I have countered some of the criticism easily, someone has said there are better pictures on a google site, but they are all copyright, not like Alessandro's talented picture! The bold dates can be changed but do you want to, (we could just do 1705: rather than In !705 etc, but I don't know another way which would not result in a complete confusion of what he was ding when, with so many things happening at once. I don't know what you think, but I think as a joint effort its pretty good as it stands, any student can dip straight in and extract the information they want, which is the point, or so I thought. So lets not get despondent abpout the critics. Regards Giano</dd>

<dd>Excuse my intruding with two points:
<ol>
<li>I'm not sure which of you nowiki-ed but in any case, putting a colon immediately after the opening brackets (as Seth did above; do section edit to see his Wiki-markup) is fully effective and easier.</li>
<li>If verifying removal is urgent enough, it appears that an edit of (in your case) <a href="../../../d/r/a/Category%7EDrama_e553.html" title="Category:Drama">Category:Drama</a> forces the system to update that listing immediately instead of doing it in background in its own good time. (This is esoteric, but similarly, it appears a cat tag that is not in the markup of the article, but gets appled bcz a template transcluded in the article is changed to include the tag, will sometimes never show up until the <i>article</i> is edited again; i'm vague about whether this depends on nested templates.) Of course, even "dummy" edits (adding a blank at end of a line, e.g.) that make no visible change still clutter the history, but doing it once can do wonders for your confidence, and obviate most future need to see the result promptly.</li>

<p>BTW <i>By the way</i>, i notice now that Drama does not use the pop-culture def <i>Popular-culture definition.</i> that contrasts it with Adventure, Comedy, and Documentary, <i>Typical catgories in a video rental store, or in a film review.</i> and while the text of a Cat should be far less extensive than that of an article, IMO <i>In my opinion</i> an explicit sentence to avoid that confusion is in order, within the Cat text.</p>
<p>I also note that the descrip of WS Apoc <i>[William] Shakespeare Apocrypha</i> is unreasonable; the cat w/ <i>with</i> that descrip <i>description</i> should have something like "Apoc'l WS plays" <i>Apocryphal Shakespeare plays</i> as title, since IIRC <i>if i recall correctly</i> there are apocryphal WS poems. (I think you understand that no article on non-dramatic poetry, nor any cat that includes it, can be a child, or any descendant, of drama?) If it were me, i might rename the Cat, but also might just say in its Talk page that it should be done, bcz <i>because</i> the quick &amp; easy move tool <i>the WP command that changes the name of an article, and uses the old name as a redirect to the renamed version</i> doesn't work on Cats. (But you seem to have moved so many articles into Plays. So you'll want to know <i>since you have demonstrated willingness to do work that some would consider too long and boring</i> how...) To rename a Cat:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Cat with the new name (you do so know how),</li>
<li>Copy over the old text,</li>
<li>De-orphan it <i>slang term: give it a parent so it is no longer an "orphan" category</i> by editing in (at least one) suitable tag, of a category it can be a sub-Cat of,</li>
<li>Edit the tags in all its children (subcats and articles) to change the name there,</li>
<li>Unless there is a proper use for the old name, consult Speedy Deletion <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a12.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Speedy deletion</a></i> &amp; put it up for speedy <i>Like VfD (Votes for deletion) but immediate or same day, with no real discussion.</i></li>
</ol>
<p>(In this case, i would make WS Apoc <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Category%7EShakespeare_Apocrypha_b44a.html" title="Category:Shakespeare Apocrypha">Category:Shakespeare Apocrypha</a></i> the parent of Apoc'l WS plays <i>Category:Apocryphal Shakespeare plays</i>.)</p>
<p>Finally, if dramatic port'ls <i>portrayals</i> of JC <i>Jesus [Christ]</i> fits in Plays (or Drama for that matter), plays must include drama on film; isn't it time to get such a category turned into a sub-Cat of Plays?<br />

<p>I'm pleased by your willingness to ask, and by your obvious interest in what i also think is an important aspect of WP. I'm going to go thru (above) and insert the translations in italics, within the confusing version. BTW ("By the way"), "descendancy" is a pretty good coinage, IMO ("in my opinion"), but not at all typical English. "Descent and ancestry" would do the job well.(And "Ancestry and descent" would be still better, since that order warns the reader of the context, instead of leaving them thinking "Going downstairs and ancestry? Huh?")</p>

<p>is just another Cat tag, such as might appear in an article. Since it is on a Cat page instead, it has the effect of making the Cat it appears in a sub-Cat of Genre.</p>
<p>By the way (and even tho i don't want to even look in it for fear of being sucked into a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black hole</a>) Genre seems to me a bad Cat title almost anywhere, and definitely bad here:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm pretty sure it has to be plural. ("Drama" isn't, but my explanation of that is that "drama" means both "an instance of drama" and "all instances of drama".)</li>
<li>"Genres" could be restricted to any of a number of creative fields: literature (in the sense that restricts it to verbal works), painting, music, etc; if i recall correctly, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a> is a really opened article, and without specifying which media and so on the classification being applied to, it is no more specific than "types" or "kinds". In my opinion, someone needs to figure out what was intended and probably arrange for it to be renamed or simply eliminated once everything in it is checked to be sure they are in some other Cat.</li>

<p>My friend Bo told me that, when he was a child, he danced for Chairman Mao, and the first sentence he learned in English was the above.</p>
<p>I just read "The Shepherd's Week," by Gay. What a cool poem. There are so many neat poems not by Dryden, Swift, and Pope, you know. Anyway, this was anticipatory to writing up an entry on the poem. I'm considering an article on "the pastoral debate" of the early 18th c. It's a pretty tortured thing, but it shows up in several notable poems. Namby Pamby, Pope's references in his blastings of Philips, and Gay's Shepherd's Week are all entries in an argument about how the pastoral should be written (basically, whether you could update it, or if it always had to be Damon and Chloe, etc.).</p>

<p>I wonder how you'd feel about the sidelight that the <i>Apologie</i> is speculated to be one source of Pope's fury, that it wasn't the Shakespeare but, rather, an anecdote of Pope in a brothel that Pope hated so passionately and/or the Fielding scorn (and Hercules Vinegar swearing a warrant for Cibber's arrest on the charge of "murder of the English language")? I'm sincerely asking. Right now, the article is concise, but Cibber's role as target and focus of Tory hate was pretty extensive. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:47, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ah. I haven't read your <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Relapse_0ee6.html" title="The Relapse">The Relapse</a> yet, but I will. I've now written a "Cibber as Dunce" section into the Cibber article. It's too long and loose, though. I need to go back with the exact year and phrasing for some of the things that I referred to (the bench warrant, e.g., and just what Cibber says about saving the finest poetry of the nation by literally pulling Pope off a woman). If you have the Apology, you might look at this scandalous anecdote. You can understand why Cibber didn't think Pope would be pissed and why Pope was. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:11, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have read your <i>The Relapse</i>, and it's a great article. My writing on the "Dunce" section was awful to start with. I think I've improved the prose now. I wonder if the promised activity on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Charke_48ed.html" title="Charlotte Charke">Charlotte Charke</a> has ever taken place? I remember when I first heard about her, back in 1991, and it seemed then that all sorts of people who work on Queer Theory, gender, and "transgression" were going to be all over her like white on rice. Someone will no doubt have heard all about her and will write up the article, I'm sure, but it's not for me. On the other hand, I think I'll have to write <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Theobald_306b.html" title="Lewis Theobald">Lewis Theobald</a>, though I won't do as good a job on his editing as a Shakespearean would. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:11, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you scan images, why not make them a bit more high-res? Most scanners can handle pretty high resolutions, and I think you should scan @ at least 320 <a href="../../../d/p/i/Dpi.html" title="Dpi">dpi</a>. Low-res images don't print well, and since a print edition may be in the future for Wikipedia, I think we should strive towards large images or vector art. Future display devices may allow for a lot higher resolutions too. — <a href="../../../c/h/m/User%7EChmod007_2959.html" title="User:Chmod007">David Remahl</a> 15:20, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I see your point. I did go with low res, but I'm also a dial-up user, so I'm always one to worry over load times. <b>However,</b> I encourage you and Bishonen both to take a look at the Tale-stages image I put in there (last image in the article). I did a 200 dpi scan there (not what I do if I'm going to print, I agree), and the screen resolution on the full size version of it is exceptional. I can see details of the woodcut that I never saw before.

<dd>Just finished all the edits which I was not going to do today, I've now written all I know on the subject, I've been a bit POV at Seaton Delaval. and I think the idea about Villa Foscari is all mine, but I'm convinced of it -so there it is, its a big thing to take all the other buildings out, but I think there was too much information, most of them are demolished or changed anyway, this is simpler a progression 3 stages: start; middle; end. What do you think - be honest!</dd>

<dd>Regarding the image tags: I don't know how to apply them, I just upload and give an explanation of where I found things and hope for the best, I moved Castle Howard in JV tonight and it fell exactly where I wanted it, but that was pure luck - In a wonderful hotel room tonight with a great view of Edinburgh Castle flood-lit shame Vanbrugh did not design that, London tomorrow night and a chance to check the books - good night <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 21:37, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well........er...! Some of them don't exist anymore, I just felt they were cluttering the page up, but they were not major works just alterations, no doubt later all the locals will come in,some day, and edit all their favourite houses into the page. I think I've done all I can do now, you can decide when its finished. London (and what passes for home tonight), so I can check a few facts and dates, but I don't think I have any more contribute much more. Seaton Delaval may prove a little contravertial as ,Villa Foscari, is a new theory, its OK; but there may be an odd accusation of POV, I can always change i. I like the idea of a quote section, but a warning about the page's length is already up!

<p>Instead of playing with wikipedia, why aren't you working yourself to death like me and the rest of the world! The picture is great, I mean it, if you think its too big (just change the px, I only know how to do it in the format my pictures are in), but I think its OK as it is. I had the same problem as you logging in this morning and the whole thing was a bit slow. I reckon your plays read brilliantly, I've learn a lot, we didn't study much Vanbrugh at school by the time I arrived in England I only studied economics, girls, cigarettes and myself!. As Oscar Wilde said "Youth is wasted on the young" or was it Shaw. Any way to the point: Yes the lead has got to be extended, do you want to do it? If you do, I'll then come in and 'tweak in' a bit on the architecture. I think we need a little more on 'Marriage and the man' (not sure about that heading either) I realised this morning we had him dying without a date.</p>
<p>We also have to resolve what we are doing about the 'dates' as you know I liked them bold, but after the brief period with User:Clever-Clever I'm not so sure, the same with 'Act I' etc.</p>
<p>I have mixed feeling about JV on featured article, It would be great, I've never had a page there, have you? Nor have I taken much interest in it, I once nominated a page of some-one else's, and every one one so rude I never went there again. If they are rude about it, we shall just have to rise above it, look what that daft man said about Geogre's, but it looks like at least he Geoger will go through. I've asked Wetman to look at Seaton Delaval to see what he thinks, if I was a bit too POV, I don't normally get this in depth! but the page demands it. Will be away for a few hours afternoon, then back in L and some free time untill tomorrow. Problem is 'Adolescent' has turned up in London too, apparently school permits him hours/days (months it seems) of free time to study, which means he hugs the computer, (and we can only connect one at a time to the internet there) claiming its school work, I shall demand some money back of that school soon, he's never there!

<p>Hi, JV is yours for the evening. Just arrived home, kicked adolescent off the computer and out to find a take-away Pizza for 4 (well, we are Italian) I had not spotted Filliocht's comments, better be careful what we say! - am sure he is a charming and deligtful person. No you edit away, I've plenty to do, Adolescent seems to have been here since Monday with a friend, and we've run out of mugs and teaspoons and (Wife not me) forgot to put the dishwasher on when we left last month (very unpleasant!) phoned wife in Rome who said; why are you always so hard on him, I can't do everything, is bambino hungry! Have read book on the plane which said "Dryden's death in 1700 marked the end of an epoch in Restoration comedy" so you see I am trying to improve myself. Funnily enough I have a book on Dryden's family home Cannons Ashby a country house in Northamptonshire, should you ever want to do a page on him. Will check emails next, one of ny book has a black and white Kit-Kat of Congreve and Joseph addison (was he a writer?) if that's any use, will go to library tomorrow if time. So you edit away, I will put bleach and loo cleaner in the dishwasher and turn it on, can't think what else to do, does Wikipedia have a page on household tips? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 19:00, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I give up on the Tale. How hard is it to be scholarly? I <i>could</i> have presented the whole history of each critical debate, yes. I <i>would</i> have made an annotated bibliography. I <i>could</i> do a history of criticism on the work. The authorship debate is the silliest thing in the world. No one even talks about it. I was just being a Good Guy by talking about it, because Guthkelch and Smith talked about it. &lt;sigh&gt; I know that other 18th c. folks would say I was fair. You know it.

<p>Where you learn to do that then? Fantastico, really great. *BUT* have you seen what its done to the KB size of the page; but that need not be a problem, I've decided, the three milestones have to be drasticaly cut, they are too long, and the developing baroque theme linking them is not clear enough, so don't alter the picture size yet.</p>
<p>It may take me a couple of days though, apparently my son is on half term (I had forgotten) so he going to schoolfriends for a few days today. so at least I don't have to fight for computer, and say I am doing important business!</p>

<p>Hi, With a huge stroke of luck, a client has just phoned to say he is unable to make an appointment, so am going to give JV my undivided attention for a couple of hours, I'm at home with a cold and a bottle of whisky; but you edit if you want to. I just copy text into a folder, and then dump with an edit in the end. Don't worry about the size untill something explodes. All my photos are in that formulae as I copied it from somebody else, and don't know any other way, but some people seem to do all sorts of clever things, you can specify right and left though which is quite clever, but I like the way you have it at the moment, are there any pictures of Seaton D in your book, old prints, ths type of thing which are old so PD?</p>

<p>I have reduced the text by a few 100 words, added one extra image, sadly reduced your biggest to more modest proportions, and we have IKB to play with before our size is up to the limit. Regarding the stub pages (which are all crap) were I writing them I would bang on about their entire history, gardens, furniture, people who lived there etc; where as on JV the only information is purely connected with JV himself. See what you think anyway!</p>
<p>Filliocht has added a new heading to your new bits which are exceptional, I think we should just plough on now, and when we have all we think should be there, then take out surplus adjectives and generally tighten it up, this man is a big subject, he just can't be squeezed into a few sentences.

<p>Love the beefing up, brilliant; just a minor point of Englisch speek "undercover for the interests fostering the deposition" don't know why, it doesn't sound like the way they say things. I know your English is better than mine but......! Why have the fames returned, I thought they were great without.

<p>NO - we are not leaving it! Lets see it through we've put too much into this to walk out on it now! Must remove those frames though it was so much better without them! <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 16:24, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see we now have Castle H,BP and SD linked and mentioned at the beginning as well as intro to architecture, I'll sort it later, (I will put in use on for about 10 minutes while I do it) - I haven't a clue how to fix the photos, and am reluctant to expirement for obvious reasons. (there's a message for you on my talk page, by the way!)

<p>Hi there - thanks for the message on my talk page (as it happens, I also saw your message on <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConte_Giacomo_c61a.html" title="User talk:Conte Giacomo">User talk:Conte Giacomo</a> first and replied there too - and while typing this I see that you have seen it and posted another messsage on my talk page).</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the confusion - it is all my fault, I am afraid, through an excess of enthusiasm: I thought you had finished your edit and forgotten to remove the {{inuse}} tag as it had been marked as "inuse" for over 4 hours. Yes, four hours is rather a long time to prevent others from editing, particuarly as my edits were really just copyediting and markup rather than content (I has assumed that you were working on the content and left that alone, mainly because you are the expert and I am not).</p>
<p>I was just <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">being bold</a> and trying to fix the table layout with a &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;. I also made the images a bit bigger and added a "thumb", and a frame just comes automatically when an image is marked as a "thumb". I didn't realise that you had deliberately removed the frames. As it happens, I generally prefer the look of images with a frame.</p>
<p>Yes, I also copied the sentence to go at the top of the <b>Playwright</b> section because it seemed to be the most appropriate one to act as an intrioduction, as was suggested on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Vanbrugh_d164.html" title="Talk:John Vanbrugh">Talk: John Vanbrugh</a>. Again, not being the expert, I just duplicated something that was already there and would be factually correct, in the knowledge that the experts (you and <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Conte Giacomo</a>) would sort it out if it wasn't elegant enough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the wiki way is to see your work "edited mercilessly and redistributed at will". On the whole, it leads to better articles - everyone has something to bring to the table. However, I can understand it is a bit upsetting for you to see a stranger (me) hacking away at your carefully crafted prose, but I hope that it doesn't put you off. If you prefer, I'll go away and leave you to finish the article. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 17:25, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good morning Bishonen, I've left you an email about the finale for your thoughts. The 'see also' section seems to have an external link to Kimbolton Castle, I haven't mentioned this in the text as to list every house with a desription would be tedious for the reader, but if Kimbolton is to remain then there must be mention of the others, these are all in a mish mash of styles depending on the whim of the owner and patron, so little to do with V's architectural concepts and ideals. I think you had some plays etc. on 'see also' - Why have you removed them? If you don't want them there we might as well remove the whole section. I will put a explanation on talk pafe as to why I haven't banged on for pages about other designs. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 09:58, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

He'd done a little programmer's edit in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> today, as Chmod007, coding the dashes in the reference list. My edit line was just for taunting him by pointing out I'd removed the dashes anyway. :-) (I was following the Wikipedia house style for book references — that kind of editing is more transcendently unimportant than I can even express, but by vocational accident I know to do it and it hardly takes any time, so why not.)</dd>
<dd>Well, I think I might be more stressed with the flag than without, you know, I don't want to use it any more. I'll just use a text editor and pop in and out as fast as I can.</dd>
<dd>Edit conflicts wouldn't even matter as long as we're not editing the same section. How about we keep each other posted on this page? I'm on "Playwright" with all its headings, I'll post here when I'd like to move on. Are there any sections below that you definitely think you're done with for today? Oh, and if I try to put years on "my" headings, will you do the same for Architecture and following? Just so we can see a)if it's possible (I mean, what years did the audience taste change?) and b) how it would look?

<p>Hi Bishonen, Its amazing we have not had a disagreement in this entire project, so try the table if you like, bit I do think putting it on the headings solves the problem, and creates a table (of sorts) anyway. Does it really look that bad? A table is going to be a long column, what is going to go beside it, and have you seen the length of the page already? That sums up my feelings, but this is a joint thing, perhaps we need a third view, what does Geogre think. If you really hate the headings lets go for the table. We are NOT going to fall out over this <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConte_Giacomo_de32.html" title="User:Conte Giacomo">Giano</a> 07:49, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bish; Very well - I surrender! Geogre has a point (I suppose), have you time to sort it, I am up to my ears in work here, and then have a working dinner tonight, until anout 12, and then have to leave at 6 tomorrow morning. Not emailed you today, so you've not missed anything. I'm really quite pleased with the article, if it does get dammed at FA, we must not let it bother us, I saw your remark about argueing on Geogre's page, we are in this together, I have been called a 'vicious rottwieler with a nasty bite', so don't worry we shall survive!

<dd>The chronology looks pretty good. You know what a demon I am with 2nd Stuart politics or Augustan politics or whatever the era is called, so I'm always interested in putting in bits about the political scheme. Too bad I can't just be a Marxist critic. That would be much easier than being a marxissant critic. Anyway, I've explained a great deal more about my own suggestion for the organization. As for the FAC voters, I think the nominator matters more than one would suppose. Perhaps not. I can never tell whether I am the most hated, most loved, most ignored, or most ambivalent figure around. I seem to be all in different lights, but you should perhaps ask Waxman for the renom, since it was his nom to begin with, when you guys feel ready for it. Also, call on me when you don't care about my mucking about in the prose.

<p><i>elements cross-posted</i></p>
<p>What I meant by "perhaps we could spin it off into a sub-page for template-style transclusion, if you're worried about Wikitax page length issues", and more specifically, by "template-style transclusion", is using, in the same way that we use templates, something like {{included template}}; the content of the referenced template is 'transcluded', or automatically put in the middle of the article with the above tag. For example, {{:Main Page}} would include a copy of the Main Page in the page you put it in. "Wikitax" is just a (but perhaps not <i>the</i>) name for the set of codes that we use in the MediaWiki software, like '' and [[.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, however, I don't think that this type of hiding of the content is a particularly good idea, as there is no large single block of content that is unlikely to want to be edited much, unlike on the PM article with the list of former PMs; a better tactic would be to do the much more standard Wikipedia method, where larger sections are summarised and the bulk of the content is spun off into another page (for example, John Vanbrugh as a playwright and John Vanbrugh as an architect, or perhaps something rather better-named).</p>

<dd>Well, looking at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vanbrugh_d131.html" title="John Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, I think that you're right in that it really does need shortening, but, for example, the section on his "early life" alone could probably be easliy expanded by another few thousand words, if one felt the inclination. Part of the difficulty of being an editor is showing editorial discretion, and knowing what to cut. Thankfully, this being online, we can keep the "deleted" stuff, in another article, but if we show no judgement, eventually the article will be less useable, and so less good.</dd>

<dd>Hey, my opinions are not ill-informed!</dd>
<dd>BTW, I agree with you guys: don't shorten the article. The whole <i>point</i> of it is to be complete. You balance the needs of comprehensiveness with the duty of conciseness well, and any change would be an imbalance, in my opinion. Your article is far shorter than the general <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> entry, a bit longer than the usual <i>Encyclopedia Britanica</i> article, and does, therefore, exactly what needs doing: gives a full portrait that doesn't attempt to be all that can be said. <i>Could</i> more be added? Hell yes. All the cultural background could be thickened. <i>Should</i> anything be added? Hell no. <i>Can</i> anything be clipped? Not really, unless a whole play or building gets clipped. <i>Should</i> anything be clipped? Absolutely not. It would be better to know that you had written one of the best articles on the man around and not have an FA than to have to make that sort of concession to an arbitrary rule.</dd>

<p>" Le Vau showed a sensitivity to Italian Baroque architecture that was unusual in a French architect, and his College of Four Nations (1662; now the Institute of France) in Paris owes much to the Roman churches of Santa Maria della Pace by Pietro da Cortona and Sant'Agnese in Agone (1652–55) in the Piazza Navona by Borromini and Carlo Rainaldi" My personal view is that Vanbrugh was not influenced by Le Vau; or Versailles, with Blenheim Vanbrugh had a once in a lifetime chance to copy Versailles, he dod not, in any way. There is nothing in Vanbrugh's work which fits with the above summary of Le Vau; I think Castle Howard and Vaux le Vicomte is as far as it goes. Vanbrugh almost certainly would have seen Versailles though, any "Gentleman" could go there so long as they wore a sword!

Thanks for your message and congratulations on the Barnstar. If you list a 'high culture' article on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> it will draw less attention than the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsons.html" title="Simpsons">Simpsons</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a>, but this listing is doing pretty well.

<p>As the code had previously been set up, the table was defined as belonging to class "floatright". I suspect that this class is defined in the default (monobook) style sheet, but not in the Cologne Blue, which I am using. As a result, my browser didn't know what to do with that class, and I had a column of images at the left side, with lots of empty space on the right, followed by the text. I just explicitly added a style sheet specifying "float:right". If someone had modified their stylesheet to make class "floatright" appear somewhere other than floating at the right, my change would foil them and force this to appear where you (we) want it. However, I find it very unlikely that someone would have done this. The long-term solution for Wikipedia would be to have someone add the "floatright" class to the Cologne Blue skin. I'll mention that on Village Pump or on meta. <a href="../../../m/p/o/User%7EMpolo_8b72.html" title="User:Mpolo">Mpolo</a> 09:18, Nov 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the Prose Rose is a great idea, actually, and it was well timed. Since I was making articles, yesterday (in guilt about doing nothing else), I finally remembered that I needed to put up any information from them to the "Did You Know" immediately, so I did. I did a "DYK: Thomas Middleton's A Game at Chess caused such a scandal that it was closed down after nine performances and the actors and author were put on trial?" Something like that. That <i>Dunciad</i> is going to take a while. I really need to buckle down to it, though. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:26, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

Well, now I hit Save, but I don't really expect this message to reach you, I haven't been able to save any edits all day :-(. I asked about it on IRC, and apparently it's just me, everybody else was editing along as happy as clams. I wish I knew what that's about. It seems to <b>especially</b> affect any edits I make at the Wycherley article (you know which one, I don't even want to name it here).

<dd>Kindly do not vandalise my user page, with your false modesty!!! Had a quick look at the poll page, looks like its Oscar Wilde, can't bear the man, - biggest social climber since Cinderella, and always a bit too pleased with himself for my liking - got what he deserved; as that daft boy he towed around, he was avery nasty piece of work indeed, (somebody a wrote a book about him - I read the review-which was quite enough to put me off the pair of then for life) I don't like the look of the others enough to want to work on them, Henry James was alright I suppose (did he write the 'Golden Bowl'?) I will keep looking though, they may have Enid Blyton some day, that's about my level of literature! - I don't think Hawksmoor was quite what Filliocht had in mind anyway! <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 08:42, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the FAC for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dee_d7cc.html" title="John Dee">John Dee</a>, I swore to myself that I wouldn't say anything about Lord Emsworth's objection about the American spellings. I was just checking your contributions, saw that you'd breached the subject, and then, despite myself, said something. The biggest thing is that Emsworth asking him to change to British spellings means that he might miss one or two and thereby actually violate the manual of style by being inconsistent, as opposed to not violating the manual of style by adhering only to American forms. Grrr. It was after Emsworth's comment about proper Commonwealth English that I began looking at his contributions for any more stiff ruff stuff. He works in the 18th c., but always on characters that my principles object to somewhat. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:31, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, this is getting really confusing. When I uploaded the image a second time, _both_ my revisions appeared at the same time. And this cannot be a case of client-side caching, since I looked in the emulator (which had previously not loaded the page). I've come to the conclusion that it must be MediaWiki that had cached the images. I've verified that it now works in IE4 (yeah, I use an old OS in the emulator), even though it took three Refreshes before it realized that �I had uploaded the new image...Hm. Anyway, as I replace the other corrupt image on the page, they too should start working, eventually.

<dd>Re: Photoshop...Does 5.5 have a "Save for Web..." feature? In that case I suggest you use that one instead of the normal "Save as" to save PNGs.

I'll try it through the Wipedia e-mail in a minute, not that there was anything much in it besides telling you Photoshop 5.5. I actually don't use "Save as", I use... hmmm.. "Save copy". "Save as" only lets me save in Photoshop's own format. But there is indeed a "Save for web" feature, I'll try that, thanks for the tip. I'd really rather not use Photoshop at all, in any version.

<p>I uploaded a new, fixed, version of the rose now. The cache may remain for a few hours / days, though. By the way, I think that claiming fair use for the "brilliant prose rose" is stretching the definition a bit...The criteria for fair use are (from memory):</p>

<p>The reason that only the framed images show the problem is that when MediaWiki scales thumbs, it basically performs the same cleansing of the images that �I perform, removing the gamma information and other things that cause problems.

<dd>My Preview can't. I thought it might come to this: you're telling me to get Panther, aren't you? I so much more like the way Jaguar looks, though. (Looks even better with the cool skin I've got on it.) Panther, to me, looks corporate and horrible. That's not to insult anybody who likes it. I'm kind of hoping for the Tiger, or whatever it's going to be. Thanks for the link, but I think the resident nerd tried it, and the whole custom thing, but he just ended up shaking his head. He's not a mac specialist like you, but he's a pretty good programmer. I was encouraged to hear you say the Photoshop Save for web feature is like an app within the app, I'll try it next time.--[[User:Bishonen|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">(Talk)</a>]] 21:51, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>JPEGs _are_ generally better suited for photographs, resulting in small file sizes and adequate quality. However, it is important to keep track of the unchanged original.

The whole article is far to long and wants breaking up into at leat 40 smaller pages; and there's far too much talk aboput sex; some of us have forgotten what that's all about, and don't need reminding - Thank you very much! Also are half those images necessary - I think not. Yours sincerely Mrs di Dracula of Alabama</p>

<li>Mine is Mozilla on MacOSX, and it looks OK on my screen now also, after I added the missing bullet (the first one on the list), but I think with bullets it's probably a bit fortuitous whether a particular user sees huge white spaces or not, as a matter of font size rather than browser. The text will go down the page below the image in line with where the bullet that it's "following" happens to be: it may be at the left margin as is proper, or it may be near the middle of the page, forcing the text into a narrow column surrounded by white wastes below the images (this is how the page looked on my screen before I made the tiny change). I'm explaining it badly, but my upshot is that I think images had better be attached to an ordinary prose paragraph, without bullets.--[[User:Bishonen|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">(Talk)</a>]] 01:55, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was just researching the Variorum tonight. I plan to re-read it tomorrow and then start back on my favorite, the 4 book version, where Cibber is the hero, later. I think some of the specific charges made against him by Pope would be proper, but I could see FAC voters not liking them for thinking that they're a distraction. It's hard to emphasize to anyone coming at him cold just how little remembered he is own aside from the Dunciad. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:21, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>More in there now. I was surprised to see him attacked in the Variorum, but there he was. The Variorum goes further in its notes by quoting Jacob Tonson's <i>Lives of the Dramatic Poets.</i> I don't know if you want it in, but it's this:
<dl>
<dd>"Mr. <i>Colly Cibber,</i> an Author and Actor; of a good share of wit, and <i>uncommon vivacity,</i> which are much improved by the <i>coversation</i> he enjoys, which is of the <i>best.</i> JACOB <i>Lives</i> of Dram. Poets. p. 8. Besides 2 Volumes of Plays in 4, he has made up and translated several others. Mr. <i>Jacob</i> omitted to remark, that he is particularly admirable in Tragedy."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Pope's getting an extra dig in there with the tragedy bit, so that suggests a real desire to wound before '38. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:57, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aha, left-legg'd Jacob, the notable whig? "As when a dab-chick waddles through the copse/ On feet and wings, and flies, and wades, and hops: / So labouring on, with shoulders, hands, and head,/ Wide as a wind-mill all his figure spread,/ With arms expanded Bernard rows his state,/ And left-legg'd Jacob seems to emulate." <i>Dunciad</i>(1728), book 2. I just happened to know that by heart, naturally. Actually, I was looking for Tonson in Gutenberg, but he's always hard to find, with being all over the place in his character of publisher ("Printed for Jacob Tonson"). Van's best bud. But who was Bernard? --[[User:Bishonen|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">(talk)</a>]] 21:29, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So Bernard is Bernard Lintot, who had been Theobald's publisher and the publisher of several of the attacks on Pope after the 1728. Pope's note that accompanies the passage is a full page, so I'll wait for my trawling of Book II tomorrow to give particulars of why else he hated Lintot. There is a full-length book on Jacob Tonson that I've got, but I couldn't be persuaded to read it. I snagged it at a used book store, since it had belonged to one of my professors before he died. I think it's called <i>Jacob Tonson: Book-seller of the Kit-Kats.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:40, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure he won't like the bit I just added, from John Dennis: "There is a notorious idiot . . . who from an under-spur-leather to the Law, is become an under-strapper to the Play-house, who has lately burlesqu'd the Metamorphoses of <i>Ovid</i> by a vile Translation." Damn. I really wanted to get in a bit in the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunciad.html" title="Dunciad">Dunciad</a> about the really scary line: "Dunce the second rules like dunce the first" and the fact that Pope (in a note to 2 lines earlier) says that a copy of the poem had been presented to George II by Robert Walpole. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 05:56, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, there is far more than enough material on Cibber in Dunciad (or will be when I go through the 1738 4 Book Dunciad) to swamp the biography. If I add all of the relevant-to-Pope stuff, it'll run to enormous length. If I add the relevant-to-Cibber's-reputation, it will still be as long as the biography. Either trimming will have to take place (it will anyway) or the article will need a somewhat controversial structure. It's possible to present it almost as a parallel biography, stated explicitly in the "Dunce" section. Also, the way that I'm going about the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunciad.html" title="Dunciad">Dunciad</a> article right now is to be indiscriminate and prolix at first and then chop down in retrospect (retrospect being a week or two from now, when I'm in south Georgia and have perspective), figuring that I can only add stuff when it's fresh, but I can weed stuff out any time. I'm going to write an experimental opening to the "Dunce" section today. See what you think.</p>
<p>Finally, it would probably be good to have a narrative section after the "Dunce" section -- a "literary significance" or "impact of the life" or something -- so that the reader isn't left with a bad taste nor left with Pope getting the last word. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:15, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, the problem is that The Man and the Dunce are both dumbasses. I mean, "his work is slowly gaining a fresh reassessment by scholars", like you wrote before, was very beautiful and considerate, but, well, any time I reassess him, he looks just the same. His smarts were all street smarts. He never stops looking like a really bad writer. Also looking like a really bad actor, every time he insists on playing serious roles. It does leave a bad taste, the way everybody treats that ambition (surely a harmless one) as fair game. There's a collection of Augustan commentary on his performance of Richard in his "own" <i>Richard III</i> in the <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>: "When he makes love to Lady Anne, he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more design on her purse than on her heart" (<i>Grub Street Journal</i>, 1734). He played Richard with "the distorted heavings of an unjointed caterpillar" (Aaron Hill, 1734). "He screamed through four acts withour dignity or decency" (<i>The Laureat</i>, 1740). Everyone's a funny guy. Even the <i>Bibliographical Dictionary</i> itself takes un-encyclopedic pokes at his plays: "His next play was <i>Xerxes</i>, a work in which Christopher Rich sensibly expressed no interest". The <i>Dictionary'</i>s whole take is that every success Cibber ever had was due to his major trait of opportunism, especially his business success. Well, it's true, I guess. The way he sucked up to Christopher Rich and got himself made "advisor" and then "sharer" is disgusting, one has to agree. There are plenty of digs at it in documents from the relevant time, 1702—04, so scoffing at Cibber is no invention of Pope's. No actor colleague he ever had seems to have liked or tolerated him.--[[User:Bishonen|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">(talk)</a>]] 17:45, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok. At the same time, he must have been ingratiating. We have Tonson saying that he benefits from the conversation of others, which is the best. We know that he was an intimate of Pope's and the other Scriblerians, at least enough to have pulled Pope off a prostitute, when he was about to committ "without armor." He had to have been a lively speaker and a good wheedler to have even been <i>able</i> to suck up to Rich. After all, Rich would have had a lot of folks sucking up to him. Furthermore, for him to have managed the difficult egos of Betterton and Barry (whom Gould pissed off) would take some work.</p>
<p>What I was getting at, though, is that if you give me free reign, I'm afraid that I'm going to put in too much. E-mail me, if you want some resections. I'm concerned that you and I will know that what I'm doing is fair but that eventual FAC voters will be puzzled, and casual readers (who haven't read <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunciad.html" title="Dunciad">Dunciad</a> or <i>Dunciad</i>) will wonder why more than half the article is dedicated to showing what a pipsqueak he was. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:52, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gee, if getting pissed off by Gould is a criterion of a difficult ego, there must have been a lot of difficult egos about. Betterton was a pretty diplomatic and easy-going guy, I think. (I don't have much sense of what Barry or Bracegirdle were like.) But never mind about that, our Kålly was indeed an excellent wheedler and handled Rich very well. Rich always preferred to think he could just order people about, and C did a job on him, combining wheedling with implicit threats of removing his valuable contributions, actually removing himself bodily over to Betterton &amp; Barry at one point, purely in order to put pressure on Rich to appreciate him more. But C's problem was always with his peers being pissed off by him wheedling superiors. He recalls quite cheerfully in the <i>Apology</i> that all the other kids hated him at school because he was such a suckup! He seems to regard it as some sort of interesting fact that he's a suckup, he has no thought of denying it, it's just the way he happens to be, and other people just happen to not like it, all very interesting, none of it a problem. 'Strordinary. <b>Me</b> give you free rein? Don't be silly, now, the rein's so free it's dragging on the ground. (As for the reign, let's be co-monarchs! I'm <b>not</b> cricizing your spelling, I know they're both used!) I agree that it's better to put lots of stuff in and then cut back later, that's why I've put some imbecilic stuff into the other half of Kåli as it's occurred to me. But if you're worried about the article not being appropriate for readers or other editors in the meantime, do you think it might be more comfortable to keep it in a user subpage for a while? I have various WIP pages already. (Please don't think I mean to interfere with your methods, but that could also be a possibility for the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunciad.html" title="Dunciad">Dunciad</a>, if you'd like it to be.) But just like you, I'm a bit worried about the whole being incoherent. We couldn't FAC it without more of a master plan, I guess. Anyway, you're needed at the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunciad.html" title="Dunciad">Dunciad</a>, I absolutely don't want to distract you from that. Focus, Geogre! You do know that <i>The Dunciad</i> is gold and Kålli is lead, right?

<p>Gould pissed off Barry more than Betterton, apparently, and it had to do, again apparently, with not being enough of a butt kisser, though we only have a partial version of Gould's side of that. The impression I get is that in person Gould was shockingly polite, so no telling what it was about. Betterton forgave Gould. Barry didn't. Again, forgave him for whatever it was.<br />
As for Cibber and Dunciad, you have the materials for a biography of the man, and I'll have some excruciating detail on his literary reputation. The trick will be to add no more than one paragraph from the Four Book and then get out. As for <i>Dunciad,</i> I'll go ahead and draft in public. It's not like the page has gotten even one visitor since I began it (well, the people who wander by to put on templates and categories hit it), so if it has a few tumors at present, they can be lopped off later. The only criticism I got on the <i>Tale</i> article was that there wasn't any flavor for the contents. I may give too much flavor for <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunciad.html" title="Dunciad">Dunciad</a>, but I can do something about that after the fact. (Besides, if the goof troop can't help but write articles about single jokes from their favorite TV shows, then how can I cut the hilarious bookseller race in Book II?) It may not be an FA when I'm done, but I don't mind accidentally giving people some of the finest satirical verse in history. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:32, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words. I hope it will be OK when finished. Some passing editor linked poetic and diction in that way people have of linking every noun regardless. I may create a poetic diction stub later today, if time allows.</p>
<p>You're quite right about the Lyrical Ballads: I suppose the idea was that Swinbourne, for example, had drifted somewhat from the purity of that position. But Pound learned a lot from Browning and Bunting loved Wordsworth, for example.

<p>Culture of Italy sure needs something. I'm not really sure about these 'Culture of..' pages I think the individual art and drama pages fullfil the need quite well as it is.

These were subrational figurings, though, since the first thing I did was overwrite that same Romantic myth, it's not there any more. Anyway, please replace D with someone better, or see him as a placeholder and avert your eyes—the painter must have really hated him—I'm thinking of maybe Coleridge or Carlyle. Got any ideas? (What I'd <b>really</b> like is an outtake from the happy-ending <i>King Lear</i>, showing Edgar and Cordelia getting married or something, but can't find one.) Oh, hey, PR<small>IIS</small>, the first sentences, about the Renaissance, are kind of archeological remains, it would be great if you'd replace them with something to the point.

<p>As for the Johnson, the wedding reinactment just seems goofy to me--that article still needs work, but lots of people have things to say about the Great Cham, so I'm afraid it will always be in flux. A Boswell shot is not a bad idea, though. As for Dryden, maybe the problem is the article just needs more pictures, like a title-page from a quarto of Hamlet or the First Folio or something to balance things out more. I'm no expert on Shakespeare, but I thought about what you asked about the reputation, and I'm adding a couple sentences. I'm sure I'm missing something, though. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRiis_d9fa.html" title="User:PRiis">PR<small>IIS</small></a> 15:30, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hear the words of Pope: <i>Dunciad Variorum</i> 1732:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A matchless youth: His nod these worlds controuls,</dd>
<dd>Wings the red lightning, and the thunder rolls.</dd>
<dd>Angel of Dulness, sent to scatter round</dd>
<dd>Her magic charms o'er all unclassic ground:</dd>
<dd>Yon stars, yon suns, he rears at pleasure higher,</dd>
<dd>Illumes their light, and sets their flames on fire.</dd>
<dd>Immortal <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rich_%28producer%29_12a7.html" title="John Rich (producer)">Rich</a>! how calm he sits at ease</dd>
<dd>Mid snows of paper, and fierce hail of pease;</dd>
<dd>And proud his mistress' orders to perform,</dd>
<dd>Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm.
<dl>
<dd>But lo! to dark encounter in mid air</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>New wizards rise: Here Booth, and Cibber there:</dd>
<dd>Booth in his cloudy tabernackle shrin'd,</dd>
<dd>On grinning dragons Cibber mounts the wind:</dd>
<dd>Dire is the conflict, dismal is the din,</dd>
<dd>Here shouts all Drury, there all Lincoln's-Inn;</dd>
<dd>Contending Theatres our empire raise,</dd>
<dd>Alike their labours, and alike their praise." (III 250-268)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Booth was one of the other patentees of Drury Lane. Cibber had done a show where he made a pantomime with a dragon, which he rode. Rich you know about. Further, Pope records a particularly offensive play called <i>Dr. Faustus,</i> which was performed by both houses, earlier. He says that they contended with each other to produce big effects: dragons, 10-horned fiends, giants, Hell rising, Heaven on earth, and a huge fire (and, of course, Tibbald had written fires into his plays). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:44, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
By the way, Pope also attacks <i>Theophilus</i> Cibber as an impertinent dunce. I had completely missed that in my previous readings, and this is in 1727-8. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:56, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow! What was that movie with Robert Redford, where he was a millionaire who'd pay to sleep with some dude's wife? Theo was just getting a jump on it, I guess. I tried to gracefully merge in the single line from <i>Dunciad</i> into that article. You can remove it or move it, if you please. It's just that it seems like being mentioned in the poem is not trivial -- though it doesn't hold a candle to the blackmail sex story. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:43, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>That section is new today, eh? I didn't know. I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for him in the 4 book <i>Dunciad,</i> since the first of those things happened between the publication of <i>Variorum</i> and the 4th book, and between the change of kings from Tibbald to Cibber. (In the <i>Variorum,</i> by the way, there is a reference to homosexuality, which surprised me a little. As with Cleland's <i>Fanny Hill,</i> it's spoken of as something that won't be spoken of.) It sounds like Theo is ripe for a modern, salacious biography. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:02, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, from <i>Dunciad B</i> (1743), note to I 134:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Ben Johnson (sic) honestly wished he had blotted a thousand (lines); and Shakespear would certainly have wished the same, if he had lived to see those alterations in his works, which, not the Actors only (and especially the daring Hero of this poem) have made on the <i>Stage,</i> but the presumptuous Critics of our days in their <i>Editions.</i></dd>

<p>On another matter, of Colley, a note to line 2: Colley has "a <i>Son</i> so exactly like him, in his poetical, theatrical, political, and moral Capacities."

<p>You were talking to me about the wig in a sedan chair. Here's your source:</p>
<p>"The first visible cause of the passion of the Town for our Hero, was a fair flaxen full bottom’d Periwig, which, he tells us, he wore in his first play of the <i>Fool in fashion</i> (1696). It attracted, in a particular manner, the Friendship of Col. Brett, who wanted to purchase it. ‘Whatever contempt (says he) Philosophers may have for a fine Periwig, my friend, who was not to despise the world but to live in it, knew very well that so material an article of dress upon the head of a man of sense, if it became him, could never fail of drawing to him a more partial Regard and Benevolence, than could possibly be hoped for in an ill-made one. This perhaps, may soften the grave censusre which so youthful a purchase might otherwise have laid upon him. In a word, he made his attack upon this Periwig, as your young fellows generally do upon a lady of pleasure, first by a few familiar praises of her person, and then a civil enquiry into the price of it; and we finished our bargain that night over a bottle.’ See Life, octavo p. 303. This remarkable Periwig usually made its entrance upon the stage in a sedan, brought in by two chairmen, with infinite approbation of the audience." <i>Dunciad B</i>, Note, line 167.</p>
<p>I don't know <i>Fool in fashion</i> of 1696, but that's probably the source of the anecdote. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:15, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure is, thanks very much. The play is <i>Love's Last Shift</i>, Kålli liked to talk about it under this unofficial title that refers to the part <b>he</b> played, fancy that, who'd have thought it. So should I refer to the John Butt or the Aubrey Williams ed?--[[User:Bishonen|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">(talk)</a>]] 19:10, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I got it from the Butt, but it's just a note <i>by</i> Pope, so the citation is to him, any edition you prefer, of the 1743 <i>Dunciad,</i> note to book I, line 167.</p>
<p>More: From another note by Pope, this time to line I. 228: '"It may be observable, that my muse and my spouse were equally prolific; that the one was seldom the mother of a Child, but in the same year the other made me the father of a Play. I think we had a dozen of each sort between us; of both which kinds some <i>died</i> in their <i>Infancy,</i> &amp;c. Life of C. C. p. 217. 8vo edit."' Now there's some filial love for you. Also from the notes, I find that Cibber was meant to take orders by his father. Granted, Pope selects only passages that show CC in a bad light, but things like this show him in a <i>very</i> bad light. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:22, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah. That's not Pope talking, he's quoting the Apology (as in most of the <i>Dunciad</i> periwig passage, just not in the actual mention of the sedan chair).

<p>Right: I messed up the quotation marks above. Also, right after I wrote it I noticed that you had put the information in already, so I had nothing to add. Ok, I've been back to the CC article. In the "Later attacks" section, I saw where the first stuff I'd put in, about the prostitute anecdote, had been kind of REMmed out. That's fine. However, I figured a way to make it fit a bit better. I expanded on the theme of "why the <i>Apology</i> offended people" by giving the "died in their infancy" thing I quoted above as an illustration (and an apt one, since Pope picks it out, thereby ensuring that people who read either Pope or Cibber would hit it) and abbreviated the prostitute thing and put in the boast of having a "whore" at 80. You can cut stuff out if you like. I'm putting in rather too much to begin with. I do think, though, that some discussion of the offensiveness of the <i>Apology</i> in its own right would be a good thing for the Later Attacks section. Since I'm not going to read the Apology any time soon, I'll let Pope pick out the abuses for me. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:45, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would have been perfectly fine to remove it altogether, as it wasn't well documented, but I wasn't complaining in any case. Also, I didn't know that I'd put it in twice. Since I'd been adding to the CC article haphazardly, I've no doubt that I lost track of the whole. Like I said, it was totally fine. If it's in twice, I probably need to scale back the first ref and leave the second so that there can be a "what was it about the Apology that set people off," or make the second only an allusion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:38, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Went through the S. Rep. just with minor grammar. However, I did insert one new thing. I had written that the sexual slang and puns were back in to stay. Well, that wasn't quite true, and I knew it. The Family Shakespeare and Shakespeare for Children were out there on the horizon. Neither of them quite <i>removed</i> this stuff as an avowed "edition of Shakespeare": Both said quite clearly that they were altered editions in their titles and didn't try to fool anyone into thinking that what they were doing was Shakespeare. However, I thought that a reader might well know about Bowdler and have a question raised in her mind, so I put in the "(with a few <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bowdler_f95a.html" title="Thomas Bowdler">exceptions</a>)" in there.

I'm not sure that all of "Cibber as Dunce" works with a good flow or that it doesn't show the fact that it was added in sections weeks apart, but Cibber is pretty much out of the <i>Dunciad</i> now, so I don't anticipate running across more to say about Pope's attack on him than I've already put in.

<p>Hi Bishonen, just a note to say thanks for your note on my Talk page and sorry for not responding sooner, but I've been swamped. I'm interested in what you wrote about the rhythm of paragraphs, and the need for a mix of different lengths. I'm about to start preparing a second article for a featured article nomination, and I'd like to get it right this time, so any more views or information about paragraphs lengths would be appreciated. I won't nominate the second one until Bernard Williams is dealt with, because I read the note about not submitting more than one per person.</p>
<p>I found the nomination process extremely helpful, by the way. It has served to focus my mind on what makes a good, as opposed to an adequate, article; and I now find myself going around inserting comments on Talk pages about the need for references.  :-) Seriously, there is nowhere near enough referencing in Wikipedia. We could be making most of it up for all the readers know.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever considered establishing a permanent group of Featured Article judges, who would judge all nominations? I was wondering because I noticed that Special Relativity has been nominated. Two of the objectors (who referred the article for peer review) were anonymous IP addresses, one of them single-use. It seems wrong that a Featured Article can be judged by people with no expertise and no editing history. It would be great to have an established group consisting of, say, a physicist, biologist, chemist, economist, historian, critical thinker/philosopher, writer etc. I know that Maurreen has been involved in the encyclopedic standards debate, and specifically Wikipedia 1.0. I felt that, rather than set up a new editing structure, the existing Featured Article structure could be strengthened, and more editors could be encouraged to raise their articles to that standard. I don't know whether you have any thoughts about that. Anyway, it was nice dealing with you over dear Bernard, and thanks again for the improvements you made. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 19:33, Dec 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Were you the one to add the bit about the Prose Edda? I've got to ask, because I've read the thing a couple of times, and, unless I have an abridged version, I honestly don't remember any poetics in it at all. (Shelley in Prometheus Unbound, but it's poetic diction in a different sense. He pushes elevated diction that's laden with terms from philosophy and esoteric sciences. It's not antique, but it's definitely elevated, but elevated like Milton -- highly Latinate and very unusual. Fine to have it out, but I was trying to get at the way that wispy language crept back into Romantic poetry. Not in Byron. I also think WW's dialect is precious, but that's another matter.) Anyway, I want someone to reassure me that the bit about the Prose Edda is accurate. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:58, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, that was me. I read it on the Internet, so it's gotta be true! No, seriously, I have no idea. I was going by <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/1086.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/1086.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, also somewhat by Wiki article <a href="../../../y/o/u/Younger_Edda_7767.html" title="Younger Edda">Younger Edda</a>. Do change it, or remove it, if you've actually read the thing and it's not about poetic diction. At the same time, I suppose, if you did have an abridged version, it's only too likely that it would keep the examples, as interesting, and cut the actual poetics, as boring.

<p>You should see the latest on <b>my</b> talk page. <a href="../../../w/d/-/User%7EWD-40_a435.html" title="User:WD-40">User:WD-40</a> thinks that I "banned his school." I've banned two vandals for 24 hours, as is appropriate, and I can just imagine one chin-drooling kid after another using the same computer lab, and therefore the same IP. The <i>Prose Edda</i> I've got doesn't claim to be abridged (U. Cal. P.). It contains the Fooling of Gylfe and the tales of Thor and Utgard Loki. The beginning is an explanation of myth, but there's no poetics in it. That might be the case in <i>The Younger Edda,</i> but not the <i>Prose Edda,</i> that I know of (if they're different). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:02, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Interesting. I've gone to the links you used. I guess I was reading an abridgement (and it's the same Press as the link you have, but the cover is much different...which doesn't mean anything). There were references in it to the <i>Hattal,</i> but the <i>Hattal</i> wasn't included, so I must have had an abridgement. All I can say is that Snorri talks about how myth was developed, and he quotes from the older edda, but he nowhere explains prosody or poetics in what I have. I might modify, slightly or expand, what you have in the <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetic_diction.html" title="Poetic diction">poetic diction</a> article just to indicate kennings and gnomic verse as part of p.d. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:07, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I put Snorri in a sort of Germanic languages pdiddy, which seems natural in the prehistory section. I also started up some references. I don't know if it's worth putting in Milton from the big black book of Milton, or Wordsworth, etc., but I had mentioned Fussell, and he's not all over the place, so I figured it would be right to list the book in question. Once I did that, I tossed in some others. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:59, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Itsy-bitsy correction and one change to the Snorri last sentence. Great expansion to it -- makes sense. I just wanted to weasel-word the last sentence a little. In the introduction to <i>Prose Edda</i> he speaks pretty derisively of the pagan literature, but he is worried that no one will be able to <i>read</i> it. I don't think he's against it, but I think he's probably kind of "conflicted" (ick) about it, so I just wanted to weaken the conclusion slightly. Feel free to change it back, if you'd like. I also did a teeny bit more for the 18th c. I wish I knew which Spectators talk about it so that I could quote or refer to the issue numbers. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:30, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding the problem of finding criticism, I've written to everyone I can think of so I'll wait a few more days for replies. I've written to Bruce Alexander too, author of the experiment, but he hasn't replied, which I suppose is not surprising, because I'm basically asking him tell me all the bad stuff about his own methodology. If I don't find published criticism, I'll do as you suggest and will try to summarize the standard view, perhaps using Nestler and Malenka, and will mention changes in brains seen in scans and when addicted rats are dissected. I'll also take on board your point about reductionism and will try to define it in an NPOV way.

<dd>Regarding photographs, I agree with you completely about the National Parks article which cries out for great illustrations. I wonder whether, apart from the issue of screen size, some editors equate "encyclopedic" with "boring." Anything dull, dry, facts only, no pics, no opinions, no life, no good writing is, for them, encyclopedic, and nothing else can fit that definition. I accept that it's a challenge to write an interesting, lively article and still make sure it's NPOV, but it's not impossible and it should be the aim, in my view, of Wikipedia. I feel we can't (and shouldn't want to) become a free version of the Encylopedia Britannica, which can be deadly dull, often quite unhelpful, and surprisingly error-prone. Anyway, I doth protesteth too much, perhaps. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 21:41, Dec 15, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetic_diction.html" title="Poetic diction">Poetic diction</a> a question: <i>Preface to Lyrical Ballads</i> 1802? Several places, the article text says that WW challenged p.d. in 1802, and yet it says "<i>Second edition of Lyrical Ballads in 1798.</i>" Was there a revision to the "Preface" in 1802? I always learned it as 1798, but this may be one of those obvious facts that I just don't know. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:51, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 1798 ed only had a brief Advertisement, just with something like "some may find these productions too 'low'", then there was an 1800 ed which had a real preface, but the 1802 ed has substantial and relevant prefatorial additions and is the one usually quoted, and the one I need to quote. (So 1802 is right, but the 1802 is the <b>third</b> edition, not the second, I didn't know about the 1800 ed.) It had important additions inside the Preface <b>plus</b> an appendix specifically on poetic diction. I was trying to say in the Lead that <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> itself was published in 1798—it's the famous year, gotta say it somewhere—not that the second edition was in 1798, but I see that's what it came out looking like, I'll change it.

<dd>I'm glad you like the idea. It's certainly possible for style sheets to control the size of elements on the page (I have seen numerous other sites with such switches).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm thinking about how to propose this idea in a way that will garner enough support to overcome the objections that will surely come up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will put yet another proposal together for the Software polls section, but someone with some "juice" around here will have to be convinced of the merits of this idea, before it makes sense to post the proposal. I've encountered a number of good Administrators who constantly point out that many people are working to improve the workings of Wikipedia, but this project is so big, that the ratio of naysayers to agents of change makes any improvements proceed at a glacial pace.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, there is a smaller project called Wikinews that seems to be much more open to actively changing and improving itself, so let me see if I have better luck over there first. If we can show style sheets with an element size selector working on Wikinews first, it will be more difficult for any of the naysayers over on this project to block the same feature on Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>I've been trying to get the "Christmas" article up to speed for a re-nom in time for this year's holiday. I thought the stuff in question was interesting, and fwiw well-written, but too "out there" for an encyclopedia article about Christmas. I guess I'm more of a technical than a creative writer. I see now what you meant re my deleting what made it clever ... the parallellism where you had repeated for effect that phrase with "traditionally" in it ... but without the context of some threat of food poisoning ... which context no one I asked understood ... it seemed over the top for this article. Last month, when I was eagerly buffing up "Bicycle" for FAC, one guy (who eventually pretty much torpedoed the whole thing with (frivolous) objections deleted a misunderstood sentence of mine. I had obliquely criticizing my fellow-Americans for buying inappropriately sporty bicycles for everyday use, and referred in contrast to the "less style-conscious" Europeans, who purchase sensible utility cycles for doing errands and biking around campus. This Brit thought I was dissing his taste, and erased what he called this "wisecrack". I let it slide, since this fellow had not seemed to be one with whom you could deal rationally.

<p>good changes on "Christmas", as opposed to some other guy who is now making unhelpful, but not as of yet destructive, changes. most of those references and virtually all the ext. links, were others'. I was going to "footnote" all of that last section on "theories on the date ...", and backed off because: 1) none of it was mine; 2) some of it had required a lot of research; and 3) i'd have been stuck with trying to figure out what to do with a footnote within a footnote.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 19:23, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>No problem, after all, comments on FAC are not final, and you can always edit them if the article, or your opinion of it, changes. I have developed a 'radar' to some extent to these 'pagan pov' things, because the pagan related articles are positively riddled with them. usually they are not too bad, just slightly suggestive, but a Featured Article of course would require a thorough screening. Most of the time it's along the lines of "the fanatical Christians came and destroyed the beautiful aboriginal intact pagan culture", while in reality, of course, it was almost never so clear-cut. There are quite a few of these left in this article, e.g. the suggestion that Iceland was bullied into becoming Christian. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 17:21, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<hr />
<p> <br />
I've fixed the accidently doubling of the Bibliography which you informed me of. As to the article in general, it seems to me to have a number of gross errors and dubious statements. For example, what text actually states where Asgard was located, outside of the eumheristic locatation in Turkey by Snorri or the identification with Constantinople in Saxo? And a few sentences later, though Asgard, was previously located at the center of the earth disk, we are told that Midgard lies between Asgard and Niflheim, in apparent contradiction. I think the only sources locating Niflheim at all, locate it in the north. We have a statement about the dualism between Jotüns and gods and a later statement that Norse religion had no clear-cut dualism. The identification of Honir with Vili and Ve with Lodur is very dubious. (That one god replaces another in the same story does not necessarily make them identical, for example the Greek Prometheus, Hephaistos, and Typhon are not identical, though they share traits and story motifs.) The statement that Skuld describes the death of Baldur and fall of the gods seems to be from someone's idioysyncratic theory identifying Skuld with the Vala in the Völuspá. The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> is certainly not an example of lost mythology, other than a few genealogical traditions. There is an overabundance of Tolkienism here. Unless there has been something discovered I am not aware of, an etymological connection between Old English <i>ent</i> and <i>ettin</i> (= Old Norse <i>jötun</i>) is still considered to be very dubious. And it oversimplifies and claims far too much to say that Tolkien <i>based</i> his Middle-earth on Midgard.</p>
<p>I wonder if something like the article <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland.html" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> would prove a good model, that is a series of short summary pieces each linking to a fuller discussion.</p>
<p>I do not see any point in distinguishing between "References" and "Further Reading" in a listing, unless "Further reading" means material not so closely connected to the article. I'm a full convert of the MLA school of documentation and the Harvard scientific style of documentation in which one uses in-text references, usually last name of the author, sometimes year date, and often page number of other indication of location in the work, said work so referenced to found in the Bibliography. This is far easier on the reader than end notes or footnotes and is the recommended style at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>. That all works in a Bibliography are not referenced is quite acceptable and quite normal.</p>
<p>The Bibliography was mostly added by myself, basically comprising (<i>arguably</i>) the most important reasonably available secondary works in English, one German work that is the current accepted authoritative standard work, and others not so important but reasonably available, whether on the web or in book form or both. I don't think it should be necessary to especially document secondary material that is general knowledge and that can be found in almost every one of the General Secondary Works. Also, if each section of the Norse Mythology article links to a more complete article, that is where fuller documentation would go. In some ways <b><a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse_Mythology_bf9e.html" title="Norse Mythology">Norse Mythology</a></b> should be a summary article, summarizing what is more fully expounded and documented elsewhere.</p>
<p>But I agree that some documentation is needed in the article as it stands.</p>
<p>As to citations from primary works, mostly, for Norse mythology, these should have their own articles and many now do. Accordingly, one would do citation by links, that is link to the article on a particular eddic poem or to the <i>Skáldskaparmál</i> and so forth. My plan was to rework the articles on the <i>Eddas</i>, give them more complete Bibligraphies: reasonably full listings of editions of the Old Norse texts and of most English translations, whether on web or only hard published. I have not got there yet. I may try shortly.</p>
<p>Essentially, the <b>Primary Sources</b> section would continue to contain only internal links: a link to the main article on Snorri's <i>Edda</i>, a link to the article on the <i>Poetic Edda</i>, but also an additional link to the article on <i>Gesta Danorum</i> and yet another link to an unwritten article on <i>Fornaldarsögur</i>. Each of these articles would have its own Bibliography. (There might be a few other links also. I suppose Faroese material should be considered Norse, and there ought to be a link to Faroese sources which would contain, among other information, a bibliography to sources for Faroese primary texts and translations. And there are probably other individual works that might be linked to, perhaps dividing the <b>Primary Sources</b> section into <b>Major</b> and <b>Minor</b>.)</p>
<p>There should probably also be an article or section on modern novelistic and fictional use of Norse mythology (beginning with Wagner?). I know enough to at least start one, but have other things I'd rather be doing here, when I have the time.</p>

<p>You can copy my post anywhere. I think the <i>Norse Mythology</i> article is far from being a <i>good</i> article at the moment. But when I have time and inclination to write in that area, I generally prefer to work on detailed articles covering a single aspect of Norse mythology and try to get that right, rather than attempt the impossible task of surveying the entire field in a short article. So I'm not the person to dive in and rework it. And I prefer generally working with the primary sources, often throwing out material that has crept in from secondary sources. In respect to mythology and legend, if you can't find it in a primary source, it didn't happen (and anything if that kind must be referenced as speculation if included).</p>
<p>I have nothing particularly against "references used" and "further reading" when that fits, except how do you distinguish if you and other editors together have read all the works listed? To take an example from Norse mythology, that Odin has two brothers named Vili and Ve is something mentioned in some primary texts (both <i>Eddas</i>) and in every secondary text mentioned. So <i>all</i> the works can be listed as references to this.</p>
<p>Anyone insisting that sections called <b>References used</b> and <b>Further reading</b> <i>must</i> appear in every feature-level article, should be requested to first obtain consensus from Wikipedia members to include this as a requirement in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>. Until that is done, and I doubt such an attempt would succeed, this seems to me to be an advocacy attempt to impose one particular style of reference, one that does not especially fit in an encyclopedia. It makes sense that a book on the subject of Norse mythology might contain a <b>Further reading</b> section listing works discussing Scandinavian culture, Scandinavian history, medieval Icelandic history, a survey of theories on mythology in general, and so forth. It makes far less sense in an encyclopedia where those topic are discussed in other articles with their own references, those articles possibly referenced in a <b>See also</b> section.</p>

<p>I tried to put my reason for reverting in the edit field, sorry it wasn't clear. I haven't contributed, but I've been following the discussions on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECritique_of_Finno-Ugric_and_Uralic_language_groups_fde6.html" title="Talk:Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups">Talk:Critique of Finno-Ugric and Uralic language groups</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/n/Talk%7EFinno-Ugric_languages_d37b.html" title="Talk:Finno-Ugric languages">Talk:Finno-Ugric languages</a>, and I've had many interactions on other pages with the linguists I see discussing the conflict there, so I think I have a good basis for understanding what's involved. I understand that you believe strongly in the views you put forward, and that you must feel very beleaguered, with everybody joining forces against you like this. Believe me, I don't take any pleasure in contributing to that feeling. On the other hand, doesn't it <b>tell</b> you something that you're in a minority of one? It's an encyclopedia, it's supposed to be for consensus. The whole Internet's out there, nobody's going to revert you if you start your own website, or contribute to one that already exists for the purpose of propagating your take on the Finno-Ugric language question.<br />
I have a question for you in return. Why do you persist in breaking the rules of this place, after being warned? Nyenyec warns you of the 3 revert rule above on this page, I warned you again in my edit line, and yet you keep right on doing it. Please stop. Nyenec gave you a link for it, here it is again: <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_7218.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule">Wikipedia:Three revert rule</a>.

<dd>No, the minority position does not tell me anything. The people I discuss with, have much less background in the subject, than I do. In Hungary Hungarian people are still suppressed and poor, and have no possibility to internet, therefore am I in minority here. Also 1945-1990 English language was not broadly teached in Hungary, that's the second reason for very small presence.</dd>

Bishon, I am sorry you have the opinion that Philosophy is "nonsense" -- personally, I agree with Princeton's definition: "<i>the rational investigation of questions about existence and knowledge and ethics.</i>" Nonetheless, I understand the subjectivity of it all and at the surface it appears to be nonsense, though to the uninitiated most of the text currently in "Christmas" is subjective (there is even a section labeled "Theories regarding the origin of the date of Christmas" which is right?).</p>
<p>In regards to Copyrighted material, I assure you I have authorization from the original author. In fact, I was planning on adding a link to the Wikipedia article from the original Copyrighted source, but you kept deleting my addition.</p>
<p>Bishon, I apologize if I take a different view from you but the fact is this article addition to "Christmas" was well-labeled and I believe well-placed, also there is no known copyright infringement because I wrote it. I think it would be fair to move this discussion to a public forum before deleting my addition to the "free content encyclopedia that anyone can edit" because you seem to be biased, a bit of a fascist and quick to delete the work of others while reveling in yours -- I am sure you do not speak for all of Wikipedia, because at very least I am a part of Wikipedia and you do not speak for me.</p>

<dd>I don't know what you're talking about there, I'm afraid, Gabriel. I have not deleted any contribution of yours. If you look under the "History" tab of Christmas, you will see who has deleted what. By "nonsense", I was referring to the additions that your IP (either you or somebody else who shares the same IP) made to <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party (United States)</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edwards_8861.html" title="John Edwards">John Edwards</a> a while ago. If you look again at the Talk page for 66.74.131.27, you will see that my remarks were directed at the IP, not at you personally: if somebody else was using that IP to vandalise the political pages, then I was talking to them, not you. If you add obvious copyright material to an article without saying anything in the edit field (how is that "well-labelled"?) or on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristmas_212d.html" title="Talk:Christmas">Talk:Christmas</a>, it will, and should, be deleted quickly. Other editors do not have a chrystal ball, to be able to foretell that you have plans for claiming authorship later. To assure me, much later, on my personal talk page, with the addition of a few random insults, that you wrote the material yourself isn't the same thing as giving timely information. I see you have now put back the material into <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> yet again. I advise you to explain on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristmas_212d.html" title="Talk:Christmas">Talk:Christmas</a> that you own the copyright, preferably with some evidence. Meanwhile, since you would like to see the discussion in a public forum, I will copy your post and mine to "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristmas_212d.html" title="Talk:Christmas">Talk:Christmas</a> myself.

<dd>I mean this in a friendly spirit, Antifinnugor: in your own interest, you should remove "Balf"'s endorsement on the RfC page, it's only making you look ridiculous. I don't know and don't care if Balf is a sock puppet of yours or a newbie friend who has registered only for the purpose of voting against the VfD and the RfC, but he/she is obviously one or the other, and it doesn't make any difference which: that endorsement tips the whole thing over the edge into farce.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 20:02, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh Bishonen!, - I am mortified, I had not noticed Anne B was on the front page, my screen does not display the botton half unless I scroll down, I am so short sighted I have to have very big print. "Piece de toute droit" is the french translation for "bit of all right" which is English slang, translated means "seems like a nice girl". I don't thing Miserable Towers will ever make the front page somehow; but what has happened to good old John Vanbrugh, he should have been there by now.

<dd>I have just seen what you mean about Misery Towers and the front page, you are clever to spot these things. I'm glad Philip is being so kind to categorise all these things, perhaps he can make a category for Church Towers without churches. I see he is on categories to be deleted trying to rid the world of supermarkets, that can only be a good thing. Misery Towers will not make the front page because it is a short stub, not rocket science, and I had never heard of them until yesterday when I saw an appeal by Sannse for a page to accompany the picture; whereas Anne B is a well written long and informatice article by a respected editor - It is my new year's resolution to be modest and kind to everybody - so I shall spend the next 10 hours looking for some more restoration plays for your category.

<p>I am not exactly sure what you mean (and, re [committee writing trouble there], do have some difficulty parsing these guidelines). I did think that Dbenbenn went online with this not at the best of moments, just when I thought afu had lost interest, but there is <i>ample</i> evidence of several people trying to reason with him with angelic patience. My patience however, I believe, understandably, has expired, and I will not argue with him any more. I do believe he is sincere, but if he is, he must be incredibly challenged in the common sense department, and it seems all our efforts have not availed to dispel his impression of being the victim of a KGB-like conspiracy even one bit. I chalk him up as a cabalist/troll, and only hope to get some community support out of this RfC to allow editors to waste less time with him in the future. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:30, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I'm sorry - is the point that it needs to "endorsing" rather than "certifying" signatures? What is the difference between "certifying" and "endorsing"? I should think "certification" is the stronger term, but would it be sufficient for me to move my signature from "certifying" to "endorsing"?

<dl>
<dd>I think I see. But if you look at some of the 'approved pages', there do not seem to be any additional signatures in the 'evidence of trying and failing' section, but the criterion seems to be, two signatures in the 'certifying the basis' section, i.e. as far as I can see, the rfc is 'approved', even technically.

Could you maybe point me towards an example page with references in the style you prefer? Thanks! <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 23:44, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your further explanation! The numbers should actually be mostly consecutive in the article, it's just that I've cited a couple of papers more than once. I added them at different times so I might have got the numbering messed up - I'll check this now. I think my reference style has ended up being somewhere in between the WP:MOS recommendations and what I do with astronomy papers, but the refs do have page numbers, they're all in the form <i>Authors, year, title, journal, volume, page</i>. Maybe I should make that clearer, perhaps by putting v134, p427 or something like that.</dd>
<dd>Anyway thanks again for your comments! <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:13, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think the trick is of much use at the moment, but for a while yesterday there was at least one database slave that was up to date, so it was a question of reloading the page until you got a query from that one. In order to ignore the probably outdated response from the cache you had to use <i>action=purge</i> (just put that in the URL, just like when it says <i>action=edit</i> or <i>action=history</i>), which removes cache entries for the page (or you could just disable caching in your Special:Preferences I think).

<p>I had similar thoughts. And it may be time to finally drum up the developers to get some light into this. But I suppose even mathematicians can be perfect asses when blinded by nationalism. I do not believe it is afu. His style is different. He uses sarcasm, and he actually seems to get a point if you shove it into his face repeatedly (note how he finally seemed to accept that I was not 'condemning' afu regardless of his sock's status). I suppose he really just hardly speaks any English at all, and decides to assume hostility until the contrary is established beyond doubt. I suppose he simply has just no clue what is going on, except that he has gathered somehow that someone was bashing one of his countrymen. I do hope Nyenyec will be able to sort it out with him, if this continues.</p>
<p>I am thinking about retracting my RFAr. The committee seems to want mediation, first <small><small>the lazy bastards</small></small> (*ahem*). I think I have done more than my duty already, and I will not go to mediation with afu, but I suppose it will be bad style to refuse mediation and still press an rfar? Neutrality asked for an evidence page before accepting (and his vote would suffice to approve of the request). What is your take on this? Should I begin to assemble the evidence page, weeping, or should I just leave it alone? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 18:14, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>re Gubbubu, you are of course right that he does not seem to be off to a good start for making himself known as a scientific and polite user on en: at all. But then he did not make any crazy edits to article namespace, and he compares favourably to afu in any case (who wouldn't, though!), and I don't think we should make a case of it... it's just weird.</dd>
<dd>re RFAr, well, so I guess I'll have to collect some evidence then. Just when I decided that it's not worth the bother and wanted to retract the request. Will you move your evidence from my subpage to the official evidence page? I'll also ask the 'friendly' hungarians to help me out, I have hardly any time at the moment.</dd>
<dd>I didn't get your email, btw, but that's probably due to my spamfilter, sorry. My spam is driving me crazy, recently, and I lowered the threshold for non-whitelisted from:s.</dd>
<dd>you are right. no sacrifices. It's just WP, and the articles will just deteriorate again, when we're not looking. Still, I think it's worth to stand up for some principles, now and again.

<p>Hi Bishonen,<br />
thanks for your message - that was my first one from outside the german wikipedia. And I also learned that you are (partly) behind all that marvellous articles I've translated through the last couple of weeks. -- I simply checked the english "featured articles" for what seemed to me interesting and then sat down to transcribe them into german. John Vanbrugh was particularly interesting as I could not find much german literature about him - also I have the very large public library of Cologne very near to my flat. You were wondering what the means (spelled on purpose wrong here, otherwise your page would have a link to the german wikipedia here). It is a socalled "Interwiki-link", which links for example the restauration comedy to the German "Restaurationskomödie" or links the John Vanbrugh Article to its german translation. de stands for german, es for spanish, it for italian etc. - and if you can't read it and see only funny signs it is probably korean, japanese, hebrew etc. If you set up something like this, it will show up under the toolbox in the left column, header will be "Other languages"....best regards and thanks for the tip with Cibber. -- BS Thurner Hof 18:58, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Critique appreciated. Swedenborg wasn't my addition, don't even know who he is - a prior contribution. Searching for reliable information regarding his unfornate medical condition (info in article inaccurate). Would like to attempt a psychohistorical portrait, since breeches were the common garb at the time, which made him a ludicrous figure in society. Couldn't ride a horse; difficulty walking (hence the reference to his stench, even by the standards of the time), and a factor in his absorbtion in his literary endeavor. Is that acceptable?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Want to take out the primary/secondary references since they're already in D/F, which sustained numerous reverts to keep that incredibly long paragraph to illustrate his style. Okay with me. Latest revert by Stbalbach &amp; he certainly has the credentials. Will clean up my typos, but asked him to review my comments on IV &amp; IVI for accuracy. At this point, I've contributed enough to make D/F credible, &amp; will check re: primary v. secondary sources is clarified there.

<p>yes. I am a bit unhappy about the rfar, since afu seems to have stopped his edit-warring anyway (although we let him keep his article, for now, I'm just too fed up to police around). I am really charmed by Gubbubu, the concept of 'false statement' seems to be so remote from him that he actually makes no difference between 'claim' and 'proof'. O those happy mathematicians! Well, do remove the 3RR evidence, if you like. More than a chastisement of afu, I'm looking for some vindication of the editors involved with this, to know if this is how cases like afu are properly addressed, in the view of the arbcom. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 08:55, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I did compare the revisions, Bishonen, and no: I did not add that excerpt. I did try do discuss it, assuming good faith!. And yes, I am taking a time out. I think that is a very good idea. I don't understand why someone would come in, review a page, notice that a header is missing, not change it, yet make a comment. How is that good faith, or good wikietiquette? How hard is reinserting a title, for a newbie? Or discussing why you're reinserting something that was vandalized once, and deliberately taken out, and blatantly re-inserted without any explanation on the talk page? This person made a point of stating that he's not the world authority on Gibbon. However: I did not insert that copy. The history page shows that. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonsage_ba84.html" title="User:Alisonsage">allie</a> 13:21, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
