<p>The <b>Bishopric of Limoges</b> is a diocese comprising the <i><a href="../../../d/%C3%A9/p/D%C3%A9partment_in_France_6238.html" title="Départment in France">départments</a></i> of <a href="../../../h/a/u/Haute-Vienne_1bad.html" title="Haute-Vienne">Haute-Vienne</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creuse.html" title="Creuse">Creuse</a> in France. After the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concordat_of_1801.html" title="Concordat of 1801">Concordat of 1801</a>, the See of Limoges lost twenty-four parishes from the district of <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nontron.html" title="Nontron">Nontron</a> which were annexed to the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_P%C3%A9rigueux_e964.html" title="Diocese of Périgueux">Diocese of Périgueux</a>, and forty-four from the district of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confolens.html" title="Confolens">Confolens</a>, transferred to the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Angoul%C3%AAme_de14.html" title="Diocese of Angoulême">Diocese of Angoulême</a>; but until 1822 it included the entire ancient <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Tulle_9d07.html" title="Diocese of Tulle">Diocese of Tulle</a>, when the latter was reorganized.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Gregory_of_Tours_a2d1.html" title="Saint Gregory of Tours">Saint Gregory of Tours</a> names <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Martial_8962.html" title="St. Martial">St. Martial</a>, who founded the Church of Limoges, as one of the seven bishops sent from Rome to Gaul in the middle of the third century. An anonymous life of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Martial_8962.html" title="St. Martial">St. Martial</a> (<i>Vita primitiva</i>), discovered and published by Abbé Arbellot, represents him as sent to Gaul by St. Peter. Controversy has arisen over the date of this biography. The discovery in the library at <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlsruhe.html" title="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a> of a manuscript copy written at <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichenau.html" title="Reichenau">Reichenau</a> by Regimbertus, a monk who died in 846, places the original before that date. As it is in rhythmical prose, Mgr Bellet thinks it belongs to the seventh century while Charles De Smedt and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Duchesne_a960.html" title="Louis Duchesne">Louis Duchesne</a> maintain that the "Vita primitiva" is much later than Gregory of Tours. M. de Lasteyrie gives 800 as the date of its origin.</p>
<p>In addition to the manuscript already cited, the Abbey of St. Martial at the beginning of the eleventh century possessed a circumstantial life of its patron saint, according to which, and to the cycle of later legends derived from it, St. Martial was one of the seventy-two disciples who witnessed the Passion and Ascension of Christ, was present on the first Pentecost and at the martydom of St. Stephen. followed St. Peter to Antioch and to Rome, and was sent to Gaul by the Prince of the Apostles, who assigned Austriclinium and Alpinian to accompany him. The three were welcomed at Tulle and turned away from Ahun. They set out towards Limoges, where St. Martial erected on the site of the present cathedral a shrine in honour of St. Stephen. A pagan priest, Aurelian, wished to throw St. Martial into prison, but was struck dead, then brought to life, baptized, ordained and later consecrated bishop by the saint. Aurelian is the patron of the guild of butchers in Limoges. Forty years after the Ascension, Christ appeared to Martial, and announced to him the approach of death. The churches of Limoges celebrate this event on 16 June. After labouring for twenty-eight years as a missionary in Gaul, the saint died at the age of fifty-nine, surrounded by his converts of Poitou, Berry, Auvergne and Aquitaine.</p>
<p>The writer of this "Life" pretends to be Aurelian, St. Martial's disciple and successor in the See of Limoges. Mgr Duchesne thinks it not unlikely that the real authorship of this "apocryphal and lying" work should be attributed to the chronicler <a href="../../../a/d/h/Adh%C3%A9mar_de_Chabannes_92dc.html" title="Adhémar de Chabannes">Adhémar de Chabannes</a>, noted for his fabrications; but M. de Lasteyrie is of opinion that it was written ahout 955, before the birth of Adhémar. Be that as it may, this "Vita Aureliana" played an important part at the beginning of the eleventh century, when the Abbot Hugh (1019-1025) brought before several councils the question of the Apostolic date of St. Martial's mission. Before the Carlovingian period there is no trace of the story that St. Martial was sent to Gaul by St. Peter. It did not spread until the eleventh century and was revived in the seventeenth by the Carmelite Bonaventure de Saint-Amable, in his voluminous "Histoire de St. Martial". Mgr Duchesne and M. de Lasteyrie assert that it cannot be maintained against the direct testimony of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Gregory_of_Tours_5a59.html" title="St. Gregory of Tours">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, who places the origin of the Church of Limoges about the year 250.</p>
<p>The most distinguished bishops of Limoges are: St. Roricius (died 507), who built the monastery and church of St. Augustine at Limoges; St. Roricius II (d. about 553), who built the church of St-Pierre-du-Queyroix and the Basilica of St. Junianus at Limoges; St. Ferréol (d. 597), the friend of St. Yrieix; St. Lupus, or <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Loup_2223.html" title="Saint Loup">Saint Loup</a> (613-629); <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Sacerdos_462e.html" title="St. Sacerdos">St. Sacerdos</a> (Saint Sardon), Abbot of Calabrum, afterwards bishop; St. Cessa (740-761), who led the people of Limoges against the Saracens under <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Martel_3f32.html" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a>; Cardinal <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_du_Bellay_44ee.html" title="Jean du Bellay">Jean du Bellay</a> (1541-1545).</p>
<p>The ecelesiastics who served the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crypt.html" title="Crypt">crypt</a> of St. Martial organized themselves into a monastery in 848, and built a church beside that of St.-Pierre-du-Sépulchre which overhung the crypt. This new church, which they called St-Sauveur, was demolished in 1021 and replaced in 1028 by a larger edifice in Auvergnat style. <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_II_fe89.html" title="Urban II">Urban II</a> came in person to reconsecrate it in 1095. In the thirteenth century the chapel of St. Benedict arose beside the old church of St-Pierre-du-Sépulchre. It was also called the church of the Grand Confraternity of St. Martial. The different organizations which were grouped around it, anticipated and solved many important sociological questions.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Limoges comprised two towns: one called the "City", the other the "Chateau" or "Castle". The government of the "Castle" belonged at first to the Abbots of St. Martial who claimed to have received it from king <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_the_Pious_e7e4.html" title="Louis the Pious">Louis the Pious</a>. Later, the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount.html" title="Viscount">viscounts</a> of Limoges claimed this authority, and constant friction existed until the beginning of the thirteenth century, when owing to the new communal activity, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consul.html" title="Consul">consuls</a> were appointed, to whose authority the abbots were forced to submit in 1212. After two intervals during which the English kings imposed their rule, king <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V_of_France_649f.html" title="Charles V of France">Charles V of France</a> in 1371 united the "Castle" with the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_demesne.html" title="Royal demesne">royal demesne</a>, and thus ended the political rule of the Abbey of St. Martial. Until the end of the old regime, however, the abbots of St. Martial exercised direct jurisdiction over the Combes quarter of the city.</p>
<p>In 1534, Abbot Matthieu Jouviond, finding that the monastic spirit had almost totally died out in the abbey, thought best to change it into a collegiate church, and in 1535 the king and the pope gave their consent. It was suppressed in 1791, and early in the nineteenth century even the buildings had disappeared. In the thirteenth century, the Abbey of St. Martial possessed the finest library (450 volumes) in France after that of <a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluny_Abbey_4f1d.html" title="Cluny Abbey">Cluny Abbey</a> (570 volumes). Some have been lost, but 200 of them were bought by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XV_9f2e.html" title="Louis XV">Louis XV</a> in 1730, and to-day are one of the most valuable collections in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. Most manuscripts, ornamented with beautiful miniatures, were written in the abbey itself. M. Emile Molinier and M. Rupin admit a relation between these miniatures of St. Martial and the earliest Limoges enamels, but M. de Lasteyrie disputes this theory. The <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscans.html" title="Franciscans">Franciscans</a> settled at Limoges in 1223. According to the chronicle of Pierre Coral, rector of St. Martin of Limoges, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Anthony_of_Padua_b4f3.html" title="St. Anthony of Padua">St. Anthony of Padua</a> established a convent there in 1226 and departed in the first months of 1227. On the night of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Thursday_965a.html" title="Holy Thursday">Holy Thursday</a>, it is said, he was preaching in the church of St. Pierre du Queyroix, when he stopped for a moment and remained silent. At the same instant he appeared in the choir of the Franciscan monastery and read a lesson. It was doubtlessly at Châteauneuf in the territory of Limoges that took place the celebrated apparition of the Infant Jesus to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Anthony_e4b6.html" title="St. Anthony">St. Anthony</a>.</p>
<p>The diocese specially honours the following: St. Sylvanus, a native of <a href="../../../a/h/u/Ahun.html" title="Ahun">Ahun</a>, martyr; St. Adorator disciple of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Ambrose_7986.html" title="St. Ambrose">St. Ambrose</a>, suffered martyrdom at Lupersac; St. Victorianus, an Irish hermit; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Vaast_3354.html" title="St. Vaast">St. Vaast</a>, a native of the diocese who became <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Arras_8eda.html" title="Bishop of Arras">Bishop of Arras</a> and baptized king <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis.html" title="Clovis">Clovis</a> (fifth-sixth century); St. Psalmodius, a native of Britain, died a hermit at Eymoutiers; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Yrieix_7341.html" title="St. Yrieix">St. Yrieix</a>, d. in 591, chancellor to Theodebert King of Austrasia and founder of the monastery of Attanum (the town of St. Yrieix is named after him); <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Etienne_de_Muret_36a5.html" title="St. Etienne de Muret">St. Etienne de Muret</a> (1046-1126), who together with Guillaume d'Uriel, Bishop of Limoges, founded the famous Benedictine <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_of_Grandmont_6956.html" title="Abbey of Grandmont">abbey of Grandmont</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Council of Limoges</b>, held in <a href="../../../1/0/3/1031.html" title="1031">1031</a>, is noted not only for its decision with regard to St. Martial's mission, but because, at the instigation of Abbot Odolric, it proclaimed the "<a href="../../../t/r/u/Truce_of_God_4476.html" title="Truce of God">Truce of God</a>" and threatened with general <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">excommunication</a> those feudal lords who would not swear to maintain it.

<p>In <a href="../../../9/9/4/994.html" title="994">994</a>, when the district was devastated by a plague (<i>mal des ardents</i>), the epidemic ceased immediately after a procession ordered by Bishop Hilduin on the Mont de la Joie, which overlooks the city.
