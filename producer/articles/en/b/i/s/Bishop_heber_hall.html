Way down in Tambaram, There's ol' Heber Hall</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bishop Heber Hall is one of the four halls of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madras_Christian_College_cc61.html" title="Madras Christian College">Madras Christian College</a>, Tambaram, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>. All on campus residences for students are referred to as halls and not hostels, as life in these halls is an experience of more than just lodging. Student leadership plays a vital role in Bishop Heber Hall and residents play an important role in the day to day functioning of the hall. The hall is divided into five blocks; A,B,C,D and E. Freshers are assigned rooms on the ground floor while seniors occupy rooms on the first floor. Cabinet members and other important personalities in the hall are given special rooms that are spread out through the different blocks on both floors. The E block is an annex to the main block and these rooms are reserved for students who are pursuing one year diploma courses.</p>

<p>The Lindsay Commission on Christian Higher Education in India suggested that Bishop Heber College in <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiruchirappalli.html" title="Tiruchirappalli">Tiruchirappalli</a> be merged with the Madras Christian College. Accordingly, Bishop Heber College was closed in 1934 and merged with Madras Christian College and as a result, Bishop Heber Hall, a residential hall for students emerged at Madras Christian College, Tambaram. The building was designed by architect Henry Scattchi. The name <i>Heber</i> comes from <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Heber_f2ed.html" title="Reginald Heber">Reginald Heber</a> who was an old English Bishop and also served as the Bishop of Calcutta. He was also an excellent hymn writer and has written some of the best hymns, that are sung even today.<br />
Between the three residences for men, Heber is the youngest. The others being St. Thomas Hall and Selaiyur Hall. The women are attached to Martin Hall.<br />
Dr. Chandran Devenasan was the first warden of Bishop Heber Hall and he is credited with penning the now famous <i>Hall Song.</i> Many well known personalities have passed through Heber and though they have moved out years ago, their attachment to Heber always remains. A true Heberian never leaves.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_heber_hall.html" title="Edit section: Initiation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Initiation</span></h3>
<hr />
<p>Any student who resides in Bishop Heber Hall is known as a Heberian, but only after he has been initiated. Otherwise he would continue to be referred to as a fresher. Initiation is a process where every fresher has to learn all the necessary facts and details about the hall. One is also expected to learn the hall song, preamble, motto etc. It would also help their cause if they are able to learn the names of other residents in the hall. The initiation oath is administered by the Bishop once a resident has cleared an intense round of grilling. Once through with this, he is officially a Heberian and is now eligible to use any of the hall facilities and take part in any hall activity. Initiations are conducted once a year under the watchful eye of the Warden, ARC (Anti Ragging Committee) and other college authorities.</p>

<p>If you come to Tambaram Darling, Come to Heber Hall.<br />
Heber is a paradise, Fish pond and all.<br />
Uzhundhu vadai, Masala vadai, anything you want,<br />
Mess bills as big as hills, Heber is a haunt.</p>
<p><i>Way down in Tambaram, There's ol Heber Hall,<br />
Is there another like it? No, not at all</i></p>
<p>If you come to Tambaram darling, Travelling in the trains.<br />
Get the Heber lads to meet you, they have got the brains.<br />
If you want to marry my darling and to marry well.<br />
Stick to a Heber lad and send the rest to hell.</p>
<p>Come along on sports day darling, see me run the mile.<br />
High jumping, hurdling, in the Heber style.<br />
Some of us are fat, some of us are thin.<br />
But Heber is a sporting hall, Whether we lose or win.</p>
<p>We are all members of the Heber family.<br />
Kachai moru, pachai moru eating happily.<br />
The Tamilian, the Telegu, the Coorg, the Malayali.<br />
We are the sons of Heber, home of the free.</p>

Carol Service at the Heber Chapel</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of all the specialities of Heber, the Chapel is undoubtedly the most prominent. It is located between C and D blocks. Initially it was to be constructed at the site of the current mess hall, but this plan was changed at the last minute. The garden in front of the chapel is also home to the bell tower. In the early days, the bell tower was much lower than it is now and rumor has it that the original bell went missing and the current bell was purchased from Burma bazar for Rs 500. The height of the tower was also increased and the bell has not gone missing since. Evening worship is conducted every evening at 8:00pm and it is a time of singing and sharing. Guest speakers visit ocassionally and share the word. Sunday service happens every week and the order of worship is a unique blend of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> and south Indian styles. Heber Chapel is among the very few places in India where the Nicean Creed is sung, rather than spoken or chanted. Special services are held during ocassions like Good Friday, Easter and other local events. The grandest event of all happens to be the Christmas Carol Service. Practice for this starts months in advance, with the carefully selected choir meeting regularly to prepare for the big day. The chapel undergoes a facelift every year. The walls are painted and tiles are carefully polished each year by the residents themselves. The floor tiles were imported from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and it maintains its original shine and shape even to this day. The altar was cut out from a single piece of rock that was transported from <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tiruchirappalli.html" title="Tiruchirappalli">Tiruchirappalli</a>. This is a constant reminder to all Heberians, of the roots of Bishop Heber Hall. The Chapel is a matter of pride to every Heberian and a matter of envy for the other halls and even the college.</p>
