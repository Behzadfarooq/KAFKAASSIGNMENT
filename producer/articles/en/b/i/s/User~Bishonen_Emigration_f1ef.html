<p>The Swedish <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_India_Company_cb06.html" title="West India Company">West India Company</a> established a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colony</a> on the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_River_6e02.html" title="Delaware River">Delaware River</a> in 1638, naming it <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Sweden_6c26.html" title="New Sweden">New Sweden</a>. It was the smallest and shortest-lived of the European colonial empires, containing at its height only some 600 Swedish and Finnish settlers (<a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a> being then part of Sweden). It was lost to the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch.html" title="Dutch">Dutch</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Netherland_d534.html" title="New Netherland">New Netherland</a> in 1655. Nevertheless, the descendants of the original colonists maintained their Swedish speech until the late 18th century.</p>
<p>The historian H. A. Barton has suggested that the greatest significance of New Sweden was the particularly strong and long-lasting interest in North America that it created in Sweden. America was conceived as the standard-bearer of <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">enlightenment</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28political%29.html" title="Freedom (political)">freedom</a>, and became the ideal of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> Swedes. Admiration for America was combined with the notion of a past Swedish <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_6ed8.html" title="Golden Age">Golden Age</a>, whose ancient <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic.html" title="Nordic">Nordic</a> ideals had supposedly been corrupted by foreign influences. Recovering these values in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">New World</a> was a fundamental theme of Swedish, and later Swedish-American, discussion of America. The nature of the good old values varied over time, reflecting the historical development of Swedish culture and ideology. The new land in the West began as a symbol of the rights of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscience.html" title="Conscience">conscience</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_freedom.html" title="Religious freedom">religious freedom</a>. It came in the 19th century to stand principally for the dignity of honest toil and the virtues of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republican</a> government. In the early 20th century, the Swedish-American dream even embraced the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_State_538a.html" title="Welfare State">Welfare State</a> ideal of a society responsible for the well-being of all its citizens, before becoming, by contrast, the <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbol</a> and dream of the ultimate <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>For two hundred years, the Swedish debate about America remained mostly theoretical, since very few Swedes had any personal experience to draw on. Emigration was illegal, as population was considered the wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> By the 1830s, population growth had outstripped economic development, giving rise to fears of overpopulation under the newly influential theory of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malthus.html" title="Malthus">Malthus</a>, and the laws against emigration were repealed.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The great Swedish migration began in the spring of 1841 with the departure of <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppsala_University_0978.html" title="Uppsala University">Uppsala University</a> graduate <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustaf_Unonius_48a7.html" title="Gustaf Unonius">Gustaf Unonius</a> (1810—1902) together with his wife, a maid, and two students. This little group settled in "New Upsala" at <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Lake%2C_Wisconsin_4288.html" title="Pine Lake, Wisconsin">Pine Lake, Wisconsin</a> and began to clear the wilderness, full of enthusiasm for <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontier.html" title="Frontier">frontier</a> life in "one of the most beautiful valleys the world can offer."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> After moving to Chicago, Unonius soon became disillusioned with life in America, but his letters in praise of the simple and virtuous <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pioneer.html" title="Pioneer">pioneer</a> life, published in the liberal newspaper <i><a href="../../../a/f/t/Aftonbladet.html" title="Aftonbladet">Aftonbladet</a></i>, had by then already begun to draw Swedes westward.</p>
<p>The rising Swedish exodus was caused by economic, political, and religious factors which affected particularly the rural population. Europe was in the grip of economic depression. In Sweden, population growth and repeated crop failures were making it increasingly difficult to wrest a living from the tiny, fragmented land plots on which at least three quarters of the inhabitants depended. Rural conditions were especially bleak in the stony and unforgiving <a href="../../../s/m/%C3%A5/Sm%C3%A5land.html" title="Småland">Småland</a> province, which became the heartland of emigration. The complete agricultural contrast to Småland was the American <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwest.html" title="Midwest">Midwest</a>, which, wrote Unonius in 1842, "more closely than any other country in the world approaches the ideal which nature seems to have intended for the happiness and comfort of humanity."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prairie.html" title="Prairie">Prairie</a> land was ample, <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loam.html" title="Loam">loamy</a>, and government owned. From 1841 it was sold to <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatters.html" title="Squatters">squatters</a> for $1.25 per acre, following the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preemption_Act_of_1841_e0bb.html" title="Preemption Act of 1841">Preemption Act of 1841</a> (later replaced by the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead_Act_6655.html" title="Homestead Act">Homestead Act</a>). This inexpensive and fertile land was irresistibly beguiling to landless and/or impoverished European peasants, and attracted more well-established farmers also.</p>
<p>The political freedom of the American <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> exerted a similar pull. Swedish peasants were the most <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy.html" title="Literacy">literate</a> in Europe, and consequently the most receptive to the <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radical.html" title="Radical">radical</a> ideas that shook Europe in the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution.html" title="Revolution">revolutionary</a> 1840s.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The clash between Swedish <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and a repressive <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchism.html" title="Monarchism">monarchist</a> <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regime.html" title="Regime">regime</a> raised political awareness among the disadvantaged, who looked to North America to realize their republican ideals.</p>

<p>Sweden experienced widespread resentment of the religious <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repression.html" title="Repression">repression</a> practised by the <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheran.html" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Church_5f52.html" title="State Church">State Church</a>. Such conflicts were most explosive in the countryside, where <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissenter.html" title="Dissenter">dissenting</a> <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietist.html" title="Pietist">pietist</a> groups were more active, as well as being more directly under the eye of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish.html" title="Parish">parish</a> priest and local law enforcement. Official clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching were often the decisive factor in making whole groups of pietists leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Jansson_fedb.html" title="Eric Jansson">Eric Jansson</a>, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Hill%2C_Illinois_421f.html" title="Bishop Hill, Illinois">Bishop Hill, Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>Substantial groups of lumberjacks and iron miners were recruited directly by company agents in Sweden. Agents recruiting construction builders for American railroads appeared, the first in 1854, scouting for the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Central_Railroad_3eb1.html" title="Illinois Central Railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Gold_Rush_e2d6.html" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a> of 1848—1855 drew adventurers.</p>
<p>The first Swedish emigrant guidebook was published as early as 1841, the year Unonius left. No less than nine different handbooks were published between 1849 and 1855.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Swedish ruling classes disapproved intensely of emigration. Seen as depleting the labor force, and as a show of unexpected independence among the lower orders, emigration alarmed both the spiritual and the worldly authorities. Many emigrant diaries and memoirs begin with an emblematic scene where the local clergy warns them against leaving and risking their souls among foreign <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heresies</a>. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">conservative</a> press described emigrants as lacking in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a> and moral fibre: "No workers are more lazy, immoral and indifferent than those who emigrate to other places."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Emigration was denounced as an unreasoning "mania" or "craze", planted on an ignorant populace by "outside agents". The liberal press retorted that criticism from the "lackeys of monarchism" ignored the deteriorating conditions in the countryside and the backwardness of Swedish economic and political institutions.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Yes, emigration is indeed a "mania", wrote the liberal <i>Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning</i> sarcastically. "The mania of wanting to eat one's fill after one has worked oneself hungry! The craze of wanting to support oneself and one's family in an honest manner!"<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>Swedish immigration to North America reached its height during the 25 years from 1865 to 1890, immediately after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> (1861—65).

By 1890 the census showed a Swedish-American population of nearly 800,000 with emigration peaking in 1869 and again in 1887.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> Almost all of this great influx settled in the North. The great majority of them had been peasants in the old country, pushed away from Sweden by disastrous crop failures.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> and pulled towards North America by the cheap land of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead_Act_6655.html" title="Homestead Act">Homestead Act</a> of 1862. Most of them became classic pioneers, clearing and cultivating the virgin land of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwest.html" title="Midwest">Midwest</a>. As soon as sizable Swedish farming communities had formed on the prairie, the greatest impetus for further peasant migration came through personal contacts. The "America-letter" to relatives and friends at home, something of a cultural <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> in Sweden, spoke directly from a position of trust and a shared background, carrying immediate conviction. At the height of migration, familial America-letters could lead to chain reactions which would all but depopulate some Swedish parishes, dissolving tightly-knit communities which would then re-assemble in the Midwest.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other forces worked to push the new immigrants towards the cities, particularly <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, rather than the prairie. As the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped by more than half during 1865—1890, progressively poorer Swedes contributed a growing share of immigration. The new immigrants were also increasingly younger, unmarried people. The shift from family to individual immigration led to a faster and more complete Americanization, as young single individuals without funds took whatever jobs they could get, often in cities. Substantial numbers even of those who had been farmers in the old country made straight for American cities and towns, living and working there at least until they had saved enough capital to marry and buy farms of their own. Whether this was their original intention or not, a growing proportion stayed in the urban environment, combining emigration with the flight from the countryside which was happening in the homeland and all over Europe.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Single young women, a group the historian H. A. Barton considers particularly significant, would most commonly move straight from field work in rural Sweden to jobs as live-in housemaids in urban America.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> They would find employment easily, as Scandinavian maids were in high demand, and would learn the language and customs quickly; this in contrast to newly-arrived Swedish men, who often worked in all-Swedish work gangs. These young women usually married Swedish men, and brought with them into marriage an enthusiasm for American ladylike manners and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-class.html" title="Middle-class">middle-class</a> refinements. Many admiring and incredulous remarks are recorded from the late 19th century about the sophistication and elegance gained in a few years by simple and humble farm girls, and about their unmistakably American demeanor.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>As newcomers, the Swedes tended to be despised by the native-born, but when immigration from southern and eastern Europe increased dramatically during the 1880s, the Scandinavians looked better and better to Anglo-American eyes.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> Their style was more familiar: "They are not <a href="../../../p/e/d/Peddler.html" title="Peddler">peddlers</a>, nor <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organ_grinder.html" title="Organ grinder">organ grinders</a>, nor <a href="../../../b/e/g/Beggar.html" title="Beggar">beggars</a>; they do not sell ready-made clothing nor keep <a href="../../../p/a/w/Pawn_shop.html" title="Pawn shop">pawn shops</a> ... they do not seek the shelter of the American flag merely to introduce and foster among us ... <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilism.html" title="Nihilism">nihilism</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> ... they are more like Americans than are any other foreign peoples."<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> The Scandinavians were also welcomed as counterweights to the numerous <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish.html" title="Irish">Irish</a> immigrants, in other words for not being <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholics</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>Preoccupied with their identity as both Swedish and American, and with their relation to the old country, a number of well-established and long-time Swedish-Americans visited Sweden in the 1870s. Their comments give historians a window on the cultural contrasts involved. Among others, a group from Chicago made the journey in an effort to remigrate and spend their later years in the country of their birth, but changed their minds when faced with the realities of Swedish 19th-century society. Uncomfortable with what they described as the social snobbery, pervasive drunkenness, and superficial religious life of the old country, they returned promptly to America.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> The most notable visitor was <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Mattsson_b258.html" title="Hans Mattsson">Hans Mattsson</a>, an early Minnesota settler who had served as a colonel in the Union army and been Minnesota's <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_state.html" title="Secretary of state">secretary of state</a>. He was in Sweden in 1868–69 to recruit settlers on behalf of the Minnesota Immigration Board, and again in the 1870s to recruit for the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Pacific_Railroad_8b6a.html" title="Northern Pacific Railroad">Northern Pacific Railroad</a>. Viewing Swedish class snobbery with indignation, Mattson wrote in his <i>Reminiscences</i> that the contrast in this respect was the key to the greatness of America: "Labor is respected, while in most other countries it is looked down upon with slight." He was sardonically amused by the ancient pageantry of monarchy at the ceremonial opening of the <a href="../../../r/i/k/Riksdag.html" title="Riksdag">Riksdag</a>: "With all respects for old Swedish customs and manners, I cannot but compare this pageant to a great American circus—minus the menagerie, of course." Mattson's first recruiting visit came immediately after two consecutive seasons of crop failures in 1867 and 1868, and he found himself "besieged by people who wished to accompany me back to America." He noted that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the laboring and middle classes already at that time had a pretty correct idea of America, and the fate that awaited emigrants there; but the ignorance, prejudice and hatred toward America and everything pertaining to it among the aristocracy, and especially the office holders, was as unpardonable as it was ridiculous. It was claimed by them that all was humbug in America, that it was the paradise of scoundrels, cheats and rascals, and that nothing good could possibly come out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more recent immigrant, Ernst Skarstedt, who visited Sweden in 1885, received the same galling impression of upper-class arrogance and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">anti-Americanism</a>. The laboring classes, in their turn, were coarse and degraded, drinking heavily in public, speaking in a stream of curses, telling indecent stories in front of women and children. (Just like on #wikipedia.) Skarstedt felt surrounded by "arrogance on one side and obsequiousness on the other, a manifest scorn for menial labor, a desire to appear to be more than one was."<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Worst, he was incessantly hearing American civilization and culture denigrated, from the depths of upper-class Swedish prejudice. "If I, in all modesty, told something about America, it could happen that in reply I was informed that this could not possibly be so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden."</p>
<p><b>Other factors</b>: Brattne and Åkerman have studied the new transport organization built up at the end of the 1860s for signs that it constituted a third force between "push" and "pull", but conclude that its effect on emigration was marginal. Neither the massive advertising campaigns of the agencies nor the price policies of the transoceanic steam-ship companies influenced emigration decisively. The advertising mostly had the effect of frightening public opinion in Sweden, while <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartel.html" title="Cartel">cartels</a> among the shipping companies were successful in extracting excessive ticket prices from the emigrants.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Swedish emigration dropped dramatically just before the turn of the century, while remigration rose, as conditions in Sweden improved while those in the US deteriorated. Sweden underwent a rapid industrialization within a few years in the 1890s, and wages rose, principally in the fields of mining, forestry, and agriculture. (B 80) The "pull" from North America declined even more sharply, as the <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlement.html" title="Settlement">settlement</a> frontier reached the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific.html" title="Pacific">Pacific</a> in 1890 and ceased to exist. The price of land rose, and the US was torn by <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_capitalism.html" title="Monopoly capitalism">monopoly capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_unrest.html" title="Labor unrest">labor unrest</a>. No longer growing but instead settling and consolidating, the Swedish-American community seemed set to become ever more American and less Swedish. However, the new century saw a new influx.</p>

<p>Around 1910, one fifth of all Swedes had their homes in America.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> Defining themselves as Swedish <i>and</i> American, the strongly adhesive Swedish-American community showed great fascination with the old country and their own relationship to it.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> Many middle-aged or elderly immigrants returned briefly to Sweden for a nostalgic visit around the turn of the century, and many narratives and observations from these trips were published by the numerous and productive Swedish-American publishing companies.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> They testify to complex feelings, but express above all an eagerness to return to the Midwest. While the American travellers are moved by again meeting old friends and relations, and by the natural beauty, they are shocked by Swedish manners. Indignant at the drunkenness and public swearing, the pervasive inequality and the class pride of the privileged, the absurdities of royal ceremony, and most especially at the lack of respect for women, they return home with renewed pride in American culture. Poor women treated with contempt! Gentlemen taking liberties with waitresses! Compare Sw American self-appraisal, B 115 ff: peasants and working people become more refined and well-behaved in America. Simple girls become ladylike.</p>
