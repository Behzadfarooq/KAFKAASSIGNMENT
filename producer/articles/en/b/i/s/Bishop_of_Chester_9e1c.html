<p>Chester at various periods in its history had a bishop and a cathedral, though till the early sixteenth century only intermittently. Even before the Norman conquest the title Bishop of Chester is found in documents applied to prelates who would be more correctly described as <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Mercia_23b3.html" title="Bishop of Mercia">Bishop of Mercia</a> or even <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Lichfield_9f15.html" title="Bishop of Lichfield">Bishop of Lichfield</a>. After the Council of London in 1075 had decreed the transfer of all episcopal sees to cities, Peter, Bishop of Lichfield, removed his seat from Lichfield to Chester, and became known as Bishop of Chester. There he chose as his cathedral collegiate church of Saint John the Baptist, an arrangement which continued until <a href="../../../1/1/0/1102.html" title="1102">1102</a>.</p>
<p>The next bishop, however, transferred the see to Coventry on account of the rich monastery there, though he retained the episcopal palace at Chester. The Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield was of enormous extent, and it was probably found convenient to have something analogous to a cathedral at Chester, even though the cathedra itself was elsewhere; accordingly we find that the church of St John ranked as a cathedral for a considerable time, and had its own dean and chapter of secular canons down to the time of the Reformation. But the chief ecclesiastical foundation in Chester was the Benedictine monastery of St Werburgh, the great church of which finally became the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_Cathedral_01db.html" title="Chester Cathedral">Cathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary</a>. The site had been occupied even during the Christian period of the Roman occupation by a church dedicated to Ss. Peter and Paul, and rededicated to St Werburgh and St Oswald during the Saxon period. The church was served by a small chapter of secular canons until 1093, when <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_d%27Avranches%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chester_5e95.html" title="Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester">Hugh</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Chester_2397.html" title="Earl of Chester">Earl of Chester</a>, converted it into a great Benedictine monastery, with the co-operation of St Anselm, then Prior of Bec, who sent Richard, one of his monks, to be the first abbot. A new Norman church was built by him and his successors.</p>
<p>This monastery, though suffering loss of property both by the depredations of the Welsh and the inroads of the sea, prospered, and in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries the monks transformed their Norman church into a gothic building.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Chester_9e1c.html" title="Edit section: Tudor Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tudor Period</span></h2>
<p>The last of the abbots of Chester was John, or Thomas, Clark, who resigned his abbey, valued at £1,003 5s. 11d. per annum, to the king at the time of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries_9b7b.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>.</p>
<p>In 1541 <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, without papal sanction, created six new episcopal sees, one of which was Chester. The archdeaconry of Chester, from the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, and that of Richmond, from York, were combined to form the new see, and it was laid down that the abbey church, now the cathedral, was to be served by a dean and six prebends, the former abbot becoming the first dean. At first the diocese was annexed to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Canterbury_9ed0.html" title="Province of Canterbury">Province of Canterbury</a>, but by another Act of Parliament it was soon transferred to that of York. The first bishop was the Provincial of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmelite.html" title="Carmelite">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bird_41fc.html" title="John Bird">John Bird</a>, a doctor of divinity who had attracted the king's attention by his sermons preached against the pope's supremacy. Having already been rewarded by appointment as <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Bangor_aba0.html" title="Bishop of Bangor">Bishop of Bangor</a>, he was now translated to Chester. On the accession of Mary he was deprived as being a married man, and died as Vicar of Dunmow in 1556.</p>
<p>Despite the origins of the diocese, it was recognized by the Holy See for the space of Queen Mary's reign. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cotes_720a.html" title="George Cotes">George Cotes</a>, Master of Balliol and Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and lecturer in theology, was appointed bishop by the Holy See. In 1556 he was succeeded by <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Scott_ca44.html" title="Cuthbert Scott">Cuthbert Scott</a>, an able theologian and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University. On the accession of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a> he was one of the four Catholic bishops chosen to defend Catholic doctrine at the conference at Westminster, and immediately after this he was sent to the Tower and was deprived in 1559. Being released on bail, he contrived to escape to the Continent. He died at Louvain, on 9 October 1564.</p>
