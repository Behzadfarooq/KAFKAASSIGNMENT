<dd>That corpse you planted in the garden, has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? Oh keep the dog far hence, that's friend to men, or with his nails he'll dig it up again! No, I for one have stopped ANI'ing the dogstar. Just add any new pup to the category Sockpuppets of Thewolfstar (the sock tag will do that), and we'll have the whole lot of them in a tidy flock.

<p>Thank you, your majesty. My first order of business is to tell the prosecutor to shut the fuck up, and wipe that stupid fucking grin off his face becasue it's distraculating my case. Next, I'd like to announce that Randy and Lahey have been drinking all day and they're wasted out of their fuckin minds, and they're both assholes. And the testimony they just gave is total fuckin bullshit and I can prove it ... Clearly Cory and Trevor accepted money on film, and they admitted they stole gas. And they're sick. I mean, look at them. That's gas sickness. Fucking idiots. I got nothing else to say right now except that the Crown and Lahey can go fuck themselves. The defense rests, everybody can fuck off. Except you, I didn't mean you. But those two guys, and him.

<p>I just want to say that just because Lucy spent the night in the drunk tank, dosen't mean she's a bad mother, I mean, everyone spends nights at the drunk tank. I've been there about ten times, I'm sure you have and you guys have, it's not a big deal, just happens everyonce in a while. And the problem was that she lives with this girl named Sarah, who smokes a ton of weed, and that's what happens: When Lucy gets drunk, she's fine. She gets drunk and smokes a joint of hash, she's fine. She gets drunk and smokes a joint of weed, she's a different person. And that's why she ended up in the drunk tank, because of Sarah and her little weed joints. But as for the open liquor, I mean, I live in my car. My car is my home. So that should'nt have been open liquor anyway. You guys must have liquor around your house, probably all kinds of liquor; I'm sure you got liquor at your home. Cops pull you over in your house, how is that open liquor? Anyway, the big thing is [augh, just dropped my smoke there]: I'm gonna have a lot of money coming to me in the next couple of days, which, I'm not gonna tell you how I'm making it, but it's gonna be a lot of money. Gonna bail my dad out of jail and I'll buy a trailer. I'll be living there, Lucy will be living there, there's going to be lot's of people watching over Trinity, so this can't ever happen again. And you know, if you just release her, send her back to her mom; her mom is great, good mother. And I'll be looking after her once in a while when she is drinking, but other than that, she'll be always watched, and my dad can watch her when he's not drunk. But tonight I'm getting drunk, because it's my turn. Lucy got drunk yesterday and this is my day, so I'm gonna get her... I'm not gonna drink before she gets home, I'm gonna get her to Lucy, Lucy will be watching her, then I'll have some drinks. So, yeah, I think we're done here, and I'll just pick up my duaghter and take her home to Lucy. Get drunk. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 05:09, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The Bible or the ballot/ The bullet or the gun." Yeah, yeah, but any violent overthrow fostered by, designed by, led by, or containing non-proles is just another totalitarianism. Meanwhile, actual socialism of a non-19th-century-economic-theorist variety comes through the ballot, not the bullet, and leaves all alive, not some dancing on graves. I already have a religion and don't need to believe so fervently in one disgruntled Hegelian that I'll pass up social justice that doesn't fit his predictions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, "yeah yeah," this is no longer the 19th Century, some things change but some fundamentals stay the same. I have no need for a religion, and you'd be critically mistaken to confuse a breadth of vision with faith, or militant rhetoric with crude anarchoangst ... if you actually get down to whichever underlying particulars. I'm uninterested in prediction and prophecies, then, but am confident in the inevitability of certain things becoming explicable in the course of human history. Violence is tragic, but these <i>are</i> violent conditions and tragic times for billions of people. Hunger is violence, as is plunder. I want no violence, in any sense of the word, but I also know that the imperialists will (and have been) wage war over their continued ownership of the planet, and they are able to do it effectively because they are in power right now. At some point in time, the people will prove well-organized, well-led, and progressive enough to be able to defeat them. It may take hundreds of years, hopefuly less. But so long as the imperialists are allowed to exist as such, an existence which is indefinitely guranteed when accepting parliamentary and electoral machinations as a final strategy, there will be no end in sight, no possibility for a stable (not to mention, genuine and holistic) social justice. Obviosuly, I'm not calling for armed struggle in countries that are more suited at the present time to legal forms of struggle, I only emphasize on the revolutionary character that this struggle needs to take. Because I'm realistic about the lengths the imperialists will go to forever stay in power; on what it would take to overthrow them, and the realities that define the nature of their system, this system, the unfathomable toll it takes on humanity. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:01, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The one critical mistake there is assuming that "they" won't be "them." In the past, every armed revolution for justice has been led by someone who turns it to private benefit and who always intended to do so. Perhaps the Zapatistas are pure, but they also struggle not for The Revolution but for indigent rights. Imperialists will do anything to remain? Indeed. They'll coopt revolutions, join juntas, and this is when the revolutionaries and juntas don't decide to become ideological imperialists and justify their own economic parasitism by pointing to the bearded Hegelian instead of the periwigged republicans. The reason I applaud the Sandanistas, and few others, is that they were a democratic socialism and willingly stepped down when they lost elections. Only having the people continually controlling will enable anything like a socialist state; otherwise, it's one totalitarianism that becomes imperialistic vs. another. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:21, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a formerly revolutionary party sells out and becomes social imperialist, as the USSR and the PRC did, they need to be overthrown, too. But put back on track, not replaced with other imperialists. This is one of the lessons that needs to be drawn from the mistakes of the past. It isn't possible to build socialism in countries to the point where these contradictions no longer exist so long as one buys into these liberal-democratic games as the will of the people. Inhabitants of imperialist countries especially have been indoctrinated from a very early age not to intellectually surpass certain limitations which ultimately serve to defend the vital interests of the imperialists. This, then, is expressed even among more progressive tendencies, in romaticized and unscientific notions, ones which distort both the meaning of and relationality between democracy and dictatorship. While I applaud moderate progressive forces such as the Sandinistas and the Zapatistas (even Emiliano Zapata was ultimately a moderate progressive), I support the FARC-EP and others who offer a broader vision, one ultimately not bound by parochial localism. A socialist state is but one key stage of the struggle. It will not be possible to share power and resources in this planet in a natural and noncoersive way by envisioning socialist (or any) states existing indefinitely. But giving up on revolution because it might go wrong and one would need to take a few steps back before taking further steps forward, or even starting it all over, is far too deterministic and historically unhumble for me. The tired claim that the failure of revolutions in this past century are bound to be repeated in that sense for all centuries to come, is the sort of human nature argument that I reject and history has rejected; for ex., the supposed (sub)human nature of women, of different ethnic groups, and so on. Those contradictions once thought of as the final (biblical &amp; otherwise) word, are still with us to the detriment of all but the imperialists and their lackyes. With the contradiction of class gone, they too will become but a fleeting nightmerish memory. But with easily circumvented or suppressed electoralism as a final strategy, all these contradictions will remain a reality. I look beyond them. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 21:26, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you want to believe in History, because it shows the necessity of a revolution, but you don't want to believe in history that shows that every worker's revolution has been a totalitarian one? You want to relegate any concepts of representation to the dustbin because they were cooked up by gentry, but you want to hang onto concepts of classless societies <i>despite</i> their being concocted by a German gentry? You want the will of the people to be invisibly present in the future society, but you don't want to hear from them in any say on the government? And, if any particular historical example turns out to be corrupt, you want to say that it wasn't genuine. More, though, you say that people can't tell what they want because of their historical conditioning, and yet <i>you</i> can see what they should want <i>in spite of</i> historical conditioning. Finally, while you are against imperialism (presumably as an economic formation), you dismiss any local social justice in favor of those who believe in invading their neighbors to spread the good word of socialism. Sorry, but I'm of my own opinion still. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:49, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In chopped order:<br />
Q1. <i>So you want to believe in History, because it shows the necessity of a revolution, but you don't want to believe in history that shows that every worker's revolution has been a totalitarian one?</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A1. I don't believe every worker's revolution has been a totalitarian one, I do believe that inhabitants of imperialists countries have been indoctrinated from a very early age to think that.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q2. <i>You want to relegate any concepts of representation to the dustbin [of history&#160;?]</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A2. Far from relegating every concept of representation, I want ones the imperialists do not control, even indirectly, by virtue of owning the means of communication in that society, and so on.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q3. <i>Because they were cooked up by gentry [?]</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A3. I fail to see where I mentioned the gentry.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q4. <i>[B]ut you want to hang onto concepts of classless societies</i> despite <i>their being concocted by a German gentry?</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A4. I'm not following how that. Yes, the concept of a classless society, eventually. But inhabitants of imperialist countries have been indoctrinated to see such a stage as impossible or the opposite of what it is (i.e. as monolithic, boring uniformity, etc.)<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q5. You want the will of the people to be invisibly present in the future society, but you don't want to hear from them in any say on the government?<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A5. I want them to end up having more of a say, I just don't want to be an imperialist-dominated government. The dictatorship would be over the imperialists and the democracy of and by the people, the opposite of how it is now, where the imperialists impose their dictatorship (electoral &amp; otherwise illusions aside) over the people. But eventually, there will be no need of a government as we understand it.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q6. [I]f any particular historical example turns out to be corrupt, you want to say that it wasn't genuine.<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A6. If something (anything) turns out to be corrupt, than either it wasn't genuine to begin with, or at some point it stopped being genuine.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q7. <i>More, though, you say that people can't tell what they want because of their historical conditioning, and yet</i> you <i>can see what they should want</i> in spite of <i>historical conditioning[?]</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A7. Moi? In spite of and because of historical conditioning, with science and a correct scientific theory we can go beyond the abyss. But, no, it is revolutionary conditions that result in more people becoming open to what myself and my comrades are for, or nothing happens.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q8. <i>[W]hile you are against imperialism (presumably as an economic formation), you dismiss any local social justice in favor of those who believe in invading their neighbors to spread the good word of socialism.</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A8. Against imperialism in all its form, of course, though my focus is economic (for a reason). I far from dismissed local social justice, even when it is (what I think you meant to say) of a narrow scope. But I am for acting local and think global. Nor do I think (or anywhere said) that I support invasions or finds these particularly useful or progressive, though in some instances they may well be.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Q9. <i>Sorry, but I'm of my own opinion still.</i><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A9. `You would go into the militia yourself,' was Ernest's retort, `and be sent to Maine, or Florida, or the Philippines, or anywhere else, to drown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties. While from Kansas, or Wisconsin, or any other state, your own comrades would go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood your own civil-warring.' `Not when the government suspends civil law. In that day when you speak of rising in your strength, your strength would be turned against yourself. Into the militia you would go, willy-nilly. Habeas corpus, I heard some one mutter just now. Instead of habeas corpus you would get post mortems. If you refused to go into the militia, or to obey after you were in, you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down like dogs. It is the law.' <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 08:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In which the sun of the soul light<br />
Pierces the east of your body.</p>

<dd>Note also that you edited DG's page <i>twelve times</i> altogether in less than an hour and a half, against repeated and insistent requests to desist. And today you resumed. Seriously, just stop. As for your accusations of sockpuppetry, they are rather serious. You may consider yourself lucky that DreamGuy isn't one to bother with RfCing people, or running to admins to complain. (He hasn't been in contact with me.) I urge you to either try to verify the specific <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictrix_96b3.html" title="User:Victrix">User:Victrix</a> accusation, or retract it as publicly as you've made it. Sockpuppet verification is quite easy: all you have to do is place the evidence you have on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_CheckUser_53a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for CheckUser">Wikipedia:Requests for CheckUser</a> page, and if it's at all convincing (which I assume it is, since you've been making public accusations based on it), one of the CheckUser admins will perform an IP check. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:17, 31 May 2006 (UTC).

<p>"Teachers" is fine, "staff" would not have been. In American education, "staff" means administrative, janitorial, <i>etc.</i> personnel, and "faculty" means instructional and research personnel. Faculty members, even those in secondary education, find it insulting to be called staff members.

<dd>Hmm. Insulting? Hmmm. We do? Hmm. Staff/faculty is an operative distinction <i>within</i> education, but all faculty and staff are "staffing" outside of education. I don't think I mind being called a member of the staff, but I'm not staff. Even within, though, I wouldn't say that it's <i>insulting</i> to be accidentally referred to as staff. After all, "staff" includes administration, and they're in charge. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All right, I won't remove it again, but I'm sure other people will, if you restore it in the same form. Do you want to <i>sound</i> like you're not trolling?

<dd>I removed <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMccready_a493.html" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a>'s comment. He was recently given a short block for wikistalking SlimVirgin. The block was discussed and supported on AN/I. I see the comment I removed as uncivil and part of a pattern of tendentious editing. He has rigid thinking that shows up on Wikipedia as wikistalking, edit wars, and the inability to engage in consensus editing, and so on... We need to keep gently reminding him of our observations and enforcing <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_policy.html" title="Wikipedia policy">Wikipedia policy</a>.

I think I've even seen a bit of policy somewhere, to the effect that such trolling needs a good hefty block. The only question is whether a week will incur collateral damage, and these things--whether the IP is static or dynamic--are a closed book to me. Could you please ask aboout that on ANI? I'm just going out, sorry. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:43, 10 June 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I wonder, do you really think it will be necessary to go that far? - It seems to me to be rather like a tyre that's running out of air, one knows it's going to burst just when and where is the question.

<p>Umm, which one? I could expand the Areopagus by discussing the particular prosodic innovations of the group, but, because it's one of those critical retrospect terms rather than an actual, demonstrable movement, I feel a bit funny doing so. However, I clicked on one of the poet members I'd never heard of before -- complete 1911 dump, of course -- and it was quite sure that there was a 'movement' (but the 1911 was sure of everything). I think PEPP is a bit more cautious. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:48, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, a few things, first mea culpa for not actually bothering to check the history to see who left the calling card, er flag, and just assuming it was a regular contributor here, and jumping to the obvious identification. My bad. Second, your bragadaccio is noted, Giano, it's part of your "charm" to be so boastfully overblown. Captain of the waterboys would be more likely, in my view... Third, I have no idea about Sweden's performance in the World Cup, I barely even am aware of how the <b>US</b>, my home country, does (other than to characterise it as generally badly but roughly trending upwards?? I think??), as my primary interest is in witty repartee rather than sports, but someone who cared more could certainly look it up if so desired. Perhaps the relevance of Sweden could be explained, though? Were you jumping to conclusions too? (now THAT would be an interesting olympic sport!)

<p>Opinions on my unprotecting the article seem to vary quite drastically, above. Having reviewed the recent History, I have to say that the situation we're in with regard to AOL anons — who are basically unblockable — is more than a little absurd. There seems to be a bit of a break right now, but if another spate of hair-raisingly POV AOL edits starts up, I invite any admin to semiprotect again.

<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Duncombe_fd73.html" title="William Duncombe">William Duncombe</a> presents an interesting rationale. I've watchlisted the most current controversy, BTW. I also did <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Durand_2789.html" title="David Durand">David Durand</a> today, but it's so slight as to have been hardly worth the bother. The thing about Duncombe, though, is that his son married <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susanna_Highmore_7c98.html" title="Susanna Highmore">Susanna Highmore</a>'s daughter, and the <i>daughter</i> was a poet like the mother. Unlike the mother, though, she published <i>more than two poems.</i> (Why the DNB had an article on the mother, I don't know. Why I bothered to take notes on it and make an article here, I'm still wondering. "Woman poet 18th century" was about the only thing I could come up with in either case.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:22, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Errr...yeah. How do I list the references in different areas but make it so that it doesn't show up as there being 15 references when there are only 4? <a href="../../../k/s/c/User%7EKschwerdt514_fcf6.html" title="User:Kschwerdt514">Kschwerdt514</a> 04:45, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm... yep. If you simply use the &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;tags, as you've done, you'll get a new footnote every time. To only list each reference once, copy the way the notes are done in <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Byrne_6884.html" title="Simon Byrne">Simon Byrne</a>. Take a look at note 1, and see how the <b>abcde</b> business works when you click between the note numerals in the text and the reference at the bottom. Then open the article in edit mode and see how these notes are coded in the text. You see how the first of them (<b>a</b>) has the complete information, while the others (<b>bcde</b>) only have the <b>"name"</b>? The name for footnote 1 is "Svinth". To use this system, you need to invent a unique name for each of your 4 footnote numbers. (The <b>a'</b>s and <b>b'</b>s will be added automatically, don't write them anywhere.) Hope this helps. It's the most usual system, so it's the way to do it if you want to join the majority. (It's not the system I like or use myself, as it happens; I prefer to have the footnote numbers nicely ordered in the text and avoid the <b>abcde</b> mess, by making one footnote section <b>plus</b> one separate references section at the bottom, as in <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._A._Andree%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897_0ae2.html" title="S.

<p>Hey Bishonen, I was wondering if you could close this AfD for me. It's been up for eight days now; I'm not sure why it hasn't gotten shut. I got ahead of myself and deleted it earlier, but immediately thought better of it, as I was the nominator of the AfD and would prefer to do this by the book. Could you take a look and make a call on it?

<dd>Sorry for slowness and sloth in replying. That's a good discussion, lots of pertinent commentary. I'd have no problem with making the call (it's a "delete" in my book) , but I can't seem to get my head round the technicalities. I've closed very few AfD's, and I always forget how, in between.

<dd>Oh, I've never knowingly closed an AfD (or VfD, or indeed any other kind of XfD) - I think there are some templates or other that you are meant to add on either side of the discussion, but (a) I seldom participate in the destructive side of Wikipedia; and (b) I just nuke the ones that have a consensus to delete and let a wikignome sort out the legal niceties (and then feel guilty about not pulling my weight and revert to (a)).

<dd>My spies tell me that nuking the article and then waiting for the elves can be seen as sloppy or imperious by some folks. I'd do it, though, rather than go through the 40-50 pages of pages telling you where to find the pages that have superseded the old pages that used to tell you where the pages were that told you which page to go to do it properly. "Destructive" and "dark" side? It's just Wikipedia's alimentary canal. When sh*t goes it, it has to go out, and some part of the organization has to give it the shove.

<dd>Oh - "at" and "ab" - very neat. I may even remember that; on the other hand, perhaps I would rather be seen as sloppy and imperious: some of us admins have Important Thing To Do.

<dt>"Talk page vandalism</dt>
<dd>Deleting the comments of other users from article Talk pages, or deleting entire sections thereof, is generally considered vandalism. <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Removing personal attacks</a> is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long Talk page to a separate file and then remove the text from the main Talk page. <b>The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments at their discretion, except in cases of warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors."</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope you can see the contradiction here. Additionally, if the warnings are justified, then what makes them being posted by me any less valid then an Admin posting them? I was personally attacked by a user in an RfA and no Admin took any action. In an effort to prevent additional attacks, I placed the warning template prepared by the Wikipedia Community. Please note the hypocrisy, because if an Admin was attacked and their warning was removed twice, they would have blocked this user. I look forward to all this being cleared up, because they tags are valid, and from as far as I can see on the VANDAL policy page, they should remain because deleting them simply serves to mislead other editors. Do I have this wrong? If I don't I would appreciate if you would put them back because right now this user mistakingly thinks their attack posts to me are just fine. The first time they personally attacked me an Admin removed the warnings despite another Admin saying they were justifiable. Perhaps that is why they attacked me again and again.

<dd>Hi, PoolGuy, I understand it's confusing. That text you quote isn't in any of the pages you link to — I'm not sure where it comes from. Is it <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a>? If so, or in any case, please see the top of that page, to see that the whole issue is contested and contradictory. See all those links to policy pages, and especially the comments on them? Also please note that the bit you quote has in the past said "which they are generally <i>discouraged</i> from removing" —discouraged, not prohibited — and right now actually says "discouraged/prohibited"! The page changes rapidly, it's only a proposal: <b>not</b> a policy or guideline. Anyway. The central point for you to be concerned with, I suggest, isn't really whether BH's behavior is proper, but whether <i>yours</i> is. That's the only thing you have control over and for that, I might refer you to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_pages_8576.html#Etiquette" title="Wikipedia:Talk pages">Wikipedia:Talk pages#Etiquette</a> (a guideline): "...However, reverting such removals or redirects <b>is not proper and may result in a block for edit warring</b>. If someone removes your comments without answering, consider moving on or <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. This is especially true for vandalism warnings." In the final analysis, PoolGuy, please just use common sense. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a system of law</a>. Take a look at the history tab for BH's talkpage. Surely you can <i>see</i> the guy's being harassed, and by whom?

<dd>Thank you for trying to clear it up. Perhaps my comments will assist in making this clear for us both. First, the quoted section I used was from the official Wikipedia policy of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a>. It is fourth from the bottom of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL#Types_of_vandalism</a>. In this policy the key phrase appears to be "remove and archive comments". The conjunction used stipulates that two actions are generally permitted, the removal 'and' the archiving. It is not the removal 'or' the archiving. In this instance there is removal without any archiving, which on its face appears contrary to the spirit of the section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, "in cases of warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing" the section is modified with a more stringent criteria. The higher criteria appears because the removal of warnings serves to mislead others, and the removal then constitutes vandalism.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Third, while you have tried to reference the proposed <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing_warnings</a>, by my read you have even mischaracterized its intent. I understand that reaching concensus is still underway with that proposed policy, however its spirit mirrors what is actual official policy in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a>. Please read this quote from the page.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>"Removing warnings</dt>
<dd>Removing warnings for vandalism from one's talk page is also considered vandalism. However, after a reasonable time has elapsed, archiving one's talk page, including the vandal warning, is acceptable. Editors may be subject to a minor block for archiving prematurely so as to hide warnings."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It clearly proposes that removing the warnings is vandalism. It goes on to suggest there are some instances where archival would be acceptable. In this case we are dealing with a user who is simply deleting, not archiving. It goes on to state:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Furthermore WP:VAND states: Removing warnings, whether for vandalism or other forms of prohibited/discouraged behavior, from one's talk page is also considered vandalism. It is generally acceptable to remove misplaced vandalism tags, as long as the reasoning is solid."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This part of the proposal indicates if the tags are misplaced, then with established reasoning, the tags can be removed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bonafide.hustla has not provided solid reasoning, nor have the comments been archived. Based upon the spirit of both <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing_warnings</a>, this is the action of vandalism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am disappointed that you are suggesting that I am edit warring. First and foremost, Bonafide.hustla is the one who found targeted and personally attacked me without me ever talking to him. I am the one who has been pursued, and would sincerely appreciate if an Admin would actually do something to discourage his behavior. Bonafide.hustla personally attacked me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PoolGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50372628" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PoolGuy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50372628" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, I placed an NPA tag on their talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> which was subsequently removed by an Admin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. (As an aside, this Admin has been pursuing me and taking baseless administrative action against me since March. They follow me where I post, and try to influence other Admins to work against me. The RfA that they started against me is about to conclude <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/PoolGuy/Proposed_decision" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/PoolGuy/Proposed_decision" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and the ArbCom has resoundingly shown that I truly did not not violate policy warranting their Administrative pursuit. The Admin has continued to pursue me and their actions are the underlying cause for Bonafide.hustla attacking me initially then continuing to attack me.) I attempted to restore the tag <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABonafide.hustla&amp;diff=50702726&amp;oldid=50695597" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABonafide.hustla&amp;diff=50702726&amp;oldid=50695597" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, however the Admin continued to remove it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50702726" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=50702726" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> despite support from another Admin relative to its validity <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANlu&amp;diff=50707335&amp;oldid=50545548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANlu&amp;diff=50707335&amp;oldid=50545548" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. I would like to state that the action of this Admin has caused this user to think that it is perfectly alright to personally attack me. In fact, after this, they inserted themself into my RfA despite their only interaction with me was to personally attack me. When I refuted their evidence in the RfA they attack me again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FPoolGuy%2FEvidence&amp;diff=57137948&amp;oldid=56266012" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FPoolGuy%2FEvidence&amp;diff=57137948&amp;oldid=56266012" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FPoolGuy%2FEvidence&amp;diff=57323681&amp;oldid=57305879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FPoolGuy%2FEvidence&amp;diff=57323681&amp;oldid=57305879" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> in an RfA, and no Admin assists with warning this user. Considering the lack of Admin support, and even encouragement, I hope you can appreciate why I must tag this user for their violations.</dd>

<dd>Your implication that I am edit warring would suggest that I have simply been adding tags and not engaging in any dialogue.

In each of these instances where this has advanced the Admin in question has tried to turn other Admins against me, and the result has remained that there has been support for the tags placement. The only thing that is missing is an Admin actually taking action to warn Bonafide.hustla that their comments are not appropriate for Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You suggest that since Bonafide.hustla has obviously read the warnings, that is sufficient. I don't agree. On ANI <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive109#PoolGuy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive109#PoolGuy" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> Bonafide.hustla states that he thinks the tags are not justified. Your action of removing my valid tags <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABonafide.hustla&amp;diff=58508265&amp;oldid=58495967" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABonafide.hustla&amp;diff=58508265&amp;oldid=58495967" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, even after another Admin warned him about his vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59504947" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59504947" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> will only serve to make Bonafide.hustla think it is ok to continue to attack me and other users. I ask that you appreciate the history of this, read and understand the spirit of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL#Types_of_vandalism</a> and restore the tags and explain to Bonafide.hustla whay he should not attack other users. I must stress that your removal of those tags implies to Bonafide.hustla that they are invalid, and he is free to continue attacking me. Your discussion with me about my action is fine, but removing valid tags completely undermines what Bonafide.hustla should learn.</dd>

<dd>I understand that you think I should be responsible for myself and I believe that is what I have to do. Absent action from Admins (and even their pursuit of me and facilitation of this user personally attacking me) I must act to enforce Wikipedia policy (without authority to block I can only post). I would really appreciate it if you would do so in your role as an Admin, rather than threatening to block me (to me it seems absurd that as the one who was attacked the only threat of block comes to me). Your assistance would truly help. Thank you. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">PoolGuy</a> 05:47, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>PoolGuy, the reason I'm giving you a block warning for talkpage harassment is simply the look of BH's page history tab. I hope you took a look at it, as I suggested. I'm sorry if you feel this is unfair, but I stand by it. Look: your warnings aren't vandalism warnings (and thank you for that, as they shouldn't be). They're about civility and personal attacks, a field that is absolutely notorious for being subjective and debatable, so they're by no means automatically "valid warnings" even though you posted them in good faith. Please take a look at the talkpage of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDAL_b36a.html" title="WP:VANDAL">WP:VANDAL</a> if you want to see how problematic the whole thing is considered to be. There's a lot of food for thought on that page. If you'd rather insist on the (ever-changing and highly contested) letter of the the law, I think you will still agree that a sentence formulated like this is no iron-clad rule: "The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments at their discretion, except in cases of warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors." They are <b>generally</b> (=not under all circumstances) prohibited from removing warnings, <b>especially</b> where the intention is to mislead'. "Generally" means "not always", and "especially" again emphasizes "not always". Personally, I find the most natural reading, of the "intention to mislead" bit to be that it applies to anonymous silly-kid vandals removing <i>incontestable and self-evidently true</i> warnings about <i>vandalism</i>--you know, <b>not</b> warnings about being in somebody's (inevitably subjective) opinion incivil, but warnings about inserting "RYAN IS SO GAY LOLZ" on article pages. Anyway, there is nothing ironclad about the rule you quote, it's rather formulated as an encouragement to use common sense, which I would again exhort you to heed. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:16, 21 June 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I am extremely disappointed in your statements. In short, a user attacked me, I felt attacked, no Admin took action, I placed tags expressing what I thought was valid and other Admins even agreed with. The user and an Admin removed the tags saying that the warnings are not justified. I was attacked twice more with no Admin action. I try to warn again, with the same response, Admin support, but the user and Admin still claim it is not justified and basically say I can be called a d!ck and told to get a life all they want. Now you come in to threaten blocking me because of your confusion regarding an official wikipedia policy. You don't like how his talk page history looks and you conveniently ignore all of the context surrounding the user's actions. If you ignore it, I ignore it, and another Admin encourages it, this user will do it again... disappointing.</dd>

<dd>While I am disappointed, I will leave it be, but if I am attacked again, I will not ignore it, and I will post a tag again, and I will await you blocking me because I was attacked. That has no common sense, but I will go along with it since you can block me and I am now told that the policy is not iron-clad but simply a policy developed by concensus that Admins can ignore at will.</dd>

<p>Thank you all for your kind copy-edits and attacks on my foot-note system, yes it is a pity there are only four ref books (actually realy three, as one was only something unconnected) which will cause some-one to comment on FAC: "not enough references". While I appreciate yoor efforts (Paul - I can't actually see what you have done!) could I just point out the page is nt in fact finished, it has yet to have its section titled "Abdication and the broken heart" This will be a very moving and poignant section in which Lord Brownlow drives the Duchess of Windsor away from Belton and the King to France, with her soft tears echoing in his heart! Namely he has a broken heart because he has just realised he has backed the wrong side and knows he is about to be hacked up by the new <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon_de74.html" title="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon">Queen</a>, who was at that time not a cuddly old granny, but when thwarted, a very unpleaseant piece of work.

<li>No Giano can't teabag, and Y-front briefs are surely only worn by nerdy Brits whose parents hate them by giving them daft names. As for the code Paul, I'm sure there is a Lady in Japan waiting just for you, would you like me to notify her of your existence? - NO!, I thought not. So you know what you can do with your code - don't you? Is it the fact you are going to loose to us in the footie realy hurts? - You surely don't immagine I would rub it in and mention it at every opportunity for the next four years do you? <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 18:24, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think Paul, like poor dear BoG you are becoming exitable, and should calm down, it is only natural that you should need a magnifying glass - self examination is very important in those over 50, I was only reading a very interesting poster in the doctor's waiting room the other day. You Brit's all have an (understandable) obsession with size, it must be very troubling for you all, but apparently it does not matter in the least (<small>if you beleive that you will beleive anything</small>).

<dd>It was an ugly game all the way around, but the USA did better than I expected. There was a huge difference in the game, in the US, depending upon whether you listened to satellite radio with broadcasters who follow all soccer all the time or the stupid TV people who appeared to think it was a baseball game. To say that they were out of their depth was an understatement. While radio complained about ticky fouls getting called early, they thought the redcard was well deserved (an elbow to the eyesocket of the guy who just scored on you). The TV people thought that there weren't any fouls being called and that all the yellow and red cards were just the refs messing things up.

<dd>The inept ABC announcers liked the eye-gouging red-card (and were impressed that the ref saw it, since it was pretty quick) and they also liked the offsides call on the goal, the one that had the US coach in near-hysterics. They didn't like any of the sliding-tackle red- or yellow- cards. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:37, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Paul - Oh dear how can I explain this, you seem a little confused - <b>footie</b> is a game where one kicks a ball about a field with lots of other men, <b>footsie</b> is an altogether different game, played likewise with the feet, but discretly under a dining room table with another man's wife.

<dd>Mmmmmm I'm not happy with it either, I probably would vote for it on FAC, but only because I wrote it! Problem is people don't like sunkissed, I've shortened it by shunting the beautiful Duchess and the strong limbed aristo off to a "royal watcher's" <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_Cust%2C_6th_Baron_Brownlow_c8a1.html" title="Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow">delight</a> of their own (even the wretched man's name makes me wince, his parents must have loathed him on sight), I'll have another drastic prune. Then of course we have the cite v footnote fiasco (sorry I know you hate that word) I think the (Smith, 245) method is distracting, but the little numbers method tempt people to click away in exited anticipation, they should be reserved for thrilling and gossipy peices of information that are a little off subject, but will entertain or enlighten the reader - I jave a couple of those, but should they be muddled up with all the fact citing - poor dear Agatha Christe never had these problems with writing her exiting books. I can see the page's problems just not quite get my mind arownd them. Anyhow I must do some proper work.

<p>Bishonen, would you consider counseling <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">User:His excellency</a> to remove the remaining personal attacks from his talk page, or removing them yourself? I don't mind him <i>quoting</i> me (though diffs are always helpful), but his section title is personalized, inflammatory, unsupported by the material contained in this section, and, most germanely to this discussion <i>false</i>. Other false claims, such as the allegation of homosexuality, also remain. I removed one section, but he reverted it. Block or no block, Wikipedia should not provide a platform for false and malicious claims.Timothy Usher 00:08, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since you're OK with the section itself — as you say, it's almost wholly made up of quotes from you — you mean will I counsel His Excellency to remove the heading "My charge that Timothy Usher is in fact a bigot", right? (Or remove it myself.) I'm afraid I won't. Sorry. You speak of that heading as if it said "Timothy Usher is in fact a bigot"; it doesn't, and I think the distinction matters. His E is discussing Tom Harrison's block reason — stating his case against it, defending himself against it, arguing that he shouldn't have been blocked for it. That's what blocked users do, at least very often they do, and I would be cautious in hamstringing anybody's self-defense; I think it's a context where latitude is necessary. I understand that you don't like the section title, I even sympathise, but I think there's a logic to it, <i>as a description of his self-defense</i>. I have blocked him for calling you a bigot, you know. When you speak of other false claims on His E's page, I'd like to look further before I reply to your request to have them removed. Please tell me what and where they are, especially the homosexuality allegation. I don't see them on a quick read-through, and the page is rather long. I presume you're not talking about the section you removed yourself, since that <i>is</i> the section with the heading "My charge..." etc, and you specify these as being <i>other</i> false claims. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:49, 21 June 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I removed his "butt buddy" comment as well. Think Google, Bishonen. If you think it acceptable that my name pops up with a screaming headline calling me a bigot, preceded by "My Charge that" or not...well, think again.

<dd>We're not responsible for Google, though, and Bishonen's right: it's his talk page, and he labelled it according to what he wanted to do. We can't take responsibility for what some postulated person might understand from a search. Those of us jealous of our real life identities use assumed names on Wikipedia, and those who use real names are, more or less, accepting that this online world is going to be irresponsible with that name. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You know, Ranelagh and the various Augustan gardens are amazingly involved subjects. One neat thing, though, is that they kind of evolved from the established habit of the mall. St. James, in particular, had <i>become</i> something like a pleasure garden, when it had begun just as an open space. As fashionable folks did the promenade, other people (mercantile people) showed up to entertain and furnish them. Therefore, when there were developed public spaces, they sort of settled on classical models that would match reality. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You have written to me four times now, and the first three included threats to block me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your first post to me started with the gentle "Desist immediately if you don't want to be blocked. And, yes, I have clicked on your links in the exchange immediiately above, and see nothing which justifies this kind of harassment. It doesn't make any difference if your warnings are justified"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I did try to dialogue with you and explain the situation and my understanding of the official policy as a victim of an unwarranted attack. What I got from you was threat, threat, threat. Please forgive me if I don't view block threats as speaking as one grown-up to another, appealing to a better side, or treating me with respect. They are just a standard bullying technique that appear to me to be regularly employed by some Admins.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am a very reasonable person and very willing to dialogue, however after my treatment from other Admins, I am increasingly disenchanted with them, their disregard for the communities' policies, and frequent attempts to make up policy violations to justify their need to take administrative action. I apologize if you don't behave like this, but if you read my RfAr you can see why I am disenchanted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What really got me with your post is that you stated that civility and personal attacks are absolutely notorious for being subjective and debatable. Your statements make it seem like you don't consider them worthy to warn other users about. Of course you threatened to block me over harassment, which is a form of a personal attack. You made a subjective call, which the user didn't even allege. To me that is quite hypocritical.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course the worst part is I took time to demonstrate that I felt as if I was the victim of a personal attack. That must have some validity. Yet your comments and actions make it look like the situation is somehow my fault. If the user didn't attack me three times, with the encouragement of another Admin, I would not have had to post a tag on their talk page. Given all the attention it has received, and the comments from other Admins that I was justified, why didn't someone else warn the user. He clearly does not veiw my post as legitimate, so someone should help me. By removing my post from his talk page, you helped him, not me, and I was the one he repeatedly attacked.</dd>

If I had access to a better library right now, I'd offer to help write about the architectural losses, and the reconstrucion. However, I am not close enough to one, and have to make do with purchases on Amazon, with a meagre budget. I could use a monograph on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Wren_3129.html" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a> though. Anyway, hope all is well. <a href="../../../d/v/d/User%7EDVD_R_W_e2d2.html" title="User:DVD R W">DVD</a>+ <a href="../../../d/v/d/User_talk%7EDVD_R_W_d778.html" title="User talk:DVD R W">R/W</a> 19:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A <i>very</i> new user.&#160;:-( I'll be frank, Tups. I don't think you made it quite clear to CBW what your focus was, i.e. the newbie-biting, the lack of talking with the user and lack of a friendly voice explaining what the problem was. I thought you indirect. CBW seems to have taken your post as complaining that it shouldn't have been a speedy; only that, no more nor less. Yet that wasn't your point. If I were you, I would write to CBW more explicitly. Incidentally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CambridgeBayWeather&amp;diff=60366907&amp;oldid=60332166" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CambridgeBayWeather&amp;diff=60366907&amp;oldid=60332166" rel="nofollow">this</a> worried me a little. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I was actually hoping that CBW would realize the problem himself once I have made it clear that this was not just some teenager copying pieces of text on space thingies from a random website, but a professional astronomer posting text from a website where he is quite possibly one of the authors.

<dd>ROX, I don't know about the articles you mention (this is my bedtime, I'm not checking anything more today), but please stop harassing BH by reverting his talkpage. The 3RR doesn't apply to him reverting his own page. If anybody's violating the 3RR on it, it's you. Please compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PoolGuy&amp;diff=59545138&amp;oldid=59370513" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PoolGuy&amp;diff=59545138&amp;oldid=59370513" rel="nofollow">my warning of Poolguy</a> (now blocked for bootless wikilawyeriing) and following dialogue with him. It's a mystery to me why people want to get dug into this kind of trench warfare over another person's talkpage; you realize, of course, that he has <i>read</i> your warnings, so what's your point? Do you want them kept there as a form of <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_humiliation.html" title="Public humiliation">public humiliation</a>? That's not what Wikipedia is about.

<dd>I'm not trying to harass BH by reverting his talk page. He is deleting valid warnings from his talk page which constitutes vandalism according to the policy. Currently BH is very close to breaking the 3RR on the articles mentioned above and some other articles, he has been POV pushing on many Taiwan-related articles, even an admin reverted his POV pushing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_of_Taiwan&amp;diff=60580644&amp;oldid=60572231" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Culture_of_Taiwan&amp;diff=60580644&amp;oldid=60572231" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The policy clearly states that the offender have to be warned about it before someone can report him for 3RR and that the offender is not allow to hide warnings by deleting them. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">RevolverOcelotX</a> 01:57, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jag måste be om ursäkt för det sjukt dåliga klimatet på svenska Wikipedia. Det finns vissa som tror att Wikin är till för reglerna och inte tvärtom och kan inte förstå, hur många gånger jag än upprepar det, att man måste använda sin känsla för vad som är bäst för Wikipedia och inte blint följa reglerna. Ett bra exempel är ju att man ska vara vänlig och förstående mot andra användare. Jag ber återigen om ursäkt. /<a href="../../../g/r/%C3%B6/User%7EGr%C3%B6n_468f.html" title="User:Grön">Grön</a> <sup><a href="../../../../sv/g/r/%C3%B6/Anv%C3%A4ndardiskussion%7EGr%C3%B6n_1a59.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Användardiskussion:Grön">sv</a></sup> 09:15, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was the same way when I registered there two years ago. I wonder if the Swedish Wikipedia will ever outgrow its problems, especially as they seem to be self-perpetuating. I concluded some time ago that Sweden is just too small and that the Swedish Wikipedia will probably never get the critical mass needed to create an encyclopedia according to this model. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 10:12, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, note that <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boudoir.html" title="Boudoir">boudoir</a> does not say that the Duchess of Bedford <i>invented</i> the meal - merely that the <i>English</i> custom of afternoon tea was <i>developed</i> in her boudoir (emphasis added). The link I provided above says that she is "credited with introducing afternoon tea to England in around 1830" (introducing, note) and it goes on "The habit was also happening in France, as it crops up in the work of Madame de Sévigné" (over 100 years earlier). <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madame_de_S%C3%A9vign%C3%A9_3906.html" title="Madame de Sévigné">Madame de Sévigné</a> is strangely silent on this contribution to world culture, though.

<dd>Both books are very specific that she took tea in the Blue Drawing Room, and English Ladies of that era had "sitting rooms" they did not have Boudoirs (which would have smacked of tarts -No! - not the edible afternoon kind).

<p>Regarding the <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butter_knife.html" title="Butter knife">butter knife</a> article: I never heard anyone born after 1920 refer to a table knife as a <i>case knife</i>, and then only if they were "country", and I was born in Atlanta and my grandparents were from Tennessee. The two knives pictured are <i>master</i> butter knives, and the caption correctly notes they are to remain with the butter dish and not be used for spreading. However, the caption refers to them simply as "butter knives" and goes on to state that a <i>side knife</i> is used for the actual spreading, while in the US we would use the individual, or personal, butter knife. Are they the same thing, and it is an English/American terminology difference? I never heard of a side knife, and if someone were to use the term I would think <i>table knife</i> not <i>butter knife</i>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 11:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening Pretty Girl,</p>
<p>Is there any chance wikipedia can lock the MMY article as it now looks? The controversy seems to be gone - but I fear the moment the Christian Fundamentalists turn their attention to it and once again tears it apart..</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Peterklutz 00:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No chance, sorry. The protection policy is very conservative: protection is to be used as little as possible, for as short periods as possible, and never preemptively, only to stop ongoing and acute vandalism or edit warring. And not on a particular, selected version, either. I'll add the article to my watchlist, and please get in touch again if you see an acute problem. P.S. You really shouldn't ask people what the purpose of their existence is, you know. Please be nice. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:40, 27 June 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>If I see an aucte problem..? It's a war going on&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Why won't Quapeds admit that MMY was a disciple of Brahmananda Saraswati (BS)? Because BS is above critiscism and don't want to admit that MMY had this relationsship with him. It's the same with Maharishi's name, some of the die-hards won't even call Maharishi for Maharishi, since the word i sanskrit means great seer - which they don't like to call Maharsihi. The rationale is the same when these people dig up forty-fifty year old allegations of inappropriate conduct (like eating chicken) and plaster them all over the articles - they just want to destroy the guy and his work.</p>
<p>I understand this can be a bit confusing for outsiders, it sure is to me.</p>

<dd>I restored the disciple bit, I don't see why not, either. And removed some "his holiness" embroidery that had, oddly, been left in there. But my start for a copyedit and NPOV version got reverted back to your pro-TM (and, may I mention, hair-raisingly POV) version by an IP. You, was it? You know, I think I'll just semiprotect the article, so people have to at least have an identity to edit it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Will the article remain frozen? For how long?</p>
<p>Is he and his kind going to beat the system/your attempt to find resolution by now staying away - simply to return when the article's protection level is lowered again (at which time their editorial crippling and threats to fellow editors will come back in full swing)?</p>

<dd>I plan on keeping that sucker fully protected until a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> version is agreed on the talkpage. Perhaps I should put up a note saying so. If any regular editor should stay away during that process, consensus simply won't include them.

<p>Peterklutz, the last thing you need to worry about is my going away. The very last thing. TMers have been hopping on their butts and praying that I go away now for 15 years. You need to understand that I'm a dedicated TM cult watcher -- for life. That's what happens when any group brings a <a href="../../../s/l/a/SLAPP_4483.html" title="SLAPP">SLAPP</a> suit against me to stop me from investigating and exposing their misconduct. They acquire a devoted follower for life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the block is because of my talkpage anyway Just a little update after my wikibreak. If I was blocked, I find RevolverOcelotX had even more reasons to be blocked. The point is, I did not do anything wrong, not a single thing against the wikipedia regulation. Damages on my rep. had already been done by this unjustified block, so anyway all I'm asking is can u ask the blocking admin to post on my talkpage saying the block was a mistake?

<p>I posted it on AN/I. The posts I blocked him for are for the last few days. I didn't even look at the posts that Tim made on PAIN. I work overnight and I saw all of this just before I went to bed. So I hadn't had a chance to really go through the guy's contribs of the last few days until the last few hours. Btw, the idea that only extreme personal attacks are blockable isn't always true. Persistant personal attacks, no matter how extreme they are, are also generally blockable. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 04:50, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>See, that's not acceptable as a protection reason, I'm sorry I didn't make it clear last time you asked for article protection. It's 180° the wrong way around. Articles get protected for being battlegrounds, not for being stable. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:36, 29 June 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>I would request complete unprotection, on the same rationale.--quadpus 18:37, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Complete? The article is <a href="../../../s/e/m/Wikipedia%7ESemiprotection_3c63.html" title="Wikipedia:Semiprotection">semi-protected</a> right now. This means all accounts more than 96 hours old can edit it, but younger accounts and IPs can't. I semiprotected in order to somewhat calm the edit war by at least preventing people from evading the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> by IP-hopping. Preventing IPs from editing is in general a Bad Thing, and semiprotection isn't a state I <i>like</i> the article to be in, but with highly contested articles it can be helpful. You want me to unprotect completely? Or did you just mean you don't want it <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">fully protected</a>, i. e. locked, the way <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendental_Meditation_4184.html" title="Transcendental Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> is?

<dd>It seems like Peterklutz was only using IPs because had a habit of not logging in before editing, it doesn't <i>quite</i> seem like anyone was using IPs to evade 3RR on that article.

<p>On an unrelated note, I hope you don't mind that I didn't file a statement at E.E.'s RFAr. It's not because I think the RFAr is inappropriate (quite the opposite, in fact), it's just that I'm a little burned from this entire fiasco and would rather see the back of it.

<dd>Let's go through this step by step. I wrote on George's page, "while the abusive user Bishonen defends insists upon maintaining an attack section on his user talk page":
<ul>
<li>"the abusive user Bishonen defends" can, according to Standard English usage ("defends" is the predicate of the relative clause, else "defends insists" would be ungrammatical), only be His excellency. Prior to the time of this post, you'd been defending His excellency on ANI against his first indef block. Do you deny that?</li>
<li>And at the time of this post, His excellency maintained an attack section on his user talk page. Do you deny that?Timothy Usher 01:27, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, quite, I do see that the sentence can be read that way. But weren't you trying to post some basis (="Evidence") for your claim that I was "defending" HE's "supposed right to defame" you? You say the claim you made on June 20th was based on my edit of June 21st...? If it's possible for you to ever simply <i>reply</i> to something, as opposed to changing the subject and doing a <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-step_%28dance_move%29.html" title="Two-step (dance move)">two-step</a>, try doing it now. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:48, 30 June 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>His indef block, against which you defended him, was for defaming me on another talk page, was it not? And you shortened this blocked on 17:10, 19 June 2006, correct? The diff to which your time machine comment was aimed illustrates you explicitly defending his right to engage in this behavior - a position which was already implicit in your posts to ANI, and in your shortening of his block with a friendly message without counsel to refrain from further attacks; indeed, he continued them - as you're the one who'd shortened his block, I asked you to do something about it, which you refused to do, as shown. You'd referred ANI readers back to the FairNBalanced report, insisting that H.E.'s behavior be viewed in this context (<i>what</i> context, I wonder?) and delayed this report from archiving. The most straightforward construal is that you believed HE's vicious and calculated attacks on Christians, Jews, Anglos and other editors to be somehow <i>understandable</i> in light of FNB's image upload, and the conversation that followed. And now, lo, you've returned to ANI on the occasion of his second indef block to lend him another helping hand against what was otherwise a consensus.Timothy Usher 02:38, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I guess it wasn't possible. But I do understand that the conjunction "abusive user Bishonen" was a grammatical accident, thank you for clearing up that part. Incidentally, did you see that without me it would have been a consensus for exactly one minute longer, until Geogre weighed in? If you choose to discount Aminz' protest, that is. But that's not a point I want to argue, as I think it no shame to be reckoned she who objected to an indefinite block without process. Your far-fetched "construals" are your own affair. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 06:18, 30 June 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Might you explain, then, why you saw it fit to link the H.E. report to the FairNBalanced report - in which, for that matter, did you not argue for precisely such an indefinite block (this for a user who'd never been blocked or even so much as warned)?Timothy Usher 06:28, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've changed the subject yet again, but that's alright. He wasn't a new user, actually, he'd had a reasonable number of contributions under FNB, but, I'm curious: who are you saying was he before? H.E. also alleged this, but I've honestly no idea who he or you had in mind. If you're willing to be specific, I can look it over, and possibly agree with you. Still, it'd be nice were you to answer my questions.Timothy Usher 07:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Therefore, it is making fun of making fun of religious beliefs, and arguably he would be asking why she was making fun of the "religious" belief in evolution, which doesn't make a lot of sense, and this ignores the fact that it has nothing whatever to do with either Darwin, fish, or the ichthus and is, instead, about "bishzilla." He might as well be asking why she's making fun of Toho studio executives. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:19, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes Dear I am getting your emails - all of them, fret not - but for some reason I can't send emails, the goat in the treadmill at the power station has probably been shagging again. I've ben mulling over you idea about covering just the aftermath of the fire, its effects and impact etc., that would certainly be more FA-able, and is a subject yet to be covered anywhere really. We would have to go though quite deeply into restoration politics, social history and architecture before the fire to give an explanation to what came after. I've an old dissertation that was published years ago roughly on the subject - does that count as original re-search though - I think though we could be stumped for refs in the direction you suggest? If we are doing this - lets go deep. I'm back on Tuesday think on it. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 21:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, you should keep those goats in order, how many times do I have to tell you. Referring to your own published work is fine, theoretically—it's not OR—I always try to avoid it, though, for privacy reasons. The most interesting side to me is the plight of the common people, the unrecorded lives—but if they're <i>really</i> unrecorded they're right out, obviously. I'll see what I can dig up. There's a colleague at the anthropology department here who may be helpful.

<dd>I couldn't agree more, I love common people too, all that joyful singing and dancing, (one hardly likes to ask why they don't concentrate their efforts on getting a job) - anyway rest assure I have the goats harnessed for treadmill work, the common people too, and once I'm back in the civilized world you will see the results of my efforts.

<dd>I just know I'm missing something here. I have a good idea of who linked me here, but I'm not really seeing the reason for it. Anyway, Bishi is right. Be opinionated and skeptical on Requests for Adminship and you will receive praise for your insight and participation. Fight vandals relentlessly and stop assuming good faith from IP editors, for it will portray you as a brave defender of the Wikipedia, a valiant warrior whose selfless vandal-bashing promotes the encyclopedia's integrity. Whenever people group together to consider a community-issued ban, always support it and cite some random edit which that person made, and everybody will applaud your participation in the bureaucratic process. (Note my sarcasm. In all honesty, if you follow the above, you WILL become popular, even if you lose a bit of your soul in the process. Instead, I advocate editing simply, staying away from controversial articles, assuming good faith, and attempting to be excellent in all endeavors.) The choice is yours.

<dd>I'm totally confused by this. Who claimed "while" to be a pronoun? The quoted text is but one clause excerpted from a longer sentence. "While" means roughly, "at the same time as." There's no problem here.Timothy Usher 01:09, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I figured it deserved subst:ing for being a template about the importance of subst:ing, you know? I mean, why do we subst warning templates? It's so the person will feel more personally addressed, isn't it? I mean, I've never believed it's because the user might otherwise put inappropriate content into them or something. If they're going to do that, they can just as easily delete the whole template, or whatever. So, and this is my point, why not allow the user who gets the TestTemplaters on his/her page to also feel that there is a human at the other end? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC).

<p>First of all, thanks for <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and asking me what was meant by the RfC comment I posted. I don't intend to start an RfC on the users who vote against me -- obviously that's their perogative and I welcome whatever contributions they would like to add to this open source wiki. However, the opposition to my RFA has revealed some interesting problems with how a large number of wikipedians view the "Administrator" role here at Wikipedia. In particular, I was taken aback by what seems to be implicit an idea that administrators are somehow only worthy of support if they show a particular brand of Wikiculture and accept a view of that administrator status is something of a badge-of-honor. In a project where ignore all rules is a feature, it seems peculiar that the community would see fit to guard a set of tools so closely even when it is clear that the person who wants to use them has the experience to understand their benefits and drawbacks. I've seen enough of my fair share of dispute resolutions and have posted on the administrator message board enough to know what the tools are good for and I would use them for exactly the purposes I outlined in my request.</p>
<p>If you read on the instructions page for the RFA, there is no indication that someone needs to write a grandiloquent statement supporting their nomination, nor is their any indication of what a "good response" versus a "bad response" to questions are. I just responded accurately and precisely as to what I want the admin tools for. I know the potentials for abuse that are associated with them, having been at the wrong end of admin fury once or twice myself. As far as I'm concerned, the only reason I want to be an administrator is because I know that the tools would be very useful in areas that I have previously found cumbersome. Adminship is a convenience for the seasoned editor, it's a set of tools. I really don't think it's supposed to be an <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">FAship</a> for users. Amazingly, it seems to me that many of the comments on this RFA seem to be indicating that people view an RFA in this way. In short, I think the community should have a discussion about what an "Admin" is. In the external media, much is made about the "power" that admins have. My RFA seems to indicated to me that a number of editors are actively buying into this idea that adminship="POWERFUL MEMBER OF WIKIPEDIA". An RfC would be an appropriate venue to discuss this problem. I'm going to start one regardless of whether I get the tools or not because this is a discussion that needs to occur.</p>

<dd>Er... you respond rather as if I'd been objecting to your nomination. No, I was fine with it, and as I said, I particularly approve of selfnoms. The subject you outline may need discussing, but, as I just wrote on your RFA, "for the refining of ideas, an RFC has to be the world's worst place, bar none." I would <i>really</i> advise you to choose a different kind of venue. You might consider opening a discussion-slash-poll or something. The venue matters. The trouble with the RFC format for your purpose is two-fold: a) the format is pre-filled with adrenalin, and b) people wouldn't find it, as neither of the two kinds of RFCs, article or user conduct, is intended for such discussions. Finally, the subject is ongoingly, everlastingly discussed at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia talk: Requests for adminship</a>; what's wrong with that? (Maybe in any case you'd be interested in reading a few of its archives.)

<dd>Good advice it all. I've actually had different levels of success with RfCs than you have. I think initially it was supposed to be a "Request for comment" -- nothing more. Now it acts more like a grand-jury for RfArb (at least in terms of User-RfCs which is not what I was intending). I've been involved in more than a few RfCs that have arrived at novel and satisfactory resolutions. Yes, discussion at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia talk: Requests for adminship</a> might be a good idea, but we'll get all the usual suspects in and won't move foreward. I'd like to let people who don't hang out at RfA a chance to weigh in as this whole process is really in need of some outside review, methinks. I'll read some more of the archives of RfA, but from what I've already read I think that this particular issue hasn't really been addressed yet. Cheers,</dd>

<dd>FWIW, I'd have to concur with Bishonen almost entirely. It would be surprising if the opening of an RfC wasn't perceived by many as a hostile, petulant act, just because of what (non-article) RfCs have come to be. It's my impression as well that the issues you are talking about have indeed been discussed many times on the RfA talk page (often with references to Jimbo's "No big deal" quote). Me, I think that the problem in general and in your case in particular isn't the big-deal / no-big-deal thing, but that there's a whole culture of people who are frequent RfC voters. These folks make a lot of votes on people they haven't come across and the heuristics they use are... insipid at best. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 23:21, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I'll forego the RfC since apparently these things are now viewed as "hostile". Perhaps that new sense of RfC should be stated on the RfC page in some fashion? After all "request for comment" doesn't sound to the non-Wiki user to be a "hostile" act. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 20:55, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are plenty of implications of hostility on the page IMO. "... It is part of the dispute-resolution process, and its purpose is to help you resolve the conflict at this stage if possible...RfCs which are brought solely to harass or subdue an adversary are highly frowned upon by the community. Repetitive, burdensome and unwarranted filing of meritless RfCs is an abuse of the Wikipedia dispute resolution process. RfC is not a venue for personal attack. Filing an RfC over a matter that other users regard as trivial or inappropriate may diminish their opinion of you, or may cause them to file an RfC against you.... Note that the RfC you file may itself turn into an RfC against you, if most of those voting and commenting are critical of you. It may also be the first step in dispute resolution leading to arbitration. Filing an RfC is therefore not a step to be taken lightly or in haste." <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:13, 8 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Woohookitty, I appreciate your considered input on ANI more than I can say, thank you very much. I don't think any of us are really good at defending ourselves without any support. I know I'm not--at least it certainly takes a psychological toll. I was beginning to feel as if the entire community with the one exception of El C was giving consent by silence (and sometimes indeed by cheering him on) to Timothy Usher's stalkerish anti-Bishonen campaign.

<dd>Hey, no problem.&#160;:) Well in a way, we're alike. We both seem to deal with alot of disputes. And I know that that tends to be one people are eager to point fingers. I mean I know how it is. You have no more stake in the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi article or the articles that His excellency edits than I did in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Gibraltar_9245.html" title="History of Gibraltar">History of Gibraltar</a> article or <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price-Anderson_Act_1377.html" title="Price-Anderson Act">Price-Anderson Act</a> or any of the other articles where I've been told that I'm "biased". I was once told that I was against the entire colony of Gibraltar! I'm from Wisconsin for crying out loud.&#160;:) So I know how it is. You are just doing your job. And I don't know how you got involved in either case, but I bet it was through PAIN or AN/I or whatever. Basically stumbled into it. Shows that you are a good admin. Not biased. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 20:25, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Heh, I see quite a long discussion has started here! (What happens when you forget to watch a page...) Well, the <a href="../../../v/0/2E/WP%7EV0.5N_4ec5.html" title="WP:V0.5N">WP:V0.5N</a> page is where all the candidates are listed, and from there and from there, there are three possible outcomes: the article is passed, which means it is removed from the nominations page and goes into <a href="../../../v/0/2E/WP%7EV0.5_07ec.html" title="WP:V0.5">WP:V0.5</a>; it is failed on quality, and it is sent to an archive; or it is "held", which means the article is too narrow in scope but ok in quality, so it is stored for a future release, perhaps 1.0. <small>Note that this is a bit controversial, and there was a huge kerfuffle on the talk page about this, so if you start reviewing, try not to do those for a bit...</small> As for the categories... well, to be honest, I don't know what is going on there. Originally, I had set up the 0.5 listing with ten categories, similar to those at the nominations page, but then <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> changed it, as several categories overlapped, and the change kind of stuck, so I don't know what is going on there. So yes, we really do need all the help we can get there, so poke Geogre there too. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 23:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mostly, since it is a test-release (and holding articles that are featured put us in a bit of trouble with some users), we're not excessively concerned about having an article that shouldn't be there on basis of importance; however, if the basis is quality, poke the WP:0.5N talk page and we'll discuss it.

<dd>Hi, Woohoo. I won't extend the 3RR block, I have a whole different kind of block in mind, as soon as I have a moment. This has to be one of the least educable users I've come across where our policies are concerned; he's been warned again and again, blocked with progressively lengthening blocks, linked untold times to the relevant policies, and <b>still</b> most of his edits blithely violate <i>all</i> of the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">five pillars</a>.

<dd>Hi. ArbCom cases are two-tiered: the statements at this stage are merely about whether the ArbCom will accept the case--whether they actually <i>will</i> arbitrate it or not. If you take a look at for instance the Eternal Equinox case, that I've been involved in, you'll see how it works. The initial statements have been refactored to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and when the case was accepted and "opened", <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Evidence" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Eternal_Equinox/Evidence" rel="nofollow">this evidence page</a> was created and the action moved to it. I don't see much percentaqe in me adding a statement to Merzbow's request at <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, unless something turns up from somebody else that I think I can really usefully comment on; I'll save it--what there is of it--not a lot--for the upcoming evidence page. Assuming that the case is accepted, the evidence page will be the meat of it, it'll be what the arbs base their decisions on. You might want to save your own best ammo for that not-yet-created page, too. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:30, 9 July 2006 (UTC).

<dd>All you can do is continue to act according to the rules. Sometimes people think you're trying to help a user or trying to hurt a user, when what you're doing is trying to help Wikipedia follow its rules. I endorsed a 24 hr block on some dude to try to prevent the usual "block forever!" cries, and his response was to send me a nastygram. I figured, "Meh." I wasn't trying to help him. 24 hr was the proper block. <s>So, if HE is cursing you for "helping him," meh.</s> If Usher can't tell the difference between asking people to obey the actual rules of the place and "taking sides," meh. Can't do anything about either one of those people. At least that's my view.

<p>People like to repeat such things stripped of niceties like hypotheticals. They like to write about his "admitted sock", as if he tried to conceal his name change but was then forced to admit it.

<p>Hi, I am hahahihihoho. And I will put a source in the Bosnia and Herzegovina article where it says that 250 000 died. I will not delete the part where it says that 100 000 died. Is it a deal?</p>
<p>Hi again!</p>
<p>I have changed now and you can change so that it will be like the number 5 in my evidence cause I dont know how to do. Anyway, I found evidence that 250 000 died and I have tousand more evidence if you want.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having problems with <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahahihihoho_33f4.html" title="User:Hahahihihoho">user:Hahahihihoho</a> for about 2 weeks i.e. since his first post. As I see it, he is not standard vandal, he is more like unable to get the point, due to some kind of mental disorder or being under 10 years old. Whatever, arguments doesn't work with him, so I tried to explain him by example, at first in english, and later in croatian (Bosnian, whatever...).</p>
<p>Text in croatian basicaly says the same as text in english, but I replaced "Deutsche Presse-Agentur, November. 21, 2005" with "Mate Matic" (the same as <i>John Doe</i>), to make it easier to him, but he replied that <i>he dont want to listen to my fu**ing Mate Mitic</i>. This is no reply of sane preson.</p>
<p>Anyway, to make a long story short - this guy is an idiot (this was a diagnose, not an insult). I don't know what is wikipedia policy for plain idiots. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnte_Perkovic_0b1b.html" title="User:Ante Perkovic">Ante Perkovic</a></p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Just like I said, he is an idiot. After 2 weeks, he still didn't learn to <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">sign</a> his posts and now he attacked me for something I didn't do (explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHahahihihoho&amp;diff=63085813&amp;oldid=63066807" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHahahihihoho&amp;diff=63085813&amp;oldid=63066807" rel="nofollow">here</a>), that proves that he still doesn't understand what "history" link serves for. I'm sorry that at least 5 people lost their wiki-time on this idiot. I think we should try to find some way to minimise the loss of time.

<dd>(It's funny how my threat helped him get the point...) I saw you posting on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> about this some time ago, didn't I? That was why I blocked H. for 12 hours a while back. Anyway, there's obviously a language problem, and also unfamiliarity with how the site works.

<dd>(Edit conflict) Oh, hey, I see you writing *very* impatiently to him above, and on your page ... please don't call names!

<p>Ante: Why do you hate?</p>
<p>I thought that Jesus say that you must love your enemy?</p>
<p>Btw, the ONLY thing I changed in the BiH article is the evidence that 250 000 people died. I DID NOT delete YOUR PART were it said that 100 000 people died. I just layed evidence that 250 000 people died.</p>
<p>So, my question is:</p>
<p>Why did you delete that part? // Hahahihihoho</p>
<p>Bishone: Is that allowed to say that somebody is mentaly insane in Wikipedia? Cause Ante call me that and i HAVE NEVER said something like that before. // Hahahihihoho</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hahah, I've replied on your page about your source and the figures 100,000 and 250,000. No, it's not allowed! Ante shouldn't have said those things. But you must consider that he has been *very* patient with you before, and it hasn't done any good--it wasn't until I talked about blocking you that you listened. Please consider how frustrating that must have been for Ante, and forgive him. And it must also be stressful for him that you keep saying that he reverted you, which <b>he didn't do</b>. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I will never forgive him.</p>
<p>Or, does it say in the rules of Wikipedia that you MUST forgive?</p>

<dd>No. But it says in all the religions that you should forgive if you want to be forgiven for the bad stuff <i>you</i> did.

<p>I will write again the source of 250 000 cause it is up to the people to decide which source is more availaible and I will write the source again. I am not breaking any rules when I write down source cause I will do it again after 12 hours.</p>
<p>// Hahahihihoho</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's up to the editors, yes. (One of them already reverted you.) But it's not about which source is more available, it's about which is more <i>reliable</i>, c'mon. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:23, 10 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Seriously dude... I didnt mean available cause I wrote wrong. It was meant as reliable. And I will write down the source cause there are 2 sides and the people must now so that they can see the 2 sources and decide for themselves which is more reliable.</p>
<p>Because of that I will write down the source so that people dont think that 100 000 people died when there are obvious evidence that 250 000 died during the Serbian aggression on Bosnia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you are breaking rules even if you don't revert more than 3 times a day. Please read and understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:3RR#Intent_of_the_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:3RR#Intent_of_the_policy" rel="nofollow">this part</a> of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. I have already explained to you that one of the sources is <i>better</i>. People are supposed to be able to read Wikipedia and know that we have only good sources, they're not supposed to have to decide that for themselves. Children read this encyclopedia too, and we need to give them only well-sourced information, not a phony choice which they don't know how to make. It was good that you looked out a source, but it can't be kept because the source for 100,000 dead is much better. Don't put your source back. And please click on <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a>, like Ante has told you, and learn how to sign edits on talkpages properly, the way I do, so that the signature contains a link and a timestamp.

<p>I will learn that soon, i Promise!!!</p>
<p>But I know that 250 000 died in the war, its because of that I cant accept that it is written that 100 000 died when it was 250 000!!</p>
<p>And I will put my source back, otherwise I will delete the source were it says that 100 000 died. And I will find a better source if you want, I promise!!!</p>
<p>But One thing is for sure:</p>
<p>IT WONT BE WRITTEN THAT 100 000 DIED CAUSE I WILL FIND SOURCE AND I WILL ALLWAYS WRITE THAT 250 000 DIED. Why? Because that is the truth!!!</p>
<p>Okej, here is more evidence:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862002000100015&amp;script=sci_arttext" class="external free" title="http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862002000100015&amp;script=sci_arttext" rel="nofollow">http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862002000100015&amp;script=sci_arttext</a></p>
<p>Is this enough evidence for you or not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a lot better, congratulations! A document from the World Health Organization is a good source all right. Would you like me to input the 250,000 figure and the source for you, to make a footnote and also to explain that 100,000 is according to the news agency and 250,000 according to WHO? (and that 250,000 includes missing as well as dead people). I know you wanted help with the footnote, and also, the last time you didn't make it very clear about the two figures. If you write it I worry that you could be reverted again just because it's not clear, or because people assume that you're doing what you did before. I would put in the edit summary that I'm writing it <i>for</i> you, so you'd still get the credit.&#160;:-) Deal? (But don't expect it soon. I'd do it today or tomorrow, but I'm busy right now.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:27, 10 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I can't figure out where to insert the spoon to prise apart the bricks enough to make a statement, since my statement would be about the crazy talk TU has been fond of. Even there, he goes back to "Why this, when not this other case?" and is unable to address just the one thing, just the one case.

<dd>(Edit conflict: hiya, Geogre, did you see it's not about TU, though?)[Shrug] Thanks, Mike. I'm sure the ArbCom doesn't expect everybody to be an expert in the intricacies of RFAr:s, they won't mind, or think the less of him. Though they may have more of a problem with what looks from here like a pretty grievous violation of the exhortations to pith and brevity on the evidence page. How about advising Merzbow to move some of the text to the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_His_excellency_Evidence_c207.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/His excellency/Evidence">talkpage</a> you just created?</dd>
<dd>Oh no, vey ist mir, I just saw you advised him to come <i>here</i> and ask <i>me</i>... Well, then I might as well declare that no matter where that question is asked, I'm not going to be drawn into any argument about it. You already answered it on the RFAr talkpage, on about the right scale, anyway. (I appreciate it.) And I'm <i>busy</i>. This thing is taking too much time as it is. In short, the RFAr talkpage is better, because then other people may chime in and clarify stuff. I'm going to first write some evidence--it's such a slow business--and then I have some plans for an <b>article</b>, here. For the encyclopedia, if anybody remembers such a thing?

<p>Thank you for your support at WP:AN/I. Sometimes I start to wonder if my actions are reasonable. He has some useful contributions to make but is a little obsessed at times.

<p>I agree that dissident isn't too strong a word to use, but I feel "propagandists" definitely strayed into PA territory. By itself perhaps that even wouldn't be <i>too</i> bad, however in light of his other past comments I do feel they represent a personal attack against the editors that are disagreeing with his insertions. For example, from his current talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Gary Will and his friends are public employees involved in Regional Government in Ontario Canada. Regional Government in Ontario are a networked gangsterlike organization pilfering hundreds of millions of dollars per year from the taxpayer's in everyway possible. They control and manipulate civil justice systems and are a more corrupt form of government than anything existing anywhere in the world that are generaly regarded as ANTI-DEMOCRATIC."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Though mostly a comment about the government, Garywill is not a politician, he is a user here (<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarywill_7a8c.html" title="User:Garywill">User:Garywill</a>). Also see a previous comment he made on that user's page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AGarywill&amp;diff=61929685&amp;oldid=55975200" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AGarywill&amp;diff=61929685&amp;oldid=55975200" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. Though perhaps the 2 examples I posted to WP:PAIN themselves may not technically violate <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> if evaluated separately, I believe he is violating the spirit of NPA.</p>
<p>Regarding NPOV, the message that I left on WikiRoo's talk page was worded based on his recent edit history. You see, he has been adding his own personal commentaries across many related articles. It seems he has a bone to pick with the current state of government in the Region of Peel Ontario, and instead of adding factual, cited information he has been almost exclusively adding his take on the matter. In many cases he is adding the same POV-laden essay to as many tangent articles he can apparently find. I wrote what I wrote in order to try to help him understand the <i>spirit</i> of NPOV as a whole; that articles need to either be written neutrally <i>or</i> be balanced. What I meant wasn't so much that he <i>personally</i> has to find something good to say about each topic, but that negativity in an article should be counter-balanced in order to meet NPOV.</p>
<p>I think perhaps my comment may have been read out of context. If an editor added one thing that I felt conflicted with NPOV, I would have written something different, and certainly wouldn't have discouraged the editor from editing the article. What I wrote was based on his ongoing attempts to try to ram through his POV. I was trying to suggest he should try to approach the article from a neutral frame of mind, as if he had no emotional ties to the subject, and try to improve the article by adding factual information.</p>
<p>Regarding the discouragement from editing the article, it seems common-sensical to me that if an editor has an obvious emotional attachment to the topic of an article and repeatedly inserts inappropriate material, then perhaps that person should refrain from editing on that topic and re-direct their efforts to another article. I didn't suggest he should leave Wikipedia. Again, if this were the first time he added something inappropriate I wouldn't have left the message. However this editor seems dead-set on adding his viewpoints, which thus far have the overwhelming consensus of being inappropriate.</p>
<p><s>If you haven't seen it yet, here is a RFC on WikiRoo: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_WikiRoo_5f78.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/WikiRoo">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/WikiRoo</a>.</s> The RFC on WikiRoo pretty much sums up most of the issues the other editors of these articles have been experiencing lately. We have tried many approaches to get WikiRoo to come around and add factual or at least properly cited content. The other editors and myself have made many comments to him in the past about NPOV, but they haven't had much of an effect. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

His edits have been reverted over 100 times in less than three weeks by about a dozen editors, which he takes as a sign of conspiracy.

<dd>Thanks for laying it out so fully, guys. When it's this big of a quarrel, I have to swear off, I don't have the time. Dan, feel free to put back your <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> posting which I removed, or, better, post a new one with more information in it (still try to keep it short, though!); then only admins who can spare the time for it will take it on. Admittedly, that could mean nobody takes it on, but it's still better to be clear about what's involved. I did review the RFC, but nobody had commented, so it was basically one side (=not much help). I will add, also, that I still don't like your message to WikiRoo, Dan. Maybe you didn't mean for it to state that it's the individual responsibility of the editor who adds criticism to also add something else to "make the article balanced"; but that is what it does state. There's not only no support for that in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, but it's also not common sense. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Considering you've left a comment on his talk page regarding the "propogandists" comment, I don't think it's necessary to push it any further (as long as he doesn't cross the line again).

<p>I just wanted to say that I hope everything between us is neutral now. I really am sorry if I ever got in your way or bothered you endlessly. Anyway, since I'm sure your friends will be on my tail like Foot Guards, I should just tell you that I'm back to editing some articles anonymously until July 19 (because I have some days off schooling). As you can see, I <i>did</i> keep my vow not to return (but then I got lucky with some free days; interpret it however you want). Whether you read this or not or whether it is reverted blatantly within the next few minutes, I seriously wish you the best (but I hope you read this)! Take care as an administrator and please consider accepting this as my honesty. I'd be really happy if all our drama was put to rest. Well thanks for keeping me on my toes! If I return later this year I'll make sure to take your "wikiwisdom" and apply it the best I can. See you! 64.231.77.2 23:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Btw, we have fine new software for blocking IP ranges"? Extraordinary Machine seems unhappy with another of your edits, too.

<dd>I'm a mess. You know it and I know it. It's because of my temper, which I've had my whole life, where if I don't like something, I become a monster, and Wikipedia really isn't the best way to avoid the situation. Here, I want to try and arrange something with you that will allow us to both get along without having to constantly trample one another. You can decline this offer as quickly as you want, which I would understand because of my behaviour (and it has been poor), but if you're willing to hear me out in a paragraph or two (or three), could I contact you by e-mail?

<dd>I need to read that. There is a feminist attack on SoC, too. The unsourced part of SoC is one hurtful bit, although truthfully 6 months ago we'd expect non-sourced and demand sources only if what was written seemed <i>incorrect,</i> but the thing that gets me is how clumsy the definitions are, as they return to the subject three times to change the definition slightly (wiki-itis), and then the really, really bad "history of" bit. Thing is, we need to recognize that no one <i>here</i> should be describing the "real" first but only talking about this as a streak of Modernism. I.e. treat it as a <b>critical concept</b> and not as an objective reality. When did it arise as a bit of lit crit? Why? What is the historical concept of its emergence at that time?

<dd>I'm wondering the same thing. Pinkerton the dude is worth investigation, as he was notorious in his own day for a bit of brutality and a bit of for-hire goonery. The Pinkerton Agency was known to have political leanings, and they were called in to attack unions, later, and specifically the unionizing in Kentucky and Virginia coal. I'm going to venture to guess that a history of "the Pinkertons" would be plenty salacious and interesting. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:20, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And now I've read the Pinkerton and Allan Pinkerton articles. Wiki-itis strikes again. We have a good, but unsouced article at Pinkerton, but then...then...want to guess? Yep: "Pinkertons in popular culture!" That then gets loaded and larded with every comic book, tv show, unwatched movie, etc., and in no particular order. They miss, in fact, one of the best illustrations of what the Pinkertons were known for. <s>In the movie <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Matewan.html" title="Matewan">Matewan</a>,</i> Pinkertons are called in to break a strike, leading to a bloodbath. It has a great line, as David Straitharn says, "I've met Mr. Pinkerton. I wouldn't piss on him if his heart was on fire."</s> The article on Allan Pinkerton suggests that he's quite revolutionary and interesting in his field, and it simply doesn't mention whatever political leanings he might have had. Also, people not <i>quite</i> up to understanding things mention that the Pinkertons are mentioned often in the current HBO show <i>Deadwood.</i> The idea there is that the Pinkertons will come up to the conclusion their employers want. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC) Whoops, it was <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin-Felts_19bc.html" title="Baldwin-Felts">Baldwin-Felts</a> in <i>Matewan.</i> <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:25, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Actually it was a mistake on my part. I couldn't really tell the difference (just tiny difference in wording) between the previous version (made by admin Nlu) and Taiwantaffy's version so I didn't get why he made the edit and I didn't think his edit made the article better. Anyway the case's solved now. Oh yeah by the way, how do you feel about me running for adminship?? Do you think my contributions and stuff are good enough??

<p><b>Don't</b> remove my own comments from my own talk page. It's as simple as that.

<dd>Where did I do that? I haven't intentionally removed any comment of yours from your own page. If I did it unintentionally, I'm sorry. There was a silent edit conflict, I saw--yoou and I posted simultaneously. Unless you're referring to me removing your strike-through through *my* comment? Because then I'm not sorry at all. There was no question of "believing the first person". I reviewed your silly edit war on MONGO's page plus your posts on Hipocrite's, and you're lucky Tony Sidaway got there first with a mild block; you'd have gotten more from me. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:02, 17 July 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Well, then I apologize for the misunderstanding, but am even more disturbed by your insistence on rushing into a decision.

<p>Hi. We've really got off on the wrong foot here, and I think a lot of this friction is bult up on misunderstanding. One good way to reduce anxiety and distress over the actions of other editors is to listen to what they have to say in an effort to clarify a miscommunication. I know this was the case when I thought you had intentionally silenced my comments on my tal page, but I see now that it was just overlooked in your attempt to revert my strike-through. I wish to clarify something that I was made aware of by your post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=64369156&amp;oldid=64368839" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&amp;diff=64369156&amp;oldid=64368839" rel="nofollow">here</a>. My complaint on the noticeboard was not about you, nor did I say on your talk page that it was you who "alleged" that I had violated policy. If you cool off and actually hear what I have to say, rather than assume I'm only a troublemaker, you may be able to distill your hostility and refrain from the sort of uncvil sarcasm you've flung at me with your persistent "wikilawyering" comments. I've been able to restrain myself from such behavior, and I don't think it's too much to ask for a little respect and civility from you.

<dd>Well, if you supply your e-mail address in your preferences, nobody can read it from there. That's guaranteed, your preferences have very good security. People will be able to write to you through clicking on the "E-mail this user" link in the lefthand column of your userpage, under "Toolbox", but they'll never see your address. You'll receive an ordinary e-mail from them, where (of course) you can see <i>their</i> address. If you choose to reply, but only if you do, you will be giving them your address. I would suggest not using your regular address for wikipedia, but get a yahoo or googlemail address or something, so you can reply to people you don't completely know and trust without worrying about it. But perhaps you mean, how secure are the contents, can somebody at wikipedia read what you send or receive through it? No, they can't, it's e-mail--just regular e-mail. The recipient gets it, no one else. I suppose, if the government is after you, they can dig into your computer or the recipient's and read it, I dunno...;-) But the wiki e-mail is as safe as anything else in your mailbox. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:09, 19 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I understand. For whatever it may be worth, I felt the same way. The second guessing in this case is of the director. I didn't think that it should have gotten where it got, but such is the case with other pop cultural phenomena. This particular item is a fantastically popular and widely used text, so that would color perceptions in the director's mind, I imagine. It's particularly not version 1.0, and I hate to think what serious snooping into references would reveal.

<li>For the most part, I didn't have a problem, but the move of a comma outside of a quotation mark is a British convention; since I've been writing as an American everywhere else in the article, it introduced inconsistency. However, again it was a "grammar" fix, when, well, there wasn't any grammar involved. Nevermind that. For the most part I didn't have a problem, either. When I wrote most of that article, there were slim pickings on images, so I'm sure that the other image is better. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, yes. Uh, is it significant? Carl couldn't hear me either at first, but we have ticked some boxes and now he can.&#160;:-) The issue seems to be that the boxes revert to some stupid default whenever I move a hair. I'll just have to remember where these boxes are, and keep checking them incessantly, and keep my hair still, and we should be fine tonight. Oh, and keep checking the separate little volume control on the cord, because that has a "mute" position that it'll assume if a draft from the window hits it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:00, 24 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<li>Well, the articles they're talking about are not generally done by students, but, of course, the fact that we say, on every page, that we're not definitive can only be ignored because, indeed, our peer review model has made us somewhat definitive. Believe me, ALoan, they know that no source is irreproachable. Their primary <i>job</i> is to complain and to pick at everything. They have to. If they don't, they lose any rationale for their own jobs. They <i>must</i> find a mistake, or else they won't have anything to say on the subject, and if they can't say something on the subject, they can't publish on it, and if they can't publish, they can't be promoted. The bigger the problem, the better the chance for "setting the record straight." This is one of the many reasons I walked away from that crowd as a congregation of pisspots. It's more educational to visit an abatoire than to read what "scholars" have to say to one another on such a list. I wanted to actually <i>help students</i> by making available texts and accounts. They wanted to publish snotty articles in <i>Theory and Practice of Practical Theory of 18th Century Language Text Literature Social Production.</i> I have not decided whether such persons are successful because they are small minded kernels of bitterness or if the system's illogical and inhumane structure makes honest people turn into such, but I know that I don't want to be near them. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Giano, don't even <i>play</i> like that (and don't be serious, either). It's all going to be fine. Really. As I said, the way I read it, Fred was motioning for "everyone should be cautioned, so no one feels picked on," and I've seen people clearly in the right, who had the ArbCom ruling go wholly in their favor, get that. Giano, you were closer to the line than anyone else with EE, so it makes sense that you'd be the one isolated, but I thought that you never did anything more than express the frustration we all felt in a different way. Having that kid show up to fling boogers at everything you do was, well, like a kid flinging boogers: there was never any <i>damage</i> done, but it made the thing dirty in some deep way. Bish, are you saying Friday? It's Thursday now, and I should be reviewing the 500 poems I assigned for today. (Good thing for me that I have taught these poems many times before.)

No, I have a new cause and raison d'etre which will be revealed shortly in which you can all join - it's going to be called "How to tell when one is over the hill" - In fact I'm going to found the "St Giacomo Autumn Rest Home" where lots of old people give me all their money, and I send them off to live in a converted Goat shed on a mountain in Sicily where the sun will be good for their rheumatism etc, and they can be free of all material cares and possessions.
