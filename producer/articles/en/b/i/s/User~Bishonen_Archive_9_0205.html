<p>Apparently, I'm Aristotle now.&#160;:-( I hate being in front of the column, and now we've got what I consider the reductive gesture of personalizing. "It's the US vs. Saddam Hussein!" "It's the US vs. Manuel Noreiga!" No: issues and ideologies clash, and it's a mug's game to buy into the "mano e mano" myth. So, no, I won't answer personal questions in soundbytes.

<dd>Boney! Sigh. I see that my dear El C (an acquaintance? how cold that sounds!) protected your page because you kept re-introducing racist material on it. Now, I don't care if your material was "no worse than" whoever's, as you say.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:El_C&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81168037" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:El_C&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81168037" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> You're responsible for your own page, not for other people's. Don't tell me you put that (very offensive) material on it in order to make a point about somebody elses's page, I <i>don't</i> want to hear that.

I assume El C had his reasons for not removing that material, and you do not get to "admin shop" between him and me about other people's pages. Please concern yourself with the acceptability of your own page only. Let me ask you this: are you proud of that material? Here's the deal: if you promise to not reintroduce it, <i>nor anything else that's in the least like it</i>, then I'll trust you and unprotect your page.

<p>Omg, you seriously needa calm down. I feel kinda bad for makin' you feel so pissed off. But anyway enough said, I ain't gonna defend myself now. I will probably request to be block in a short while since there really is no point of me bein' herre, you know. Oh yeah, one last thing, I am NOT admin shopping between El C and you because obviously you two have a very close relationship and frequently contact one another. I asked you because I felt you're prolly the only admin I trust and respect.

<p>Okay, here's what I'm going to do. Since your an admin, can you please block me for a week?

<dd>I'm in the state of florida, close enough. Dear me, Giano, what a hubbub! I saw the beginnings but it just keeps going, yes? It will take time to read all that mess. Who is Inksplotch? Is Tony reformed? Did anyone listen to David D, who makes some excellent clear points? Did Kelly actually approve the use of "Lying primadonnas" in the evidence section of an Arbcom case, as pasted by Cyde from her This is not Wikipedia blog entry?

<dd>My advice: <b>don't</b> read it. It will take you from the insane state of Florida to the state of insanity very quickly. There has been a lot of unexplainable stuff there. The blog being "evidence" was just one of the weirder ones, and no one commented on it amongst the arbitrators. According to user PizzaHut2 (what happened to PizzaHut1, I wonder), Kelly really did give permission. This by corroboration to Cyde's statement that she did. Now, that might make you think that she has a low opinion of what can be evidence or a high opinion of herself, but I take it as just one more example of how far out people can get when they believe themselves instead of the group, or when they define their group only as those who agree in the first place, which is why my alternate text was consistently about narrowcasting in untraceable communications fora. That may sound like a very specialized complaint (and a lot of people who read...quickly, I guess...read it that way), but what I was getting at was the impulse among many people, when they find their desires checked, to pull in the fences and start appealing to <i>smaller</i> groups rather than larger, whether those people are arbitrators deciding to ask only themselves or beaurocrats hiding their process or a group of administrators secreting their opinions and then acting on them in public. No matter who it is, when you see that the disagreement is rational <b>or</b> widespread, it's time to open up more, time to explain more fully, not to close the door and turn off the lights. Apparently, my simple view is construed by some people as a "political" struggle (and I still don't think Wikipedia is a <i>polis</i> that can have politics) or, what I have never thought, much less said, that I think that administrators abuse users. Either I'm really not able to communicate very well at all or some people cannot read or some people simply don't believe that I mean what I say (when I've been pretty consistent for years). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Ghirla (for the PA support, not so much the raving election lunacy&#160;:-P). Being attacked by a stranger apparently quite unaware of the background got to me, I admit. Yes, yes, I'm too touchy as we all know. Having regrouped, I'm back for a sandbox break, hoping the user you mention won't feel it necessary to come round and scoff at the paucity of what I do there. You have caught me in the perfect mood to run for ArbCom! Of course I will, just wait while I eat some broken glass first, 'cos that's fun too.

<dd>Giano, you mention someone with "sense and logical reasoning" standing for ArbCom - examine that carefully.

<dd>Please take my words easy, but I really think that most featured articles in Wikipedia <i>are</i> overlong. People tend to think: the longer the better. Not at all.

<dd>"Recognition" would be fine, but there is no attribution. Admittedly, I originally lifted the facts from other newspapers, changed to order and the words, and wikified. Perhaps it is my fault, and I have unwittingly steered too close to a common source, but I was surprised at the similarities here. I always add my sources, at least. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 14:04, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ouch, Giano, where you say above "are we going to allow that to remain unanswered," I <i>hope</i> you're just giving an example of what an actual coterie/clique would do! As for article length: I like short articles. I think with most FAs, you could write whatever in the final paragraph, because nobody's going to get that far anyway. Maybe that just shows I <i>am</i> the laziest reader on the site. But "my" FAs are too long, every last one of them. They represent desperate cutting and condensing, and they're <i>still</i> too long. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Country_Wife_1be8.html" title="The Country Wife">The Country Wife</a></i> might be tolerable, if I remember it right (daren't look). Once I actually came close to tears when I'd just corseted an article to the point of implosion and Geogre immediately added a whole paragraph... a good paragraph, but... As for Dürer's rhino, it's perfect, though I guess I would add, it could be a whisker <i>longer</i> and still be perfect. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd><b>IRC is not Wikipedia.</b> Let's get that established. IRC is not Wikipedia, is not mandatory for Wikipedians, is not preferred for Wikipedians, is not helpful for Wikipedians. Secondly, Giano said that the blog was horrible. Well, that's misplaced, but it's not exactly a personal attack. I could say that Slashdot is horrible without attacking Commander Taco. I could say that Wikipedia is terrible without attacking Jimbo Wales. Cool off blocks are not ever, ever, ever successful in their proclaimed intent, and Doc seems to want to replicate the mistakes of Tony Sidaway in that. If you want to block for "civility," then lodge an RfC.

<p>Bish, Did you mean to give people the impression that the way Giano expressed what he had to say was acceptable? Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 03:29, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ben: I wasn't aiming for impressions in that respect: the impression I was after was that it's important a user <i>under arbitration</i> should get to state his unhampered views on the matter being arbitrated. On the evidence page in particular. (<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> has since put it better on ANI: "blocking someone who is currently in the middle of an arbitration case is not the best thing to be doing. If it was, I can promise you that there is at least one person recently active on this same RFArb who I would have been blocking for 3.6 minute stretches every 4 minutes. For fun. Until he cried. But I held off because it's an arbitration case, and because the arbitrators get to determine what is "too far" in that context.") I tried to explain this in my original post to Doc <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81107270" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81107270" rel="nofollow">here</a>: "I find it inappropriate to block the nominal focus of an RFAr for evidence added on the evidence page." That must have been unclear, since Doc translated it as being about Giano having enough<i>time</i> to respond to the RfAr: "3 hours is not disrupting his ability to respond to the RfAr - and as you say he's 'nominal' so that reason is pure wikilawyering." And met my offer of further explanation with a disinvitation to post on his page to "defend myself", because he was "done" with me. I'm just as well pleased to abide by that, considering the misunderstandings of my reasoning (e. g. by <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a>: "Excuse me? Is policy in abeyance on the evidence page?"). My fault, I expect--I do try to be clear, but I guess I fail a lot, and this was a complicated issue to disentangle.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, Ben, you probably didn't just mean to ask for what impression I meant to give people, but also whether I think Giano did express himself acceptably? Yes, I do think so. Compare <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a>, who put it well: "Giano's response may have been harsh, but the material he was responding to was a downright vile personal attack on him. It was hardly uncalled for."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=81128587&amp;oldid=81128473" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=81128587&amp;oldid=81128473" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Tactfully, no; acceptably, yes. What was that foul self-indicting Wikipedia-Review type rant doing in the Evidence section in the first place? Why was the ArbCom's only comment on the person who wrote it, and sanctioned pasting it there, a "Thank you"? Giano had every right to ask. Incidentally, if anything's wikilawyering, it's justifying that blog post being <i>right there in the RFAr evidence</i> (its presence sanctioned by Kelly and implemented by Cyde), by saying it was in some sense "really" posted outside the wiki, so it doesn't count. Bah. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 12:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>No he did not, read it again (I would have thought everyone here could recite it by heart by now) it says "Are we truly to believe the arbcom are so thankful for that, and Jimbo was ever so taken with her". The arbcom having read the evidence are now voting to thank her - so it is a very valid question. Kelly always implied she was a friend of Jimbo's. Good for her, that must be very pleasant for them both. However, I can't imagine Jimbo was particularly impressed by that blog either. If you actually read the blog, not just what was pasted to wiki, there is a lot of other information. I was also commenting on the blog. I don't imagine Jimbo is much impressed by me or many others concerned with whole rotten case either, but it's all a bit late for those concerns now. Now this is actually Bishonen's page, so my further views will be posted on my own page, if I decide to post them that is, because I too am heartily sick of this whole case, it is just a pity reference to that blog was ever permitted as evidence, especially if people do not in fact want to discuss it or hear concerned parties views on it. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 08:50, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To me, this says 1. either the arbcom's judgement is faulty, or their thanks are insincere; 2. Jimbo has been making decisions with his heart, not his head. I don't know how much truth is contained in the content, but wrapping the whole thing in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scatological.html" title="Scatological">scatological</a> language means that people don't react to the content, they react to the way it was delivered.

<dd>Thanks for the unblock (I was in bed hours before anyone even noticed) it now seems we are not allowed to comment on off-wiki blogs, even those that are nothing but a tissue of lies and insults about wikipedians. Kelly still has her fans, I wonder how many of them saw her "Bitch from Hell" remark on wherever it was and were too frightened of her to even raise an eyebrow. Just for once I would love to be listening to the wittering and twittering on IRC, but alas no time - travelling today - so you won't have to watch out nervously for my edits. Sorry if I've caused you all embarrassment but it needed saying, and as usual it was me that had to open my great mouth. It always amazes me how some people post provocative statements and then become surprised when they provoke. Of course the link and pasting from the blog should never have been allowed to remain there, amazing how quick though a comment against it can be removed - truly amazing - anyway this particular Prima-donna has to pas-de-deux to the aeroport - and you "lying Prima-donnas" and assorted "female dogs" have an encyclopedia to write.

<dd>I'll be back with some distinctions, Ben. Giano, since there's a misapprehension there, I think I should point out that "bastard bitch from hell" was Tony Sidaway's summing-up of myself on IRC, not Kelly Martin's. Doesn't affect your main point about lies and insults too much I guess, as there have been amiabilites from her as well, also on the restricted admin channel (which I thought was to be purely used for coordinating admin actions, but I've learned differently).

<dd>Let me toss in a thought about the consensus on AN/I. If people had not seen the blog entry on the /Evidence page or not seen the whole sorry state of affairs, then all they would have seen is, apparently, this comment out of nowhere making hash out of another user's hobby. That would be shocking. However, in the context, it was pretty understandable (as I've explained a number of times). The thing is, that was followed by <i>two</i> inappropriate actions that our outside of the realm of interpretation: Doc Glasgow removed the comment without being a clerk, and then Cyde redacted the blog without being a clerk, and all of this when all had been sternly warned by Fred that no one was allowed to remove Tony Sidaway's ... excessive?... threads on the /Workshop. However, the /Evidence page is not just any page, and Doc Glasgow presented it on AN/I, where evidence shows are pretty much never cited. (After all, when some of the trolls have gone ape during their procedures, has anyone quoted those on AN/I and asked people to agree to a block? It's unheard of.) The readers, therefore, would have had to be already familiar and exceptionally attentive to have offered an honest and considered opinion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:11, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It was my own fault entirely, I hadn't realised Cyde had pasted it in just for decoration and the Arbs and clerks left it there for purely ornamental purposes, I stupidly thought it was considered bona fide and therefore needed repudiating, I don't know about you Geogre but I failed the audition to be the Sugar Plum Fairy, and one thing I am never accused of is lying, a little direct with the truth perhaps. Besides which I had no idea it was illegal to comment on a non-wiki site that was being economical with the truth. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 15:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bishonen, I just wanted to sincerely apologize again for my haste. Marskell has mentioned before that I was risking burnout, and he's probably right: I was burning the candle at both ends. The oversight happened because of my haste, and because I'm sure Marskell was sensitive to how much work I've been doing. I looked at the refs, saw three, then looked for inotes in edit mode, and neglected to even look at the prose because I was trying to finish my watchlist and pack. Anyway, I see the articles have now been moved off the list. Thanks for making those other editor changes: I had to go through all 400+ articles to build a spreadsheet of Projects and authors to notify if/when they come up at FARC, and it wasn't always clear to me. If you see other changes, can you let me know, because then I can be sure to update my spreadsheet as well?

<dd>Shucks, Sandy. I hope you don't let the work get on top of you, but keep in mind that Wikipedia's supposed to be something you do for fun. You know, like a hobby? That's some impressive spreadsheet you've got. I can certainly understand that it's better any moves or changes to it are done by you--just look at me fumbling about in there at random. Pathetic. Er, I noticed one thing, actually. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead">User:Ganymead</a>'s Elizabethan theatre project--under "Theatre"--the three articles listed there, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_drama.html" title="Augustan drama">Augustan drama</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colley_Cibber_0789.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_comedy.html" title="Restoration comedy">Restoration comedy</a>, aren't Elizabethan at all--nowhere close--they're 18th century, and I'm pretty sure Ganymead doesn't mention them.

<dd>The notifications are just a courtesy; something I'm doing in an effort to cast a wider net, hoping to increase the chances of finding someone interested in working on an article. When I searched the 400+ articles still on the citations list compiled by DiscoKing, I added any relevant Project that I was aware of or could find via the Council Directory, but I also included any WikiProject that showed up in the article's "What links here" (hence, Elizabethan theatre on those articles). I'd rather over than under-notify, on the chance that someone might pitch in and help on an article, so I included even Projects found in the links that didn't make sense. Is it likely anyone reading the Elizabethan theatre project would help provide citations? I'll switch Augustan drama—thanks. I shouldn't be promising to take on yet another task, but as time allows, I will read completely through every nomination as articles come up, so that another John Dee/PRiis won't be missed. The official notification is the talk page FAR template; optimally, FAs are being watched by their original authors so they won't deteriorate, so original authors should be aware even if I miss one.

With the (seeming) end of the Vaughan-gate mess, I've been back to normal editing for the last while and wanted some outside opinions as to what kind of job I'm doing; if I'm on the right track, if there's anything I can do to improve, etc. If you have some free time, I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look and leave me some feedback!

<p>Hi. I notice that you seem to have a particular interest in concealing the above editor's long history of abuse from the Wikipedia community. This is a particular concern, given that DreamGuy has now returned after being caught out using sockpuppets - and has already started abusing myself and others exactly as he did before. I'd suggest, given recent accusations, that your continued defense of this person is probably something you should look at very <i>very</i> carefully. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 06:03, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I don't know what you're referring to, Centauri. I'm not "defending" DreamGuy, I'm merely enforcing basic decency on Wikipedia. Are you saying DreamGuy's revert of <i>your</i> continuing edits to <i>his</i> userpage amount to <i>him</i> harassing <i>you</i>...&#160;? I sought advice on the admins' irc channel before touching the page, myself, and got 100% spontaneous reactions that it's inappropriate for old adversaries of DGs, with an obviously hostile agenda, to be adding this tag at all. Also that it's unsuitable for <i>anybody</i> to keep re-adding it when the sockpuppetry wasn't even proven. Also that it's in any case wrong for anybody to do it when any puppetry was not a present threat, was not some ongoing outbreak of incessant sock creation, or, in a word, was <i>old</i>. Shall I go on? Your and English Rose's edit summaries to your reversions sometimes refer vaguely to <i>other</i> things about DreamGuy than the Victrix case--some sort of generalized "abuse" (could that be because DG's article edits thwart you?). "A stack of evidence is against DreamGuy and he is aware of it", "do not attempt to conceal this editor's abusive history - particularly as it now continuing from exactly where it left off"--you both can't be referring to the old Victrix story with those statements, can you? There's obviously no "stack of evidence" or any "continuing" about that, so you're both talking about something else. But the tag isn't for something else! In particular, it's <b>not for generalized vengeance against a POV opponent.</b> You are abusing the tag. If I were you, I'd look "very very carefully" at your <i>own</i> actions, and so should English Rose. (Hello, ER, I know you're sure to read this.) So, most especially, should Gene Poole, who is about to get blocked for his reckless accusations pertaining to Gzornenplatz/Wik. If any of you think it's open season on DreamGuy because of the Victrix affair, you're mistaken. Finally I remind you, Centauri, for the nth time, that you can stop saying CheckUser "confirmed" that case. Have you genuinely forgotten the CheckUser finding of "likely" (as opposed to "confirmed"), or are you just shameless? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 09:12, 19 October 2006 (UTC).

<dd>When I read that comment, my blood just boiled. I’ve taken a few minutes to calm down a bit. Right, <i>“There's obviously no "stack of evidence" or any "continuing" about that”</i>, oh yes there isn’t just that him and Victrix edited at exactly the same time, went away for the same periods, used the same language, edited the same articles and reverted so that one could avoid 3RR. You’re right, no "stack of evidence". You carry on defending Mr. DreamGuy for the next few years, cause your very good it.

<dd>Bishonen, you can bluster and threaten me all you like, but the fact of the matter is, it is <i>you</i> who are actively defending an editor who treats Wikipedia's community standards with utter contempt. It isn't <i>me</i> who accuses people of being "fucked up" and "psychotic", who blanks whole random sections of article content then describes it as "fucked up spam" in the edit summary, who tells people to seek "psychiatric help" or accuses everyone who disagrees with them of "harrassing" them, or of "impersonating" them. It was - and is <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a>. He was doing it six months ago, and he is doing it today. Allow me to spell that for you: T O D A Y. Do you want me to provide you with the links? So, looks to me like you better start "enforcing basic decency rules", rather than just using the phrase as a club to attack me with.

<p>I can't seem to... it's a .pdf, I don't seem able to find any links on it, or save any images from it either. I don't have the latest Adobe Reader. I suppose it's the photo of the studio by Julia Margaret Cannon from 1871, on page 20? Note that there is also a photo portrait of Hannah by JMC, also 1871, also on p. 20, don't you want that as well? Not that I'm able to get either of them. Bunchofgrapes, help!

<dd>I know! I saw it, it's on my watchlist, too. No, Im not happy.&#160;:-( I think the stub that was--the present intro, at least last time I looked--was fine. But I don't think there's much to be done, unless possibly by someone prepared to expand the page in another way. It's a <i>really</i> difficult thing to complain of tactfully. I tried to figure something when I saw it yesterday (you know how Bishzilla's delicate sensibilities come to fore in these tricky cases) but I had to give up.</dd>
<dd>The single-play articles of the period are mostly in a poor state anyway, only the 1911 author pages are worse. (<i>/me is ashamed of self, prefers to work among the ice floes and other dangerous elements these days.</i>) If this is just the beginning of a similar plotification of the entire period, though, I guess we'll <i>have</i> to send in Ze Ogre. Or if they get to one of your nice shapely play pages, or, remote contingency, one of the few FAs. Anyway, if you have an idea for an approach to the contributor, I will certainly back you up as best I can. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 10:47, 20 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<p>We're in accord and sympathy, then, because I, too, grappled with how to complain tactfully. What was added was legitimate, if... shady. Why summarize a plot, of all things? Not, of course, that I haven't wished for plot synopses with some of the Restoration plays where all the characters have the same name (but with vowel endings sometimes for the girls) and minor chars walk in without motivation to monkey about, but the plotting is more or less the least important thing for the political comedies (and that's all of AB, IMO). There may be critical plot actions that need to be talked about, if they're thematically important, but... Well, I think of what would happen with a plotting of <i>Pasquin.</i></p>
<p>The way to overcome it, I suppose, is the way that we can overcome the 1911 dumps and (much worse than them) the Short Literary Encyclopedia dumps: overwrite with legitimate expansion. That means the dreary world of deep diving into each play, and that's asking quite a bit from harried people who don't get their grading done on time (me). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:18, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In regards to your fire article (it's looking quite nice, BTW), have you seen either of Liza Picard's books <i>Elizabeth's London</i> or <i>Restoration London</i>? While I don't have <i>Restoration London</i>, I have the one on Elizabethan London and it is quite fascinating. Picard attempts to give a perspective of London outside of the usual observances of the upper class. I certainly think that <i>Restoration London</i> might have a great deal on the fire and how life was affected by it. Certainly if you have anything you think I might be able to check on in <i>Elizabeth's London</i>, I am humbly at your service. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 16:38, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the tip, I'll take a look. I do have Roy Porter, <i>London: A Social History</i>, also. But I dislike the callous way modern social historians tend to say what a pity it was the horrible suburbs didn't all burn down. "Burning down was what they needed", writes Porter. How hard is it, if you actually try, to imagine what a disaster it was for the poor to lose their tarpaper shacks and be "encouraged" (by Charles II, no less) to leave London and go on the road, with what they could carry? The lack of imagination of the well-fed. I hope your Picard is nicer. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I'm changing my mind about Porter these days. He really was the last committed Enlightenment historian. I have little patience for the "sacks of potatoes" histories, but Porter was too positive. He could be first class, top notch, but he seemed to revert to the old Verities, like enlightenment and the march of science over superstition. Relativism is an ennervating plague, but positivism is intellectual constipation, and no one should have to make such a Hobson's choice. Maybe Pat Rogers is the best we have (despite his telling me, "I'd have done it (<i>Grub Street: A Portrait of a Literary Subculture</i>) better if I had it to do again"). One doesn't have to abandon all standards to count a life for a life, and one doesn't have to put on oiled leather boots to believe that there are better and worse historical developments. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

Yesterday a bureaucrat (Taxman) erased the account at my request, and I registered it, my first thought being indeed that I wanted to prevent recreation and further impersonation. But I have some thoughts of using it for special purposes, also. I often use the nick in jest on IRC ((<i>/Bishzilla destroys Tokyo</i>) and people who hang on IRC sometimes address me by it.

<dd>That means you think I'm insulting myself, too, for working on something nobody wants to read? I don't think I said or implied that. I don't worry if <i>vandals</i> don't feel like reading it. Once that segment of "nobody" is cut off, we're left with the people who don't want to read anything they haven't heard of, and I don't mourn them, either, and the people who are intellectually curious. They do want to read it, but they're not going to scribble in crayon on it. You had to work to make that an insult, I think. It's a great, scholarly article, and we should take pride in not writing about "Lost (TV series)" and "24 (TV series)" and thus being vandal magnets. What is and is not a vandal magnet, beyond pop topics, is having a title that is prone to dirty jokes. <i>The Relapse</i> is safe, but <i>The Country Life</i> wasn't. Finally, if it sounds like a subject they have to take in school, they'll scribble, so "Physics" or "Algebra" would get big scribbles. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Still, either I was insulting myself, or I wasn't insulting you. I looked at the history of Relapse, and it's getting salt and vinegar from the bored schoolboys, which is plenty.

<dd><i>Why</i> did I..? Seriously, Blnguyen. You do realize you led the wikicops straight to it? Did you see what happened to it?

<p>FYI, I think the standard form of those arbitration summaries is to include only the "remedies" that passed, not the "principles" and "findings" and not proposals that weren't adopted. I agree the formal summary doesn't address the substance of the issues that were or weren't resolved, but it wasn't an arbitrary choice of what to include by the person who did the closing, either.

<li>On the subject of "bah!," there I go trying to be a good citizen by telling the AN folks (where the brouhoho occurred) not to start a new hash on the subject, that everyone was as mollified as they could be <i>by this case in its scope</i> and that, if they thought there was more to say, to do it from a fresh starting point, and Doc Glasgow has some sort of internal explosion and accuses me of trying to get the last word! Holy cow, but that's right on the edge of totally flipping nuts. Here I thought that more people against the repromotion of Carnildo were disgruntled by the case than those for it, but Doc's tantrum and insults show that he's at least so upset that he's going to read every comment as being somehow persecution. This is just great. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:01, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Brad don't think I don't truly appreciate your attempts at peace-making, but you seem to be completely ignorant of how strongly people feel about this matter.

Rest assured sooner or later though I will be saying it. However your soothing tones are starting to irritate, which I'm sure is not your intention.

<p>Last week you removed an NPA message I placed on <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a>'s talk page.

<dd>(Edit conflict)Bah humbug. Common sense is not disruptive, but userpage harassment is. Don't post on userpages after the user has shown they don't want you to. Hint: the user removing the message once is a way of showing they don't want you to. Edit warring on other people's userpages is inappropriate, against Wikipedia policy, and a blocking offense, so don't do it. And no, if an admin wants to review your complaint against Calton, your having put that message on his page twice (yeah, that'll make a good impression) is perfectly clear from the History.

<dd>Bravo! A few concerns, though. Your maps of the fire are lovely but I'd like to see some labels. I can figure out what most landmarks are (The Thames, London Bridge, The Tower, the Wall) but nothing is marked. What is the black line just above London Bridge? What are the street names? What districts are included in this map? What is the building just above the city wall? I presume the blue cross is St. Paul's? I think labels would make the maps much more effective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides the map, I have nary a problem with the text. It's as beautiful and learned as I always expect from you. Perhaps a quick side-project you might consider: a list of the major buildings (churches, etc) destroyed in the fire. I've always had a strange fascination with the churches of London (where else can you find such wonderful names as <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Clement_Danes_ab63.html" title="St. Clement Danes">St. Clement Danes</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Anne%27s_Limehouse_48e0.html" title="St Anne's Limehouse">St Anne's Limehouse</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows-by-the-Tower_c1ed.html" title="All Hallows-by-the-Tower">All Hallows Barking</a>?).

<dd>Hi, Ganymead, thanks very much—I was just returning here, in fact, in order to mention that the cute maps are by my good friends <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenceslas_Hollar_e7b7.html" title="Wenceslas Hollar">Wenceslas Hollar</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Wren_3129.html" title="Christopher Wren">Christopher Wren</a>, and <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a>—I hope one or more of them will address and discuss your concerns&#160;! I thought the maps were so clear—but I'm bound to be a little crazy from reading too much about it. Oh, and <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Hallows-by-the-Tower_c1ed.html" title="All Hallows-by-the-Tower">All Hallows-by-the-Tower</a>, is it? Surely that's got to be the red-linked "Barking Church", that Pepys climbed on the Wednesday? [/<i>Me runs to bluelink it.</i>] Thanks! But the churches—I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've taken an unreasoning dislike to the churches—they're the only things that get properly documented, you see, at the expense of everything else. My only really scholarly source, Reddaway, complains that the secular rebuilding is all a blur, because everybody's too busy documenting every last brick of the churches. In other words, they can be listed all right, but... I don't like them enough.&#160;:-( Plus it would make the article longer still. Or you mean a separate list article? Now that's an idea!</dd>

<dd>Yes, I meant the list should be separate. I think the maps are clear to me (I know London fairly well) but I think someone who hasn't had a chance to visit or read up on the city, like ourselves, might find them uninformative.

<dd>Ganymead, the little day-by-day maps are deliberately label-free in an attempt to reduce visual clutter, the idea being that one would refer to that <a href="../../../g/r/e/Image%7EGreat_fire_of_london_map.png_53ed.html" title="Image:Great fire of london map.png">big first map</a> in the article for bearings.

<dd>For someone who doesn't know what a sixpence is, I'll make my best guess. Towards the end of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_London_0aa9.html#Sunday.2C_September_2" title="Great Fire of London">Great_Fire_of_London#Sunday.2C_September_2</a> is it quoted accurately that Samuel Pepys wrote, "simplicity [=the stupidity] of my Lord Mayor", the sixpence being [=the stupidity]? The article is one of the best, and at the moment I really like the panorama box.

<dd>I assume we are looking for some flaw. After the guess above, another thing that I wonder about is "connivancy [that is, the corruption]" towards the end of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_London_0aa9.html#Fire_hazards_in_the_City" title="Great Fire of London">Great_Fire_of_London#Fire_hazards_in_the_City</a>.

<dd>Looks good, Bishonen. I did a lot of picky stuff, which you are free to remove at discretion and no hurt feelings, and I didn't add anything more than four words. Of course the triumphalist narrative of the Fire always centers on the rebuilding in modern versions, and this article leaves out all of the rebuilding. That's good, as the rebuilding is not the fire, and the fire is not the rebuilding, and we're all following <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> by trying to find a palace of silver in the dark smoke clouds. Of course, it does beg for an article on "Rebuilding of London," if there were a stable term for it. It's ready to be an FA, whatever FAC says. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:47, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks very much for the fixes, Geogre, and for the "triumphalism" comment. I think that was exactly the narrative I was trying to avoid, though I didn't make it clear to myself (until you did). I hate those "it was all for the best" histories—my sources are all like that, naturally. Almost as much as I hate all their spotlight on Charles and James and the wonderful way they <i>rose</i> to the <i>occasion</i> and impressed their humble people by getting soot on their very own royal frilly white shirts. We skipped <i>that</i>, haha. [/<i>Bishzilla is such a commie! Grrrrr!</i>] Yes, it calls out for an article on the rebuilding, and also the social aftermath—not so much is known, of course, but it's a fascinating subject IMHO. Shortage of labour, prices and supplies, profiteering, all that. Well, OK... so I'm the only person on the planet that that sounds interesting to. Don't you agree, though, that the final section as it presently stands is <i>too</i> impoverished? I shall have to do something, for about ten obvious things are sort of missing. Oh boredom, more reading.&#160;:-( <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 18:41, 29 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>From a historian's point of view, "long view" is one of the primary options, and teleology is almost impossible to shear away, so it's a <i>legitimate</i> way of looking at things, and it's further endorsed by Dryden, but it's remarkable that the "march of progress" narrative is virtually the only one that has been written when it comes to the fire. Forget the enlightenment itself: <i>the present day's image of itself</i> is very deeply invested in a progressivist view of the late 17th - 18th centuries. We keep telling the story of the banishing of superstition because we think we're engaged in the same project, and therefore telling a story other than "clearing away the poor people for a glorious London to come" is to imperil our ongoing narrative of urbanism and progress and expansion. It is also, paradoxically, a very necessary view for radical capitalism: the market will provide by building up hovels and then burning them down.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, I think the stories of Chuck and Jim are more important. It's not because they got sooty, but because they asserted centralism and federalism against devolved power. One of the stories of the period was the limitations of democracy, the mob versus the elites, and the attempted justifications of birth. If we cut away that last part only, we get much more interesting things about the first two. Also, this is pre-syphilitic James (or early syphilitic James), and he was doing a job. That part alone would be surprising to contemporary Brits. (His pre-coronation work is actually interesting, as a good bit was "me-too" to Charles, but a lot of it was also, "I'm gonna get rich," and he had amassed a pretty hefty fortune of his own before having to become the Old Pretender.)</dd>
<dd>I don't think the first section is all that needy, although there is a pile that we can add. The way that London grew without official growth is important to the debility of the various fire precincts, as well as to the debility of the policing. Because it grew over autonomous areas, and because it grew without statutory extension, it ended up with ancient practices mixing with planned maintenance. The story you read in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mint_0826.html" title="The Mint">The Mint</a> is indicative of everything outside the wall. London City had a system, but each direction outside the wall had a different system, or no system. Also, there is more to say about tenements and the braces they had to use to keep from falling down.</dd>
<dd>When it comes to the rebuilding, we'd need a <i>name</i> for it, and I mean a single name. Also, one wonders now whether the fire isn't one of the reasons that Moorfields because the proverbial home of highwaymen, whores, and witches 30 years later. One wonders if the dispossessed who didn't move on became progenitors of a race of poor and thieving and desperate persons. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:56, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where ther is money I am like a homing pigeon! There is just one eency weency but rather gruesome little detail I don't agree with "the heat of the fire would have cremated all victims, leaving no recognizable human remains" when I was new to my RL career I had to deal with a certain criminal - No you don't want to go there - just trust me - and I can tell you categorically that the heat from the fire of wooden houses would not be sufficient for that, tinder dry and pushed by wind, it would have been an intense heat, but in a specific spot very quick, not long enough - something, quite a lot actually would have remained. So do you mean "recognizable human remains" as in not recognizable to their loved ones (God I hate that common expression) or not recognizable as human remains, the former is likely the latter impossible. Finally on a more cheery note, the lead image shows the Tower of London clearly on the right, just as it is in BoG's images perhaps it would clarify things for those who find it hard to read maps if some mention of that similarity between maps and image was made. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 18:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This was supposed to be a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firestorm.html" title="Firestorm">firestorm</a>, though—hotter than your regular wood fire. See the page <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firestorm.html" title="Firestorm">Firestorm</a>: "The greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of oxygen which significantly increases combustion, thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat. The intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat (<a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrared_radiation.html" title="Infrared radiation">infrared radiation</a>) which ignites flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself." Nothing about <i>how</i> hot, but hotter. I'd better check what Hanson says again, it's been awhile since I read the "cremated" comment. Quite possibly I made it up. Thanks for that horrible glimpse of RL, it makes me more determined than ever to never visit the place. Reading maps? But everybody can read.... oh, all right, I see what you mean.

<p>It won't be legible, what with all the flames and hippie blue jean patches and squawking, but I thought I'd mention that I e-mailed. Also, a thought occurred to me, in the midst of my bilious reflections on my own self-fulfilling prophecies (there is a tautology or two there): the Navy in the 17th &amp; 18th century was today's Air Force. It was surprise attack, hopelessly technological, an industry that nations took great pride in surpassing others in technology, restricted to nations with advanced sciences, and romantic. Thus all the books of naval terminology released then, and all the books of aircraft released now, and for the same readers, too. Thus all the criticizing of novels for not getting their naval terminology and slang <i>just right</i> then (see Swift defending himself genuinely in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>) and all the criticizing of novels for not getting their air strikes just right in military/spy/war novels now. Thus the "sailor" being a figure of a lady's bawdiest dreams and a "captain" being a lady's most marriageable dreams then, and thus a "fighter jock" being a lady's trysting fantasy now and a ... well, they don't dream so much of majors and colonels in the AF now. The point being that the intense interest in gosh-golly aspects of military terminology and practice, with exact relations of navigation and all the naming of tools, in 18th c. seafaring works is analogous to today's movies with gosh-golly super weaponized fighters. It's the same thing, just faster. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC) &lt;/Geogre waves furiously, begins hopping up and down.&gt; <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 21:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, this article wasn't the one I was referring to before, but I was wondering if you could take a look at <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilary_Duff_%28album%29_3e1f.html" title="Hilary Duff (album)">Hilary Duff (album)</a> and leave comments at <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Hilary_Duff_%28album%29_a1e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Hilary Duff (album)">Wikipedia:Peer review/Hilary Duff (album)</a>. As I told Geogre, disposable teen pop can be so fun and wonderfully trashy! I know you said you don't know much about music, but that's actually useful because I want to make sure people who don't know much about music can understand the article. Also, it probably needs a copyedit and might be too long. You don't have to comment if you don't want to though, and I won't mind if you don't.

<dd>OK,, sure, I'll take a look. If you're in the mood for a little tit for tat, scroll up and take a look at my informal peer review under the heading "To my guests", hmm? Don't feel obligated or anything, and especially, no, you don't have to say I'm wonderful (an informal compulsion to do that seems to have developed, which I think is something to do with my having recently registered <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishzilla_a74f.html" title="User:Bishzilla">User:Bishzilla</a> as an alternative account—people never know when I'm coming to stomp on them!) Just please let me know if you see any problems with the page, especially anything that's hard to follow or understand. If you happen to not be familiar with 17th-century history, it would indeed be an advantage, just as you suggest yourself. But it's only a thought, don't feel you have to take me up on it.

<p>Bishonen - thank you for your help regarding Gryffndor. Things got personal a little while ago, but we have a great moderator that has helped make a lot of good, respectful discussion and progress (potential). I just want to be able to edit and contribute - if I step out of line it's one thing, but what he's been doing is so blatantly personal. It's nice to know that at least someone noticed! <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 13:48, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. I've been watching and contributing to those threads on AN and ANI because I feel strongly about attempts to force users to keep warnings visible (especially those mechanical templates—of course templates have no special authority over a note in a human voice, but they <i>are</i> more inflammatory and humiliating), and I noticed your post on AN, I think it was. Policy—which is what admins actually do, and what there's consensus for—has been changing rather quickly on this point. You can take a look at the discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you're interested. But I'm hoping the threads I linked to will be persuasive to Gryffindor. If not, I can find more, as it's quite a big subject on the admin noticeboards. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I think it's valid for anonymous IP addresses - so an admin can see historic viewpoint of continual abuse from one address. But from a particular user I think it all depends on the situation. In this more recent situation, I stumbled into a situation with <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Tyrol_30d1.html" title="South Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> that has been ongoing for a year. Then I didn't quite realize the impact of my actions, and was warned while I was learning that I walked right into a minefield. Gryffndor took it personal and made statements such as me "wasting my time on Wiki Commons" because (in his words) "I am (ahem) a sysop there as well". So Gryffndor and I locked horns a few times. I found a voluntary mediator with an admin - <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> - and he has done a lot to monitor the situation and cool our heads. I thought it was all well and good, then suddenly Gryffndor is back on my personal page with his threats of "continually monitoring me". I find this offensive. I am a military person and have a strong personality, but I haven't done anything that deserves such. The greatest percentage of my edits have been contributing to fill holes in wiki where I find maps missing or other information needed (or corrected). So I simply want him to leave me alone and do his own good in edits and not constantly theaten or monitor me in any way - after all, that IS violating the wiki harrassment (or stalking) rules. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 22:30, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you know anything about this author, her name keeps cropping up in my Hannah re-search, and there is limited internet material available, she based the heroine of a couple of her books loosely on Hannah, and lived in a house close by (incidentally on my youth I went to a parties there twice she had long gone, and the new owner was somewhat more notorious and entertaining - had an amazing jacuzzi - where no-one was allowed to where clothes - Oh to be youthful again.

<dd>Not in the same class as Sybil at all, <i>much</i> better known. Not a good writer, you know, but a notable public figure, and especially an establishment figure, against whom the suffragettes and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Woman_1858.html" title="New Woman">New Women</a> defined their efforts. (The New Women = the Victorian, you know, feminists?—if you've heard of such a thing.) She was known as a children's writer and public debater, promulgating conservative values and religion.

<dd>Ah well Lord Rosebery was against giving votes to women, because "India (ie the Indians) would not like it" and of course Hannah was so powerful she hardly needed a vote - but would she (Mrs H W) have based Sir G Tresady's heroine and (I can't be bothered to click back) "Melissa?" on Hannah R? The Gutenberg link suggests although they were close neighbours Stocks is with in sight of Mentmore they were not that close friends, have you read anywhere before that her heroine as based on Hannah?

<dd>I agree with Bishonen that one has to cut <i>some</i> bit of the story off, and the rebuilding is the best candidate. For one thing, to be at all fair, the rebuilding must be complicated, because it was a very complicated affair. Any number of wonderful plans bumped against each other, and even the grubbiest of plans bumped up against the Dutch Wars and their costs, and all bumped up against Parliament, which was run by Commons, which was run by various ancestors of Ronald Reagan's and Margaret Thatcher's. They didn't see why they should give a farthing to help the king look good or ape papists. Against all the economic reality, pitch the commercial development that was taking place without permission. Against that, toss in the competing public health views (some prophetic, and some stupid). Then add in some powerful personalities in the Royal Academy. No: even a bird's eye view of the rebuilding is 20 years at a blink. I know readers are going to yearn for closure and a happy ending, but the actual ending, as opposed to the poetic one that has been repeated countless times, is money, the King getting a mysterious lump sum from France (for promising to convert to Catholicism), the gain of New Amsterdam and loss of Surinam, etc.</dd>

(No, no, do <b>not</b> think that the his genitive is the most ancient. it isn't.

<dd>Wow, you used to have that? This kind of genitive construction is common in Low German, Afrikaans and Norwegian (dem Mann sein Hund / die man se hond / mannen sin hund = the man's dog (the Man his Dog?). I love it - I try to work it into every edit I make to the Norwegian Wikipedias&#160;;) Do your sources not mention the possibility of a relation between these and the English his genitive? <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 11:48, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Indeed, Curme mentions it explicitly, and Baugh isn't in the business of mentioning it (as his book is strictly confined to morphology and not linguistics). Algeo &amp; Pyles (<i>A History of English</i>) don't mention the comparative angle. Curme notes that it occurs in other OHG derivatives but can't quite connect the dots, and I'm not sure how easily the dots <i>could</i> be connected, if Baugh is right and it occurs because of an accident of phonology. I'll go back to Curme and add in the cognate usages in other Germanic languages. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The phonological accident could perhaps have been strengthened by German influence.

<ul>
<li>Really? I thought it was <i>far</i> too dull, and I'm still convinced that I did a hash on the writing of it. The DYK part is whether or not the his genitive is the reason people use the apostrophe for genitive endings in ModE. The <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genitive.html" title="Genitive">genitive</a> article says that it's debatable, but Curme and Baugh both say that it's simply true, although Baugh points out that Samuel Johnson was probably the source for the popularity of the theory. (The genitive article has no citations, but the his genitive article does, so we know who wins, if it's a contest.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok, new <b>Did you know</b> for the his genitive, with newly added information that connects the dots to other OHG languages. Basically, it's this: our good friends the Anglo-Saxons had a his genitive, her genitive, and their genitive, but they stopped for some reason or never got all over with it. (No info on whether or not it's a <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danelaw.html" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a> feature.) Other OHG languages kept going with it. So it shows up in ModE from a misunderstanding of lME.

<dd>How absolutely fascinating. And what a good job I found the latest Bishonen-article and ended up here to comment. Now I have learned a thing about language as well as lots about London. Sorry, btw, to butt in here, but my browser can't cope with editing the entire page, so I have to piggy-back on a section. Hello, Bishonen (and all). Yes, I realised subsequently that the talk page commentary must be from the FAC. I slunk off from <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> when people started posting their lists of grammar to abide by. All a bit too much "I'll see your Strunk and White, and I'll raise you a copy of the Oxford Guide to Style." Anyway, love the article.

<p>No, you have not offended me, and I regret that I have offended you. I simply think that many of the sentences in the article are verbose. In my personal writing I like complex and rich language, but I'm less fond of it in profession and public works. My manner in opposition might have been brusque, but it was late at night, and I felt it was in keeping with the general tone of FAC. (<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony1</a> has in the past been particularly brutal regarding prose, and the term has been thrown around sever times over the year.) Later comments in the FAC directed at me rubbed me the wrong way, and "Flab" and variants unfortunately stuck in the immediacy. I'm sorry the offense. I hope you see that I've been trying to work in good faith to improve the article, which is well done, regardless of its designation.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonocrat_e146.html" title="User:Monocrat">Monocrat</a> 22:50, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It wasn't just you. Anyway, I don't think I did any grandstanding about taking my ball and going home, I just said I'd hesitate longer next time before FACing anything, which may not be a bad thing. Getting a body part or two crushed between the wheels is part of the wiki experience and a good way of finding out how unfamous you (anybody) are (is). You and me both. Half of even those who watch any particular debacle never notice, the rest forget about it in short order. Even more so with your triumphs: feel good about them, by all means, but be aware that nobody else remembers, and that, in any case, 90% of the population always arrived last week and have never heard of you. It's a very indifferent place, which is good and bad—mostly bad, IMO—but it does mean it's easy to live down a setback. Don't be concerned for your repute, it's already recovered. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:33, 4 November 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I think I'm the one being most mean, and I think I've explained why adequately. Memory does persist, though: just look at Sandy Springs responding (or not) to me. Also, I am rather the same person each time out, except that I've been getting less polite as time has gone on and there has been no mending of ways. I get some of the same reactions, too, when I complain generally about, let's say, a self-appointed "style" and "copy editing" master/mistress, and every person who has made a change to an article thinks I'm referring to him or her. It has never been that changes aren't possible, and I would commend my history of dealing with changes to "my" pages as witness, but about the <i>name</i> of these changes being "fixes" (the implied incompetence of everyone but the Myrtle the Turtle judge of style and copy), when they're more alterations. Some are improvements. They're not "fixes," however, unless there are actual <i>errors</i> present or, much more directly implied, <i>incompetence</i> involved. How could anyone interact with such an arbiter without being insulted? Add to that what appears to be memory-based prejudicial interest, and how could anyone fail to be irritated or worse? So it goes. It's just that the long memories look funny to the people with no previous experience of these conversations and arguments, while the new person's comments can look like an insidious reiteration of the long time quarrel, and thus we mistake friend for foe in all directions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re: Starwood Festival article</p>
<p>Please READ the most recent version of the article I wrote. Let's see what I have added in the last time:</p>
<p>I included the topic magical and spiritual, and still state that the phrase "New Age topics" does NOT cover them adequately. Many New Age folks do not accept that magical practice is part of what they do, and there are many spiritual practices that are NOT New Age ones. I also added the topic "mind/body sciences". I included the founding date of the event. I cut the repeat of the phrase "these communities" and just made it "them". I trimmed the third paragraph MORE than the one you keep reverting to. I added an additional type of dance that is featured at the event, then cut a paragraph out.</p>
<p>I created a "Features of the event" section, and cut some of the same other paragraphs that the version you revert to cut. I changed "that can be seen from space" to "visible from space". I added "Sufiism" to the list of spiritual paths featured under the People section.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I have accepted a lot of the cuts that have been made. Gone is the mention of seasonal campers, wood-busters, the line about the intent of the event, the mention of the event being a yearly vacation for some, the "celebrating their diversity" line, and more. In fact, I think I have eliminated most of what has been objected to, while making the description of the event and its components more complete.</p>
<p>I urge you to actually READ the newer copy, and to compare it to such sites as the Burning Man site, and explain why reverting to that one rather than using this one is an improvement. In my opinion, the addition of a History section, a Principles section, a Community section, a Timeline section, and all sorts of other information would be encyclopedic and in keeping with the rest of Wikipedia, along with graphs and photos. I see no reason to harass me over the present content.</p>
<p>However, I apologize for violating the 4-revert rule. It was an accident, and I did self-revert as soon as it was pointed out to me. I'm not sure I did it right, but I certainly did not revert it again until Timmy12 stepped in, and he has a history of staking my articles and reverting them. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosencomet_99ef.html" title="User:Rosencomet">Rosencomet</a> 21:31, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>All critics apply their theoretical background to their works and authors, but
<ol>
<li>As publish or perish increased, young "scholars" began looking for authors who would work for their theories, rather than for theories that would work for them or be true, so psychoanalytic critics went looking for authors and works with poop phobias, Marxists went looking for authors and works with some sneering or romanticizing of poverty.</li>
<li>The theories became increasingly speculative and decreasingly applicable, as they began to obey their own Darwinian dynamic and fight against one another for the most unique and exclusive appeal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When a person begins with a very small tool, she or he has to find a very small nut to crack.</li>
<li>We stop talking about Dickens and Pope and Ford Maddox Ford to begin talking about small, small appeal works and about the major figures only with antipathy and denunciation.</li>

<dd>Since Simony derives from the Book of Acts and was a constant accusation of clergy one did not like, it's a pretty predictable typonymn, although I can't say I know of many plays that used it.

<p>Just so you know, the recent note on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Talk%7EEcological_economics_dc92.html" title="Talk:Ecological economics">Talk:Ecological economics</a> was what prompted me to remove the RFC listing, since I eventually figured out that was why the other fellow came to the page in the first place and wanted to forestall any more timewasting.

<dd>Sure. Those listings aren't supposed to stay up indefinitely, I presume. It was from September. I only noticed after I posted that the Swedenborg account has in fact been editing for a year, though not very actively. What can I say--he <i>seemed</i> new.

<p>I have no idea if that it spelled correctly, but I was wondering how people on this site become administrators? I'm kinda curious. Do they have to pay? Or are they all founders of the site? Oh, and how long has Wikipedia been around for? Never mind, I'll look that up myself.

<dd>To become an admin, all you have to do is be a trusted, experienced user and pay $1,500 into <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a>'s bank account.

I see that those rude posts from you are still on Calton's page, although you have posted a sort of apology. I'm going to assume good faith--that you didn't know what I meant by removing them, or didn't know how--and remove them myself.

<dd>Dang. Then again, I was reporting a received opinion truthfully, with neither malice aforethought nor awareness of his continuing in business in that place (which would be unusual, if he were, as he had left before I did). Therefore, he could not be identified as a business, and he was regarded as personally unpleasant. If I meet Bob, and I regard him as horrid, can I not say so? If I am reporting my own opinion as opposed to reporting a criminal or untrue quality, do I not have the right of speech? Now, if I go one step away from Bob and say, "I heard from a friend that Bob was dull," would I still not be alright for saying a true thing about a report received? Is it not only actionable when it is malicious, designed to harm business, and designed to ruin reputation (and that can only be the case if the reputation is not true)? As it is, I said only good things. C'est la CYA. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:37, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Despite my profession, I wasn't thinking about this primarily from a legal point of view, just a "do unto others" one. Put it this way: if someone in "real life" encountered me once and found me to be somehow unpleasant (not an unprecedented phenomenon, I assure you), or heard a rumor that I was generally deemed to be a difficult individual to deal with, I wouldn't think it was appropriate for him to identify me by name in the context of a digression and gratuitously state that uncorroborated, bare opinion for the whole world to read on the Internet. Now granted, in this instance we are dealing with a relatively common name, so it's possible the issue would never come up - and then again, maybe in a week if this thread remains here, a Google search by a prospective client for [that guy's first name] [that guy's last name] [the town he is or was in] would yield this page as the number one result. Would that be a Good And Fair Thing, do you think? Regards, <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To tell the truth, I wouldn't worry about it, given his profession. He must be pretty prepared for that. By putting his name on a sign, he was already placing it in the realm of thoroughfare speculation. This is why I am intolerant of people who wish to put one foot into the public sphere, as if, making themselves public, they can retain ownership of their public character. This is aggravated by the fact that the name would draw attention from anyone even dimly aware of British history (or a Pulitzer Prize winning novel that was also an Academy Award winning movie). However, the duration of the evil was now so brief that I doubt a Google cache is going to get it, and the very coincidence of his name with a more famous individual means a great unlikelihood that he'll be able to advertise on the web anyway. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:17, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You seem to be used to receiving compliments on your insightfulful questions, are you sure that's healthy? Here's my maiden effort: are you crazy or do you merely think I am?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship#Co-nominations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship#Co-nominations" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> (Moved from userpage—please excuse a new user and get a talkpage link in your sig for great justice.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishzilla_a74f.html" title="User:Bishzilla">Bishzilla</a> 06:47, 13 November 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your kind remarks. Any compliments received by the undersigned are undeserved, I am sure, but I've had my share of cross words directed at me as well, so the balance helps make life here worthwhile. As for "insightfulful," I do my poor best, even as I sit here wondering whether "insightfulful" is an intensifier or a typo. It's to be expected that <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishzilla_a74f.html" title="User:Bishzilla">Bishzilla</a> would speak loudly and repetitively, of course.</dd>
<dd>As for the substance of the matter, I feel empathy for a potential candidate who is lucky enough to receive multiple requests to co-nominate from a number of respected users who are either perceptive enough or deluded enough to believe the candidate might make a decent admin. Today on Rfa-talk we read that there are some who will oppose for too many co-noms, and others who might withhold support based on the candidate's perceived ownership issue with respect to his or her own RfA. One person on the thread made the suggestion that I anticipated, to the effect that having to keep everyone happy in those circumstances is a good practical exam question for a future administrator, but I don't really agree with that. I suppose there are those who think RfA should be a gauntlet, but I don't think it ought to require navigating between <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scylla.html" title="Scylla">Scylla</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charybdis.html" title="Charybdis">Charybdis</a>.</dd>
<dd>My own view is that with all the harshness that pervades the Wiki (User:Konstable's flameout over the weekend being the latest development that makes me sad), we have far worse problems to be addressed than too many kind words, on RfA or pretty much anywhere else. I have also found that not all co-noms are repetitive, and some are helpful in addressing a candidate's qualities from differing vantage points, and unless the candidate has blatantly lobbied for people to co-nominate in an effort to distract attention from some serious flaw, I don't see a problem with them.</dd>
<dd>As for the signature, I will look into changing it. The Wikipedian who initially greeted me several months ago (you may check who it was if you like) failed to mention the matter.

<dd>Well, "a good thing," that is, in the sense that if one argues that B is a better choice than A, then one posits the consequences of B are in some sense better than those of A. Here, for "A" read having a bunch of co-noms; for "B" read letting the would-be co-nommers post early in the Support section instead. Your view, as I understand it, is that the possibility of the rationale of early&#160;!votes being overlooked, while obviously not "good" in the abstract, is easier to accept than the negatives of multiple co-nominations, whatever those might be.</dd>
<dd>If you believe the matter is unclear <i>in situ</i> then will return thither and clarify appropriately after luncheon, although I believe the thread of the discussion has moved somewhere past that point by this point.</dd>

<dd>Man. It's a problem that they're forgotten. This problem in its turn exacerbates, not alleviates, the problem of the conoms' greater pretensions, as the conoms through the forgottenness of the&#160;!votes get to even more emphatically call out, and <i>enact</i>, their greater importance than mere votes. Two tiers arise, distinguished not by meritoriousness of argument, but by mere form. It would only be a good thing if <i>all good arguments were conoms instead of&#160;!votes</i>.

<p>Doh! that's what tiredness does to you. Although if I remember from about 2 months or so back there used to be a template or something at the top of the page to say it had been closed!!! AH well. Ill remove it. Is there anyway to put the page up for review again. There really wasn't that much discussion and, though it's a nice page, I have seen better ones not make FA status. (all those images and red links). It just appeared that Giano's prestige as a FA writer was the main reason it passed (plus of course the quality of the writing). Ill raise the issues on the talk page anyway.... cheers --<b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup></small> 12:09, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Do you have something specific? The fact that you don't like it is sort of irrelevant, in that we all have to come to that point where we begin to employ criteria rather than taste, where we have to recognize that not all that we like is good nor all that we do not like bad. The article passed many voters, went through revision, and was not treated reverently by the voters at all. The theory that it passed because of its author is absolutely bizarre. Those comments were not fawning, and the author has plenty of people (apparently) who will oppose because of outside matters. Fortunately, most of those could tell that there were no legitimate grounds for objecting. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:26, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>"There used to be a template or something at the top of the page"—I don't think so, I believe you must be thinking about some other kind of transcluded page. FACs never had a "closed" template as far as I know. The <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">Featured article review</a> is the place to put a FA up for review, but you're—obviously—not supposed to do that as soon as it's been promoted. I'm sure you can see the unreasonableness of prolonging the FAC process indefinitely by essentially moving a page from FAC to FAR. Anyway, it's all in the guidelines at the top of the FAR page: three months is typically regarded as the minimum interval. I don't quite understand your point about the page sailing through because of "Giano's prestige", as FAC definitely doesn't work like that. Also, the reason Giano has prestige is that he's good. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li>In a nutshell: Giano has prestige for the <i>same reason</i> that the page sailed through - because he's good. Very good. You complain that "there was little discussion" - perhaps that was because of the rather stunningly simple maxim that <i>if it ain't broke, don't fix it</i> and Giano's work is not broken. Hopefully this will help clarify the perceived lack of harsh criticism. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 19:45, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But this is from the Ledoux page, they didnt have lighting in the 18th century, just a few old jam pots with candles in I expect <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 16:20, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, they had quite a bit of lighting...often the scenic elements: flats and such would have banks of candles on the back, large chandeliers would hang above the stage to illuminate the actors as well as footlights. If you've seen the movie <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadeus.html" title="Amadeus">Amadeus</a></i>, there is a scene onstage where Mozart meets the Emperor following the performance of one of his operas. If you look closely, you can see the banks of candles behind the flats. The chandeliers over the stage began to be replaced in larger theatre towards the end of the 18th century. These were replaced with light from the wings and footlights, all of which utilized relflectors. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 16:30, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You need to stop telling experienced users that intervening against your policy violations is not their business, because it is. As a Wikipedia administrator, I <i>am</i> involved with any policy violations I see on the site. So are other experienced users: Calton, for instance, knows more about policy than many admins, and obviously a whole lot more than you do. Since you ignored my civil request to not restore the personal attack on your userpage, I have removed it again and, this time, protected the page from editing except by administrators. Please let me know when you're ready to keep your userapge reasonably civil (it's far from polite as it is, either, but not restoring the attack against Alistair is the only thing I'm insisting on at this point in time). I won't take the trouble to post links for you about the userpage policies you're violating, since Calton already has, and you don't seem to have bothered to click on them. Please read his links, they contain all you need to know about the amount of control you have of your userpages. I also urgently invite you to review <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.

I stopped reading the rules when people said "well the rules let you do this" and then afterwards someone found a contrary rule just to get my information removed. You obviously read my opinion on my page.

<dd>Yes, I've read your opinion on your page, but I haven't studied the history you seem to want me to (I'm not even sure what history--that between you and Alistair, or what?), and quite frankly I don't have the time of the motivation. You see, I don't need to do that in order to know that you don't get to edit here in contempt of Wikipedia policy, as you do. Your generalized attack on Alistair is unacceptable regardless of circumstances and background. If the policies are too much to get your head round, I would have thought it made sense for you to take the word of people who do know about them—people like Calton, or like me—rather than spitting at them. If you consider an administrator is abusive or unfair—again, I know nothing about the conflict between you and Alistair—you can post an informal complaint on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, or open a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> on him.

<p>Hi, Bishonen. I was surprised to see you back in the TM article after having been gone several months. I think you made some good edits. I apologize for changing the word "claims" in a couple instances where you made edits. I agree with the guideline on Words to avoid that this work detracts from NPOV.</p>
<p>You're right in noting that it's odd that the organization doesn't have a name. The problem is that there are many branches, and there really isn't any umbrella term. I'm not sure what to do about this.</p>
<p>I noticed that you used the British spelling "practise". Is there a guideline on American vs British spelling? Thanks.<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimidGuy_f7a8.html" title="User:TimidGuy">TimidGuy</a> 02:28, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it's on my watchlist, and I get an impulse every now and then. I've been watching you improve the article a lot, I don't know how you have the patience (patiense?). Is there a guideline? Good grief, there's a wikitreatise and a battlefield, as I'm sure you know, TactfulGuy.&#160;;P I didn't intend to change American to British, but only, according to my lights, to change the noun "practice" to the verb "practise". I understand now that to make such a distinction in spelling the parts of speech is British. Please change it back. It's not that I want "claims", it's just that "says" looks a little, well, style-wise, it's kind of childish, to my ears, in this kind of context. I'd hardly ever suggest "heightening" the style, I'm against all that, but honestly, in this case... How about "states"? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I see that I warned him, then blocked him, for personal attacks and trolling back in April. (His charming comment on my block warning is still right there on his talkpage.) It looks from the RfC and the block log like his behavior hasn't changed any. I wonder if it may be getting time for a community ban on this persistently unpleasant editor, rather than bothering the ArbCom with an obvious case? Let me think on't. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Thank you for taking the time to comment on the RfC. For the record I have asked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-11-14_In_re_User:RPJ" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-11-14_In_re_User:RPJ" rel="nofollow">Mediation Cabal</a> to get involved, but only to bolster the case before taking it to the ArbCom. However, if this step is not necessary, I would certainly consider doing the Arbitration now.

<dd>Do it now. If you cast your eye over a few old RFAR requests—look in the History of <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>—I think you'll find that cases this obvious do get accepted, rather than sent back with a request for prior mediation. I think the arbcom has realized, perhaps a little belatedly, that it's unfair to make good-faith editors jump through that pointless extra hoop before they can get POV warriors and abusers arbitrated. Arbitrators know that productive users deserve their protection and support. If I were you, I would more or less just link to the RFC, which is already very telling, and describe in a few words what's happening on it.

<p>A few things, since I've taken ten minutes to take a crap and think.</p>
<ol>
<li>No, I was not "edit warring," nor were my actions out of hostility toward Mongo. I harbor no hostility toward Mongo, but other things which I will address momentarily. I do believe - and still believe - he once again abused his bit to silence something he a) is too close to and b) had no right or responsibility to do. That's why I re-added it, that's why I added a comment to it.</li>
<li>I am frustrated that Mongo's automatically the good guy and anyone who dares stand up to him is a troll or acting in a bad faith way. If we cannot question the actions of admins, those people shouldn't be admins, period.</li>
<li>I do have legitimate frustrations with him that spill over when you come over and threaten to block me for asking an actual, legitimate question. Having dealt with him lie about me and my motives does not sit well, and when I'm again accused of wrongdoing with no evidence to the contrary, I get irritated. Wouldn't you?</li>
<li>However you feel about his talk page, he was still wrong and I would appreciate you fixing the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd appreciate a response. I don't recall us having any bad blood, and I'd like to keep it that way, but part of that has to do with a little give and take instead of what we just experienced. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 23:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I seem to be expected to fix everything on the site today! I neither can nor want to. My concern with you is quite limited: MONGO's page and your reverts on it. I can't call <i>twice</i> reinserting a comment that you knew to be highly unwelcome anything but edit warring. You obviously knew other people kept removing it <i>because</i> it was unwelcome. In view of that, I'd call an edit summary like "ain't yours, either. If he wants to remove my comments, he's free to do so" plain wikilawyering. What would you call it, Jeff? I'm afraid I'm not going to research what's been happening at AFD and/or DRV (all I've gotten is <i>hints</i>, yet, that that's what this is about—I could be wrong, you could be talking about someting quite different). They're the least familiar parts of the project to me (being as I dislike them too much to familiarize myself), and I don't have a practical chance of doing it. But please note that I also don't regard it as necessary, I can see MONGO's page history without that lot. No, there's no bad blood between us, I've always regarded you as a decent user. I hope you take my points in good faith and in the spirit they're meant. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:19, 16 November 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>I personally don't think anyone else should be defining what's unwelcome when it comes to anyone else's administrative actions, but maybe that's just me. What do I call leaving it up to him to remove comments? It's interesting you call it wikilawyering (there's that word again, go figure), but actually letting <i>him</i> decide if a legitimate question about his actions is worth keeping around.</dd>
<dd>I certainly understand your points - my gripe comes from your apparent knee-jerk (just my POV, take it as that) warning to block me if I dare ask a question, because other people view it as unwelcome. There's a lot more going on than perhaps you are aware of, and my ham-fisted assumption that you knew the details was probably my fault. I still think you're wrong, and I still think you should actually do something about it, but you don't want to get involved and I reluctantly accept that. Seeing someone I respect follow along with the deceits that have been perpetuated is incredibly frustrating is all. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>MONGO had himself already removed the question from Alexjohnc3. Then other administrators removed it again, after it had been restored by Alexjohnc3. You restored that question, Jeff, with a comment of your own. The comment was new, but the question had been deleted by the person whose talk page it was; this shows clearly that it was unwelcome. Frankly, I can't understand why people are so eager to jump in and replace something that a user has removed from his talk page. I've never done that, even in cases where I, as an administrator, had issued a warning to a user who was being highly disruptive. He removed it; I knew he had seen it; I would feel free to block if the disruptive behaviour continued. What good does it do to Wikipedia to annoy someone by forcing him to keep an unwanted message on his talk page? Surely MONGO deserves as much respect as a disruptive troll who has been warned by an administrator that he's facing a block? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 00:48, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

If he removed Alex's comment, I wouldn't have pressed it further and taken a different route. Since it was other people deciding what was best, I decided to safely ignore it, since I think Mongo's capable of protecting himself. Now, if you want to talk respect, I'll be glad to talk to you about it, but I don't think you really want to get in the middle, as much as I'd love a neutral party to step in and end the nonsense. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:54, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jeff, that was my mistake. I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88052407&amp;oldid=88046183" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88052407&amp;oldid=88046183" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit summary, which, very improperly, accused MONGO of vandalism, and saw that it was rolled back by an admin. I saw that the user, whom I did not know, had posted again. I clicked on <i>that</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88053065&amp;oldid=88052760" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&amp;diff=88053065&amp;oldid=88052760" rel="nofollow">diff</a>, saw that it was yet <i>another</i> post on a subject that I know MONGO does <i>not</i> want messages about, assumed that the user was just reinstating something, and then rolled him back. I would at least have used an edit summary if I had not thought that it was a <i>reposting</i> of an unwanted message. That said, it's quite obvious that MONGO does not want those posts on his talk page, regardless of the possible good faith of those who have posted them. There's also little danger that he'll fail to see something important. Most users check the history of their pages when they get new messages, and it's already clear that MONGO is aware of what was going on at his page. Finally, there are some people on Wikipedia whom I trust to make a judgment about what I may or may not want on my talk page, and to remove posts accordingly, when appropriate.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=48252779&amp;oldid=48233704" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=48252779&amp;oldid=48233704" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> I'm not aware of being on MONGO's "trusted" list, but it's quite clear that he was not displeased at my intervention.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>My Lord, I find thy face apelike and thy form mishappen. Thy beard, moreover, is an offence against decency, resembling more closely the scabrous fur which doth decorate the hinder portion of a mongrel dog than a proper adornment for a human face. Is it possible that thy mother, seized by some wild lechery, did dally at some time past with a randy goat? (not you, Randy!) ... Thy semeth wroth, my Lord, or mayhap thine unseemly breeding hath robbed thy tongue of human speech. I do percieve, my Lord, that thou art afflicted with cowerdice as well as lack of breeding, for, in truth, no man of honour would endure such deadly insult as those which I delivered unto thee without some response. Therefore, I fear I must goad thee further.</p>

<p>I apologize in advance if I have incorrectly alerted you. There is a problem over in the Yeti article, user "Davkal" is seems to be show sign of old behaviour. There seems to be no arguing with him/her, persistent (which in itself is not a problem), aggressive and now is in the process of editing attributable text out of the article. I have tried to accommodate on more than one occasion and reword a very small piece of, quite important text from a book. I have single headedly provided neear all the references and citations, however in the case of John Napier (primatologist) a scientist of some note and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Angelo_Jackson_c63f.html" title="John Angelo Jackson">John Angelo Jackson</a> comments from experience are being blotted out. I have only really added short pieces of text, but most the data and non of my POV. The article in reality is about POV as people are observing and then interpreting sightings into something they recognize, which is not wrong, but there has never been any corroboration and so as many reportes have written, the phenomena is not soley concerned with (and its a minor point) apes, the article should be inclusive of the indigenous animals life. At ttis time Davkal is removing what he thinks is fit according to his rather retaliatory and self absorbed muddy thinking (thats my POV I am again sorry). I am asking you as to how to deal withit, I know just reverting will just compound the situation given his past behaviour. I have stopped doing work on the Yeti as a result. I have on two occasions in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangchenjunga.html" title="Kangchenjunga">Kangchenjunga</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himalaya</a> a large amount of background work to bring more to the artcles. articleOnce again many apologies if I've done this in the wrong manner.

<dd>Appealing to me is fine, except that any admonition from me is likely to get Davkal's back up, since we have a history and, at a guess, he still resents my previous admin actions against him. I hope you don't give up editing <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yeti</a>, as you clearly have a lot to add; as far as I can see, consensus is on your side, which means Davkal can and will be sanctioned if he edit wars for his version.

I've put a note on <a href="../../../y/e/t/Talk%7EYeti_3dd9.html" title="Talk:Yeti">Talk:Yeti</a>, and if the same problems continue, I'll put up an appeal on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> for admins who <i>don't</i> have a history with Davkal to watch the page. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:23, 16 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I can't thankyou enough for assistance, that is all that I can ask. I'm not a good writer but I am able to do research, I do have a lot of family connections with experience of the Himalaya and also the early books on the subject or the Yeti. I can also see that you have gone through the article. I'm not a good performer at this sort of confrontation and I think its a good idea if I go away for a while and just watch, I tried today but as you can see I failed (Wikipedia is compulsive viewing.

<ul>
<li>1. There are far, far too many blocks issued for personal attacks, and it seems to be escalating. I've seen people PA-blocked for <i>expressing differences of opinion on content</i>. What may be actually worse than the blocks are the unfounded <i>accusations</i> of PAs, both as admin threats and as manipulation by other users. I've seen editors consistently play the PA card to avoid having to engage with a content discussion. You might take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/His_excellency/Evidence#His_excellency_is_a_valuable_contributor" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/His_excellency/Evidence#His_excellency_is_a_valuable_contributor" rel="nofollow">my input</a> on this issue in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_His_excellency_21de.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/His excellency">RFAR on His excellency</a>; it was precisely this aspect that stirred me up so much that I wittingly exposed myself to a shitstorm. At the Islam articles, the manipulative redefinition of disagreement as PA had successfully shut up all opponents (except, indeed, His excellency) and left the POV of one side in undisturbed possession. I tried to edit one of these articles myself, mildly as all getout, and got told that all my talkpage arguments (which had taken me frigging hours to write) were mere personal attacks and therefore needn't be addressed; reverting me was all that needed to be done. The talkpage was full of such unreasonable put-downs from the reigning troika, towards passing anons and established editors alike. If they didn't write on Talk they got reverted because they hadn't written on Talk; if they did write on Talk, they got reverted because their argument there was just a personal attack anyway. Here we see a fine example of how the quality of articles, in this case the Islam articles, can be compromised by this PA nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2.That said, which I believe fits closely with your own views, I was also glad to see that you specified that disruption, in the sense of unrelentingly making life so unpleasant for good-faith editors that they give up and abandon the article, <i>is</i> a blocking matter. Such disruption often has PAs as a main ingredient. Sam Spade used to do that. The RFC on RPJ that I commented on today is another good example of using PAs as a way of making/attempting to make editors give up. Here we see <i>another</i> fine example of how the quality of articles can be compromised. And it's when PAs are used to disrupt, in this sense of the word, that I personally block for 'em. You do write about this quite clearly, Geogre, but IMO you might consider giving 2 a little more emphasis. 1 and 2 are equally pernicious, but I do believe 2 is more common. Oh, and I also consider unremitting harassment of individual editors to be <b>disruption</b>. Poisoning the editing lives of users is a block reason in my book even if no particular article is being disrupted. It prevents the normal functioning of good-faith, productive editors and there's no reason to put up with it.</li>

<dd>All of that is true, and what I wanted to do was highlight "unable to work in a cooperative encyclopedia" as the personality trait that's at the heart of the people who should be blocked for "PA." After all, the ones that are worth a block are not because they contain nasty words, but because what they are demonstrating is an inability to work with other people in any manner. I pointed to Prof02 for that reason. Some people just aren't cut out for this venue. Hell, every author I've ever known has gotten a little edgy when being critiqued, and being rewritten altogether is enough to provoke homicide. How weird do you have to be to sit calmly as the reasonable <i>DNB</i> inspired <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza_Haywood_a322.html" title="Eliza Haywood">Eliza Haywood</a> turns into an homage to a transgressive female redefining boundaries of desire? What I see in most of these folks is that they cannot cooperate or compromise, and so they insult and shriek and taunt. It's not because of some damned word or other, but because what they're really illustrating is that they just aren't cut out for this type of website. You're right that I normally do bring up the consequences of the NPA policy and how it is the <i>malleus mallefactorum</i> [we have no article on that! we have no article on that!] of Wikipedia. It meant hunts for numb spots on all the witches, and so some people (I'm thinking of Kelly Martin's recreating a hitlist to see if her opponent would delete it) begin <i>pricking</i> the suspects to see if they complain. I should add that, as it is part of my core belief on the subject. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:56, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for the Ming vase, it's a clearcut case of bias at Wikipedia.

<dd>Noting an illogical quote from WP:NPA, I went edit the policy, and ended up changing the parts of (er, most of) the "Examples that are not personal attacks" section. It feels a bit pointless, I think the entire policy is a disaster area. But anyway, I'm tired of trolls triumphantly telling me that na-hah, they can accuse people of vandalism all they want to and nobody gets to complain, look, it says so here! (Because it's a well-known fact that you're free as the wind to say anything however dumb or untrue as long as it's not a Personal Attack, and nobody gets to criticize you for it! Merely one of the many problems inherent in having the policy at all.) But anyway, I changed this and that and wrote a screed on the talkpage.

<p>Well, I'm fine with the changes except to the last paragraph. The <i>although otherwise it is</i> phrase is both awkward, and I think, overstated. A claim of vandalism, even if false, is not the same think as saying "you are a vandal".

<p>Apologies for the intrusion, Davkal has done his worst again and I don't want to fight anymore. However to give you the details of what I had to condense into one sentence in the article (and I said to him/her that to put all the data in the article would become far too long), I've put together the start of a document which clearly goes through all the information in a PDF file. The URL is <a href="http://www.cabernet.demon.co.uk/JAJ/TEST/Yeti-3.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.cabernet.demon.co.uk/JAJ/TEST/Yeti-3.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabernet.demon.co.uk/JAJ/TEST/Yeti-3.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>If you have the time or you impartial admins that might be interested in having a look at why a very short statement has caused so much fuss. The document is the start of a chronological treatise of all material from 1832 to 1980. The relevant pagaraph regarding <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Angelo_Jackson_c63f.html" title="John Angelo Jackson">John Angelo Jacksons</a> statement is at the start of page 2. I don't feel I can put that much data into a a Wikipedia article. Many thanks in advance for anything you can do.

<dd>You have very interesting material. I'll try to find the time to show you how to best present it (a sample of it) in a Wikipedia article, because Davkal makes a valid point that the short statement is difficult to understand. It's just a couple of tricks, really: the trick of realizing how little the reader knows, plus the trick of never saying anything from yourself, but always from the authoritative source that you're using. As for not putting that much data into a Wikipedia article: I actually don't agree, I feel it would be a pity not to use it all (a bit more concisely put). It would be disproportionate in the present article, yes, but the way to solve that is to create a new, detailed article, called as it might be History of the Yeti myth, and have a summary of it in the article <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yeti</a>. Confused? Just look at an example, for instance <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. See the section "Plays"? It's got a little notation like this on top:</dd>
<dd>
<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare%27s_plays.html" title="Shakespeare's plays">Shakespeare's plays</a></i></div>
</dd>
<dd>That tells the reader that the section is only a summary of the much fuller "main article" <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare%27s_plays.html" title="Shakespeare's plays">Shakespeare's plays</a>. This is a well-accepted and much-used system; you might think of using it for your material. Anyway, you'll hear from me with some concrete presentation suggestions. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I'm impressed that you've read the the Yeti-3.pdf document, (put together last night and this morning) I agree also that it, the data, should all be used and I'm quite happy to finish the article and put it into a fuller detailed account. I very much appreciate your option, I was becoming quite at a loss as too how to proceed in the face of so much negativity from one source. I did hint at the notion (in the earlier part of the discussion) that the shortness of the comment is the result of drastically distilling a huge amount of factual data, that everything else is taken from, and reported fact into one sentence. Agreed that a new article would have to be more consise or pared down, however I feel that much work could be just target practice for you know who to keep ridiculing, would there be some protection whilst it is being setup. You must know that it can be exhausting writing text which is either previously unseen in some cases or not seen in 30 to 40 years, which are the detailed account of all the text regarding this issue is just dismissed by well who know what? If a new article is setup does it not seem fairer that I should move all the data I've given to the original article. I'm trickless but I would really appreciate like to know how to present a document that can please everybody, I guess thats what politician do all the time. I've had rather too much wine I'm 50 in 25 minutes. Best regards and I'll write again soon. I do appreciate your comment [please keep in touch, however the article is being degraded.

Sandbox drafting is a common thing to do when you want to write experimentally, I often start articles that way myself. Normally, nobody would interfere with your work in your own "userspace". About <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yeti</a> being degraded—well, frankly, articles on subjects such as "cryptids" or whatever are forever in flux, and it can indeed be disspiriting to see them spiral down to a mere reflection of some agenda—or torn apart by different agendas—but often a reaction sets in, and they improve again. If I were you, I'd leave <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yeti</a> alone for now and let other people take care of it—the beauty of the wiki system is that when one returns, it very often turns out that somebody <i>did</i> take care of it—and work on your own "main article", until it's ready to be summarized in <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yeti</a>. That's just my suggestion, I'm not here to tell you what to do.

<p>Good morning, I've got a 50 year old hangover, my own fault. I'm going to take your advice and leave the YETI alone for the moment, and possibly think about a complete re-write that could be presented in about 6 months, it’s the research that uses up the time. I/we/they need to get everything together, and come up with what needs to be said and in what order that has none of the current mistakes etc (that will be a miracle). But a lot more verified facts need to get presented, however the more you find the more trouble you seem to run into, but thats the process of closing all the questions down as your come up against them that we live with it seems. I have a hill information (80% I've not read yet), references and original press releases that have never been seen or at least very rarely. Again your take on these matters is much appreciated.

<p>Well he might like you for some reason, &amp; therefore made an effort to make a positive impression on you.

<dd>Hi, thanks for contacting me. He's calmed down a bit, as have I probably (I mistakenly originally thought he was in league with <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">User:Vision Thing</a> and you know what he's been up to). However, now <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBKramer_42bf.html" title="User:JBKramer">User:JBKramer</a> is making ridiculous edits. I'm sure they're both very nice to their grandmothers and, like other disruptive editors, are perfectly fine when nobody objects to their edits, but they're insisting on things that are no part of wikipedia policy and breaking actual policies. Historically examples prove the influence of anarchist communism, whatever other encyclopedia may or may not have said (more to do with space and the likelihood that the material was covered under anarchism). 172's campaign to make a term, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_socialism.html" title="Libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a> famously used in 1970 by Chomsky (as well as apparently since Bakunin in other languages) as a neologism is ridiculous. Despite the fact that consensus is on my side, I've still sought to compromise, but have a look at JBKramer's latest edits. I have requested mediation, I've just expanded the list of people involved, because this dispute needs someone to come in and mediate between what I acknowledge are strong opinions. However, I'd expect the same attitude towards anarchism from other editors that we have shown to the anarcho-capitalists - a properly cited, historically correct reference. And the situation vis a vis that minority view is far more extreme. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 23:45, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bishonen - I have no problem in answering your question nor in accepting any potential mistake. In the 4 diffs presented as evidence, <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> repeatedly removes some wikilinks, the "anarchist communism" subsection headers and trims/rewords passages in "growth of modern Communism." His reverts took place - original and 4 reverts - between 23:07 pm November 18 and 23:43 pm November 19. In the first reverts, he removes "anarchist communism" entirely but then decides to merge it into the preceeding section. I respect this editor and I've offered (thru email) to revoke the block if he pledges not to engage in multiple reverts, but its his fault for not settling the issue on the talkpage <i>before</i> making "compromise" partial reverts. I quote from <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>:</p>
<p><i>"Reverting, in this context, means undoing the actions of another editor or other editors in whole or part. It does not necessarily mean taking a previous version from history and editing that. A revert may involve as little as adding or deleting a few words or even one word (or punctuation mark). Even if you are making other changes at the same time, continually undoing other editors' work counts as reverting. 'Complex partial reverts' refer to reverts that remove or re-add only some of the disputed material while adding new material at the same time, which is often done in an effort to disguise the reverting. This type of edit counts toward 3RR, regardless of the editor's intention."</i></p>
<p>If you feel I've made the wrong decision, please lemme know why. I am open (always) to your input. I don't wish to use blocks where a discussed resolution is possible to achieve. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 04:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe I'm too tired to think straight, it's about five hours past my bedtime in this timezone. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communism&amp;diff=88882263&amp;oldid=88874671" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communism&amp;diff=88882263&amp;oldid=88874671" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the edit I'm talking about. (Please don't tell me about timestamps in some quite different zone than what I'm seeing on my screen, that's all I need for my head to actually explode.) It seems to me that it's a rewrite of Donnacha's piece that's a <i>little</i> shorter, but mainly is better integrated into an article called <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>--a historiographic presentation of the concept of communism for the general reader--as opposed to an article called "Communism and anarchism compared," or such like. Also, 172 surely discussed it amply on the talkpage. But if a "revert" is now defined, for the purpose of the 3RR, as any change of another editor's input, down to a single word or dot--then presumably anybody who edits an article in any way at all four times in 24 hours needs a 24-hour block..? For they're surely always changing <i>somebody's</i> input--the word or dot I'm changing came from somewhere. The more I think about it, the more I have difficulty understanding that definition. It seems random to call regular editing "reverting". The definition at <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">Help:Reverting</a>, which is prominently linked to from <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, is quite different: "To <b>revert</b> is to undo all changes made to an article page after a specific time in the past. The result will be that the page becomes identical in content to the page saved at that time."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I conclude that, for "reverting" as defined in the 3RR policy to have any meaning beyond simply editing, <b>continually undoing other editors' work</b> must be very operative words in "A revert may involve as little as adding or deleting a few words or even one word (or punctuation mark). Even if you are making other changes at the same time, continually undoing other editors' work counts as reverting." I really can't agree that 172's edits amounted to continually undoing other editors' work. Especially the one I've mentioned, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communism&amp;diff=88882263&amp;oldid=88874671" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communism&amp;diff=88882263&amp;oldid=88874671" rel="nofollow">this</a>, doesn't do that --it's a thoughtful edit, and doesn't undo anybody's work IMO. Surely it can't, at the very least, be seen as a link in any sort of chain of <b>continually</b> undoing other editors' work. That's what I think. But I'm done, and going to bed, I'll leave it with confidence to you. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 05:44, 20 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Your rationale is very illuminative. However, I still disagree - thru the edits he made in the diffs, 172 was inserting his data thru the modification of the existing text. The things he <b>continually</b> changed were removing the "anarchist-communism" section and the wikilink on "ideology." He also sought to reshape the passage in "growth of modern Communism." Now the other editors were insisting that he not make those changes - its not my concern if they were right/wrong in this but that 172 kept insisting on reverting to his version, albeit with modifications to placate those who reverted him before. I followed a strict interpretation of 3RR based on the quote from the policy - what I would have expected 172 to do after 1-2 reversions, is to discuss his proposals for compromise and make the change only after the talkpage discussion settled down. Edit summaries don't do work for the talkpage and 172 should not have engaged in multiple reverts. However, I'm not a "trigger-happy" admin and I respect 172's contributions. If there is a genuine problem over 3RR's correct application here, I don't mind the slightest if the block is revoked. I just hope 172 is more careful from now on. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 13:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, to punctuate it as "You suck," the comment has to be a vocative. So, there is some person called "You suck" (or Yu-Suk?), and then we get "take you are elected."

I blocked Davkal for a week once (with 100% support from <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, incidentally) and he hasn't missed a chance to attack me since. I wish I had the temper or the time to edit the articles he has his barbed wire round, but I don't: there are too many more interesting things to do round the site for me to feel like wasting time running to stay in the same place, and being insulted as a bonus. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 16:00, 21 November 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I support your edit to the article. If it doesn't say what organization said that, it could say that members of that organization said it and that the organization published it. The weasel words saying that some have criticized CSICOP doesn't say much.

<p>Hi Bishonen,</p>
<p>This is Aminz&#160;:)</p>
<p>I have a simple question if you don't mind. I am involved in a dispute in which some editors consider <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Johnson_%28journalist%29_db19.html" title="Paul Johnson (journalist)">Paul Johnson (journalist)</a>, a conservative journalist who has a lower-second class degree in Jesuit method at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonyhurst_College_b072.html" title="Stonyhurst College">Stonyhurst College</a> at Oxford, to be more reliable than <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> &amp; <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> for the following reasons:</p>

<p>In fact, the quotes from the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> are removed and quotes from Johnson are replaced.

<p>Thanks Bishonen. Would you please let me know if Geogre, Bunch, and <b>Newyorkbrad</b>are read this discussion?</p>
<p>P.S. the whole relevant paragraph (from Encyclopedia of Islam) is posted here (to check its context):</p>
<dl>
<dd>It cannot be denied that from the last three or four centuries of the Middle Ages there was a general hardening against <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmis</a> in Muslim countries, helped materially and morally by the change in numerical proportions. Before proceeding further, however, it must be noticed that this hardening of opinion was contemporary with that which appeared in Christendom against the Jews and against Muslims where there were any, without our being able to say to what extent there was convergence, influence, or reaction. On the other hand it must be emphasized that the populace were more easily excited as a result of the deterioration in the economic climate, and that generally changes in the Muslim attitude had been occasioned more by political than by religious considerations. Hitherto <i>there had been scarcely any difference in the treatment accorded to Christians and Jews (at most they were distinguished by prescribed differences in dress); but it later came about that some categories of d̲h̲immī s were looked on as friends of foreign powers and were worse treated, and naturally some Christians were in this respect more of a target than the Jews. There is nothing in mediaeval Islam which could specifically be called anti-semitism.</i></dd>

<p>Thanks very much again. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 03:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Newyorkbrad</b> (why the bold?) will try to take a look in the next couple of days. But my first reaction is that Johnson and Lewis are both reasonable sources and the editors should be able to use both in the article, perhaps contrasting the differing points of view. I'm not familiar with Cahen. (Maybe this should have been the practical exam for the ArbCom candidates instead of John Reid's hypothetical.&#160;:) ) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 03:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Newyorkbrad, Thanks for your comment. Johnson has only a lower-second class degree in Jesuit method; not in Islamic studies or in Antisemtism studies. Furthermore he only has a lower-second class degree. On the other hand, we have a very notable source on Islam, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a>, brill academic publisher, and people like <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a>,... which are all experts.

<dd>Furthermore as it was discussed in the talk page, The publisher of Johnson is New York: HarperCollins Publishers, not a univ press or other ones which particularly publish scholarly books, meaning that it is not peer reviewed --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 04:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, just wanted to say congrats on FA status and also wanted to apologize for not keeping a closer eye on the FAC page. To be honest, I had forgotten about it for a few days, and when I did come back to it, I saw to my dismay that it had degenerated it into a contentious argument. At the time, I was still rather new, so I was discouraged and offended to be apparently lumped into a category of "smug" editors (simply because of my oppose vote) who don't understand simple grammar, according to Geogre. Not wanting to be sucked into such an argument, I basically decided just to stay away. In hindsight, I should have followed up more closely (especially as I just now saw your comments directed towards me near the end of the FAC). Anyway, my object was more to do with the missing citations than any prose problems (the long sentences to me seemed confusing, but they certainly weren't "flabby prose", and I think we can agree to disagree civilly). I guess I must have missed the covering note which would explain why they went unsourced, so my vote probably would have changed. Anyway, sorry again for not keeping a closer eye on it, but I was a new editor and I was put off by the contentious atmosphere. <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 03:38, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to see this dispute ended up at ArbCom. I was surprised that you didn't include the AfD link in your statement: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Erich_Heller_608f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Heller">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Erich_Heller</a>. PS. In the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_London_0aa9.html" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire of London</a> article, the style of referring to the sources by name in the article can be confusing: "Porter gives the figure as eight, and Tinniswood as "in single figures" [...] Hanson takes issue..." - initially I thought this was referring to contemporary people at the time called Porter, Tinniswood and Hanson. I know you earlier explain who they are, and give the dates of their books, but still, this is one reason why I prefer prefacing remarks like this with "20th century scholars..." or "in XYZ book (2003), Pearson says...", if you see what I mean? Anyway, just a thought. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:45, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That makes very good sense. I guess I just automatically did it the way I'm used to, the academic way. And also probably I felt so infinitely familiar with those names after living with them for months that I couldn't imagine anybody <i>not</i> knowing Tinniswood... pretty stupid, but what can you do. Anyway, why don't you just change it? I'd rather not edit that article any more, it's a sore spot for me. It got very frustrating to be called "territorial" and "trolling" or "<a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNing</a>" if I made any change to other people's edits, and <i>also</i> get blamed for every word written by other people. Pretty much a losing game.&#160;:-( I took that sucker off my watchlist while it was still on FAC, and the IPs are welcome to improve it freely when it's on the Main Page as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, why do you think the AfD is important? I thought of including it, but I reckoned the more pages I link to, the more off-putting and heavy going it'll look. Don't you think the user talk page basically says it all..? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>I'll try and look in on the GFoL article if I get time, but probably won't. Well, not until I see it on the front page, anyway!&#160;:-) As for the AfD link, that was me wanting to be completist. I think it does demonstrate some important points about Prof02's attitudes and also some possible remedies were suggested there. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:17, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>ArbCom?</b> ArbCom? What the hell? Let's see what the "remedies" could have been.... Unblocking? Yeah, that might be one. Posting to AN/I? That might have been one, too. An arbitrator filing arbitration, without recusal, on the basis of a <i>single action</i> is bizarre, if that single action was a routine block/unblock situation. Is there evidence of a wheel war? Is there evidence of failure to listen? Is anyone certifying this? There are about a dozen places to go below ArbCom, and a dozen ways of preventing recurrence without the tedium and bitterness of arbitration, so it's staggering that such would be brought. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:44, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The ArbCom procedures state that if a user is blocked, he or she can initiate a case by e-mailing a member of the committee and asking that it be posted. I would like to think that Fred Bauder was simply cut-and-pasting the e-mailed-in case pursuant to procedure without in any way endorsing it. I guess we shall see. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:56, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If the words are not his, if this is a c&amp;p, I would hope that he would take the pains to make that clear. Given the lack of attempts at solving the problem, I would hope there is no certification, as well. The person in question is more abuser than user of Wikipedia. I may or may not have agreed with the block &amp; lock, but it falls far, far below the threshhold of arbitration, in my view, and I hope like heck that this isn't yet another one of those wild ride cases where the person lodging it becomes the subject. If it does, Prof02 looks more and more and more like a Wikipedia goiter: he doesn't <i>do</i> anything, but he keeps occupying space. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It says "statement by Prof02" and not "statement by Fred Bauder," and Fred hasn't listed himself as a party, so that's the inference I draw. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 04:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. I've read it now, and it's unambiguous. I was hasty. Even though I entered a view, I really think the best thing is for it to be uncertified and fall off. I agree with one thing about all this, though: if Prof02 learns that he doesn't get to own the article, he will probably wander away from Wikipedia, as he hasn't shown any interest in the site in general. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Not very appropriate, I think, when it concerns an image like the one of the crashed Eagle.</p>
<p>I reverted your Andrée expedition article, because the image size change was so obviously against common sense there; one might as well remove the images entirely, as the small size makes most of them virtually useless as illustrations.

<p>...Speaking of which, I just discovered balloon fetishism while <s>stalking</s> looking at Bunchofgrapes's contributions (staunch defense of the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese.html" title="Cheese">cheese</a> article, as always). Apparently, balloon fetishism comes in different varieties, one of which is <i>popping</i> balloons. I wonder if there is any relation between that and a predisposition to like popping <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubble_wrap.html" title="Bubble wrap">bubble wrap</a>, which the Wikipedia article on the topic innocently and without sources describes as "stress relief". Hmm, I wonder if the scientific literature has anything on <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubble_wrap.html" title="Bubble wrap">bubble wrap</a>?<a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 15:55, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My reading of the case is that it was brought because Prof02 was blocked <i>and</i> his user page was protected. It looks like Fred probably brought the case because Prof02 couldn't plead his case on his user page - see the bit under "methods attempted to resolve dispute" (or something). That might be the little thing that those blocking Prof02 have to justify.

<li>I don't see what you're upset with, Giano. Charles Matthews says that all the page moves, etc., were maneuvers. He was trying to say that Prof02's complaint didn't apply to him. It doesn't apply to Bishonen, either, though. There are two parts to Prof02's statement. One is an AN issue, and one is paranoiac. He says he wants to be unblocked. Ok, that's a normal thing and doesn't involve ArbCom. Then he says that he wants "action" to be taken against everyone who has touched or commented upon his misuse of server space. That's an absurd charge, and Charles Matthews would have done well, from my armchair position, to have just said that Prof02 is demanding that we not be the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Instead, he said that he had been uninvolved in the thing that made Prof02 unhappy. &lt;shrug&gt; I didn't read into that anything to do with Bishonen at all. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

On behalf of all of the nonAmerican editors I have carried out some research on thanksgiving (mostly wiki based admittedly). It seems like a good time is nominally had by all, but I ask you - how good by European standards is that time, this image here seems to sum it up <a href="../../../t/r/a/Image%7ETraditionalThanksgiving.jpg_e786.html" title="Image:TraditionalThanksgiving.jpg">Image:TraditionalThanksgiving.jpg</a>, and that begs two questions, firstly an aesthetic one - why are they eating off a <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedspread.html" title="Bedspread">bedspread</a>, is there a little reported tradition here, and secondly more close to my heart - where are the wine glasses. Now, a comment from me (at an in USA aeroporto) I do object to being referred to as an <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien.html" title="Alien">alien</a> I have not flown in from outer space, I am in fact a human being - (there is no need to comment "Lar"). Anyhow I may be off-line for some time, my satellite thingy is attracting unwelcome attention, and a very large lady keeps smiling at me!, in an earlier queue she heard I had arrived via Frankfurt, and said she had always wanted to try a real frankfurter - words fail me - I explained I was from Sicily and clearly not her man - but she had an unconvinced look, please don't let her be nest to me on the flight. I should have accepted BoG's kind invitation and stayed where I was. I will attempt to make contact in the near future climate and natives permitting. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 19:26, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think people have a particularly good time. (New blog post on why.) They have a good time on balance, but in that harrowing of hell sort of way. It's like taking a giant purgative. At the same time, I had 18 hr driving in traffic, running fevers, possibly nursing a cancer (and possibly not), and with a bad head cold.

<p>Bishonen (great name, incidnentally)-- I noticed that you were closely involved in the FAC on the <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> article way back in September of 2005. There had been a lot of trouble getting that article worked out due to the existence of a large number of single purpose accounts that show up to promote OD here on wikipedia. (In the FAC, for example, no less than 3 different brand new accounts showed to vote in that discussion, for example).</p>
<p>Anyway, puppetry notwithstanding, I've recently done a major rewrite on the <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a> article and am <a href="../../../o/p/u/Talk%7EOpus_Dei_4841.html#Request_for_Comment" title="Talk:Opus Dei">requesting comments on its talk page</a>. I think the new page is better, but the aforementioned <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single-purpose accounts</a> have been reverting it pretty consistently. Could you look over the page and comment on whether the rewrite is an improvement and maybe help out in the ensuing discussion? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 15:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow... you get a lot of comments! So many sections added since my last comment to you. I'm sure it's probably because you're trusted and valued in the community, but I think your username helps. lol.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, thanks for helping out on the OD page. If you see any other non-controversial ways the page can be improved, by all means, go for it, you're doing great so far.</dd>
<dd>On a side note, I'm assuming by your actions that you approve of the recent rewrite? If so-- could you explicitly state that approval <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opus_Dei#Comments_by_outside_editors" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Opus_Dei#Comments_by_outside_editors" rel="nofollow">at the RFC section</a>? Reason being-- we still have a number of OD members threating to revert the whole thing back to the old version and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see one more good edit war flare up over it. And when that happens, it would be helpful if the admins could quickly and easily go to the RFC and see a list of 15 people all in support of the rewrite.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, the thing is, every time I've gone to look, I've gotten sidetracked into something else, like the intro this time. You mean read the old version and then read the new version...? I'll try, but it <i>is</i> a bit of an undertaking. I tend to not be focused enough, these past few days, to do something like that. Yeah...I get comments... I also get my friends getting comfortable chatting to each other here, over my head.

<p>In a recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Opus_Dei&amp;diff=91284173&amp;oldid=91284006" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Opus_Dei&amp;diff=91284173&amp;oldid=91284006" rel="nofollow">edit</a>, a user transformed the bullet pointed criticism to a prose form. I reverted that part of that of change, but do you think I was right to do so? On the one hand, the bullet points all the article to be a little more NPOV-- I wanted to keep the criticism very brief, and the bullet points allowed us to retain that extreme brevity but still be NPOVed balanced against a rebuttal section that was 3-4 times as long. On the other hand, we don't use bullet points elsewhere in the article, so perhaps we shouldn't here either, but should just create a longer prose form of the criticism. What do you think?</p>
<p>Lostcaesar has worked on a replacement controversy section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lostcaesar/project_page_3" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lostcaesar/project_page_3" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As of this moment, it's basically just the sentences with the bullet points taken out. I think it sounds a little schiziophreni (though he may have fixed that). Do you think bullet points are acceptable, or should we replace them with a longer prose section? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 16:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Breathe a sigh of relief everyone I'm home! Normal service is resumed. So to catch up on the mail:</p>
<p>Thanks Carcharoth for answering my question, well actually you haven't as to why Americans dine off their <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedspread.html" title="Bedspread">bedspreads</a> on Thanksgiving <a href="../../../t/r/a/Image%7ETraditionalThanksgiving.jpg_e786.html" title="Image:TraditionalThanksgiving.jpg">Image:TraditionalThanksgiving.jpg</a>. Mrs G would be very cross, if I put her best "Toile de Joy" on the dining room table and then let the kids spill sauce all over it - Never mind - I'm sure it's a very nice custom, and it must be very comforting to smell that lovely meal when tucked up in bed. <small>God! they think we are quaint</small></p>
<p>Now Bishonen, I see you seem likely to be absolved of assault on a newby. Even I 've never been charged with that one ( I think - could you check that Lar? - thank you) you must be a very bad woman indeed - I always thought it was such a boring page I'm surprised any one ever read it anyway.</p>
<p>Finally I see we are in for some fireworks tomorrow, well I'm sorry to say I don't think it is quite ready for the main page yet, I am about the only person who has not yet stamped my individuality on it - where I ask is the sun-kissed prose? I'll go and have a fiddle with it in a minute. Congratulation though, very clever! - is it a true story?</p>
<p>Oh yes. here is something I made when I was feeling bored this morning - clever isn't it - you may want to hand them out? I don't suppose you know how I could incorporate it into my signature? I love the cut and thrust of politics, just like being back in the old homeland at election time!!!</p>

<dd>He's expressing bitterness. And you're telling him he obviously doesn't mean it, because if he did he would change his <i>username</i>? You think he's joking or something? Trolling? And that it's for you to tell him to change the account name he's been contributing under? "Oh, just create some reincarnation or sock or something"? That's a very contemptuous proposal.

<dl>
<dd>No, I'm telling him that he's being immoderate in his comments. Allow me to explain why. Let me preface this by noting that I admire his contributions to the article space.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have no doubt that he's very bitter, but that does not give him the right to remind us of that in every public forum. Every time he comments on an admin action he finds it necessary to remind us that he dislikes admins in general. He'll probably work in a snide remark about IRC too (like that lovely homophobic box further up the page). Now, Carnildo blocked him almost a year ago. Apparently the slur wasn't severe enough to make him leave altogether. No, it wasn't too severe a burden until that nasty affair with Tony Sidaway and the arbitration case, a case in which Giano faced no sanction or reprimand (quite a feat these days). He scrambled his password and killed access to the email account, which isn't all that uncommon when one wants to leave--except that he came back. We deal with cases like this all the time. Someone recently got adminship under a new account name, and he wasn't the first. Now, the nastiness in the block log isn't his fault--neither is the nastiness in mine, not that anyone ever cared to look. However, the actions that he took to lose access to his account were his, and his alone. That it would even be on the table for Brion to personally address this mess is incredible--I can think of no other case in which so many people have bent over backwards to help someone. Even more incredible, Giano's two main opponents in that case, Tony Sidaway and Kelly Martin, have withdrawn from Wikipedia.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that it's too much to ask, on the balance of things, that Giano start treating other people with respect and that he realize how well he's been treated, when it's all said and done. Every time I see him on the noticeboard or elsewhere, making snide remarks about people who've done him to wrong and re-opening old wounds, I ask why his behavior couldn't be on the level of his article contributions. Civility isn't just being on the welcoming committee or couching one's words in soft language, it's demonstrating that you have respect for other contributors on this project and value their input.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One final matter. I don't appreciate having words put in my mouth. I never called him a sockpuppet or any such thing--I simply observed that if he wanted to avoid the "taint" in Giano's block log, he shouldn't have called his new account "Giano II." This seems to me a commonsense observation and frankly I don't understand the reaction it provoked. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 13:04, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't get why anyone should <i>care</i> whether Giano II is feeling bitter. The comment on RFAR was jocular, in my view, and this allegation that it was opening old wounds is a thing I can't understand. Giano didn't talk about how much he dislikes admins (and I don't know where he's done that in general...some of his best friends are admins, etc.). I've never read anything but disliking administrators who get egomaniacal, and a lot of us have written against those folks. Giano has requested the clearing of the block log since the day of the block, and for very good reasons. It's easily done, but, apparently, there are so many people who have put their pride on the line that there is opposition to removing a comment that everyone (except Carnildo) has said was a terrible mistake and factually incorrect. People are acting on personalities and saying that they're doing so because Giano is acting on personalities. We'll never get anywhere that way. Also, the "homophobic" is <i>yet another</i> insult, and a very serious one. If Giano were as bitter as he's accused of being, he could get pretty ticked off by being accused of homophobia here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:46, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let us not spoil Bishonen's lovely day, with all this talk of "little people", both RL and Wiki-friends know I am not homophobic. I have to say that the alternate meaning for fairy had not crossed my mind until it crossed Mackensen's.

<dd>Where I come from fairy, in that context, means something very specific. I fail to see how I was to assume it meant cake, or some such, especially given Giano's previous unkind remarks about IRC. I find this all very mysterious. I don't think I'm going to profit much by continuing here in this discussion, although I do appreciate that so many of you took time out of your day to tell me that I was wrong, that my concerns was misplaced, and that on the whole I was being unreasonable. Some of you were even kind enough to do so without being flippant. I thank you for that. I won't waste my time or yours trying to make you see something that you've decided doesn't exist.

<dd>I am sure you understand "fairy" as being homophobic, at least in that specific context (I won't even bother with the gay blade or the gay cavalier) but I am also sure that Giano did not have the slightest intention of being homophobic.

<dd>I agree with ALoan. If <i>I</i> were to call someone an IRC fairy, I would mean that the person is a lightweight, that the person is an airy nothing, not that the person is homosexual. Given the percentage of Wikipedians who are homosexual and the fact that no one can know and fewer than none should care whether the person at the other keyboard has a tab with beefcake or cheesecake open, making a gay bashing remark on Wikipedia would be really weird. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:40, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Cheesecake" for "revealing photos of women" predates "beefcake" (which isn't a cake of any sort at all), and I think it comes from the 1940's, when "cheesecake photos" were used as pin-ups for WW2 servicemen.

<p>I finally got around to posting a first version of the article on <i><a href="../../../z/u/m/Zum_schwarzen_Ferkel_3712.html" title="Zum schwarzen Ferkel">Zum schwarzen Ferkel</a></i> (I noticed somebody else editing <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagny_Juel_da1b.html" title="Dagny Juel">Dagny Juel</a> and posting an article on <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Paul_8383.html" title="Adolf Paul">Adolf Paul</a>, and I obviously couldn't let anyone beat me to writing an article I had, after all, been planning to write for a while...), and <i>three minutes later</i> some new page patroler comes slapping a {{notability}} tag on it. (I mean, I have on occasion tagged articles myself, but this one clearly establishes the notability of the place). I'm just wondering how long time it will take before somebody will put a {{db-group}} tag on the page.

<dd>Why take the risk of dialogue on the talk page, when you can slap a tag and run along?

<dd>Thanks and sure you can (although I'm sure it will be joined by another dozen vaguely related project tags soon, as that is what seems to be happening on all article talkpages). There is still some more work to be done here. I need to put in footnotes, and there are more names to be added. There is a nice image of the place (the one shown <a href="http://www.munchundberlin.org/munch.jsp?section=F4" class="external text" title="http://www.munchundberlin.org/munch.jsp?section=F4" rel="nofollow">here</a>) that seems to come from Adolf Paul's book, but I am uncertain about the copyright. It was, as far as I can understand, first published in 1914, but I don't know who made it. If it was Paul himself, he lived too long (until 1943) for it to have lost protection yet, unless there is some "published-before-19XX" clause that can be used. There are also paintings and drawings by Munch, but they are also still under copyright (another sigh), as he died only in 1944. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Upp◦land</a> 06:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Previously when we talked, the issue at hand was my commentary about Wikipedia and specifically mentioning someone by name. The likes of what I have currently posted was not mentioned. I am not aware of rules that I have broken by what I posted, but as I am being warned it now makes things quite clear. I would like to know the specific rules on the issue so I can avoid such things in the future. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 05:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know, its not very pleasant being threatened over things I was not aware of. Generally speaking its better to warn of rules violations. Stating you would lock my user page is in itself a direct threat. What I did hurt no one and it should be obvious that it wasn't done with the intent of breaking any rules. So I would appreciate a less hostile attitude since I wasn't trying to be hostile with you. Thats also why I am asking for a link to the rules your talking about. I keep getting these warnings but I don't recall ever being given a rules link and its hard to follow rules when you don't know them. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 06:01, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, generally speaking it's better not to troll and not to waste my time. Can you remember the times before you became a rulebot, Ayeda? Try to recollect that mindset and act according to it on wiki, and you can't go far wrong. There is no possibility for Wikipedia policy to cover <i>in advance</i> all the dumb or offensive things users can think of doing, such as posting different kinds of offensive content on their userpage. The specific policy on that is <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserpage_a297.html" title="Wikipedia:Userpage">Wikipedia:Userpage</a>: "libelling people on userpages is a bad idea, and in fact, using userpages to attack people or campaign for or against anything or anyone is a bad idea".

<p>Bishonen, I am not trying to troll nor waste your time. You posted a warning to me and I didn't know the rules on the issue hence my request. You should have noticed that I immediately removed the material you commented on as well as something else you did not. I did that in good faith to follow the rules. I admit to being irritated over this, but I am trying here and I came to you in good faith to find out just what I did wrong. Your cited rules mostly talk about libeling people, not organizations. Ubisoft is an organization. However, I do notice the second aspect of the quote from Jimbo, and I agree that going for an entire paragraph on the subject was pushing things a little far. So in the end I now see what you were warning me about, acknowledge, and agree. Thank you. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 17:46, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sno, knock it off. I told you last night not to do something like this. This was between Bishonen and myself and I find the situation to have ended properly. If you had bothered to do a little digging, you might have noticed Bishonen is someone we can agree with. Bishonen is a supporter of userspace. So stop making enemies of people that should be friends. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 17:46, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Bishonen, I'm not seeing what was so terrible about Tawker's warning. Yes, it's certainly appropriate to ask questions about a candidate's past history, but I don't think it's particularly appropriate to ask loaded questions, and I can't understand labelling Tawker's warning as intimidation. It's my understanding that ArbCom questions are intended to be informational rather than adversarial; "shown your true colours", to me, sounds like it came from questioning in the Canadian Parliament, not elections for the Arbitration committee. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 18:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To every uninvolved observer, Tawker's warning most certainly looked like an ill-conceived attempt at intimidation. It is not pleasant to see people intimidating superior editors with threats of blocks. As has been established on numerous occasions, these tactics never help to defuse the situation. I suggest Tawker should write a couple of featured articles before claiming a moral right to place such statements on talk pages of one of the best wikipedians around. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 18:14, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Except I am never intimidated.

<dd>And to Tawker -- and to me too -- the original question looked like a loaded question. Again, ArbCom questioning is supposed to be for requesting information, not making speeches shaped in the form of questions. So I still can't see why Tawker's warning was inappropriate. (By the way -- I did say Kelly Martin had my personal support, but she is no friend of mine, and I voted in opposition to her ArbCom candidacy.)</dd>

<dd>As for suggesting that Tawker write a few FAs first, I'm not following the logic. Although ArbCom has taken into account the service of established editors in suggesting remedies in the past, writing FAs doesn't give one a free pass in terms of everything else. If Wikipedia worked that way, our most established users would have free reign to be our most abusive. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 18:33, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm unable to access IRC right now (and haven't been able to for quite some time now), but I was hoping to hear from Bishonen about my original question. ArbCom questions aren't intended to be adversarial in nature, and Giano's brilliant FA editing (and I agree, it is extraordinary) doesn't exempt him from receiving warnings for things, so I'm still puzzled as to Bishonen's comment. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 18:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Npa templates, or user templates altogether, aren't supposed to be planted on established users. It's generally known (and gets a consensus on ANI every time it comes up) that using templates in such a fashion is much more inflammatory than calming. Real users—as opposed to anonymous vandals—should be addressed in a human voice and individual words. If you're aware of the infamous "cooling-down blocks" (which everybody also seems to agree never cooled down anybody or anything yet) which have been imposed on Giano by people who chose to dislike something "loaded" he said, I would expect you to see the "intimidating" aspect of planting a warning template about blocking on him. But I've discussed that issue with Tawker, and I don't really want to canvass his action here in the third person. It strikes me, btw, that nobody warned Cyde about the speech, thinly disguised as a question, that he posted on <b>all</b> the candidates' question pages. A few people questioned its appropriateness with great politeness and circumlocution. But threatening templates seem to be reserved for Giano. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:00, 4 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>You wrote: "Doc in his statement calls his role in the recent Giano RFAR case "silly"."</p>
<p>I'm afraid I may have not been as clear about this as I might have wished, and caused you to misunderstand me. Sorry. If I may explain, I do not regret my original action re Giano. I was an uninvolved admin. I had no history with Giano or any of his associates. I saw what I regarded as a self-evident personal attack on another Wikipedian. I administered a very modest block and, since such are often controversial, I reported the matter on ANI for peer review, adjustment, or reversal, if thought necessary. Most uninvolved persons on ANI agreed with me (granted, not all), but no impartial person ever suggested my action was in bad-faith or wholly unreasonable. I still believe I followed a course of action that was at very least reasonable.</p>
<p>My 'silliness', which I do honestly regret, was in getting "fired up" in the ensuing, and increasingly personalised, debate with Giano's friends. That was very poor judgement on my part, I should have left the matter to uninvolved parities to consider. A quiet withdrawal rather than a self-righteous defence would have served the community better.</p>
<p>Now at this juncture, I'll not make that same mistake by debating this further, or commenting on the actions of others. So, please do not think me rude, if I refrain from responding to any reply you may make on this subject. I simply wanted to clarify my statement. I genuinely have no desire for enmity between us, and, whilst I disagreed with your actions at the time, I apologise unreservedly if I said anything in that debate which was personally offensive or (more likely) unnecessarily hostile.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 22:38, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I see Ms Martin's user page is now sporting an adaptation of Kylu's bumper sticker, (or whatever it is Americans call them) well it takes two to tango in harmony I suppose. However, you and your friends are now becoming as transparent as sunshine but far less cheerful. If this is how you all want to select an Arbcom - God help you. Or do you feel it entirely my fault Ms Martin only has 26 supports and 156 opposes? Much as I would love to take credit for that, I fear the entire responsibility lies with Ms Martin herself. I suggest you take yourself and your friends off and use your talents more constructively elsewhere, or if you have no useful edits to make go and chat on IRC or wherever it is you all normally chat.

<dd>My questions were about the job. If a person says, of another, "drama queen" for leaving and then leaves, it's fair to ask about the intemperate comments. If a person is applying to be dispute resolution and sees only victimization in her own censures and obvious villainy in everyone else's, that's bad. Further, during the Giano RFAR, I asked and asked and asked what "she has left" meant. Since she blanked her page, said she wouldn't respond, and said repeatedly (according to the pasted in blog) that she wasn't "at Wikipedia" anymore, it was a fair question. Would she do that again? The userbox wars were such as to make her withdraw before, and yet her characterization glossed over all that and suggested it was due to the virtue of being an administrator, so it was fair to ask if she had any faults in the matter and <i>if she could assure people that those had been addressed.</i> She could have said, "What I did was later made policy," but what I was getting at was whether or not she thought that it was appropriate to act without discussion and consent. All my questions were about that. All of my candidacy has been about that: no unilateral action and no unitary executive. There was no venom in my question, and I frankly suspect you are reading in what I never put in. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:08, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Bishonen. Will Beback seems to have been monitoring the TM article, so I asked him if he might freeze it, given the onslaught of changes an angry editor is making without first discussing. He didn't think it was warranted. Here's what I said to Will.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Will_Beback#Freeze_Tm_article.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Will_Beback#Freeze_Tm_article.3F" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Your thougnts?

<p>An editor keeps disputing my understanding of the purpose of the Talk page to evaluate sources for reliability. This really has me confused.

<dd>Timidguy, I'll take a look, but meanwhile: you don't know how to revert to an earlier version? You really need to know that. Seriously. Please see <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>. Just practise a little on your own userpage or something, if you find it alarming (I know I did at first), and bear in mind that you will not ruin anything. Anything you do can be undone. Just tell me, if the page explodes (but it won't), and I'll fix it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 19:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I tried to create the user Puppy, as that is (increasingly) starting to mean me, but was told the name was taken.

<p>I wasn't sure whether that "external link" was spammy or not (didn't click). I rolled back on "Augustan literature" because the guy who was adding it put it in the "See also" section, which gave me a solid excuse. However, that IP has been pretty dedicated about inserting that link various places. If it's spammy, I'll keep my eyes peeled and revert it whenever it gets plugged into one of my watchlisted articles. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:40, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Levelling accusations of spamming always makes me nervous, but in this case, well, take a look at the IP's talkpage—those warnings. Plus, having an activity of 100% adding external links is inappropriate in itself, Wikipedia is not a link repository etc etc. It's not that the site in question is bad, but it's just like I tell the person: Google does it better, and a short list of really good and <i>unique</i> resources is much more useful. That reminds me, I used to go through the external links section at <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> now and then, on (a more urgent version of) the same "Wikipedia is not Google" principle, with a rousing talkpage speech.

<p>Thing is, I try very hard to avoid OWN. I therefore end up leaving junk that I should revert. Someone caught a quote from a self-published novel pasted into <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistic_inspiration.html" title="Artistic inspiration">Artistic inspiration</a> yesterday. I feel like, if I jump on these things, I'm "OWNing," and if I don't, I'm negligent. This is probably largely due to my being the only person at some of these pages.

<dd>You know, this is an old problem: a quality site getting inserted everywhere. It's not a case of bad faith, exactly, but mass-produced <i>anything</i> is automatically suspicious, especially when there is a commercial benefit to the insertion. Even if the content is solid, the fact remains that a .com makes money through advertising, and those rates are dependent upon page rank, and we are a wonderful page rank escalator. Hand inserting is certainly better than allowing for a mass produced link list. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is, yes. It's not a <i>bad</i> problem, but it is a problem. We're non-commercial and not for advertising. That's a really root principle of Wikipedia. If someone page rank boosts with us, even if it's for a site we like, they're still effectively making money off us. We don't accept ads for Amnesty International, even if every member of the site supports AI, or Doctors without Borders, and so we can't backdoor advertise even Bartleby.com. Again, it's not a <i>bad</i> problem, but it is still a problem, IMO. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:26, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you might have noticed, the thread on the admin noticeboard about my unjustified 1 second block is dead. The compromise section intending to reach a peaceful resolution is untouched. No solution is reached at the end and Centrx basically just stop replying on the noticeboard and responding on his talkpage (except making up stuff like I accused him of vandalism which I didn't). So should I go ahead and get the armCom involved in order to set official policy for 1 second block or file a RFC against him? or should you contact Centrx and tell him to admit his mistake (since the community overwhelmingly condemn the particular use of 1 second block) and apologize on the block log? (like you told Alex a few months before thankz lol) Your suggestion will be greatly appreciated.--<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">Certified.Gangsta</a> 18:56, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for reviving it!! I saw your post on my talkpage and what you said reflect my thoughts exactly. I mean, arbCom is gonna take a really long time. After checking out your proposal on the issue on admin. noticeboard, it seems like a definite policy can be made on 1 second block. I also checked out <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">User:Centrx</a> but he doesn't seem to regret his decision despite overwhelming consensus. An apology seems unlikely at the present moment. What is really disturbing is that the 1-second block is only one of the several ill-treatments (such as userspace harassment, stalking, etc) he imposed on me after my overly-harsh warning. --<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">Certified.Gangsta</a> 00:35, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Go to the Alec page. Youll see why your formulation is a mistake. And go to the OD discussion page. Your "rather than " is totally innaccurate, it adds a mistake in an encyclopedia!

<dd>Please click on <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">the link I gave you</a> to read about the three-revert rule, which is quite technical. If an editor's reverting, he/she is reverting: there is no question of an admin deciding that one side is "right" and the other side is "reverting" them. It's quite common for two people to be warned together, and sometimes (but I hope that won't happen here) blocked together. In this case, I have warned you and Alec. Mind you, I consider that you have been <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_warring_4ebe.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit warring">edit warring</a> (again, please click on the link) a good deal more tenaciously than Alec has, as you have actually made one and the same revert three times, and in a mere couple of hours. But from the technical, 3RR, point of view, you're both just the same, and equally close to the blocking limit. I wouldn't block anybody myself for editing infractions at <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a>, as I've edited it and argued on the talkpage, but I'll report you guys at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> if necessary, for an uninvolved admin to take care of.

Bish, I was trying to help out with this page because it looked like Louisar had compromised with Alec about which version to use, but both were at 3RR. Apparently I reverted to the "wrong" version (naturally...<i>it's always going to be the wrong version</i>, right?). At this point I'm not sure whether I should revert myself, or try to restore some other version, or just let it sit as-is. Then I thought, "hey, why not just dump it on Bishonen, she doesn't have anything else to do". I'd be willing to either Save whatever version can be mutually agreed on, or simply support whatever version you think would be the best working model right now. Sorry for the further confusion on this page, I really was just trying to help&#160;: ( <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics"><font color="green">Tropics</font></a> 21:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your efforts (go tell Bishzilla about them!) OMG, they agreed on <i>that</i> lead section? [Checking.] No, they didn't, another editor wrote it after you reverted. "<i>Therefore</i> members of Opus Dei fall under the jurisdiction of the local bishop"--right, say no more, that's horrible. Way to drive Alec to despair when he turns up. Alec and Louisar haven't agreed on anything, as I expect you know--what you see on Alec's page is just Louisar talking to himself. And what you reverted to isn't a bad version, it's <i>my</i> version, lol--endorsed by Alec earlier today. I suggest you just leave it, I don't think there's much point in editing the Lead for coherence right now. It doesn't have the right stuff in it. Maybe Tùrelio will see the coherence problem himself. If not, I sugget we let Alec take care of it, it's probably the least of his problems.

<p>These tags always amuse me. It's not that they're always inappropriate or anything, but to see the Andree article with a "you could learn a thing or two from the other languages where it made FA" brings a smile. The spirit of the tag itself is fine. Shoot, it would be nice if monoglots looked at the other wikis and tried to translate their FA's into English. It's just that sometimes the line of influence is already established, and it <i>goes in the other direction.</i> (Which saying is not meant to diminish the efforts or skills or even additional information that the translators might have shown.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:51, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Amandajm, I don't know anything about these matters, I'm afraid, always excepting the personal hygiene objets d'art. (Added a little more information there.)

<p>No, I didn't mean enlarge Palladian I meant enlarge English Renaissance <i>and</i> make links to Palladian and anything else appropriate. Never mind, I'll fix the link, if I haven't already done so. Bishonen, sorry about the template being left on- I've been transferring stuff to new main articles in the hope that someone will enlarge them.

<center><b>Announcement</b></center>
I've never tried to stop editing before; it wasn't as hard as I thought. How hard is it going to be to abandon something that's turned distasteful? I've been shocked at what Fred Bauder calls "the dynamics" of the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/wikipedia-en-admins" class="external text" title="irc://chat.freenode.net/wikipedia-en-admins" rel="nofollow">#wikipedia-en-admins</a> IRC channel, which Fred says that he doesn't understand.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&amp;diff=97142158&amp;oldid=97127195" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano_II&amp;diff=97142158&amp;oldid=97127195" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> I guess it really doesn't sound like you do, Fred. I don't exactly understand the <i>dynamics</i> myself either, but I happen to know something about what goes on there. I've looked out the footnoted bits of logs here for the benefit of those who need to know, at least those among them who have access to the logs themselves. Surely arbitrators do have, or can get, such access? But merely having access is not enough, the logs remain protected from the eye of penetration by sheer size. However, logs are simply searchable text, and that's where my footnote to selected extracts comes in. I hope many people will be able to read those log extracts, and have the curiosity to do it. They're no violations of privacy or personal attacks, so please restore the references to them if anybody should remove them from this page. I'm very sorry I can't simply post the extracts themselves, to make them truly accessible to the ordinary user, but that is not allowed. (The reasons include both major privacy concerns and something to do with sacrificial goats and/or dead chickens, see the ANI discussions.)
<p>From what some admins have said in recent threads on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, the en-admins channel was different earlier, and usefully served the purpose it had been created for. <i>Some</i> of the time now it still does; but a dedication to working out "safe" block rationales<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and childish nya-na-na-na-na viciousness and squabbling<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> fill a lot of it. The bad blocks arising from certain en-admins habits and imposed on good-faith and hardworking contributors like for instance Giano have been devastating for the individuals hit. Unlike many of my friends I don't believe this is inherent in the medium, but it does seem to center or cluster round en-admins. I simply don't know what the hell happened. Some sort of tilt in the balance of power? Some sort of refusal to see, or mental laziness? Simply a project that hasn't scaled? Or even more simply, was the viciousness alwayus there and, exemplifying the mental laziness, I just became a litle less naive when affected personally&#160;?</p>
<p>Anyway. This is an announcement. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> has said he's out of here, after one bad block too many<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Naconkantari&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97059026" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Naconkantari&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=97059026" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> turned into a proposal for "civility parole".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=97178344#Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FGiano" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;oldid=97178344#Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration.2FGiano" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> Now it's a hopeful fact that he has said so before and yet returned, enthusiasm dented but contributions still excellent. Therefore, I won't say definitely that I'm out of here too; but I do say that unless Giano returns, you've seen the last of me. That's just to let my friends know, really. I'm as vain as the next person, but I <i>certainly</i> don't have any self-important notion that the project needs me or will notice or remember my presence or absence. Wikipedia would do just fine without me, and without all the people who're continually leaving with less or more fanfare. At lest, it would do fine if it <i>was</i> doing fine. I don't think it is doing fine. It can do without the individuals and never notice they're gone, sure, but what about the wedges being driven between user and user<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=97191848#Are_we_all_deficient_administrators.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=97191848#Are_we_all_deficient_administrators.3F" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=97208652#Giano.27s_rampant_incivility" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=97208652#Giano.27s_rampant_incivility" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=97208652#Block_of_Giano_II" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=97208652#Block_of_Giano_II" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>I read your announcement above and I'm not even sure if I am allowed to post here anymore. Anyway, I actually came to say good-bye since I'm leaving wikipedia , but it seems like you're a step ahead of me. Well I just wanna thank you for helping me out on many issues/disputes since my arrival despite my poor reputation in this project. Apparently all the best editors who have good faith in the project are gone. To me, it seems like the eventual downfull of this system. A failed experiment to a certain degree. I just wanna say you're the best admin I've met so far and it has been truly a great time working with you.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">Certified.Gangsta</a> 07:48, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bishonen, there were millions of human-hours invested into this project and there are not that many productive contributors. Every single one go hurts the project a big deal. I left a message on the Giano's talk and I repeat it here the clique of the admins you have problem with is relatively small and there are thousand of active admins and probably even more productive users. Go figure. I got my admin bit for a single purpose: to create workable and enjoyable environment for the productive editors.

<p>Hello Bish,</p>
<p>our paths have not often crossed, although I have followed your work with great admiration; nevertheless I thought I should leave a comment. I needn't repeat what a loss for the project it would be if you left, because that's abundantly clear, so just let me express my gratitude: there have been few contributors as intelligent, witty, productive, or cheerful, and, contrary to your thoughts, you have already left a lasting mark on Wikipedia. As for the social dynamics, it's much harder to tilt them into the right direction, but I am convinced that you have also done so. It has always been my impression of your style that you have remained firm in that civility is more than a buzzword, and that's a great achievement in such a hostile environment. If you foster thoughts of continuing with Wikipedia, I am sure you have been offered lots of advice; mine is probably just the same: get emotionally disinvolved. Delete your watchlist (<small>that may be hardest bit, as predictably some articles lose in quality when one highly engaged editor fewer watches them. For me, it was an incredibly helpful step</small>). Consider renouncing your admin status (<small>the second really hard step; I am however convinced that it has helped me a lot to stay active at all and not leave for good in indignation</small>). Take a long break. Keep in contact with a few selected Wikipedian friends. Rediscover real life. After a long while, look back and, if you feel like it, return with the attitude of an elder statesperson. I wish you all the best.

<p>Hope you are still lurking. I've made a similar, but less drastic decision.

<li>Another very long time user, another serious contributor, another person in there, hip deep, trying to manage articles, and you're having to walk away from it, too? Great. It's not that there is turnover. We always have people fading away and fading in, but I see a clump of about four users who have been responsible for the departures of about six major long-time users, and generally with their own self-importance and bristling and revenge campaigns.</li>
<li>As I've recently written on my talk page: suppose you are insulted, even explicitly, by name, and accurately. Now, is that going to make you quit Wikipedia? Is it some place where it's unavoidable? So, what is the cost of that insult? Now, you're going to block that nasty user for that nasty talk and that nasty attitude. Is that more or less likely to make <i>that</i> user leave than the insult? Is that block going to make a long time contributor leave, or just a pest? Is it going to mean the departures of three other users? What value, exactly, do you value on your self-opinion? Is your character so important that the loss of four other users, even if they're only little contributing, worth your pride? What would it take for you to relax, to say, "Dang, I don't like that guy" or even, "Oh yeah, well, I don't like you, either?" For a certain knot of users, their own pride is far, far more valuable to them than the contributions of several others to the project.</li>
<li>Part of this is the danger of teen people, where adolescence means a constant battle for ego, but there are no brakes. Ugh.</li>

<dd>Let me add my own note to this litany of sorrow. You were the first person to really help me out and take an interest in my work here. To get such marvelous feedback from someone who, as I quckly learned, deserved such great respect heightened my own confidence in my contributions. Indeed, your talk page has been a learning experience, kinda like discovering a virtual 18th century coffee house filled with a marvelous assortment of fascinating characters. Looking about lately, it seems like everyone is leaving and the landscape appears more and more barren; littered with junk articles on worthless pop culture. I pray this isn't farewell.

<p>I'm not sure I made the hugest amount of sense; I'm still up at 10:30 am having been up all new year's night, and I'm tired and not entirely sober. Probably shouldn't be here at all.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how I can express how it hurts me to see good contributors - such as yourself and many others - as burned out of this place as you sound. There is too much poison here. I have no good ideas of how to drain it. Good ideas from yourself and others are always welcome, if there are any. Something is very wrong when it is the people who do serious, intelligent, in-depth work on the encyclopedia who are wanting to leave.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that you thought I was talking about the problem as if Giano was the problem. That wasn't my intention - I was sounding out things in general, rather than specifically. My apologies. I will examine my wording in the morning.</p>

<p>Bish, the same is with me: he is not answering my E-mails either. The last time I contacted him he was strongly upset by the recent developments but he did not have any intentions to leave. His lost would be a devastation blow for the Russia-related articles and a significant loss for Wikipedia in general.

<dd>Wow, look at that. I can't believe I edited it as late as this summer, but clearly I did. It's some links to users that I've at some time wanted to be able to find easily, for various reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I ought very much to tell you why <i>you</i> are linked on that list, and I've spent some time thinking, but I simply can't. I listed you in June 2006, as you can see, along with Frutti di Mare. I know what my interest in Frutti was—in fact, with some effort, I know why they're all there, except you. I'm reduced to asking: do <i>you</i> remember any interchange we've had, especially in early June..?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you. It must have been a rather weird sensation to find yourself listed like that, without any info about why...&#160;:-(. I will delete the list. (In any case, most of it obviously <i>isn't</i> any longer to users I'm interested in.) I created it when I was a much greener user, and I didn't see it as inappropriate then, but I do now. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 09:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC).

<p>Thanks for your thoughts. I suspect that most if not all dropouts continue to be present in some form or other, and I wonder if anybody who has ever become truly involved <b>can</b> even leave for good. Which is not neccessarily a bad thing for Wikipedia. Whether it's good for the individual user is a different question, but it's always a good idea to be honest with oneself. I have come to accept that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">you can log out any time you like, but you can never leave</a>. My approach, i.e. casual editing as "admin emeritus", feels just fine, and harbours a little good karma into the bargain, so I'll go on with it. And as far as Giano is concerned, I can't offer much of a comment, as his story is too complex and too long for me to overview, but I have read the IRC logs in question, the arbcom case and a few other things, and would conclude that there's more at stake than the fate of one highly respectable user (plus yours and several others'). One question that comes to mind, <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes__e160.html" title="Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?">quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</a> I don't doubt that many Wikipedians will be tempted to step into the age-old trap and try to tackle a social problem by technological means - more bureaucracy, less transparency. If the problem is recognised at all. But I myself have no good idea what should be done, either. Anyways, please keep up your spirit, and again, all my best wishes. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosebamse_5238.html" title="User:Kosebamse">Kosebamse</a> 13:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Butting in: that's the question I keep asking others to answer. For myself, I know the answer, as I didn't have to think it up. We, as humans in society, have had to sort this matter out already, in Athens and Rome. The answer is "all." Only community can assess the validity of the community guardians. That means making it <i>possible</i> and <i>attractive</i> for the community to see, and it means, very importantly, an <i>educated</i> community.

<p>I don't think it's any secret that I am a very ardent (too much so no doubt) member of the Bishonen fan club. Your articles are an enormous pleasure to read and easily among the best we have.

<p>Working and joking alongside you have given me a ridiculous amount of enjoyment over the time I've known you.

<dd>User:Carcharoth asked me an architecture question, and I think it's worth pasting my reply here.
<dl>
<dd>"*The answers, of course, would come from Giano. My architectural expertise is limited to knowing where to find the door and the toilet. Giano knew estates, manorial houses, and architectural history, and he did the best job of writing up the architecture with just enough of the history to go in to illuminate without sidetracking the thing. It's a rare skill, despite what anyone will tell you. Any fool can crib from a reference work. Any fool with a library can compile the data from multiple references. An actual author, an actually <i>good</i> author, can balance information, synthesize points of view, and manage to present a cogent argument that is NPOV and representative of contemporary scholarship. That's what Giano did. It's what Bishonen has done with elements of British history, Swedish history, and theatrical history. I'd like to think I hit that a few times, too. A <i>good</i> article is not Frankenstein wiki-itis, where, like a sticky bun in the trash can, bits are sticking out in all directions...."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Polemics followed, but the point I made there stands. An actual author, an actual expert editor, does not just throw in reworded stuff (the way I've done several times...cited, non-plagiarized, but not exactly intellectually strenuous), but rather holds a <i>thesis,</i> merges information from references along a <i>principle of selection,</i> provides <i>analysis</i> without inserting the much-feared Original Research, and knows exactly how much sex and violence, how much digression and factual compilation, will work to make a good account. Such a person similarly has control of her language, varies sentence structures, provides surprises in the sound as well as sense of the line. That's what Bishonen does, what Giano did, and what my few best have done, and it is absolutely <i>not</i> a common skill. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not a common skill. I am not very good at it myself (I just make do with cribbing from reference works, and compiling data from multiple references. But then I like sticky buns.)</p>
<p>Anyway, happy new year to you. As I just said to Giano, it looks like I missed all of the excitement. Funny what can happen while you are away for a few weeks. <b>Please</b> don't go, at least, not permanently. A wikibreak for a bit of fresh air is all well and good, but I (we) would miss you awfully. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 14:37, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for the encouraging words. A glass of beer definitely makes me feel good&#160;:). And I mean, the whole project right now is just a pain in the ass. I just reviewed my block log and found a couple of blocks that are either unjustified, unprovoked, or out-of-process. (you already know how much I resent that 1-second block) And admins on IRC conspiring/baiting to scare y'all away is just fucked up. (I know I'm supposed to be a positive role model and all that on wiki, but that's that.) Just scanned through some of the articles you and Giano wrote and it's like wow, I'm so impressed. Anyway, take it easy... can't type when I'm drinking, you know, so I'm outta here. Btw, I know this sounds lame and cliche-ish but there's always light at the end of a tunnel. Who knows?

<p>Hello Bish, all the best in the new year to you! Hoping you can explain why there are little numbers with a + or - in front of them on the articles displayed on my watchlist. Is this a new thing or have I just been missing it till now? Inquiring minds need to know!

<p>Well, I looked at the diff, and I still can't figure it out. What exactly means "Un-sunkissing the puctuation"? Curiously yours, - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 01:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Er, it's supposed to be "punctuation". <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> punctuates lightly, with occasional run-on sentences, and is fond of claiming that this characteristic prose is his national (Italian) heritage.

<p>Hello Bishonen -- Add me to the many others hoping you decide to reengage with the project. You said above that Wikipedia would do just fine without you, if it were doing fine in the first place. Two points:</p>
<p>First, Wikipedia will always "do fine" in the sense of never missing anyone. It's real people--our friends and admirers--who miss us, and you have battalions of them here, including many, like me, easily unnoticed on the periphery of your acquaintance. You said somewhere recently that you care far more about your friends than about the project. So please look beyond the plight of one friend and consider what <u>all</u> of your friends are saying and feeling. People here have benefited immensely from interacting with you and from the model set by your contributions. They are truly distressed by the prospect of losing you.</p>
<p>Second, Wikipedia is the human race's most ambitious experiment in the democratization of knowledge dissemination. Nothing so gloriously extravagant could (or should!) go smoothly. Error, foolishness, incivility, and cacophony come with the territory. But if the human race presses forward with projects like Wikipedia, then slowly--very slowly--it can teach itself to behave better.</p>
<p>So please stick around, Bishonen. Your penetrating mind and big heart mean so much to your friends and equip you like few others to deal with this gorgeous monstrosity of a project. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiPedant_c1b0.html" title="User:WikiPedant">WikiPedant</a> 20:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In case you didn't notice my response, <a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">User:Nlu</a> doesn't wanna get involved. Plus, I don't wanna escalate this issue or Guardian Tiger will go around spamming user talkpages making personal attacks then I'll probably end up getting blocked. What I suggest is this, you or one of your admin friend may want to do some investigation on <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuardian_Tiger_7cda.html" title="User:Guardian Tiger">User:Guardian Tiger</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">User:RevolverOcelotX</a>, and most importantly the indef. blocked account <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaGnaRoK_SepH%C3%ADr0tH_ad3f.html" title="User:RaGnaRoK SepHír0tH">User:RaGnaRoK SepHír0tH</a>, it isn't that hard to tell. If it was determined that they are the same person, then block all the socks without checkuser. If the conclusion is I was wrong, which means I am being a complete pain in the ass, then block ME. Does this sound good? Is it really that hard to block an obvious sock?

<dd>Without having followed all the links, CheckUser isn't normally used in personal disputes because it doesn't really matter if socks are being used - there's no rule against being an idiot from multiple accounts. Checkuser is usually reserved for people suspects of violating blocks or using multiple accounts for voting. This sounds more like a job for the mediation cabal.

<dd>Gangsta's contention isn't merely that Guardian Tiger is a sock or reincarnation (which he obviously is, since he sprang into fully-competent action on December 27, more aware of wiki vernacular, procedures and fora than any newbie could be). It's that he's an <i>abusive</i> sock of a <i>banned</i> user. That's the accusation I'm looking into. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>This is a response to what Bishonen posted on my talk page. Whether or not RaGnaRoK SepHír0tH was block or not is irrelevant. The fact is the original account that RaGnaRoK SepHír0tH was linked to, <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolverOcelotX_fe1a.html" title="User:RevolverOcelotX">User:RevolverOcelotX</a> was <i>not</i> block or banned indefinately.

<p>So, the main page FA today says that "Half Life 2" "gathered near unanimous positive reviews." Adverb anyone? Our hypercorrective style sheet folks let that go? The "limp prose" people didn't notice that the English language does not allow adjectives to modify adjectives? They don't know that "near" (as in "almost") is not an adverb? On the other hand, our first successful collaboration will be on the main page next week, and I'm sure it will be on FAR for footnotes the day after. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nah. Purposes and porpoises are equally rhotic, but those nominal eggs were the most outrageous. (Try saying, "it cost a nominal egg" very quickly, with no pause between words.

<dd>Indeed, it cost an arm and a leg. The problem with assuming these are "eggcorns" is that this is the substitution of a high falutin' word for a very common set of words. "An arm and a leg" is much <i>easier</i> to understand than a "nominal egg." Prior to the color orange, there was yellow -- a word whose meaning and usage far predate the band Coldplay. Given that poor Moll's profession required a great deal of loss of humors, she may well have died had she had to salivate. The first postage stamp came along later, so we cannot assume she was sent to lick stamps all day as punishment. Saint John Gonson? Surely that's another goof. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't agree with the approach of User:RevolverOcetlotX or whatever he's called this week, but I find it ridiculous that someone like <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">User:Certified.Gangsta</a>, who is either a blatant vandal and troll, or ignorant as a cucumber, can be allowed to run around wasting everyone else's time when others who are not nearly as disruptive (i.e. User:RevolverOcelotX) are being indef blocked.</dd>
<dd>If you don't believe me about the vandal/troll/cucumber comment, look through the history of the diffs I supplied above: almost every single one of User:Certified.Gangsta's article edtis gets reverted by reputable editors. No doubt User:Certified.Gangsta will claim that they are all the same people/all sockpuppets of each other/all Communist China stooges, but such claims only goes to prove my point.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I have vented my spleen. I have no intention to do anything about my dissatisfaction. Thank you for your time, and happy editing. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 12:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In case you haven't noticed, there has been some shocking developments in the last few hours. <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuardian_Tiger_7cda.html" title="User:Guardian Tiger">User:Guardian Tiger</a> created a new sock to evade his community ban and returned to editing without community consensus or arbCom ruling. The most outlandish accusation his new sock made is accusing <a href="../../../i/s/b/User%7EIsberg_218b.html" title="User:Isberg">User:Isberg</a> to be your sockpuppet. I don't believe it.

<dd>I've had trouble getting somebody to eyeball the situation, Boney. I'll try again tomorrow, or try to try. In case I'm not around anymore, please contact CheckUser <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> directly and ask him to review, he already knows the facts. As for <a href="../../../i/s/b/User%7EIsberg_218b.html" title="User:Isberg">Isberg</a> and the page <a href="../../../i/s/b/User%7EIsberg_Conflict_b2e6.html" title="User:Isberg/Conflict">Isberg/Conflict</a>, what can I tell you? I appreciate your indignation on my behalf, but it's misplaced. Nice friendly little sock! Sure it's mine.</dd>

<dd>I'm not going to worry about that. But the problem is that how exactly did Guardian found the Isberg account even though Isberg had made no interaction with the wiki community outside of her subpage, talkpage, and userpage? This seems a little creepy. --<a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECertified.Gangsta_104a.html" title="User:Certified.Gangsta">Certified.Gangsta</a> 01:07, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
