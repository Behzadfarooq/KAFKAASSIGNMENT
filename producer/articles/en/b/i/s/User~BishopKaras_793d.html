<p>Sorial Ayad Sorial was born on January 17, 1955.Ever since his early youth, Sorial (Bishop Karas) loved the pure life with Christ. We have all heard of his miracles in his childhood, when I read about saints and martyrs I was surprised at their courage and devotion they had. Yet, there was something about Bishop Karas that was different, I never had the opportunity to know him well, yet it was as though I had a relationship with him, without seeing him. When Sorial was 11 years old in Comboni High School, the dean of the school (a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> Monk) wanted him to go to Italy to study and become a monk. Yet, the parents of Sayedna were firm in the Orthodox faith, and refused. As you can see, Sorial was a child who was loved by everybody. Even from the young age, he had his life devoted to Our Lord Jesus Christ. It was said by Fr. Sorial Sorial that Bishop Karas had a secret life with Christ. Even when Sorial was a young child, he desired to become a monk and live with Christ. Even when he was a young child, sometimes he would be found praying for hours!</p>
<p>After Sorial finished his bachelor Degree in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_Engineering_daa9.html" title="Chemical Engineering">Chemical Engineering</a>, he left to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. During this time, he heard a voice callin him three times, and told him to go to St. Bishoy Monastery. He did not stop, yet went to the Saint Bishoy Center in Cairo. He left all his possessions and personal belongings, and only took his passport. Sayedna didn’t want to waste his time in the lusts of this world, and he left to the Monastery of Saint Bishoy. He left without even telling anybody, not even his brother, Elia. (Fr. Sorial)</p>
<p>Bishop Karas struggled during his illness, yet found peace and rest in the Lord. The presence of Sayedna was felt, even if he was not among the people. Also, his love was shown through the monks and novices, and their care for the visitors. Truly, I admire Bishop Karas because he fought through his illness, and still had the power from God to visit other sick people, and stay with the visitors. His love for the monastery was so great, because he so compassionate and caring with everyone. He put his illness in the hands of God, and God gave him the power from above. He accepted visitors even when he was tired and undergoing chemotherapy. From what I have seen, heard, and heard Bishop Karas showed us the true Christian way of ascetism, generosity, purity, righteousness, and keeping the faith. Even before he entered the monastery I was perplexed and confounded when he told the monk on duty at the Monastery of Saint Bishoy. “No one, having put his hand on the plough can look back.” (Luke 9:62) The monk told Sayedna to finish his studies, yet the monk allowed him to enter. From this Bible verse that Anba Karas said, I knew he had desired to live the life with Christ. During his monastic years, people saw Sayedna as a worthy and holy monk. H.H. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Shenouda_7f67.html" title="Pope Shenouda">Pope Shenouda</a> kept him in charge of the Papal Center in St. Bishoy Monastery.</p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishopKaras_793d.html" title="Edit section: His Love">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">His Love</span></h1>
<p>His love for everyone was great. Thus all the bishops and metroplitans agreed once they heard on hte ordination of Father Karas. Many of the people who knew Bishop Karas, were suprised how He stayed with them during his illness.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishopKaras_793d.html" title="Edit section: Kindness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kindness</span></h1>
<p>There was a family who visited the Monastery, yet the father had forgot his medicine. However, Bishop Karas had the same medicine, so he got the medicine for the father. Sayedna fed the tablet to him. Also, he gave the two girls pencils that said "God Bless You - Bishop Karas"</p>

<p><b>Sayedna Meeting an Unkown Monk</b> There was a time when Bishop Karas told a family that before he was sick, he used to walk in the Wilderness. When he was walking, he used to see one of the monks that were at the monastery, and would greet him. However, the monk didn't have any crosses on the Kolonsoa, and the monk hugged him very hard that he couldn't breathe. Sayedna made the sign of the cross on him, and then the monk disapperared out of the Galabeya(Tunic) and Kolonsoa (Head Covering). Bishop Karas also mentioned that he believed this was satan trying to trick him.</p>
<p><b>The Authority Sayedna Had Over Animals</b></p>
<p>Before H.G. Bishop Karas departed, Bishop Karas along with some visitors werewalking in the desert. While walking, they saw a snake. Bishop Karas told the snake to go back in his hole, and if he were to see the snake again he would kill it. The snake actually listened, and left their presence. After a short period, the sam snake emerged again. Sayedna told the snake that he had warned him, and that he would kill him. Bishop Karas did the sign of the cross over the snake, and left. One man who was unsure, and did not want Sayedna's words to be in vain, went back to kill the snake. However, he found the snake already dead, after a little while since Bishop Karas did the sign of the cross.</p>
<p><b>Bakhour That Came to Bishop Karas</b></p>
<p>There was a family who had a video of Bishop Karas when he had visited them during Thanksgiving. When His Grace was blessing the meal, bakhour started to appear. Yet it was hard to tell where it was coming, but it started to head toward Anba Karas, then it disappeared once it reached him. However, they discovered this miracle after the departure of Bishop Karas.</p>
<p><b>Woman Who Struggled Driving in Tough Weather</b></p>
<p>The driving was uneasy, so the family asked Bishop Karas to watch over them. The woman who was driving the car noticed something being dran on the driver's side window. After parking the car, she saw the image of Bishop Karas in his casket and underneath Him was the road she had just driven on.</p>
