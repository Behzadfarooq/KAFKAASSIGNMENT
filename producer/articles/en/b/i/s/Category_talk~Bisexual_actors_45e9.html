<p>We should have different pages for bisexual actors and bisexual actresses. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatzarro_d244.html" title="User:Batzarro">Batzarro</a> 12:54, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree. Basically a Bi listing would include half of the female professional pornstars, anyway. Of course gay-for-pay would require a higher degree of pure acting. @_@ <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 19:49, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A statement clarifying the inclusion criteria is necessary for these articles. My ideas for statement include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
<li>The article must contain sources confirming that the person acknowledges that they are bisexual.</li>
<li>The article text must mention that the person is bisexual. This could be a very short sentence. In fact that may be desirable since being bisexual is not the reason for their article.</li>
<li>Rarely, if ever, should the category be used on historical people. Bisexual is a modern concept.</li>
<li>Should be used with great caution, if at all, in non-western cultures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions, ideas? We need to remove all the articles/people without sources. That could be quite a few I'm afraid unless someone finds the sources. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 06:15, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello 81.110.194.136, please don't jump to conclusions. I'm thinking about this from sociology/cultural anthropology perspective. I offered to help fix this category to keep it from being deleted. Can we discuss this topic in an intellectual way? The term bisexual is poorly defined in modern western culture. People use it in different ways. An attraction? A lifestyle? Some people argue that everyone is bisexual under the right circumstances. Certainly, some past cultures had bisexuality as a standard part of their culture. My point is that we need to give the term a specific meaning to make it easy for editor to use. Feel free to disagree. But don't accuse me of something ugly. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 08:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you going to fix the list? Some of the people on the list are avowed homosexuals. Are they being lumped into this list as well? Also some of these people have not been verified at all, in fact, they are downright incorrect. Should there not be some attempt at accuracy?Lorrobhen 22:24, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's the plan. I took some out of the category, already. If you see some that need to be removed, go ahead and do it. Leave a note on the actors talk page explaining the reason. Otherwise, I plan to through the category after the Cfd is over. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 22:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just because a person is rumored to have been bisexual does not necessarily mean that that person is a bisexual. Without conclusive proof, a person cannot be listed as such.</p>

<dd>And how would you suggest we find conclusive proof that an actor is bisexual or gay? Not all of them "come out".</dd>

<p>I thought everyone knew that James Dean was bisexual, yet he's not on this list. Shouldn't he be included? How exactly do you know that he is or was Bisexual??? Do you have any proof? Alright then shut the hell up and get the f*ck out!</p>

<p>I noticed that Misty Mundae is listed as a bisexual actress. However, I recall seeing a magazine quote (not readily verifiable by Wikipedia standards, since I cannot at present track it down) indicating that she has had at least one boyfriend and had no lesbian interests outside of her known on-film activities, so any indication that she is bisexual must be based strictly on her on-screen sexual activities. So -- what are the standards for identifying an actress as bisexual? Is it enough to determine that she has performed sex acts on film with partners of both sexes, or do we need to determine that she has has admitted to both male and female partners off-film? The answer to this question might call into question Misty Mundae's inclusion in this category.</p>
<p>The importance of this question will affect the categorization of four of her E.I. Cinema co-stars, all of whom have performed lesbian sex acts on film but none of whom have admitted to being totally lesbian in their personal lives -- in fact, I would identify at least one of them as being bisexual based on unverifiable personal knowledge, with the other three being unclassifiable because of lack of said knowledge.</p>
<p>Anyway -- based on a decision about whether Misty Mundae truly qualifies as bisexual (and in the absence of information that indicates that what I said about her in the first paragraph of my posting is untrue), either we should delete Misty Mundae from this list or I need to find verifiable information that would permit me to add one or her co-stars to this list.</p>
