	    <p>The <b>diocese of Troyes</b> comprises the <i><a href="../../../d/%C3%A9/p/D%C3%A9partement_in_France_e00c.html" title="Département in France">département</a></i> of <a href="../../../a/u/b/Aube.html" title="Aube">Aube</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopric_of_Troyes_e34e.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The catalogue of bishops of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troyes.html" title="Troyes">Troyes</a>, known since the 9th century, is in the opinion of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Duchesne_a960.html" title="Louis Duchesne">Duchesne</a>, worthy of confidence. The first bishop, St. Amator, seems to have preceded by a few years Bishop Optatianus who probably ruled the diocese about 344. Among his successors are: St. Melanius (Melain) (390-400); St. Ursus (Ours) (426); St. Lupus (Loup) (426-478), b. in 383, who accompanied St. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanus_of_Auxerre_46cc.html" title="Germanus of Auxerre">Germanus of Auxerre</a> to England, forced the Huns to spare Troyes, was led away as a hostage by <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attila.html" title="Attila">Attila</a> and only returned to his diocese after many years of exile; St. Camelianus (479-536); St. Vincent (536-46); St. Leuconius (Leucon) (651-56); St. Bobinus (Bobin) (750-66), previously Abbot of Monstier la Celle; St. Prudentius (845-61), who wrote against Gottschalk and Johannes Scotus; Blessed Manasses (985-93); Jacques Bénigne Bossuet (1716-42, nephew of the great <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques-B%C3%A9nigne_Bossuet_8422.html" title="Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet">Bossuet</a>; Etienne-Antoine de Boulogne (1809-25); Pierre-Louis Cæur, the preacher (1849-60).</p>
<p>There have been several <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Troyes_a682.html" title="Council of Troyes">councils held at Troyes</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cath%C3%A9drale_Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul_de_Troyes_49dd.html" title="Cathédrale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Troyes">cathedral of Troyes</a> is a fine Gothic structure begun in the 12th, and completed in the 15th, century; the ancient collegiate Church of St. Urban is a Gothic building whose lightness of treatment reminds one of La <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sainte-Chapelle_3cf5.html" title="Sainte-Chapelle">Sainte-Chapelle</a> at Paris. It was built by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Urban_IV_ed81.html" title="Pope Urban IV">Urban IV</a> at the close of the 13th century. He was a native of Troyes and on one of the stained-glass windows he caused his father to be depicted, working at his trade of tailor.</p>
<p>The Abbey of Nesle la Riposte was founded before 545 near Villenauxe, perhaps by Queen Clotilde. In the 16th century the monks caused to be rebuilt at Villenauxe, with the actual stones which they brought from Nesle, the original doorway of Nesle Abbey, an interesting monument of French history. The Benedictine <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Mabillon_5434.html" title="Jean Mabillon">Mabillon</a> undertook to interpret its carvings, among which might be seen the statue of a <i>reine pédauque</i> (i.e. a web-footed queen) supposed to be St. Clotilde.</p>
<p>The Abbey of Notre Dame aux Nonnains, founded by St. Leucon, was an important abbey for women. <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcuin.html" title="Alcuin">Alcuin</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Bernard_291e.html" title="St. Bernard">St. Bernard</a> corresponded with its abbesses. At his installation the bishop went to the abbey on the previous evening; the bed he slept on became his property, but the mule on which he rode became the property of the abbess. The abbess led the bishop by the hand into the chapter hall; she put on his mitre, offered him his crozier, and in return the bishop promised to respect the rights of the abbey. The Jansenists in the 18th century made a great noise over the pretended cure by the deacon Paris of Marie Madeleine de Mégrigny, a nun of Notre Dame aux Nonnains. The part of the Diocese of Troyes which formerly belonged to the Diocese of Langres contained the famous <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_of_Clairvaux_f214.html" title="Abbey of Clairvaux">Abbey of Clairvaux</a>.</p>
<p>Concerning the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_of_the_Paraclete_6ca1.html" title="Abbey of the Paraclete">Abbey of the Paraclete</a>, founded by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Abelard_a004.html" title="Peter Abelard">Abelard</a> and in which the Abbess <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heloise_%28student_of_Abelard%29_edea.html" title="Heloise (student of Abelard)">Heloise</a> died in 1163, and where her body and that of Abelard were buried until 1792. On 20 June, 1353, Geoffroy de Charny, Lord of Savoisy and Lirey, founded at Lirey in honour of the Annunciation a collegiate church with six canonries, and in this church he exposed for veneration the Holy Winding Sheet. Opposition arose on the part of the Bishop of Troyes, who declared after due inquiry that the relic was nothing but a painting, and opposed its exposition. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_VI_5676.html" title="Pope Clement VI">Clement VI</a> by four Bulls, 6 January, 1390, approved the exposition as lawful. In 1418 during the civil wars, the canons entrusted the Winding Sheet to Humbert, Count de La Roche, Lord of Lirey. Margaret, widow of Humbert, never returned it but gave it in 1452 to the Duke of Savoy. The requests of the canons of Lirey were unavailing, and the Lirey Winding Sheet is the same that is now exposed and honoured at <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turin.html" title="Turin">Turin</a>.</p>

He preached at Troyes before founding the Oratorians. An Oratory was opened at Troyes in 1617. Charles-Louis de Lantage, b. at Troyes in 1616, d. in 1694, was one of the chief helpers of M. Olier, founder of the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulpicians.html" title="Sulpicians">Sulpicians</a>.</p>
<p>The chief pilgrimages of the diocese are: Notre Dame du Chêne, near Bar-sur-Seine, dates from 1667; Notre Dame de la Sainte Espérance, at Mesnil-Saint-Loup; Notre Dame de Valsuzenay.</p>
<p>It was re-established in 1802 as a <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan.html" title="Suffragan">suffragan</a> of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishopric_of_Paris_36e1.html" title="Archbishopric of Paris">Archbishopric of Paris</a>, it then comprised the <i>départements</i> of <a href="../../../a/u/b/Aube.html" title="Aube">Aube</a> and <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonne.html" title="Yonne">Yonne</a>, and its bishop had the titles of Troyes, <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxerre.html" title="Auxerre">Auxerre</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2lons-sur-Marne_d384.html" title="Châlons-sur-Marne">Châlons-sur-Marne</a>. In 1822 the See of Châlons was created and the Bishop of Troyes lost that title. When <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sens.html" title="Sens">Sens</a> was made an archdiocese, the episcopal title of Auxerre went to it and Troyes lost also the <i>département</i> of Yonne, which became the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese_of_Sens_15a6.html" title="Archdiocese of Sens">Archdiocese of Sens</a>. The diocese of Troyes since covers, besides the ancient diocesan limits, 116 parishes of the ancient <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese_of_Langres_989f.html" title="Diocese of Langres">diocese of Langres</a>, and 20 belonging to the ancient diocese of Sens. Since 1822 Troyes is a suffragan of Sens.</p>
<p>Before the application of the Associations Law (1901) there were, in the Diocese of Troyes, Benedictines, Jesuits, Lazarists, Oblates of St. Francis of Sales, and Brothers of the Christian Schools. Many female congregations arose in the diocese, among others the Ursulines of Christian Teaching, founded at Moissy l'Evêque in the eighteenth century by Montmorin, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Langres_27a5.html" title="Bishop of Langres">Bishop of Langres</a>; the Sisters of Christian Instruction, founded in 1819, with mother-house at Troyes; the Oblate Sisters of St. Francis of Sales, a teaching order, founded in 1870, with mother-house at Troyes; Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing community with mother-house at Troyes.</p>
<p>In the diocese the religious congregations at the close of the 19th century had charge of one foundling hospital, 20 nurseries, 2 orphanages for boys, 17 orphanages for girls, 2 houses of mercy, 11 hospitals or hospices, 9 houses of district nursing sister, 1 epileptic home.</p>
<p>In 1905 (at the breach of the Concordat) the diocese numbered 246,163 inhabitants, 40 parish priest, 383 chapels of ease, and 7 curacies supported by the State. In 1910 there were 239,299 inhabitants, and 344 priests.</p>
<p>It presently belongs to the ecclesiastical province of Reims.</p>
