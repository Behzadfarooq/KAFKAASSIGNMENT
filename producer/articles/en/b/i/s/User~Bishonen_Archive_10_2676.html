<p>I want to thanks for all your support. I know you have been very hurt by the disgusting treatment you have received in this horrible debacle. As you, together with Geogre, are amongst the encyclopedia's finest and most valuable editors you deserved better. However, I'm planning to say little more on the subject unless I'm attacked again. I have proved my point about the IRC admin channel, and many people (whose opinion matters to me) now seem to believe all I have ben saying was true. The channel is now thoroughly discredited and will never be a source of power again, and used by anyone of Wikipedian value - it is now basically finished - no one will ever believe a word that emanates from it again, no doubt a few little firecrackers will continue to pop on admins notice boards and such places but I think people can now evaluate such comments for themselves and see them for what they are dying embers of a former power base. Once again thanks for your support in this. I have appreciated it. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 10:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Congratulations on the front page article - seems it's been listed for ages though. It's really nice to see an overview article of such quality there. It seems sometimes, that only the more marginal, niche articles can jump the hurdles, whilst the invaluable overviews get bogged down in disputes and difficulties - getting a single editorial 'voice' for these articles is a real achievement. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 00:47, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will be reading it this morning as well as I don't think I've read it completely through. It will also give context to <i>The Man of Mode</i>, next on my reading list after finishing <i>Tis Pity She's a Whore</i>. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead"><i>*Exeunt*</i> Ganymead</a> | <a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanymead_5bcf.html" title="User talk:Ganymead">Dialogue?</a> 14:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You haven't read <i>The Man of Mode</i>, Gan? I think you'll <i>really</i> like it. I feel it's like the perfect play for you.

<dd>Unbelievable: Templates are for use with null accounts and incommunicative users. Experienced administrators use them for IP accounts and nonce accounts, where there is every reason to believe that there is "no one" there or that the person there is absolutely committed to trolling. They are never appropriate for established users, <b>ever.</b> They are incommunicative, carry with them no explanation, and have no justification offered within them. They're billboards, not communication. It is disruptive and inappropriate to try to drive users away, even bad ones, as bad turns to good, but gone never turns that way.

<p>Yeah, trivial, but it's the principle of the thing.</p>
<p><i>Reader's Digest</i> version: last year, someone created an article about a minor playhouse in NYC called the Grove Street Playhouse. That someone -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissMajesty_31f1.html" title="User:MissMajesty">MissMajesty</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMissMajesty_d1a4.html" title="User talk:MissMajesty">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MissMajesty_fea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/MissMajesty">contribs</a>) -- seemed to be Marilyn Majeski, its owner, since the article seemd solely done to promote the importance of Majeski -- especially after <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Grove_Street_Playhouse_36b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Grove Street Playhouse">the playhouse</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Marilyn_Majeski_5369.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Marilyn Majeski">the bio</a> both went up for AFD. Angry messages, talk page spamming, an ongoing fight with <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENYTheaterHistorian_5ef1.html" title="User:NYTheaterHistorian">User:NYTheaterHistorian</a> (whom she apparently knows IRL), massive sockpuppetry, etc. Eventually, the drama ends, and MM goes away.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I noticed that a brand-new user had edited one of my Talk Page archives (it being on my watchlist), removing the reference to "Grove Street Playhouse" from a message. So I followed backwards from there, and discovered that for the last several months before, a series of one-off accounts had been expunging the record from various pages about what had happened. Nothing as crude as blanking entire pages, but still. The one-offs and older sockpuppets include:</p>

<p>Do we refer to <i>a</i> hypothesis or <i>an</i> hypothesis - I think it might be <i>an</i>. We usually put an <i>an</i> in front of words beginning with vowels eg. <i>an irritation</i> but I've got it in my head that <i>h</i> sometimes has a peculiar status eg. <i>an honourable peace</i>. Is this just 1. a product of my confusion or 2. archaic usage or 3. quite correct?......--<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">Mcginnly</a> | <a href="../../../m/c/g/User_talk%7EMcginnly_e9ad.html" title="User talk:Mcginnly">Natter</a> 16:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You didn't think of asking me? I'm tempted not to answer, but the pedantic urge is too strong. /H/ is not a consonant. It is an aspirant. (I.e. it is a breath mark. It tells us to blow out with a hhhhhhhhhh.) Therefore, traditionally, we treat words beginning with /h/ as beginning with whatever letter comes next, which is usually a vowel. <i>However,</i> many people now think it sounds weird and therefore will use "a." Basically, I say "an hypothesis" and "an history," but some people will think these are wrong. It's considered a little fussy to use the 'an', but it's still correct.

<dd>Well, we're right back in the old descriptive vs. proscriptive argument. The <i>rule</i> is that /h/ is not a consonant. The <i>practice</i> and therefore growing <i>usage</i> is to treat it as "not a vowel and therefore as a consonant." Ultimately, the reason the rule came into force in the first place as a disambiguation, as it were. English doesn't like blending vowels between words, and so we use the nasal to provide a stop. Thus, we had "thy glory" vs. "thine arm," as well as "my bird" vs. "mine emu." The rule is exactly the same, and you're still actually <i>correct</i> to put the /n/, but the language is losing those rules (by analogy to the loss of nasal pronouns? as part of the same shift?), so it's debatable whether "a history" is wrong or not. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If we wanted to be linguists, we'd figger out what it is about some vowel lengths that, when aspirated, need no stops. I.e. "hy" is longer and heavier than "how" or "hoi," and therefore "hypothesis" and "hyperbole" and "hyperborean" all <i>feel</i> like they need no nasal stop before them, where as "howl" feels like it does. If the u is really yu ("hubris"), we <i>feel</i> like it's heavy, too. However, I traded in my linguist badge for a crossing guard sash years ago, so I'm not qualified by temperament or training. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:35, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not that I'm at all qualified to judge this, but the obvious rule seems to be that "a" goes with "h" that is pronounced ("hhhh"), and "an" goes with "h" that is silent.

<ul>
<li>To tell the truth, each of those. The thing is that we're at the point of discarding an ancient rule in English. Some people, like me, preserve it in written English (but not in spoken English) because I regard it as best to be conservative in writing. (In other words, some hypercorrectives will be offended if "an" isn't used, so I avoid being "wrong" to them. Additionally, I cannot be sure how the reader is going to pronounce the /h/. As Mcginnly's cockneys demonstrate, English speakers around the world treat the aspiration differently, so some will have more or less of a vocal initial sound, so "an" does them some service, while it just looks fussbudget to the people who aspirate heavily.) Since we've lost our /n/ speedbump between our pronouns, keeping it with /h/ may be gone already. Note that a good many people in speech will say "a" and <i>anything</i> following. The nasal is getting lost altogether. In 50-100 years, it seems like there will be no "an" at all. So, does one make a stand and fight for the /n/, or does one not? I do, but humbly. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is a strong distinction between British usage and North American usage (I have no idea about Commonwealth usage apart from Canada). In North America it is extremely rare to see "an" before a voiced "h". This has been the case for many years: I remember the issue coming up on an episode of <i>M*A*S*H</i> when upper class Bostonian, Charles Winchester, was revealed as an absurdly pretentious oaf for saying "<i>an</i> harmonica"...; that was in the mid-1970s. A further wrinkle is that of words like "homage" that may be pronounced with either a voiced or an unvoiced "h"; I've seen examples in Canadian and US texts of both "an homage" (which I would srite and say) and "a homage". <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 14:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Reading some further of your posts... I'm not just disappointed, I'm <i>amazed</i> that you keep it up about Giano "engaging in behavior as bad or worse than those you are pointing the finger at", while at the same time acknowledging that you don't know what the behavior of "those" was--<i>and</i> at the same time dismissing any need for my attempt to give you a sense of it. None of it of interest, then? Not my suggestion that people who actually consult the records come away muttering "I had no idea"? No concern with Kim Bruning's post above? Just Giano's "incivil" (pah!), so it's six of one and half a dozen of the other? Well, I'm past pretending to be sorry to have wasted your time; I don't think I took up a lot of it; I'm sorry to have wasted my own. I regret having expected to be read with interest. Forget it. I'm a slow writer, and I don't have any more time to spend in your "I know what they did/I don't know what they did" hamster wheel.

<dd>And <i>accountable</i> behavior in a transparent medium on Wikipedia (where it can be quoted ad nauseum) vs. <i>unaccountable</i> behavior in a "you post it and I'll ban you" medium like IRC cannot be "equivalent" from the start. And three vs. one and one vs. three isn't equivalent, either. And editor vs. admins and admins vs. editor isn't equivalent. And "tell us to stop on this IRC channel you are supposed to be entitled to, and we'll threaten you" isn't the same as "Oh, go away <i>from my talk page</i>, you pissant," either. No, I don't think any disinterested and rational person could see them as equivalent. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I unblocked <a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcginnly_76e7.html" title="User:Mcginnly">user:Mcginnly</a> after David Gerrard blocked him.

Given that there are <i>some</i> minority points of view who feel that their nationalities and religious identities are invested in denying that the Taj was created for anything other than Hindu purposes, the matter is hot.

<p>That's a relief, although I still don't know how to unblock properly, it seems.

<dd>You did it properly, Geogre, but the redoubtable Autoblocker bit Mcginnly. To undo any autoblocks along with your standard unblocking, go <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~pgk/autoblock.php" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~pgk/autoblock.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>—very useful URL to keep handy somewhere—and fill in the data you have. One or two facts are enough, for instance the name of the blocker and the original blockee. Click on Submit query, and see a list. The original block should be on it. Click on that block's "Autoblock ID" link, and a self-explanatory page for unblocking will appear.</dd>
<dd>Mynde you, even if you <b>do all that</b> from the start, the Autoblocker may bite again later—not going into the "why", which is fuzzy to me anyway—and need to be released again. And guess what, every technical problem is ten times worse if you use AOL. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC).

<p>I've had my eyes on something for a while, that I don't know really what to do with. It <i>was</i> a very obvious case of vanity writing. Two articles got deleted. Now one of the articles is recreated, and it looks much better. Whether or not the subject is notable enough for an article, I really can't say.</p>
<p>On svwiki, I would take it to SFFR (AfD). However, the AfD's that got the two articles in question deleted had like four people saying anything on the subject; I have difficulties in believing this is a good way of dealing with it. I am not sure if one should take actions to get the stuff deleted or not. In a way, there are things more important to take care of. OTOH, my knee jerk reaction from the clear vanity start is to remove the group of articles ASAP. I wrote some kind of recollection of it all on <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_green_burial_stuff_a541.html" title="User:Habj/green burial stuff">User:Habj/green burial stuff</a>; you can take a look if you like (but I don't expect you to). // <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabj_f852.html" title="User:Habj">habj</a> 12:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I weighed in, there. Basically, my view is that we treat individual company presidents if they make a splash as individuals. We treat individual practitioners of an industry when they are far ahead, first, or biggest. Otherwise, we cover the industry, not some dude at some company doing it. Well written or poorly written articles are irrelevant, if the subject is inappropriate, because Wikipedia articles are page rank boosts, and therefore articles are money. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:40, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bishonen. First of all, I'd like to offer my sympathies that Bishzilla didn't pass rfa; she would've gotten my support. Second, in response to your <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Chapter_and_verse_pertaining_to_IRC_logs_and_Giano_round_19.2C_by_Bishonen" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">comment</a> on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">requests for arbitration</a>, I think it was <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Land_1a6c.html" title="User:The Land">The Land</a> who unblocked Giano.

<dd>Oh, right! I still think there were more admins there, though, jockeying with The Land for first place. And El C (one of Carnildo's original three blockees) later did of those clever one-second "that block reason wasn't true" blocks of Giano.

<p>Hi Bishonen,</p>
<p>A few days you visited <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendental_Meditation_4184.html" title="Transcendental Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> to disabuse me of the notion that 3RR did not apply to multiple serial bad edits that could not be considered to be "vandalism."</p>
<p>A new editor, <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a>, has shown up recently on the "cult" pages and has been making multiple serial edits in violation of guidelines on four or five articles. Here is a recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_apologist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104711343" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cult_apologist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104711343" rel="nofollow">example</a>. He is starting to do this faster then we can revert it without 3RR'ing.</p>
<p>What recourse do we have? DR seems to be too slow, the articles could be in tatters by then. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 02:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've left a note for the user to stop making far-reaching changes against consensus, and will keep an eye on what happens. It's really late at night where I am, so I haven't done much research yet. Please don't keep reverting, especially not to the point where you bump up against the 3RR. I don't think there's any real hurry—I know one <i>feels</i> that articles are being destroyed when something like this happens, but it's all still there in the history. The main thing is to make the user aware of policy in the matter of consensus, talkpage discussions, and unilateral changes, and persuade them to abide by it. I can see that the other editors have been arguing with BabyDweezil on Talk, which is exactly the right thing to do. The next step is also exactly what you did: contact an admin. We'll have to see if further steps turn out to be needed; I hope not. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>A distorted account by <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a>--that was the <i>only</i> large deletion i made, (not "a recent example"), i've explained all my edits, and have been thanked more than once for removing some flagrant un-Wiki material inserted over time by the very POV pushing bloc of editors who are now complaining. The claim that Ive made "multiple serial edits in violation of guidelines on four or five articles" is Tanaats opinion at best and an exaggerated fabrication at worst (and its such displays of drama substituting for simple facts which i have had to deal with of late in editing these articles). Please feel free to review my edits and the discussions. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 03:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh dear, Oh dear, Oh dear, I just popped over to see if you knew about poor Albion above (I seem to remember writing it for you one wet afternoon to fill in some red links on one of your pages) it now appears that even with Wetman's valued help we cannot write a proper page between us, and now poor old "Rest Lit". I'm trying my hardest to be good, kind and nice at the moment so I don't want to be the first to comment, perhaps if nodody comments it will all go away - I'm not very good with the ostrich technique either though - and all this smiling like <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaws_%28film%29.html" title="Jaws (film)">jaws</a> is starting to hurt my facial muscles.

<dd>I think the nomination is in bad faith. If we look, we will see the same fun faces making the same fun comments as ever. Explaining to such persons <i>again</i> why, <i>again,</i> their requirements are not the FA requirements is virtually useless, and the wider audience seems to have been driven away. What's worse is that there <i>are</i> "inline citations" in the article, but they're parenthetical reference, and I explained on the talk page to the article why there aren't more of them. To cite every citation that is internal to one of the blue linked articles would make for 100kb of references. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bad faith? Hardly; I haven't been involved in any of your previous discussions on this topic.

<dd>To be serious about one thing: footnotes are a <i>form</i> of inline citation, not synonymous with inline citation. No one on FAR says "insufficient footnotes". All systems tend toward a norm, of course, and the little numbers are it with Wiki. But the Harvard style is arguably better with some of the Lit pieces that rely only on paper sources and is still perfectly acceptable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ok, perhaps it's a good faith nomination. Still, it seems like I, at least, am being called upon to deal death and destruction upon those I have already been on record as opposing. Basically, that article used its internal links for the most part. Let's put it this way (long version, be warned), I set out to write <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dunciad_5549.html" title="The Dunciad">The Dunciad</a>. I figured that I wanted an article on every one of the dunces. I used the <i>DNB</i> for the biographies. The <i>DNB</i> used the same sources that I've used in the past. Then there were all the works of literature, which I just <i>read.</i> So, then we get some really out of the way stuff, like <i>Gondibert,</i> which fairly no one in their right mind reads. I read about .25 of it, but the very beginning is a "preface" by Hobbes talking about how much he admires it. I was at one time reading up everything I could by D'Avenant, and one of his scrofulous sons. (I was doing that because I was researching Ombre, which I was doing for <i>Rape of the Lock,</i> and Charles Cotton wrote <i>The Compleat Gamester,</i> which I read and tried to decipher.) Anyway, so there is all of that. So, the article itself says, "D'Avenant tried the epic with <i>Gondibert,</i> which Hobbes praised." To what would I footnote? I already have a link to D'Avenant. I had woven in...somewhere... the "prefaces" and the debate over form. I think it was in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restoration_poetry.html" title="Restoration poetry">Restoration poetry</a>. At <i>this date,</i> I have to try to puzzle out and <i>manufacture</i> notes that would be both false and useless to satisfy people who admit that they don't know the subject? I suppose anyone could see why I'm not very eager. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:57, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh, and here's a first, or at least a first in a while: I gave a civility warning to LuciferMorgan for the rather unpleasantly personal comments at FAR.

<li>Mine was made <i>before</i> he made new ones. He should be blocked, since he went on after a warning to <i>two</i> attacks. One was aimed at you -- suggesting that you're Giano's puppet/and/or a bad administrator. Had I been able to sign in today, I'd have blocked him for that one. I was specific in referring to a specific edit of his, but it's clear that he's popping his cork entirely. My problem is, as you know, that I don't believe in blocking anyone for "personal attacks," but, given the way that the FAR is sidetracked, if not derailed into "What's bugging him," that's pretty disruptive. Everyone else has tried to address other matters, but he's going out of his way to disrupt the function of the page, so that's where I <i>will</i> block someone, only slowly. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm sorry for what I said, and got the wrong end of the stick. I still don't see why you keep sticking up for Giano, as I've found him to be incredibly obnoxious to be honest, although I jumped the gun before he got the first punch in. This stems from the Palladian FAR, which I still don't feel should've been closed (but that's another story).</p>
<p>Anyway, as concerns your conduct as an admin which I got the wrong stick about... after the Palladian FAR, a few Wikipedians I don't speak to emailed me and said I'm best off steering clear of Giano and friends of his, and yourself was named. I'm not going to say what people emailed me, as they aired their views privately and I don't wish to lay the blame elsewhere as concerns what I said. Anyway, I browsed Giano's edit history, and there was some spat with a user called David something (Gerard possibly?) and another incident with Ideogram where you reported Ideogram's before - and well, thought, it must be correct then. And when I saw somewhere you'd unblocked Giano, I thought it must be true. I also figured that should someone annoy Giano, you'd get involved, and then they'd end up getting blocked. To be honest, I know admins can block people, but not much else. People are talking about IRC (Marskell tried explaining what it is a little, but I still haven't a clue what it is), de-sysopping (I don't know what this is, but I'm assuming it's where one would be stripped of their powers), RFA (??) and other things - I'm just a person who edits the odd article and hangs around at FAR, so I don't understand this language much. At the time, when I said what I said what I did I felt it to be true in my heart - I'd never knowingly say something false about a person, as I'm not that kind of person. I've since had time to consider what I said, and make more thorough inquiries into what I said. I feel really bad about the whole mess, and am extremely sorry for any offense or upset I may have caused you. If anyone questions your admin integrity in future based on this incident, I encourage you to email me and I'll back you up.</p>
<p>I'm extremely sorry the offer to accept an apology has expired, but I found the deluge of messages from various people (excluding yourself) on my page rather disturbing and frankly a little upsetting to be honest. It hurt, so my defense mechanism kicked in, and I'm sorry about that. I feel this is an issue between myself and you, and not all the other people who've left numerous messages on my page. While the situation is grave and rather serious, I don't feel they're helping the situation either. I'll admit that I'll never win a popularity contest on Wikipedia, but I thought other Wikipedians thought I was at least ok. It seems I'm not much liked though apparently, which I'm to mostly blame for really.</p>
<p>This isn't an attempt to lay the blame anywhere else, as I found your reply rather gracious under the circumstances. It took me by surprise really, as I'd found the incident a volatile situation from other quarters. It was commendable of you to keep level headed, and made me think twice of my previous judgment.</p>
<p>I wish for my apology to be seen as a sincere one, and not something that has been pressured out of me by the community. I'm not an insincere person believe it or not, and never have been. I don't wish to start now, but this apology is genuine. It comes from the bottom of my heart, and I hope you can accept it in that way. Anyway, I hope you take care, and really hope that you'll eventually find me to be a nice enough person, and not the one you may find me to be at present.

<dd>I appreciate your apology, Lucifer, though not your lack of value for the work Giano does for Wikipedia.

<li>....and so yet another Wikipedia editor bites the dust, having been drip fed poison. I visit FARC very seldom only when an article in which I have taken a long standing interest is deposited there. My sole encounters with Lucifer before the current review were on Palladian architecture's review (I wrote it - I have a right to be interested in it) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/archive/December_2006#Palladian_architecture" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/archive/December_2006#Palladian_architecture" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> where Lucifer became more and more agitated and hostile in his comments. we now know why: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=106943012&amp;oldid=106922018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABishonen&amp;diff=106943012&amp;oldid=106922018" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> "<i>a few Wikipedians I don't speak to emailed me and said I'm best off steering clear of Giano and friends</i>" obviously was the cause of such comments out of the blue as this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103515013" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103515013" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> . The sad thing for whoever these mysterious people are who primed Lucifer is that he eventually went firing off at Bishonen who was the wrong target. Perhaps people like Sandy Georgia who make reproving comments like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALuciferMorgan&amp;diff=106973190&amp;oldid=106960695" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALuciferMorgan&amp;diff=106973190&amp;oldid=106960695" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> should confine themselves to addressing the root of the problem, which is those drop feeding the poison, rather than those seeking to establish, however belatedly, the truth. I hope eventually Lucifer feels able to return to the project, and when he does he is made welcome - I do though wonder how many other innocent editors minding their own business have their inboxes filled by strangers emailing unsolicited lies and venom about their own particular enemy of the day. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 06:51, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You've been <i>blocked</i> by an <i>IP</i>...? That would be funny, if it wasn't distressing to you. IP's can't block anybody. User:204.11.35.132 put a {{sockpuppeteer}} template on your userpage, that's all. (It's been reverted now.) The part I don't understand is the 3RR thing you mention in your mail—has the anon messaged you? I hope things have cleared up by now.

<p>Hate to butt in here, but don't you think it might be helpful to place a warning on the IP editor's talk page, since this was evidently a malicious action? - <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWeniWidiWiki_b655.html" title="User:WeniWidiWiki">WeniWidiWiki</a> 19:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I sort of don't feel like it—don't want to give the bastard a chuckle. I'm too sure that was a drive-by edit from a logged-out established user on a dynamic IP.

<p>Hi. I notice that you've helped out <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">User:Tanaats</a> in the past. Would you be so kind as to leave this person a note explaining that I'm not a crazy person? I've bothered them while following up an OTRS complaint at <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cultic_Studies_Association_3b5c.html" title="International Cultic Studies Association">International Cultic Studies Association</a>. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 20:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jkelly, not only did you <i>never</i> identify yourself as an admin (although I knew it <i>after</i> you protected the page) but you <i>never</i> explained about the complaint. You only said that "someone complained", and that still before identifying yourself as an admin. It is not very compelling if just-another-editor says that "someone complained" as a reason for deleting well-sourced material.</dd>
<dd>Then you dropped that argument entirely, meaning to me that it wasn't a strong argument to begin with. You completely switched to the argument that for some reason we should not use the <a href="../../../i/c/s/ICSA_7557.html" title="ICSA">ICSA</a>'s <i>own</i> website as a reliable source for a list of who their staff was. The whole thing was incomprehensible to me.</dd>
<dd>Admittedly I have a short fuse about the unilateral deletion of well-sourced after the predations of an editor on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_apologist.html" title="Cult apologist">Cult apologist</a>. But I really do need a head slap and an explanation about how your conduct was completely proper. Then, as I said before, I will apologize profusely and walk away chastened. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanaats_8ea7.html" title="User:Tanaats">Tanaats</a> 23:06, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hehe, nostalgia, Dante. For a while, I was in sole possession of CheeseDreams' password, how about that? I never dared use it, though, and it was burning a hole in my pocket, so I quickly passed it on to JRM, who changed it. He's in sole possession now—well, he's probably munged it, I expect.

<dd>Again, I don't understand why people are citing discussion that occurred <i>after</i> the fact as though it already had occurred. <b>At that time</b>, there was overwhelming consensus that these messages were harmful. So yes, I viewed the deliberate restoration of such a banner as something tantamount to simple and obvious vandalism. I'm sure that the user felt that his/her joke was funny and didn't seek to upset people, but someone adding nonsense to an article might feel the same way. The user was well aware of the fact that the banner's insertion was regarded as disruptive and barred via a guideline, and he/she chose to ignore these facts (as well as my warning, which he/she removed from his/her talk page).</dd>

<dd>Well, if you look at the words of the 3RR policy, I don't see that they leave much room for deciding that something—a joke banner—quite different from the examples they give of simple and obvious vandalism is "something <i>tantamount to</i> simple and obvious vandalism". On the same principle, even if you feel you have such strong consensus for a recently introduced "rule" that it's safe to dismiss all pleas and arguments on the other side, it wouldn't have hurt you any to try to understand where they were coming from—to listen rather than dismiss out of hand, to engage rather than assume that anybody with different opinions had to be out to harm the encyclopedia. If you'd taken opposing arguments into account, I don't think it would have been that hard to figure out what kind of reaction an actual block was likely to get on ANI. I'm saying this because from the way you responded to me, I didn't get any kind of feeling of being heard or listened to.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:59, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>1. I don't believe that the mere use of the joke banner constituted anything tantamount to simple vandalism. I believe that the repeated deliberate guideline violations (mostly via edits with no summaries, some of which were labeled "minor") and removal of a warning message did.</dd>
<dd>2. Again, I didn't "dismiss all pleas and arguments on the other side." Almost all of them arose <i>after</i> the fact. I <i>have</i> listened to them and repeatedly apologized for acting in a manner met with controversy (which obviously wasn't my intent). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:20, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The user has failed to show me any diff that s/he has been warned about unsing obscenities in the future, so I feel my warning was current and correct. The next time that user uses obscenities we now have a ground for blocking (hopefully that will teach that person to behave in a civil manner instead). I don't care that much if s/he removes the warnings, it only reflects bad upon that person ability to deal with criticism. What I object to is blanking <i>current</i> debates, which makes it more difficult to continue meaningful discussion. However I consider the discussion closed (the user was warned, and failed to present any coherent argument in his/her defence).--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 17:29, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As an admin, you are quite capable of doing the research as to being warned previously. All you seem to be doing is going on some kind of march to attempt to get me blocked. It won't work. You should be, instead, concentrating on the current RfC that you are the topic of for your various behaviours in the past (and present). Like the pot calling the kettle black. It wasn't a debate, mind you - it wasn't a blanking. It was acknowledgement without response, period. Next time use discretion before you go off on some tirade. Serious. Be very careful on your actions. Thank you. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 18:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bishonen - I don't mean to bother you. I really appreciate your assistance. The problem I have with <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">User:Pmanderson</a> is that he cannot remain respectful whenever he dislikes someone. If you look at this diff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28standard_letters_with_diacritics%29&amp;diff=108274079&amp;oldid=108143129" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28standard_letters_with_diacritics%29&amp;diff=108274079&amp;oldid=108143129" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, you'll see that he insinuates that I want to "lie to the reader". There was nowhere at all in my comments on this discussion a proposal to lie. In fact, my whole point was that we need to use the diatrics when using names (and redirect from non-diatric names) - a process that the workplace I am involved with does on a daily basis due to an international scope of work. I was also stating that a direct English translation of the name "Stanisław" is "Stanley" (like "Mark" from "Marek"). Yet user Pmanderson seems to be able to twist my words and attempt to slander me. This is what I wish to have stopped. I do not do the same with him, I expect the same respect in return. That is all. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:41, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be nice if at least one admin would judge my edits on their merits, instead of incessant speculations that I'm seeking some sort of thrill or persecuting anyone. I challenge you or any admin to conclude that less than 95% of my edits are well grounded. I explain the reasons, yet I am faced with obstinate, POV-minded editors who act as a bloc to filibuster and delay even the simplest, most obvious improvements to the articles. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 23:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You don't seem to understand my role in this context. I purposely don't get into your <i>content</i> disputes.

If you don't wish to, why not ask another admin to evaluate content?

<dd>Hi.The thing to do in my opinion is propose a community ban on WP:ANI. (Compare my recent post there.) Link prominently to the previous thread and the reactions that people registered there. Give the new post a heading that clearly states what it's about, and that makes it easy to notice for people who have an interest in the user—say "Community ban proposed against <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatchouli_1f56.html" title="User:Patchouli">Patchouli</a>" or something like that. See, LittleDan already said he thought a ban was appropriate, and I actually proposed a community ban, but the heading didn't say anything about a ban, so probably few people noticed it. You need to make your post easy to read and the points you make easy to grasp. Your evidence is good, but frankly, you have too much of it! (It'll be very useful if this is taken to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">arbitration</a>, as seems pretty likely.) Only use the best of your links, and <i>explain</i> what you think they prove. Mention that LittleDan and others already suggested a ban. Me, I was just talking—I don't have any experience of the user—but LittleDan is important, so you might want to ask him to post his views directly after your proposal. Preferably a little more fully than he did before.</dd>
<dd>Advice for getting people interested in the issue:
<ul>
<li>Be fair, mention if the user has some good points, or if there are any excuses for the way he behaves. Make it clear what you're proposing, but ask the readers for input and their views, rather than say "You have to ban him."</li>
<li>Be brief. Agha Nader's original post in the previous thread is a good length, and is a good pattern for you altogether (except the header, which is unhelpful), with striking examples. Yours can be shorter, since you have a recent discussion to refer to.</li>
<li>Don't talk about the various policies he's breaking. Administrators know what these policies are, and listing them only sounds formalistic. Instead go directly to what he's specifically done, and the amount of problems he causes.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Who should propose it? Absolutely not me, I'm ignorant. Not somebody who has edit warred a lot with Patchouli, or is any kind of extremist on the opposite side from him. Somebody knowledgeable. It sounds (from your evidence collection) like you would be a good person. So would Agha Nader, or LittleDan. It's not really important, the information and the way it's presented matters more than who it is. Finally, if there's not consensus for a community ban, I advise you to first have somebody previously uninvolved make a good-faith effort to reach out to the user, and then (assuming that fails, as seems only too likely) go directly to requesting arbitration. From the links already posted, I don't see the sense in wearing out everybody with formal mediation and/or an RFC which would only turn into a flameout anyway. Requesting arbitration isn't hard.

Because I don't "OWN" articles, I've been very laid back about things. It seems that someone wrote a paper on the play and had to insert its conclusions. I can <i>so</i> sense someone having a class read it with New Criticism and a sheaf of feminist perspectives. Anyway, if you look at the diff between my last and the previous version, you can see the stuff I cut. If there are legitimate points that I'm chopping off that can be made more appropriately, please feel free to put them in in a better way.</p>
<p>For my part, I'm not going to allow the idea that this is a misogynistic play to stand. My own view is that all the principals are in an ethical bind.

<dd>OK, I'm still not sure. You'd have to make sure it's a limited number of people—absolutely not more than, say, 5—7 people—and an extremely neutral message. Avoid any hint of what you'd want or expect them to say, just ask them in a very neutral way for input. The only point I feel doubt about is that it's supposed to be important to write to <i>both</i> people who agree with you and people who agree with your adversary. So, if Patchouli <i>has</i> any supporters, or people neutral on the issues, it's extremely important that you include those people. But if he doesn't, I'm honestly not sure what would be deemed acceptable. In my own opinion, though, it would hardly be reasonable to prevent you from messaging people for input in such a case. Go for it. I <i>think</i> it's ok, so feel free to blame me if anybody complains. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 04:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

When you click on the wiki-link for "bishonen" on your user page, it goes to redirect and I was wondering if you would not like that changed. No big deal.

I especially liked your subsequent call on ANI for <i>editors</i> and admins to make a better effort to see that all are treated fairly. You must have had fun writing that. BTW, sorry you feel muzzled by me pointing out that you had written half the thread, posted eight times, and were boring readers silly. Those are just facts, you know. Not like saying I'm "railroading", for example. I wonder what my interest in getting BD blocked is supposed to be. When I say I wonder, I mean I'm wondering inside my head.

<dd>OK, no rhetoric. You have your perceptions and your opinions and your motives and I have mine. At most times, I imagine, they probably and happily coincide (not to imply that you or I particularly care about that). Obviously, they do not here. I really was curious about the diacritic. Don't worry about the censorship on AN/I.

<p>And I'm very pleased to meet you! - Sorry to beg some of your time, but I've come to you to ask for some advice. I have what i consider serious concerns about essjay's conduct, and am upset with the way my concerns are being handled.</p>
<p>Brief rundown is that essjay lied on his userpage for ages about his qualifications - claiming to be a tenured professor, and hold the following degrees;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies (B.A.)</li>
<li>Master of Arts in Religion (M.A.R.)</li>
<li>Doctorate of Philosophy in Theology (Ph.D.)</li>
<li>Doctorate in Canon Law (JCD)</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that some see this as no big deal (but it is a big deal to me). What i thought was far more serious was that he repeated these lies to the New Yorker, and allowed a story to be published <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/060731fa_fact" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/060731fa_fact" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> which I feel directly bolsters wiki's reputation based on his fictional qualifications. I'm really concerned that without recognising this behaviour as a mistake at some point this could do serious damage to wikipedia's reputation, essjay being such a high powered user - this level of dishonesty is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>He has justified what he refers to as disinformation here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Essjay/Archives/52#Profiles_don.27t_mesh..." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Essjay/Archives/52#Profiles_don.27t_mesh..." rel="nofollow">[35]</a> - and basically repeated this justification when I raised it on his talk page here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Essjay/Archives/53#Ethics_etc." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Essjay/Archives/53#Ethics_etc." rel="nofollow">[36]</a> - leaving aside the fact that I think essjay is needlessly mentioning stalking, police matters and harrasment (how could wiki suddenly be so safe now?), I don't feel that he's responded at all appropriately to the issues. He's made it clear now he doesn't want to talk about it... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEssjay&amp;diff=110485451&amp;oldid=110485384" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEssjay&amp;diff=110485451&amp;oldid=110485384" rel="nofollow">[37]</a></p>
<p>I don't like the idea of someone who thinks this is not important having so much power. As you can see, I've become quite involved in this issue - perhaps I see it as so serious because I'm up so close - if it's no big deal, then I should let it lie, but I feel sure there's a seed of something quite important. I've sent you an email too..... <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurples_ea12.html" title="User:Purples">Purples</a> 02:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I can use a bit of advice here, please. Do you think that <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html#Tilman_Hausherr_.28history.7CWatchlist_this_WP:BLP_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">this</a> bit by <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a> constitutes disruption or abuse of a noticeboard worth bringing up on AN/I. I really do not want to be "dainty" here (more on that in a sec). I have a pretty thick skin and am very used to being attacked on the Scientology Series talk pages. I really don't mind it much as it gives me the rare opportunity to crack extremely wise and that is not something I do in real life or in other areas here. Lately, though, this crap has been spilling over onto admin noticeboards. There was my dainty 5RR with Smee and Tanaats try there (which he, to his credit, had the good sense to remove after I asked him to), then Orsini and Anteaus on your AN/I on BD, and now this one. Those are the recent ones. Basically, it is taking a noticeboard case and turning it into "get Justanother" on the hope that some admin will buy into their "stuff". This type of activity is off-topic anywhere (if they have a case let them just bring it) but seems especially egregious on the noticeboards. I mean, does Antaeus really think an editor/admin is going to want to jump into that to figure out and answer whatever on-point question is in there? I already figured out (finally) what his argument was and responded to it. I really wish these guys would stop it already and that is my only desired outcome. As regards "dainty". Yes, sure. But I think BD was already well "under control" and Smee was running over my valid edits at the same time in his edit-warring. Smee has said that he will make the necessary adjustments to his editing style and I have made efforts to patch things up between he and I. Thanks for your input on this Antaeus thing, I respect it. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 16:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OMG. I've read through the BLP noticeboard thread once and am none the wiser. Frankly I'm stupider. Antaeus Feldspar's posts are rather long and complicated; yours are <i>dreadfully</i> long and complicated. You'll have to apply your own unaided judgement as to whether to take it to ANI, because I can't even tell what's going on. But if you do, consider this: I react with incomprehension and frustration. So does William Thweatt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&amp;diff=110846750&amp;oldid=110831102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&amp;diff=110846750&amp;oldid=110831102" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. That's two out of two. There are currently no other comments. What kind of response do you think you'll get if you write like that on ANI, where the competition for admins' attention is so fierce? People are put off by long paragraphs, so please be brief; people don't know the background, so please explain it. These two suggestions are admittedly in dynamic tension with each other. But still. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Yes, thanks for the advice. And I do apologize for sticking your nose in that. Though I do object (in good-natured manner) to your claiming that I was more long-winded than Antaeus. I broke out the calculator and, prior to Mr. Thweatt, Antaeus was at 56.3% and me at a "mere" 43.7%, but there were just the two of us (smile). And I certainly hope I was more entertaining (but maybe not). My problem is that I have been attacked since I got here in August 2006, just because I am a Scientologist and, while it has been an educational experience and "trial by fire", I am pretty much done now with being attacked, especially as it is seeping over to the notice boards and I imagine that I will be using them to actually get some help from experienced editors like Mr. Thweatt (and yourself) and I am tired of the character assassination employed against me (such as Orsini's that I am a troll and an <a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html#A_Short_Guide_to_Office_of_Special_Affairs_Tactics_on_Wikipedia" title="User:Fahrenheit451">OSA stooge</a>).

<dd>You've merged my notes, I see. No big deal, but I thought those sentences deserved separate citing, as the theatre company history is quite esoteric knowledge. The details about the "adventurers" and about the actors' cooperative are only available in Milhous' book as far as I know, and are on a whole different level from the surrounding paragraph about how the 1690s drama was different from the 1670s, which is 100% known and assented to by everybody who's written on the drama in the past 400 years, and doesn't deserve any citing at all. Milhous lays out two separate things, though connected: the early-robber-baron-raw-capitalism that gutted the company (pp. 37—43), and the (unique, startling) reaction of the actors, who fought back by setting up their own cooperative and revitalizing London theatre life (51—68). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:39, 27 February 2007 (UTC).

<dd>I think that this is a project filled with paper dolls. These paper dolls ... people can think either that they represent a person or that they are paper dolls in their own right. It bugs me when anyone tries to embue his or her creature with aspects of a real person. I do not want to have this one say that it has rights and abilities because the person manipulating it has gotten a Ph.D. in web comics, and I do not want to have that one say that it has extra powers because the person manipulating it was a lawyer or judge. Any time that happens, I think the fundamental basis of Wikipedia is being broken. We're either anonymous editors, or we are not, and I loathe the idea of trying to have it both ways. When a person not only tries to make the fiction of the person on Wikipedia refer to the human fictionalizer, but also lets the paper doll step out of the book and <i>equal</i> the person, I'm doubly irritated.</dd>
<dd>It's easy for me to ignore LordViperScropion's claims to being Brad Pitt. However, when he tries to say that Brad Pitt has the qualities of the avatar and the avatar the qualities of the actor, it's a special kind of offense. If Essjay said he were the Pope, I'd say that means nothing, because all the identities here are presumed to be fiction, but if he says he's the Pope and therefore is the leader of all Catholics who edit Wikipedia, he's being a jerk. If he then goes on to a real world interview <i>as</i> the Pope, it's probably at the level of fraud, at least intellectual fraud.</dd>
<dd>There is no way to explain to the folks of <i>The New Yorker</i> how the fictions of Wikipedia appeal to those carrying particularly large social wounds, how the most lofty personalities as personalities are often those whose frustrations at reality are greatest, how the least spectacular personalities are often those who really have accomplishments. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What worries me is that these are not creatures who deceive to survive, but rather that there is a deception (the electronic self) that is particularly attractive to those who have the greatest deficit in their feelings. I don't want to care about the <i>Wound and the Bow,</i> as it were, don't want to care about this, either way, because only the product matters. If a forger makes a Da Vinci, I'm ok with owning it, so long as I don't pass it off as a Da Vinci: it has all the pleasures of the creation and lacks only the originality. What bothers me is that I think we've been handed a <i>Summa Theologica</i> written by Tommy A. Quines and asked to treat it as by Thomas Aquinas. The game is unequal. George has told Martha that Sonny Jim was killed. The illusion is shattered by trying to take it out of the social contract that licensed it (the deceit that is electronic self). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>... i think this is where realism comes in. We should not be surprised when people behave unethically, or when they find it hard to understand why others think they're wrong. Or to put it another way, everybody lies. Just a fact of life. I think your point about having it both ways here is very important though - wikipedia seems to engage needy people hugely, who then go through a cycle of feeling excited, empowered, frustrated then embittered - then wipe the slate clean and start again. The clutter talk of wiki-love and making the world a better place doesn't help.</p>
<p>I'm worried that people with serious, real life issues, both acute and chronic come here, get confused about their relationship to their computer screens, and end up getting hurt. There's a argument going on about clerks over at checkuser at the moment - it seems to me that someone has handed out badges, which become badges of first wiki, then self-esteem generally. Of course it's upsetting when someone suggests that your self-esteem is unneccessary - except it's not your self-esteem, it's only an imaginary badge. People handing out the badges bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>To bring these abstractions back to the nitty-gritty, essjay should simply stand down from his arb com, checkuser and oversight responsibilities, put an apology on the record and get on with everything he enjoys around here. If he finds this terribly hard, he should ask himself why....</p>

<p>P., I reply with a philosophical answer, which you may take as you please.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful street in my neighborhood, a quiet one, nicely proportioned, of just the right width and length, with mature trees, nice-looking houses, children who play on its lawns, and neighbors. Once, when driving slowly along it (so as not to alarm the children) I saw a couple speaking to each other. The woman, whom I believe to be the wife, was standing on a large rock, that she might tower over the man, and she appeared to be gesturing in a power-demanding way to the man. This disturbed me, as I have the illusion that those who live on that street have wonderful lives. Clearly, I have an ideal, about that street and life, which rests in my heart.</p>
<p>Although I have these ideals, the love of Nature and all its power lies in my heart as well, so that I understand that the mystery and beauty inherent in N. sometimes has no room for the demands of Man. Thus there are beings in Nature who deceive simply to survive, and their lives are testament to a Nature who lets them be. They exist and survive.</p>
<p>I was trained to respect <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empiricism.html" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a> because that is at the root of the power of our civilization, but <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realism.html" title="Realism">realism</a> probably enjoys a better-founded set of concepts. So I believe that your principled outrage at a being who has deceived, survived, and who has even found a better <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gig.html" title="Gig">gig</a> in his existence, may be a stage in the process of</p>

<dd>My problem &lt;sigh&gt; is that I can't draw, I have a house non-professional drawing package (see Belton House &amp; Buckingham Palace etc.) but I need a plan to work from, as I immagine do you Joopers, and there is non to be found. It is such a big complicated evolution of a place it needs something like that picture to refer to, and I have left that picture in a book in Sicily, so grapes can't have a go either &lt;double shit&gt;, and only have the edited one on my computer. I might try and draw a plan from the picture - just as a reference guide, the yellow numerals do look clearer though than the red - just <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 10:34, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey. Just wanted to apologize again more personally for that accusation on AN:I. It's been a rough coupla months on-wiki and off, and I guess I've been snapping a little. I don't remember who it was I was thinking of, but it was a prominent administrator, and they said they were 'disgusted' by my conduct, and that they would 'gladly recommend my DeSysoping to the ArbCom personally'. Not the most pleasant thing in the world to hear. I remember our interactions now on the topic of another bothersome user, and I apologize for mistaking you for someone else. Luckily, I've put myself on Administrative 'light duty' for the next term or two to get a nice, cleansing break from all of the warring. No harm done? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 06:00, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, not at all, InShaneee. Of course not. I remember two separate bothersome users we've had dealings with together... one too smart for his own good and the other, er, just the opposite—I don't know if those descriptions are enough for you to recall the people! What's light duty--no blocking? I took myself off admin duty altogether once, all the buttons, outraged that <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">one of our best admins</a> had been de-adminned from on high, most unfairly as I thought. That turned out to be a fine opportunity to write a full-scale article, for once. Hope you return refreshed after the light duty! It <i>is</i> only a website, after all.

<dl>
<dd>For me, 'light duty' is simply not getting into any pre-existing disputes...and by that, I mean distancing myself from the various Kurd/Turk debates. There's still a lot that needs to be done there, but I know another admin has stepped in for the time being, so I feel a little more comfortable letting it go for a time. Currently? I'm rediscovering my love of New Page Patrol&#160;:) . And hey, good to see you're turned your outrage into opportunity. This is just a website, but I think the reason we're all here is because we know it can be more than that.

<p>Hi, Bishonen. I'm posting stuff at Wikipedia when I really need to be writing my paper. In order to reduce the temptation for me to get involved, would you do me a favour and add <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonWatts_92e3.html" title="User talk:GordonWatts">User talk:GordonWatts</a> to your watchlist. You'll remember Gordon's incredibly ill-judged self nomination for adminship over a year ago, and actually I'm turning to you mainly because you opposed him at the time, and were challenged lengthily, so you know what he's like, and couldn't be accused of unduly favouring him, but at the same time, I know you have a strong sense of allowing blocked users some dignity.</p>
<p>Gordon is a well-meaning editor, who hasn't a clue how to get along with people who disagree with him, and doesn't make the effort to try to get along with them. He posts hundreds of words, often in different colours to draw attention to them. And he has to argue on every little point. However, his article edits are often helpful, improving word flow, correcting inaccuracies (whether Terri Schiavo was in a hospice or a hospital on a certain date), fixing spelling errors, etc. Unfortunately, he has tried very hard to get links to his own websites put in to the article, and got upset at the opposition, which included a lot of completely unnecessary rudeness and belittling. A community ban was sought, and he argued with everyone, even those who were trying to help him, and posted thousands of words, getting quite disruptive, and lost a lot of the support that he originally had. The ban vote was closed incorrectly, as the community had mostly said either that he couldn't go near anything to do with Terri Schiavo, or that he could edit the Schiavo articles but only post once a day on the Schiavo talk pages. He was told that he couldn't edit the articles, and could post once a day on the talk pages — something which nobody had voted for. He then filed an arbitration case against all the people who had voted against him, and started arguing and wiki-lawyering with the arbitrators. Then he appealed to Jimbo, and was blocked indefinitely for disruption. There was some very bad-taste gloating.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111770463" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111770463" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111830431" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111830431" rel="nofollow">[43]</a></p>
<p>The indefinite block was reduced to a month, but he's still able to edit his talk page, and is still reacting there. He's in danger of being permanently blocked if he mentions his links again, and I don't actually think he'll do it if nobody provokes him by telling him that they're not suitable. He has accepted that the consensus is that he may not add them to articles, and in any case, he doesn't have any greater history of edit warring than other people on the Terri Schiavo article. However, I'm worried that he's going to respond to posts where people tell him that he's not to mention his links, and that it may be used against him to make the block permanent.</p>
<p>In case you're interested, there's discussion <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_noticeboard_Archive2_e838.html#Community_ban_request_on_User:GordonWatts" title="Wikipedia:Community noticeboard/Archive2">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_IncidentArchive209_ff7f.html#GordonWatts_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29_blocked" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive209">here</a>. There's also a longish post from me <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html#Gordon" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">here</a>, which is cross-posted from TenOfAllTrades's talk page. Don't feel under any obligation to wade through any of it, though, as I'm not asking you to unblock Gordon or to "vote" in any discussion. All I'm asking is that you'd keep an eye on his talk page, and discourage people from posting anything that will make him feel he has to respond. (And poor Gordon feels he has to respond to <i>everything</i>!) If people keep up the arguments on his talk page, he'll argue back, saying why they're wrong to say he can't talk about his links, and then it's quite likely that someone will block him for talking about them. But if everyone leaves him alone, and stops mentioning his links even on other pages that he watches, there's a reasonable chance that he'll stop mentioning them. He has already said he'll stop, but he's just not able to <i>not</i> repond when someone argues with him. I've seen you dealing quite kindly and tactfully with people who had trouble "letting go" before. I think I'll ask GTBacchus to watch that talk page as well. I'm really not asking for any action: this could be one of the cases where doing nothing is the best possible solution. I'd just like to think that a few people who are not interested in trampling on people's dignity would be watching his page. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 15:58, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't worry that you don't have the tact for the job. You don't need a lot of tact. Gordon, contrary to what you might think, is not huffy. He once gave a barnstar to <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">an editor</a> who had called him an asshole and a certifiable nutjob, and had said he needed his ass kicked, plus lots of other similar things. And <a href="../../../g/o/r/User_talk%7EGordonWatts_92e3.html#Advice_from_Ann" title="User talk:GordonWatts">my recent post to him</a> isn't exactly full of compliments, but he e-mailed me and thanked me. Anyway, if you feel "a great wave of, hmm, <i>impatience</i>" engulfing you, you can't do better than think of <a href="../../../t/h/%C3%A9/Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_de_Lisieux_6a64.html" title="Thérèse de Lisieux">Saint Thérèse of Lisieux</a>, who describes in her journal/autobiography how someone was infuriating her, complaining, nagging, finding fault, etc., and Thérèse listened in silence, and then, before leaving the room, did one more thing. <i>"I gave her my best smile."</i> My mother always used to quote that — as a joke, not as an attempt to preach!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seriously, though, I think there's a problem if people start goading a blocked user by telling him on his talk page that he's not to mention his links, and then threaten him with an indefinite block if he answers, on his talk page, that he doesn't think that's fair, or that he doesn't <i>need</i> Wikipedia to link to his websites, because he gets plenty of hits anyway. I'm all for increasing a block when a blocked user spends his block time by filling his talk page with "[Name of blocking admin] likes to rape little boys". But if we don't have the self control not to insist on having the last word, why should we expect him to? You said something wonderful months ago about how admins are more powerful than users, but <b>so</b> much more powerful than blocked users, and that a sensitive awareness of that should make us tolerant of what blocked users say when they're blocked. I can't remember the context, or where you said it, but I'm annoyed I didn't make a note of the diff at the time. because it was one of the best posts I've ever seen. It's the reason I though of you when making the request. &lt;groan&gt; Anyway, Gordon hasn't posted in the last few days, and I have some hope that he'll follow the advice I gave him, <i>if people don't provoke him</i>. If they do, I have absolutely no hope at all that he'll be able to ignore them.</dd>

<p>Hi Bish, Sorry to trouble you with this, but would you mind having a word with Certified.Gangsta? He's repeatedly trying to add an unsourced and disputed claim into <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Marsh_%28model%29_cfee.html" title="Michelle Marsh (model)">Michelle Marsh (model)</a>, he's accused me and another editor of stalking when we've reverted him, and he is going around making edits to the effect that the Taiwanese aren't ethnically Chinese on all sorts of pages. It's gotten to the stage where more of his edits are reverted than kept, and by a wide range of editors. He's sticking to the letter of 3RR, but not the spirit. I don't think he's deliberately trolling, but the end effect is still disruptive. For his sake, can you have a talk to him?

<li>Could you maybe help <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">User:Anynobody</a> with some minor formatting/procedural issues at Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Anynobody and Justanother?

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't blame you. It's quite misleading that user RFCs and article RFCs even share a name, as they function and are formatted quite differently. The most important thing about user RFCs is right at the top of the template: there must be a co-signer of the RFC, somebody who has attempted (independently of Anynobody) to resolve the issues with JA. Both Anynobody and the other editor must sign, <i>and provide evidence of their efforts to resolve the problem</i> within 48 hours of creating the RFC. Evidence means diffs. Everything else can pretty much wait, but the 48-hour thing is obligatory, and if it's not complied with, the RFC is highly likely to be deleted as soon as the 48 hours are up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I'd prefer to do is move the page into Anynobody's own space, in other words give it a name of the form User:Anynobody/Requests for comment/Justanother; stop the people who have already been asked to comment; move it back into Wikipedia space later, when it's a bit more ready to meet the world; and start those 48 hours then instead of now. OK? Then I could give some help and advice tomorrow, as I'm about to go to bed right now. (Such is my timezone.) If you reply now—<i>right</i> now—I can move the page; if not, please confer with A and move it yourself if you know how (it's easy), or ask any experienced user. For instance one of the freaks that hang out at this page of mine. And don't list it on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User_conduct_3a88.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct</a> yet! <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC).

<p>Well... I'm actually a little frustrated that you asked my advice and then ignored it. Changing the page into a userpage until it's ready is the way to go IMO, especially because then there'll be time to deal properly with the "dispute resolution" thing. Changing it into a userpage can be done any time as long as nobody has commented, after that it'll be too late. But never mind, this is what to do with an RFC that's already in Wikipedia space (=has a name beginning with "Wikipedia"):</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the page should be Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Justanother. This is standard, and Anynobody, who's making the request, isn't supposed to be in the title.</li>
<li>The page must be listed and linked on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User_conduct_3a88.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct</a>.</li>
<li>About notifying people, that's a little delicate, indeed. The only person who must be notified, and perhaps the only one who should be, is Justanother. If you want to spread the news, you obviously have to be careful not to simply notify people who have issues with Justanother. Not sure what you mean by "previously involved". Involved in what? Anynobody seems to be asking for comments on the way the two of them have been interacting—how is anybody else involved in that?</li>
<li>The links at "Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute" are no good, to put it brutally. Posting warning templates on JA's page certainly doesn't qualify as attempted dispute resolution. (Didn't I tell you once that it was frowned on?) Dispute resolution means a bona fide attempt at reaching out, and I think you may be too upset with JA to be the best person for it. Suggestion: try asking Jossi, who knows the ropes, to contact JA and try to talk with him about Anynobody's concerns. (Yes, I know there's little time for that... people do tend to run short of time at this point. The way it's looking now, practically any admin will delete the page after 48 hours, if JA requests it.) A technical point, also: the top 3 links under "Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute" don't work, and I think there are some more on the page that don't. You need html links for talkpage sections, and you need permanent links, that'll still point to the same section after the page itself is archived or whatever. And, as the instructions say, linking to a whole page isn't useful. I can easily format the links so they work right if you like (just ask), but you do need to have better dispute resolution to point to.</li>
<li>I don't think Anynobody should put his reason for making the request on the talkpage, it should be on the main page. Under "Statement of the dispute", perhaps, or "Description". (It's a very nice explanation—it's good to see a RFC that's not full of acrimony and it's-all-his-fault —but it would be even better if it was a little shorter.)</li>
<li>Finally, I'm sorry it's such a bureaucratic nightmare. You probably weren't expecting that. User RFC's are horrible timesinks.&#160;:-( <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC).</li>

<p>I'm really sorry to cause so much trouble on both of your parts, rest assured I'm learning. Also please understand I am very thankful for your help. Maybe an RfC was the wrong road for me to take? Essentially I'd like other editors to take a look at my interaction with <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">User:Justanother</a>. I honestly don't know if I'm wrong or right, so my intention in listing myself was making it clear I'm willing to accept accountability for any errors I've made. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC) To be clear I'm happy to accept any suggestions. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 03:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Better than an RfC, that as Bishonen put it are "horrible timesinks" (an opinion that I also share), would you consider informal mediation between you and Justanother? Sometimes having such a third-party assisting can really help in disputes such as this. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 06:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To be honest I did consider mediation at first, but personally I'd like to hear from several editors. If I understand what <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> is proposing, it would be to move the page as is to a subpage under my userpage.

<dl>
<dd>No, not "once it gets a few comments". It won't get comments while it's in your userspace, that's the whole point. It won't <i>start</i> until it's moved back to a live RFC, and, on my reading of the always-vexed RFC rules, you would be able to restart the clock for those 48 hours when it was moved back. What you need the time for is dispute resolution. The rule is that there must be real attempts, by two people, to resolve differences with JA, or the RFC gets deleted. It doesn't have to be formal mediation, informal is fine, but it must be a real discussion—not scolding JA with warning templates and such. Of course the hope is that the mediation will be enough in itself, and the RFC become superfluous—compare Jossi's comment here. But if it isn't enough, it's in any case a <i>prerequsite</i> for the RFC. OK, I've gone ahead and moved the page into your userspace as User:Anynobody/Requests for comment/Justanother. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 11:07, 7 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>A quick question before this goes any further, did it really seem like I was posting warning templates and scolding him? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 21:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, IMO your attempts were ok, I was talking about Smee's. "<i>There must be real attempts, by *two people*, to resolve differences with JA</i>". See the top of the RFC template: "at least *two people* need to show that they tried to resolve a dispute with this user and have failed".

<p>Thank you for your reply, I'm sorry if that last question seemed blunt but what you were describing is exactly the kind of thing I meant to avoid. Considering that I didn't mean to create a situation where an RfC was necessary, for a little while I thought I was <i>really</i> messing up if you were describing my attempts the way I thought. I also don't want to give you the impression I don't consider your advice valuable, I just figured the worst that could happen was it got rejected. I know it may sound crazy, but I've been trying to do this without making things worse with <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>.

<li>I'm sorry this conflict is getting to you, Smee. I have to agree with Friday and Justanother that there's no external reason for you to be scared, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. That's not what it's supposed to be like to edit here! I hope you'll find it in you to walk away from the most stressful pages for a few days and decompress by editing uncontroversial stuff. When people do that, they're often surpried and relieved to find that other people do pick up the slack. That the page does survive their absence. Or so ALoan tells me.

<li>And Smee, while I figured the "Scared" was all BS for effect, I do realize that I could have been wrong and you might actually be getting that upset and really be feeling fear.

<li>We're done here. <i>while I figured the "Scared" was all BS for effect</i> does not go very far towards acknowledging that my feelings are real. It invalidates your following statements.

<li>I said that to explain why I called you a "drama queen" instead of making any effort to acknowledge your feelings and try to assuage your fears. Bishonen's reply highlighted my failing so I tried to repair it. Or at least repair the part where you say that you felt fear for your safety in the real world.

<dd>Sinclair Lewis was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature. That's the connection to Sweden, as Lewis wrote <i>Babbitt,</i> and he said, when he accepted, "Our American professors like their authors like their literature: dead." Well, Lewis is now liked by professors, and poor, dumb Mr. Babbitt has become an adjective. Why, he's a big man at the local Elk's Club. An Elk is not to be confused with Anne Elk, who was a noted female professor whom the Soviets decided to celebrate on March 8th. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Users signing other subsection should not edit the the "Response" section, but that does not mean that they cannot comment below it.

<dd>Smee, you are clearly misreading the very clear instructions. The Response Section is the section after <i>Statement of the dispute</i> and before <i>Outside view</i>. That section is for me and my supporters to make our statements without having to "defend" them in threaded discussions.

<p>Hello Bishonen,</p>
<p>I see from your edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User_conduct&amp;curid=2551069&amp;diff=113980023&amp;oldid=113831516" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User_conduct&amp;curid=2551069&amp;diff=113980023&amp;oldid=113831516" rel="nofollow">here</a> you've removed this RfC. In your edit summary, you have stated that you see the parties' attempts to resolve the dispute were inadequate. However, the subject of this RfC has engaged in repeated egregiously uncivil and disruptive behavior, not only against <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a>, but against any editor who does not share his beliefs or takes issue with his behavior. In fact, I had comments to add to the RfC, and to my surprise, the RfC was deleted. Please note I have seen efforts by <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> to resolve their dispute, and to avoid a dispute in the first instance. But as your edit cites that you view previous efforts of the dispute resolution as being inadequate, can you (as an experienced editor, especially in these types of matters) please suggest ways in which this type of dispute can be better handled and resolved, or what other steps should have been taken prior to creating the now deleted RfC? I seek the benefit of your experience and hope you can show the way here. Kind regards, <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 03:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>02:36, 10 March 2007 Bishonen (Talk | contribs) deleted "Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Justanother" (This is much older than 48 hours with the certification still woefully inadequate, as I warned the participants several days ago, and Justanother has requested deletion.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> I understand you felt that it didn't meet the RfC requirements, however somebody else did and added it to the approved section. Moreover you didn't respond to my last post under the RfC discussion explaining that I was not the only signer, which is why it got approved I thought. You could have at least explained your view more clearly before deleting the RfC, either in the request itself or the RfC talk page.. I can see by your talk page history that you and <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> are friends, and I suspect you may have let your feelings get in the way on this issue. I'm asking you to undelete the RfC, as there were other editors who have yet to comment. There certainly must be some way to escalate this matter above you, and must point out that if you take no further action I will research and pursue them. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:20, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Anynobody, I can appreciate why you may be understandably annoyed at the RfC being deleted. However, I cannot agree with your assessment that Bishonen and Justanother are operating in a conflict of interest; in fact, please note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive206#Section_break.2C_and_noticeboard_disruption" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive206#Section_break.2C_and_noticeboard_disruption" rel="nofollow">this exchange</a> with regards to the BabyDweezil case. It would appear the RfC User Comment process is very time-consuming, which is one reason why editors and admins are reluctant to pursue them, except in clear cases of disputes which cannot be resolved any other way. My personal opinion of Justanother's editing behavior is that it is inappropriate, however in order to back a new RfC, I would also need to demonstrate that I had made adequate attempts to resolve my dispute with Justanother, which I cannot do, as Justanother appears to me to become overtly hostile as soon as the premises he cites as facts are called into question. I find it difficult to reach consensus when such behavior is exhibited. However, I do believe and have observed that, to your credit, you have not only attempted to avoid disputes in the first place, you have also made considerable efforts to resolve them, despite Justanother's clearly uncivil and disruptive behavior, and the tag team games being played with an editor who has now been banned. It also appears to me that Justanother has a pattern of making comments to incite and provoke people, and initiate discussions in which his stated premises are inherently flawed; to cite one example of many: in the Barbara Schwarz article, he falsely claimed it was sourced mainly from postings to the Usenet and thus is not reliably sourced. I have read Bishonen's comments <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen#RFC_minor_formatting" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen#RFC_minor_formatting" rel="nofollow">here</a> and other comments about the process <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJossi&amp;diff=113204007&amp;oldid=113121848" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJossi&amp;diff=113204007&amp;oldid=113121848" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I hope Bishonen can suggest some ways to resolve the dispute. I do not personally believe Bishonen let feelings interfere with the RfC issue, and I believe you may agree that Bishonen may have had feelings to the contrary of those suggested after reading the exchange above with regards to the "section break and noticeboard disruption". Please review it, as it may change some of your opinions stated above. Kind regards, <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 09:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

See the RFC instructions: "If this does not happen within 48 hours of the creation of this dispute page (which was: 00:29, 6 March 2007 (UTC)), the page will be deleted." Not "will be moved to the userspace".

<dd>Can I suggest, Orsini? I'm afraid you've caught me at a bad time for it. I did suggest, as you saw at the top of this page, under the heading "Minor formatting", where I did my very best to babysit this RFC to one that would <i>not</i> have to be deleted. Anynobody had pursued reasonable dispute resolution, Smee had not. Note that according to the rules, dispute resolution must be done by two editors, and must be <i>seen to have been done</i>, in the RFC itself, in the form of diffs, under the heading "Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute". I tried to explain how vital this was, and repeatedly warned Smee and Anynobody about the 48-hour rule. First I tried to get Anynobody to keep it in his userspace, to give time for the matter to be taken care of; indeed at one point I boldly moved it there myself; he would have none of it. I explained to Smee what was wrong with the diffs he presented as dispute resolution — I quote myself:</dd>

<dd><i>The links at "Evidence of trying and failing to resolve the dispute" are no good, to put it brutally. Posting warning templates on JA's page certainly doesn't qualify as attempted dispute resolution. (Didn't I tell you once that it was frowned on?) Dispute resolution means a bona fide attempt at reaching out, and I think you may be too upset with JA to be the best person for it. Suggestion: try asking Jossi, who knows the ropes, to contact JA and try to talk with him about Anynobody's concerns. (Yes, I know there's little time for that... people do tend to run short of time at this point. The way it's looking now, practically any admin will delete the page after 48 hours, if JA requests it.)</i></dd>

<dd>That's true, although, I suppose, to be nice about it, the "character sketch" is probably more common and better known as the "memories of Local Person" in the newspaper and the "portrait of Grotesque" that creative writing classes assign, so it would be a little mean to put in Atticus or Sporus or any of the women who have no characters in the Epistle to a Lady.

<dd>Oh, hi, Moe. Did I refer to the wrong block log? That wouldn't surprise me, but I can't find where I refer to a log for the 24-hour January block at all. If I did, can you tell me where, please? As for changing the heading, or referring to WT by his (varying) IP, no, I'd rather not. I call the user--the person--Worldtraveller throughout--it's not a mistake, but rather a mark of respect. I don't think it has any potential for misunderstanding, either, since I don't discuss the circumstances of InShaneee's block of the anonymous editor at all (if I had, I would have gone into the IP thing.) I have assumed WT himself and others will do that sufficiently, and also canvass the IP thing to the point of boredom and beyond--the arbcom doesn't have any realistic chance to miss it. I discuss the aftermath. (Same reasoning with A Link to the Past, btw--I don't address the reasons for the block, I assume others will). I don't want that heading changed. But thanks for bringing it up for consideration! I appreciate your scrupulousness in taking it to me, rather than changing it yourself. (P. S. Wrong date? Weird. Thanks.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 03:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC).

<dd>Well, since it technically WT's IP and the section is accuratly describing everything else for the most part, I guess it doesn't hurt anything to say that it was in fact WT blocked instead of the IP. I just thought for the sake of accuracy it should be changed *shrug* no matter.

<dd>My paraphrase of CBD's coment: "Boy Howdy it sure does look like them fellas are conspiring together in a nasty convoluted plot with the sole goal of getting Inshaneee in trouble for some reason, but the AGF policy says we have to pretend it's just a crazy coink-i-dink, yup."

<dd>Now wait a minute. First, about "eom". It's an "email"-ism, sort of like the old radio-speak where when one person is done talking they say "over" and people take turns talking. When one is done, they say "over and out". In the radio world this was because the communication channel was half duplex and both folks couldn't talk at once. In email, it's been adopted as a courtesy to indicate a subject only message is not a mistake. This was only a poke to turn Bishonen's "you have new messages" indicator on. "Brusque" only if you don't understand the context. In context, it's meant to be courteous. I'm not CBD, and haven't interacted with him a lot, but my assumption is he meant this as a courtesy, not to be brusque.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, about CBD's original comment. I think Bunchofgrapes's paraphrase is nowhere near accurate. I'm not sure you've noticed, but I am one of the folks who objected to his block of WT. I'm on your side in this. But this doesn't mean everything CBD says is evil. My paraphrase would be "Hey, Tony, your interpretation of this requires a bizarre convoluted nasty plot that no reasonable person would imagine could possibly be the case." His phrasing was a little oblique (and he's later apologized about this as well), but IMO the basic message was supportive. There may indeed be more history here than I'm seeing, but this is how I'm interpreting this exchange. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 02:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I followed a link from the Arbcom case here and noticed this discussion. The link and 'eom' thing is my standard way of handling comments on my talk page... I respond there and post a link so that the person is notified of the response, but the discussion is not split between two pages. The 'eom' is to clarify that it is not an error that no further message is included below the title... which used to be an extremely common usage, but is apparently a bit dated. Sorry if it was unclear, perhaps I should link the 'eom' to <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_Message_f9a7.html" title="End of Message">End of Message</a>.</dd>

<p>Hey Bish, I'm not sure if you got my reply for the e-mail. So anyway long story short, going back to several other similar cases of block-evasion/ban-evasion such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalist_3959.html" title="User:Nationalist">User:Nationalist</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a>, etc, it is pretty apparent that there isn't a great distinction between an indef. block and community ban. Obviously, circumventing a ban and then getting rewarded for it just seems illogical. Seriously, this is a joke. But anyway, worst case scentario I guess is to go straight to arbCom and get them to define an actual distinction between block and ban. Oh and btw did Crum e-mail youb back?

I had been editing in the article almost since its creation.

<li>Smee made a series of edits to give what I consider undue prominence to the dedication in what I consider an effort to make the article itself into an anti-Scientology propaganda piece. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=113617354&amp;oldid=113617198" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=113617354&amp;oldid=113617198" rel="nofollow">Here</a> and then with a screenshot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114829597" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=114829597" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There are other similar efforts by Smee at what I consider propagandizing both in that article and in others but I am not addressing Smee's POV-pushing here, I am addressing his <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">WP:DE</a> in pursuit of it.</li>
<li>Ten minutes <b>after</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=115226502&amp;oldid=115208283" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=115226502&amp;oldid=115208283" rel="nofollow">opening</a> a topic in talk, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=115228420&amp;oldid=115223151" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=115228420&amp;oldid=115223151" rel="nofollow">removed</a> the undue prominence and replaced it with a mention of the dedication in the lead; a very fair compromise, I thought.</li>
<li>One hour later, Smee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=115228420" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=115228420" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> me without discussion even though I had specifically invited discussion in talk. He claimed in that edit summary I lacked consensus when, in actual fact, his "dedicating the article" is what really lacked consensus. He claimed I failed to discuss when it was him that had failed to discuss. Smee continued his improper edit-warring (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bridge_%28film%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>) and only stopped because I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJu66l3r&amp;diff=115255789&amp;oldid=114779786" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJu66l3r&amp;diff=115255789&amp;oldid=114779786" rel="nofollow">asked</a> a neutral 3rd party to weigh in. When the neutral party also objected (more as a "film person" I think than as someone sensitive to the use of this project as a propaganda medium but that speaks to the fact that propagandists violate simple standards of article creation that are evident even without considering POV issues), Smee self-reverted with a deprecating remark. Another editor with media experience came in and agreed on non-POV issues that Smee's edit is inappropriate for the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my opinion, Smee's behavior in this incident is disrespectful and disruptive. Bishonen, I could show you a number of similar incidents but this one shows my problem just fine, I think. It really is a problem; not my POV, not me whining, etc. Smee makes inappropriate edits then edit wars over them rather then discuss and continues to edit war until a 3rd party or parties come in and back me up (and they always seem to back me up). I do not mind that Smee does not want to take my word when I say that one of his edits will not stand. That is his right. I do want him to stop edit-warring to reinsert the inappropriate POV edit until the issue is resolved. The disputed material should be removed to talk and discussed and remain removed until the issue is resolved, not reinserted repeatedly in some phony "compromise" (a term he likes to use as he reinserts). That is my <b>desired outcome</b>. His agreement to to so. Would you please help us?

<p>Bishonen is just about Gangsta's only friend at Wikipedia. If you look at the thread on AN/I, you will see that she angrily defended him when I mentioned the fake banner incident. Gangsta interpreted this to mean "you're the one who is stalking, disrupting, bullying, and POV pushing all over the place. Bishonen made that quite clear." I asked Bishonen to confirm or deny that this is really what she meant to say; she has not replied yet. I am surprised you are not aware of this.

<p>Thanks for your interest, El C. In the workshop for the RFAr on InShaneee, Tony Sidaway offered the "Proposed finding of fact" that Worldtraveller had stalked and personally attacked InShaneee, and that "statements by some experienced Wikipedians" had encouraged him to do so.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/InShaneee/Workshop#Mixed_signals_played_a_part" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/InShaneee/Workshop#Mixed_signals_played_a_part" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> The only link given by Tony for that encouragement was to a statement by me. Tony and Ideogram went on to discuss how my "bad advice" was something of an excuse for Worldtraveller (who protested indignantly at what he called "condescending nonsense"). I'm assuming that workshop thread was the concern Ideogram had in mind. I didn't reply to the Proposed finding. Tony had linked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=111938652&amp;oldid=111937102" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=111938652&amp;oldid=111937102" rel="nofollow">some of my best work</a>, so there didn't seem much to add. Perhaps Ideogram was worried I might not have seen it, and prodded me on ANI and here on my page to get a dialogue going? I don't think that would be fruitful or constructive though. (I have some prior experience of attempting to dialogue with him.) El C, please don't encourage him to post here.

<p>Allo.<br />
So, I just picked an admin at random for some help with something pretty small.<br />
(btw, you may want to tell bishzilla to be more carefully when handling editors. It took me a LONG time to de-flattenify myself after I got squashed!)<br />
Anyways, I noticed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Esata-logo.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Esata-logo.jpg" rel="nofollow">sata logo</a> was a jpg, and there's a notice requesting that someone replace it with a svg or png image. I'm veeery new to svg, and have zero knowledge of how to upload images, do copyright stuff, yadda yadda yadda.<br />
So, anyways, I just used inkscape to essentially trace the original logo, also exported as a png, and uploaded both to my school account. Any chance you upload <a href="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ef99ab/inkscape/sata1.svg" class="external text" title="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ef99ab/inkscape/sata1.svg" rel="nofollow">this</a> and/or <a href="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ef99ab/inkscape/sata1.png" class="external text" title="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ef99ab/inkscape/sata1.png" rel="nofollow">this</a>, if they are suitable replacements? (And <a href="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ef99ab/inkscape/sata2.svg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ef99ab/inkscape/sata2.svg" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> is just a link to a blown-up svg version, if that's necessary for anything)<br />
This request also goes out to any of the many editors who tend to read this talk page. (except bishzilla. I don't want to be squished again. It messes with my hair.) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_00c0.html" title="User:Bladestorm">Bladestorm</a> 20:19, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I know how to upload, but am a bit fuzzy about image formats and their appropriateness, also whether the way you made yours is ok copyright-wise, so I hereby request some image whizz to do it. Wait, I'll have Bishzilla request it with her new power sig, so nobody has a chance of MISSING IT. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:59, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

Most article talk pages have been GimmeBotified, but not all; the (temporary) instructions are hard to nail down during the transition because there are several different scenarios. The bot moves the facfailed nomination to an archive, closes and tags it, clears the redirect, leaving a link to the old nom on the cleared fac page, so that a subsequent nominator will find the old failedfac already linked on the new fac page (hence, "retain"). "Add" will go away once botification is finished, and retain will be accurate. While the bot work is underway, I've been watching each fac nom to make sure all the pieces are in the right place. I'm going to be traveling; if you want to tweak further to cover all the bases until the bot work is done, Gimmetrow can help. Eventually, the instructions will have to be rewritten, eliminating any mention of add, move or archive, as the bot will have done all of that in advance. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 12:38, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean I should delete all revisions after MortimerCat? That's a thought. I didn't think of the credit thing and the GFDL—I assumed Giano's work was in fact free to steal once he'd saved it anywhere at all on Wikipedia—I removed it only on the principle that it was unsourced and unreliable and the author had even <i>said</i> so. (I won't deny that I <i>wanted</i> to remove it, but the attribution angle didn't occur to me.) OK, I'll remove those suckers. I was lucky the case was so simple—I don't know what I would have done if somebody else had made substantial additions after the IP edit. Been petrified with indecision, probably. As for the next FA, I believe Giano has foresworn producing any more of those, after recent scarring experiences of <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Giano_archive_6_%282007%29#Hannah_on_FAC....3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Giano_archive_6_%282007%29#Hannah_on_FAC....3F" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 08:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Thanks for all the support here! I didn't realise people watched my uses space so much - I shall have to watch some of the less than flattering things I write about some buildings there. I'm not bothered too much about credit - but I do like a little acknowledgement sometimes. Also I do like to check my spelling and dates etc before going into mainspace. I'm afraid, you will all have a very long wait though for the next FA - you have seen the last of those. I write only in my style, in the way I think is correct for an encyclopedia. It would be a waste of time FACing my pages as I am reliably informed via the FARC page that they would not pass today. I refuse to ref such well known facts as "<i>During the 17th century, many architects studying in Italy learned of Palladio's work</i>" - as I have been asked to do on FARC. Finally, this classic comment here referring to my writing - ""<i>In 1570 Palladio published his book I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, inspiring architects across Europe." Inspired who? According to what researcher? Needs citation, otherwise is original research."</i> made me realise that if I have to look up every obvious and accepted fact, then I would be unable to write an FA again anyway, as any spontaneity and freedom of expression in a page would be gone. They would become so dull no-one would ever bother to read to the end. While I am happy to ref a Prince of Monaco sleeping with his mother-in-law (because not a lot of people know that!) - and it makes a dull section on history page more interesting and fun - I am not about to become a "Master of the Obvious" referencing every well known fact just to please a few style and rule obsessive zealots . I feel wikipedia is so full of little stubs begging to be improved, and subjects on which nothing is written - we could all more profitably spend our time attending to these things, rather than attacking the better pages.</dd>

<dd>I know some other former FA writes such as Geogre and Bishonen share some of my views - which is a pity as they have produced some of the better and more intellectual FAs essential for a encyclopedia of any worth and value. I 100% believe references should be listed and I'm glad to see their are still some very good editors turning out first rate FAs but there is also a worrying amount of FAs on pop music and computer type things sourced entirely from the internet - not in my view a static medium. I would like to see more FAs sharing sources with not only the internet but also books with few pictures and 973 pages.<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 09:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been considering pushing an article of my own to FA level sometime in the next couple of months, and I have to say that what I have been reading about the FA reviewers demanding a footnote reference after every sentence is a serious deterrent to my wanting to do that. This page is probably not where I should be saying it, because I'm preaching to the choir here, but if our most motivated authors are choosing not to create featured content because of idiosyncrasies of the selection process, that is a serious problem. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 14:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>And what are you going to expect other people (who aren't experts in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_cuisine.html" title="Medieval cuisine">Medieval cuisine</a>) to do when someone else edits your article, and follows your style of not citing enough?

Say you get three edits adding or changing information that seem reasonably likely; two are good, one is bad. How do you expect someone not yourself to know which of the three to revert and which to keep, if you don't give them sources to compare to? This is not just a hypothetical case, I just blocked an editor who had fun doing exactly that, inserting minor inaccuracies in uncited articles.

<dd>Oh my, what if someone who's not an expert edits the article? Then it won't be reliable? What if they edit and don't give footnotes? Those arguments are, <i>at their best,</i> an argument against Wikipedia. After all, what do we do when someone edits the article on Bob Roberts? What do we do when someone edits the article on George W. Bush? Do we have to have footnotes to know the difference? Hey, what if someone <i>edits the footnotes!</i> What if "someone" <i>inserts a bogus reference?</i> Do you think it's even remotely possible to turn out a heavily footnoted article where the footnotes refer to fictitious books? This argument is against an encyclopedia anyone can edit. I also love the implication that someone is advocating not footnoting enough. In fact, I advocate <i>appropriate</i> references.

<dd><small>Apologies for not keeping Giano properly amused.</small> I can tell you what to do when someone adds a dubious claim to a well cited article. Check their edits against the citation. If they don't agree, the claim is wrong. That works equally well if the claim is bogus or if the source is. That way we don't have to worry whether the editor has a doctorate in theology or is merely diligent at using Google; we don't care if they're an expert, merely if their sources are. If they don't give a citation, that stands out as something that should be cited, tagged, or removed. Wikipedia is not reliable in and of itself, specifically because anonymous mice <i>can</i> edit - and don't think I'm saying that's a bad thing, that's the reason I am allowed to be here, after all. However, it does mean that proper attribution is the only thing we have that can give articles that reliability. That doesn't mean citing every sentence, but it does mean that when someone doubts a fact, it is only assuming good faith to believe that doubt, and be able to reference that fact. Frankly, assuming that every educated reader already knows that a 1570 book inspired architects across Europe is common knowledge is attributing quite a lot to common knowledge. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:54, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose I have more faith in the power of a college degree, but knowing that Palladianism came from Palladio only required a single Art History class for me. I would have known Palladianism anyway, a bit after my sophomore year, when I hit it in a History of England class. I would have learned it as a senior, if I hadn't learned it as a sophomore or a junion, when I took a class in Europe Between the Wars. I have "learned" that fact a dozen times in college. We do <i>not</i> cite everything. We <i>do</i> rely on good faith. Remember that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> refers to <i>articles,</i> not taggers or blocks or other things. In fact, Wikipedia was the gamble built on the assumption that more people wanted correct information than wanted to vandalize, and we are extremely susceptible to dishonest editors. We always will be. That's the nature of the game. If people want to read undergraduate research papers, they can, but that's not the standard of any encyclopedia. I find them unspeakably insulting. "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is named after Heizenberg (note)" makes me want to slap someone. How stupid do they think I am? How stupid do they think readers are in general? How stupid are they that they had to go dig up a reference to assure themselves of that? Most articles have no citations. This is a good thing, generally. Those with unusual knowledge need <i>references,</i> but not stickypad citations. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:40, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Everything must citable. That doesn't mean it needs to be cited. Some people have problem with this concept.

<li>Just looked in to see if the conversation had taken a perk, or anyone eloquent had looked in - No. So Bishonendearhart, do terminate this because it is going nowhere - we are all agreed we are done with FAs - can't be bothered with all the new malarky and claptrap far too stressful, and insulting to the intelligence. This moment in time heralds the beginning of a brave new era for Wikipedia the FAs of <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a>); <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a>'s <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Illusion_639f.html" title="Christ Illusion">Christ Illusion</a> and those of a similar mind-frame are obviously the way to go. Sadly my blood pressure these days does not allow for porn queens, and my interest in Christ is confined to mass and praying for eternal redemption - not that I'm admitting to a link between the two. I wish all the new FA writers well - but I can't agree with them, I shall not be joining them on the main page - I will be continuing in my own odd referencing ways - so I think all that needs to be said has been said. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 21:58, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

I have nothing but respect for the many FAs of Giano on European architecture, and Geogre on lesser known English wliterature, at a quick glance. I can only hope to eventually be as skilled and prolific. However, we need more good writing on any subject in the encyclopedia, including the ones that I or LuciferMorgan chose. If we have these subjects at all, they may as well be covered as well as possible, which, in the current way of doing things, means bringing them up to the standard of FA, which does seem to include citations. That is the current standard of the Wikipedia community, and it does have reasons behind it. <i>(rephrased, with apologies) --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 06:28, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</i></li>

<dd>I just go around all day, hitting the "Random" button. I recommend it to anyone. See what's really in Wikipedia.

Then we get to the really stomach churning "This is a single by MinorBand released in RecentMonth and here is a picture of it." I released singles, an e.p., and an l.p. in a former band, and hell if I'd expect anyone to look them up here. What the heck could I say about them? "We released this, and it got played on about 110 radio stations, according to tracking reports. We sold all the copies we made of the first pressing, and that netted us a grand total of $280?"

<p>Just for chuckles, I think I should point out that I have never stated my credentials, and I hope to never do so. I have a <i>job</i> that some people assume implies those things, but I have said very, very little about that, wish I had said less, and Giano is an absolute cypher. He has never indicated so much that he <i>has</i> a job, much less what it is, and even less where he went to college and how long. The point being that, unlike quite a few people -- and particularly the people demanding to have us respect their authorit-ay, neither of us, and certainly not Bishonen, either, mentions credentials. We point to our <i>work here at Wikipedia,</i> which is a different thing, and then only, as Bishonen says, in exasperation. Since I arrived here, I've been annoyed by the pop obsessed younguns at Wikipedia shouting "amen" to each other. To me, this is a fight over whether we have articles on these subjects, not whether we have FA's on them. If we get articles on them, they're eligible <b>if</b> they can be properly discussed and analyzed. 90% of the time, they can't. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, and I should have added a P.S., above. Yes, I am an elitest in many ways on content, but that's because I'm such a firm believer in the power of The People.

I have never believed that anyone or anything "is owed" an article, nor that any contributor automatically has the right to write whatever she or he wishes. Everyone should write encyclopedic content, and I think everyone can. Therefore, "Mikey is a footballer with Slovak Spartan B Community Cultural Center Extension club" is bad.

<p>Bishonen - are you saying now that I <i>cannot</i> delete the conversation from my talk page once it is complete? Because as far as I am concerned, it is complete, and there isn't anything derogatory or incorrect with me removing it...&#160;? <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 01:10, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I'm saying you <i>can</i>, but it's <i>rude</i>. That's not such a mysterious idea, is it? Some things are allowed but are nevertheless derogatory. You won't get punished for them, but they won't do anything for your reputation, either. Lots of things are like that in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Online" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life#Online" rel="nofollow">real life</a>, right? For example, it's not illegal to speak unpleasantly to your neighbors, but it's not nice either. That's how it is with this. To uphold your reputation, to be pleasant, the optimal way to handle your talkpage is to leave stuff on it until you archive the whole page (or archive all but the most recent of it—that's what I do). Replying to messages is nice too. But none of us are always nice, I guess /looks through own talkpage, blushes slightly at sight of roaring dinosaur sockpuppet/, especially when the other person is being rude. I'd hardly bother to reply to a template, I must say. I might even remove it, with an informative edit summary. But it would take a lot before I removed a real human message. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC).

<dd>That's where we differ, then. I have been military for 20 years... thus, I learn the "regulations" and what is "permissible" (plus, operate on the oh-so-popular "better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission"). I'm quite sure that if I met someone in real life and had a discussion, then found out our "wiki" identities, I wouldn't change my real-life opinion of them (I see them as separate). But I am also a person who doesn't care if I "step on someone's toes" as long as I am within the rules. So whether or not it is "rude" is all within perception (but a permissible perception! that is why I kept attempting to correct the admin, and solicited your support). He tried to <i>insist</i> that I <i>must</i> keep it on my talk page, when I knew that I didn't have to. You see, my poison is that I am intelligent and operate on logic... thus, the neighbor example for me is that when my neighbor's dog took a dump in my lawn, it is logical that they should have just cleaned it up (I don't own a dog, so it is extremely obvious). I shouldn't have to knock on the door and ask nicely, nor remind them (as it is a duty of owning the dog)... so my answer? I put the crap in a plastic bag and attached it to their doorknob. Problem solved, and surprisingly no more dog crap in my lawn... am I worried about my "rep" with them? Actually, NO. Do looks of distaste bother me? NO. If that makes me rude, so be it (it isn't against the law to be so!). If I remove a human message it means (1) that I read it, (2) that I no longer need it (unlike what I have archived or saved currently - for projects or problems I am still trying to finish, or research, or work out), or (3) that I don't care for it. Does that make me rude? Maybe. I don't care what people think about what I do as long as it is within the law/rule. The times I am outside or violate, I am humble enough to "take my lumps" and admit my mistakes (as I have been blocked for 3RR, etc, of course). So if a guy with a short haircut comes up to you in Chicago and tells you to "put the &amp;$*#! cigarette out" in a harsh tone while you are puffing away underneath a "no smoking" sign, well... it's probably me, and I don't care if you think I am rude.&#160;:) So don't take it personal, but I think the conversation is done and I will probably clean my talk page.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 02:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That suits me. I've been in academe for x years, learning to go by logic and analogy, and I have some trouble with yours. You give several examples of how you think it's proper to be rude <i>for a reason</i>, yet round off your message with rudeness for no reason: telling me the conversation is done, as if I had been needlessly bothering you with my unsolicited opinion. That's more like telling a person chewing gum under a no-smoking sign to put their &amp;$*#! cigarette out. I don't take it personally, you understand, it's just the logic of it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:43, 23 March 2007 (UTC).

<p>FYI. I'm posting here because we have orders from on-high to make this as widely known as possible, and this is a well-watched User talk. It's both a "proposed" and "already done" merger of V, NOR, and RS. It occurred, and then got held-up when Jimbo got involved. Long story. Five months of editing to slog through.

"can this be attributed to a reliable source?"; one page instead of three will be enormously easier to manage.</dd>

<dd>As ever, the questions are in the <i>uses</i> made of policy, not the wording. If someone goes along to say "all articles without references should be deleted," that's a huge mistake and a massive case of dickishness (esp. when there are thousands of really, really, really, really, really offensively bad articles that wouldn't be caught because, while they say that Fubbies Magic Pills are the greatest things ever, they link to Fubbies Magic Pills website or Mikey's Fan Favorites Web Guide or someplace...or even a spam site). OR is not lack of sources. OR is OR, and lack of sources is lack of sources. Instead of spending&#160;:30 to go on the web to research "Oh yes, it's real, so we should KEEP this article that says 'Timmy is a cricket player'," let's spend that time getting educated and evaluating sanely and carefully the inherently POV and blind reviews. Let's, while we're at it, not go around fact tagging articles that say what is found in <i>every</i> reference. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(One of Slim's nuggets.) Of course, what happens in practice is indeed more important than what the pages say; policy should reflect <i>best</i> practice, not general practice. Over the now nearly six months of debate re WP:ATT, putting to rest the descriptivist argument ("well hey, people already cite Usenet, so why shouldn't policy let us cite Usenet?") was one of the hardest parts. At one point, people were considering writing a weakened exception for pop culture articles into the policy...*shudders*. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>in my earliest wiki-days way back in May 2004 (a life-time ago) I used to write a quick page to fill a red link and never add references (it was not required) unless it was what I think of as a "proper page" - and I still stand by every word I've ever written, and if I could remember all the pages could easily find references to support them. However, I expect somewhere in all those pages I have given the odd architect the wrong Christian name, or have a date a couple of years out. I do not think those pages should be deleted - but I know what I am talking about (<small>said modestly</small>) a lot of editors here do not; and that is a problem. I hesitate to disagree with Geogre but I can see where "World" is coming from on this one. <b>BUT</b> let us be quite clear I do <b>NOT</b> think every verb needs to be linked directly to a page number - because that is meaningless. I frequently (Hannah springs to mind) use reference books that were printed 80 or 90 years ago in very small numbers - how easy would it be to cite "Crewe Vol III p 245" who could hope to check it - without the help of a very flexible credit card? (Incidentally there were only two volumes of that work) - so my point is there always has to be an element of trust, which is the reason I was so angry about the "Essjay affair" - otherwise we are going to have to say if a reference book is not currently in <a href="../../../w/_/h/W_H_Smith_c9b8.html" title="W H Smith">W H Smith</a> it is ineligible for citing on wikipedia. I don't know the answer - and if I do, I don't like it because it will spell the end of wikipedia being the&#160;!encyclopedia anyone can edit".

<dd>(butting in uninvited...) Giano, I completely agree, and your experience mirrors mine exactly. Indeed it looks like we joined around the same time (me in April), and my earlier articles are still unreferenced, though I stand by every word, most of which is pulled from books in my library which I accumulated while getting my (verifiable!!!) doctorate. I don't quite know where to jump in on the ATT discussion. Bishonen, is your experience similar? A lot of us did a lot of writing three years ago which is still quite good, should not be deleted, and will be tedious to reference ... but I'm going to start doing it soon.

<dd>As far as Worldtraveller's User page goes, I'd sum it up as an idea to light an enormous fire under Wikipedia's ass. I appreciate the sentiment, even if I disagree with the specifics. Regarding Giano's sentence on trust: here I agree fully. There's an enormous element of trust in other users required to judge an article under review (at AfD or FAC or whatever). I don't think it healthy or unhealthy—it's inevitable, and I see it as one element of <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RewardReputation" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RewardReputation" rel="nofollow">RewardReputation</a> that the project requires. But it's fraught with a lot of difficulty given the nature of Wikipedia and it's emphasis on "anyone." Essjay is the obvious example, but you can find a smaller example everyday. Antandrus has a "verifiable" doctorate. Well, I don't know that. I don't know who Antrandrus is. S/he doesn't know who I am. (Not to be picky Antandrus, just using an example in front of me&#160;:). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:51, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My view is that <b>all</b> pages should have a list of references which will verify the facts on the page. If a fact is contraversial, outlandish or a very new theory then a specific cite to its source should be made. The Pope is a Roman Catholic; William I fought at Hastings in 1066 and Palladio was an unfluential architect do not need to be specifically cited, just a book which agrees with those facts mentioned in a reference section at the foot of the page is sufficient. Credentials for the anonymous are meaningless so lets not have them at all. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 22:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good point about the books, Giano. (Some ways up. As usual, everybody and their aunt has already posted by the time I've written some reply to somebody, in this case principally to <b>Antandrus</b>.) Some of the people advocating coverall inline citing seem to assume that that would mean any editor will then be able to check any fact with a mouseclick. I don't have any sources as exclusive as yours, but you may remember I've written <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897_30ad.html" title="S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897">an FA</a> which is principally verified through <i>books</i> written in <i><a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_language.html" title="Swedish language">a language spoken by 9 million people</a></i>. That page contains quite a few counter-intuitive and surprising facts. They're cited, yes, but, in practice, nearly all readers are going to have to take what I say on trust anyway. And that's <i>with</i> me following all the rules. Anyway, no, I don't think I'll weigh in, Antandrus. I'm too slow and laborious a writer to do any good in a big free-for-all. It really bugs me when I spend half a day penning (keyboarding) a paragraph, and 15 minutes after I post it, somebody like geogre replies with two screens of much more cogent arguments... grrrrr... ROARRR... where Tokyo!? ... sorry, where was I? I appreciate Marskell turning up to sing a siren song [/me ties self securely to mast], but I'm trying to write a sandbox article here, and there are enough interruptions without diving into the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Community_discussion_ecd9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion</a>. Not planning to FAC it, no... I'm tired of FAC. It's not so much verifiability issues in my case, as the tone on FAC altogether. (One reviewer, when I took issue with what seemed outright hostility, assured me that it was nothing personal, simply the FAC culture nowadays!) And the joys of "having" a FA — in the sense of being scolded for laziness if you don't "maintain" it, and scolded for "ownership" if you do — are definitely overrated anyway. Being the main contributor to an actually controversial article, which mine are not, must be far worse in this regard, too — it's got to be "You don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> it, you know!" and "The main contributor hasn't bothered to maintain it!" all day long. Altogether, writing FAs can too easily turn you into a common criminal in the eyes of others. How many times has Giano, who never even mentions his massive FA contributions, been told that he expects, nay, demands, a "free pass" (pah!) because of them? Nice little wrinkle, that, don't you think? Anyway, an article's an article, with or without the star. If it's good, it's a good contribution to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 22:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Could not agree more, at the end of the day, a FA is only a FA because a load of people (many of whom never write a FA) say it can be, likewise it can be FARCd because the same people say it can't. I an tired of aruging with these people let them run the FA side of things if they want to. At the end of the day anything on Wikipedia that is good is good and anything less is usually appalling. Like many people I can recognise the good pages without having to look for a silly little star - so who needs FAs? <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_II_8fcc.html" title="User:Giano II">Giano</a> 22:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If, as we recognize, it's all a matter of trust anyway (and it is), and if a number of us from the old days routinely wrote true and good articles and didn't try to thumb through the books we've read to cite them, then we're up against the fundamental bullflop of it all. The people waving the flag of "verifiable or die" don't know the subjects and so cannot understand when a thing needs verification and when it doesn't. An article on a massively well understood subject like <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot.html" title="Plot">plot</a> would be stupid to cite, unless it is reporting a fringe understanding or the historical development. Every reference in the world will say that it is the connection of actions in a narrative. Every reference in the world will say that it is a structural element of narration. However, people who have never read a single reference in the world will ask for a citation, and in the process they might miss it when the author goes off on a Roland Barthes 1956 <i>Structures of the Short Story</i> jag -- which should be cited, as it is a part of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structuralism.html" title="Structuralism">Structuralism</a>. My point is that if it's just "they say you can, so you can," "they" need to be worthy. If they're not, they'll demand when they should be quiet and be quiet when they should demand. They'll miss the made up print reference. They'll have no sense of what is credible and what is not. When brand new information gets written, our New Page patrollers sniff the air. "Jimmy is a successful businessman" can be speedily deleted or not based on how likely, how credible it is, not whether Jimmy's fan put in a citation or not. If the patroller is uncertain, he goes to Google. The point is that every part of Wikipedia works by credibility, interrogation, and trust in tension, and it depends upon a dynamic balance between them. It only works with <i>educated</i> judges, though, whose education is up to the matter being reviewed. If that's Jimmy's business, the level of education necessary for a valid judgment is one place, and if it's Hollaback Girl's prescience, it's somewhere else, and if it's an FA on Heisenberg, it's another place again. No one minds, so long as they feel that the readers have sound judgment to tell good from bad. I have no confidence in those judges most active at FA right now to know good from bad academic material, as they have <i>demonstrated</i> ignorance of language and content. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How is that useful? How useful is it for one encyclopedia to refer to another? Why not just use flippin' Google Books, if that's your goal? How many citations do we need for 1492 sailing the ocean blue? People need to read and consider the things where a citation is actually <i>needed</i> as opposed to where a tag could go. By throwing these things around like popcorn in the theater, we make the tag meaningless and leave ourselves with nothing to reach for when an article is actually making controversial and outlandish claims. I do Random Page all day. I see idiot articles about Mikey Greatest of All Kids and it has a "cite" tag on it. That should be a speedy delete (A7), but it has the "cite" tag. So, is the need for citations on that the same as the need for citations on <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Shiloh_088c.html" title="Battle of Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>?

<dd>Because those articles are more thorough than ours is, so someone who wants more information now has a specific place to go. "Go crack the spine of a book" is not very specific. I reached over and cracked the spine of a book just now, and didn't find anything at all about this war, it's hardly WWII. I needed to be guided to the right book. Those articles have actual bibliographies, which, again, ours doesn't. I can't just copy and paste the bibliographies out of them, because I haven't read those books, but I can refer to it indirectly this way, because I have read the articles. Eventually our article will include all the information in those articles, including bibliographies. Until it does, I humbly propose these links are useful, and I'm not saying anything about Mikey or 1492.--<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:32, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, there has been a real <i>zeal</i> to put "cite" and "pov" tags on things. I saw a saint article that had a "this is not written with a neutral point of view" tag on it. Well, um, it <b>is</b> hagiography. The moment you have a hagiography, you kind of have a POV inherent in the job title. Then big obvious bits of history are getting "cite your sources" on them.

<dd>Sorry, Bo, I'm just rushing off to catch my train and will be away from the computer all day. I'll take a look tonight, unless somebody else has taken care of it by then.

<dd>Oh, I see that was a short-term vandalism-only account, no reason to muck about with those. Indefinitely blocked.

<p>Did you notice that it's the anniversary of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Sweden_6c26.html" title="New Sweden">New Sweden</a> -- the first Swedish settlement in the US, 1637? The articles alright, but that <i>second map</i> has me somewhat appalled. I can't let young viewers see it, as it looks like the Dutch were <i>very happy to see U.S.</i> so to speak.

<dd>You can always modify it, but you know, it is a north-south river and they probably only claimed land to a certain extent on either side.
