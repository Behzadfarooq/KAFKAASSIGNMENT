<p>The diocese of <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orl%C3%A9ans.html" title="Orléans">Orléans</a> (<i>Aurelianum</i> in Latin) comprises the <a href="../../../d/%C3%A9/p/D%C3%A9partment_of_Loiret_3e71.html" title="Départment of Loiret">Départment of Loiret</a>, and was <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragan.html" title="Suffragan">suffragan</a> of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishopric_of_Paris_36e1.html" title="Archbishopric of Paris">archbishopric of Paris</a> since 1622, previously of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishopric_of_Sens_471d.html" title="Archbishopric of Sens">archbishopric of Sens</a>. From 1966 until 2001 it was under the jurisdiction of Bourges but since the provisional reorganisation of French ecclesiastical provinces it is now subject to Tours. After the Revolution it was re-established by the Concordat of 1802, when it included the Departments of <a href="../../../l/o/i/Loiret.html" title="Loiret">Loiret</a> and Loir et Cher, but in 1822 Loir et Cher was included in the new Diocese of Blois.</p>

<p>Of the eighth-century bishops, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodulfus.html" title="Theodulfus">Theodulfus</a> was notable. It is not known when he began to govern, but it is certain that he was already bishop in 798, when <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> sent him into <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonne.html" title="Narbonne">Narbonne</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provence.html" title="Provence">Provence</a> as <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missus_dominicus.html" title="Missus dominicus">missus dominicus</a>. Under king <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_le_D%C3%A9bonnaire_52cb.html" title="Louis le Débonnaire">Louis le Débonnaire</a> he was accused of aiding the rebellious King of Italy, was deposed and imprisoned four years in a monastery at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angers.html" title="Angers">Angers</a>, but was released when Louis came to Angers in 821. The "Capitularies" which Theodulfus addressed to the clergy of Orléans are considered a most important monument of Catholic tradition on the duties of priests and the faithful. His <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual.html" title="Ritual">Ritual</a>, his <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penitential.html" title="Penitential">Penitential</a>, his treatise on <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a>, confirmation and the Eucharist, his edition of the Bible, a work of fine penmanship preserved in the Puy cathedral, reveal him as one of the foremost men of his time<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. His fame rests chiefly on his devotion to the spread of learning. The Abbey of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferri%C3%A8res.html" title="Ferrières">Ferrières</a> was then becoming under <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcuin.html" title="Alcuin">Alcuin</a> a centre of learning. Theodulfus opened the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbey_of_Fleury_d267.html" title="Abbey of Fleury">Abbey of Fleury</a> to the young noblemen sent thither by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne.html" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, invited the clergy to establish free schools in the country districts, and quoted for them, "These that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and they that instruct many to justice, as stars to all eternity" (Dan., xii 3). One monument of his time still survives in the diocese, the apse of the church of Germigny modelled after the imperial chapel, and yet retaining its unique mosaic decoration.</p>

<p>To Gerbert, Abbot of St. Pierre le Vif at Sens (1046-79), is due a detailed narrative according to which Saint Savinianus and Saint Potentianus were sent to Sens by St. Peter with St. Altirius; the latter, it was said, came to Orléans as its first bishop. Before the ninth century there is no historical trace in the diocese of Sens of this Apostolic mission of St. Altinus, nor in the diocese of Orléans before the end of the fifteenth. Diclopitus is the first authentic bishop; he figures among the bishops of Gaul who (about 344) ratified the absolution of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Athanasius_7068.html" title="St. Athanasius">St. Athanasius</a>. Other bishops of the early period are: St. Euvertius (who features in the Calendar of the Book of Common Prayer), about 355 to 385, according to M. Cuissard; St. Aignan (Anianus) (385-453), who invoked the aid of the "patrician" Ætius against the invasion of Attila, and forced the Huns to raise the siege of Orléans; St. Prosper (453-63); St. Monitor (about 472); St. Flou (Flosculus), died in 490; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Eucherius_a8cf.html" title="St. Eucherius">St. Eucherius</a> (717-43), native of Orléans and a monk of <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumi%C3%A8ges.html" title="Jumièges">Jumièges</a>, who protested against the depredations of Waifre, a companion of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Martel_3f32.html" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a>, and was first exiled by this prince to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, then to <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge.html" title="Liège">Liège</a>, and died at the monastery of St. Trond.</p>

After his victory over the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alamanni.html" title="Alamanni">Alamanni</a>, the Frankish king <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis.html" title="Clovis">Clovis</a> was bent on the sack of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdun.html" title="Verdun">Verdun</a>, but the archpriest there obtained mercy for his fellow-citizens. To <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Euspicius_53f5.html" title="St. Euspicius">St. Euspicius</a> and his nephew <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Mesmin_a65f.html" title="St. Mesmin">St. Mesmin</a> (Maximinus), Clovis also gave the domain of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micy.html" title="Micy">Micy</a>, near Orléans at the confluence of the Loire and the Loiret, for a monastery (508). When Euspicius died, the said <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Maximinus_6f96.html" title="St. Maximinus">St. Maximinus</a> became abbot, and during his rule the religious life flourished there notably. The monks of Micy contributed much to the civilization of the Orléans region; they cleared and drained the lands and taught the semi-barbarous inhabitants the worth and dignity of agricultural work. Early in the eighth century, Theodulfus restored the Abbey of Micy and at his request <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Benedict_of_Aniane_1f1b.html" title="St. Benedict of Aniane">St. Benedict of Aniane</a> sent fourteen monks and visited the abbey himself. The last abbot of Micy, Chapt de Rastignac, was one of the victims of the 1792 "September Massacres", at Paris, in the prison of L'Abbaye.</p>
<p>From Micy monastery, which counted many saints, monastic life spread within and around the diocese. St. Liphardus and St. Urbicius founded the Abbey of <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meung-sur-Loire_7bb6.html" title="Meung-sur-Loire">Meung-sur-Loire</a>; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Ly%C3%A9_cbb6.html" title="St. Lyé">St. Lyé</a> (Lætus) died a recluse in the forest of Orléans; St. Viatre (Viator) in <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sologne.html" title="Sologne">Sologne</a>; St. Doulchard in the forest of Ambly near Bourges. <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Leonard_21f7.html" title="St. Leonard">St. Leonard</a> introduced the monastic life into the territory of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limoges.html" title="Limoges">Limoges</a>; St. Almir,St. Ulphacius, and St. Bomer in the vicinity of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montmirail.html" title="Montmirail">Montmirail</a>; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Avitus_e972.html" title="St. Avitus">St. Avitus</a> (died about 527) in the district of Chartres; St. Calais (died before 536) and St. Leonard of Vendœuvre (died about 570) in the valley of the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarthe.html" title="Sarthe">Sarthe</a>; St. Fraimbault and <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Constantine_4079.html" title="St. Constantine">St. Constantine</a> in the Javron forest, and the aforesaid St. Bomer (died about 560) in the Passais near <a href="../../../l/a/v/Laval.html" title="Laval">Laval</a>; St. Leonard of Dunois; St. Alva and St. Ernier in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perche.html" title="Perche">Perche</a>; St. Laumer (died about 590) became Abbot of Corbion. St. Lubin (Leobinus), a monk of Micy, became Bishop of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chartres.html" title="Chartres">Chartres</a> from 544-56. Finally saint Ay (Agilus), Viscount of Orléans (died after 587), was also a a protector of Micy.</p>
<p>Among the notable saints of the diocese are: St. Baudilus, a Nîmes martyr (third or fourth century); the deacon St. Lucanus, martyr, patron of Loigny (fifth century); the anchorite <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Donatus_32b4.html" title="St. Donatus">St. Donatus</a> (fifth century); St. May, abbot of Val Benoît (fifth century); St. Mesme, virgin and (perhaps) martyr, sister of St. Mesmin (sixth century); St. Felicule, patroness of Gien (sixth century); <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Sigismund_7709.html" title="St. Sigismund">St. Sigismund</a>,<a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Burgundy_0714.html" title="King of Burgundy">King of Burgundy</a>, who, by order of the Merovingian <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clodomir.html" title="Clodomir">Clodomir</a>, and despite the entreaties of St. Avitus, was thrown (524) into a well with his wife and children; St. Gontran, King of Orléans and Burgundy (561-93), a confessor; St. Loup (Lupus), Archbishop of Sens, born near Orléans, and his mother St. Agia (first half of the seventh century); <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Gregory_f417.html" title="St. Gregory">St. Gregory</a>, former Bishop of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicopolis.html" title="Nicopolis">Nicopolis</a>, in Bulgaria, who died a recluse at <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pithiviers.html" title="Pithiviers">Pithiviers</a> (1004 or 1007); <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Rose_160e.html" title="St. Rose">St. Rose</a>, Abbess of Ervauville (died 1130); Blessed Odo of Orléans, Bishop of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambrai.html" title="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> (1105-13); the leper St. Alpaix, died in 1211 at <a href="../../../c/u/d/Cudot.html" title="Cudot">Cudot</a> where she was visited by queen <a href="../../../a/d/%C3%A8/Ad%C3%A8le_of_Champagne_cca8.html" title="Adèle of Champagne">Adèle of Champagne</a>, widow of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_VII_of_France_6da2.html" title="Louis VII of France">Louis VII</a>; St. Guillaume (died 1209), Abbot of Fontainejean and subsequently Archbishop of Bourges; the Dominican Blessed Reginald, dean of the collegiate church of St. Aignan, Orléans (died 1220); the Englishman <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Richard_e393.html" title="St. Richard">St. Richard</a>, who studied theology at Orléans in 1236, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Chichester_8d14.html" title="Bishop of Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a> in 1244, a friend of St. Edmund of Canterbury; <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Maurus_b9fa.html" title="St. Maurus">St. Maurus</a>, called to France by St. Innocent, Bishop of Mans, and sent thither by St. Benedict, resided at Orléans with four companions in 542.

Venerable Mother Françoise de la Croix (1591-1657), a pupil of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Vincent_de_Paul_0c69.html" title="St. Vincent de Paul">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, who founded the congregation of Augustinian Sisters of Charity of Notre Dame, was born at Petay in the diocese. The Miramion family, to which Marie Bonneau is celebrated in the annals of charity under the name of Mme de Miramion (1629-96), belonged by marriage, were from Orléans. St. Jane de Chantal was superior of the Orléans convent of the Visitation in 1627. Mme Guyon, celebrated in the annals of <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quietism.html" title="Quietism">Quietism</a>, was born at Montargis in 1648.</p>
<p>France was saved from English domination through the deliverance of Orléans by <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> (8 May, 1429). On 21 July, 1455, her rehabilitation was publicly proclaimed at Orléans in a solemn procession, and before her death in November 1458, Isabel Romée, the mother of Joan of Arc, saw a monument erected in honour of her daughter, at Tournelles, near the Orléans bridge. The monument, destroyed by the Huguenots in 1567, was set up again in 1569 when the Catholics were once more masters of the city. Until 1792, and again from 1802 to 1830, finally from 1842 to the present day, a great religious feast, celebrated <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">8 May</a> of every year at Orléans in honour of Joan of Arc, attracted multitudes.</p>
<p>The Church of Orléans was the last in France to take up again the Roman liturgy (1874). The Sainte Croix cathedral, perhaps built and consecrated by St. Euvertius in the fourth century, was destroyed by fire in 999 and rebuilt from 1278 to 1329; the Protestants pillaged and destroyed it from 1562 to 1567; the Bourbon kings restored it in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The principal pilgrimages of the diocese are: Our Lady of Bethlehem, at <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferri%C3%A8res.html" title="Ferrières">Ferrières</a>; Our Lady of Miracles in Orléans city, dating back to the seventh century (Joan of Arc visited the sanctuary on 8 May, 1429); Our Lady of Cléry, dating from the thirteenth century, visited by kings Philip the Fair, Philip VI, and especially by Louis XI, who wore in his hat a leaden image of <i>Notre Dame de Cléry</i> and who wished to have his tomb in this sanctuary where <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunois.html" title="Dunois">Dunois</a>, one of the heroes of the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years%27_war_484c.html" title="Hundred Years' war">Hundred Years' war</a>, was also interred.</p>

<p>Prior to the Associations Law of 1901, the Diocese of Orléans counted <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscans.html" title="Franciscans">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictines.html" title="Benedictines">Benedictines</a>, Missionary Priests of the Society of Mary, <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarists.html" title="Lazarists">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionaries_of_the_Sacred_Heart_542d.html" title="Missionaries of the Sacred Heart">Missionaries of the Sacred Heart</a> and several orders of teaching Brothers. Among the congregations of women which originated in this diocese must be mentioned: the Calvary Benedictines, a teaching and nursing order founded in 1617 by Princess Antoinette d'Orléans-Longueville, and the Capuchin Leclerc du Tremblay known as Père Joseph; the Sisters of St. Aignan, a teaching order founded in 1853 by Bishop Dupanloup, with mother-house in Orléans.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century the religious congregations of this diocese conducted: 1 crèche; 77 infant schools; 2 institutions for the deaf and dumb; 10 orphanages; 2 houses for penitent women, 12 religious houses for the care of the sick in their own homes; 2 houses of retreat; 27 hospitals or asylums; 1 poor house. In 1905 (last year of the Concordat) the diocese had 371,019 inhabitants; 41 pastorates; 293 succursal parishes; 23 vicariates subventioned by the State.</p>
<p>Twentieth-century bishops of Orleans included Guy Riobé, whose opposition to nuclear weapons led to an altercation with a member of George Pompidou's government, and his successor, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Marie_Lustiger_88c0.html" title="Jean-Marie Lustiger">Jean-Marie Lustiger</a>, who was appointed in 1979 after a long interregnum and shortly afterwards translated to Paris.</p>
