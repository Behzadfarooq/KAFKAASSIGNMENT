<p>Indeed. At present a lk to <a href="../../../b/i/s/Biscuit.html" title="Biscuit">biscuit</a> offers no hint of whether the flour-based food item is relatively thin, brittle, and sweet (a biscuit in UK but a cookie to Yanks), or relatively thick, tearable, and bland (a biscuit in America -- but BTW, what in UK?).<br />
_ _ IMO the proposal is a <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-brainer.html" title="No-brainer">no-brainer</a>, i.e., requires no significant thot before enthusiastic approval.<br />
_ _ How about English biscuit and American biscuit, since the non-parenthesized approaches to Dab'g are preferred?<br />

There is an article <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracker_%28biscuit%29.html" title="Cracker (biscuit)">Cracker (biscuit)</a>. Basically my position is that there should be one article each for: (a) what USies call cookie and UKies call biscuit, (b) what USies call cracker and UKies call&#160;?, (c) what USies call biscuit [and they should be savory not bland] and UKies call&#160;? I wonder if the article on British and American English differences has some hints as most of these articles probably already exist under one title if not the other.

<p><b>Comment</b>: The sections aren't big enough to stand alone at present, in my opinion. But I'd support the split if there were more content that could be added to each (I'm thinking lists or something would be possible). Not into 'English biscuit' and 'American biscuit' though; possibly 'Biscuit (US English)' and 'Biscuit (Commonwealth English)', or <a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a>'s three-way split. (Incidentally, I'm not sure how closely the rest of the Commonwealth matches Australian usage, but Aussies call both 'cookies' and 'crackers' biscuits; cookie, cracker, shortbread, crispbread, and others are seen as somewhat uncommon and technical terms to distinguish them. I'm not sure we have anything closer to US biscuits than <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scone.html" title="Scone">scones</a>.) -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 09:10, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why, pray tell, are biscuits in the American section referenced to fast food? What, was this written by a Brit or Aussie? Most Americans do not live their lives going from one fast food place to another. Lemonade is frequently featured at fast food places. But you don't define lemonade in reference to fast food. Such a reference is oddly placed indeed.</p>

<p>Water biscuits are surely crackers thinly veiled as biscuits, to gain the heightened exposure they enjoy &amp; broken biscuits are more of an assortment of biscuits than a variety- why are they listed here? (Paulo Fontaine 20:06, 26 January 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>People in the UK eat American biscuits all the time--they call them <b>Scones</b>. The only difference is that they make them a little on the sweet side. (Of course, they make their "crackers" a little sweet, too!) There's a picture of American biscuits on the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scone_%28bread%29.html" title="Scone (bread)">Scone (bread)</a> page. (It's from the US Dept of Agriculture.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Never had/seen an American biscuit, but i think Scones are different to your biscuits in some way. As pointed out in the article, they're "doughier". Scones are sometimes sweetened, especially when they have fruit in or eaten with jam and cream, but you can also get cheese ones.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Lobster_815f.html" title="Red Lobster">Red Lobster</a>, the largest chain of seafood restaurants in the US, puts a basket of CHEESE biscuits (scones) on the table as an appetizer (starter). Scones and biscuits are definitely the same animal. I'm from the Southern US, home of the biscuits. Had biscuits yesterday, just got through eating what's known as a scone here, and have had scones (and biscuits (cookies) in London. There may be variations of biscuits (scones) in the US that don't exisit in scones in the UK and vice versa but the area of commonality is much larger.</p>
<p>The biggest differences are 1)sometimes scones are made as a large piece of bread and then sliced like a pie into triangles and 2) scones are normally eaten for tea/snacks and would not accompany a meal where US biscuits are more frequently eaten as part of a meal.</p>
<p>I think everyone would be convinced if they looked up recipes for scones and US biscuits on the internet and looked at the ingredients. They are both "quick breads" made with dough instead of batter. I like to eat pizza for breakfast, too, but that doesn't mean it's not pizza, even if I gave it another name. See <a href="http://southernfood.about.com/od/biscuitrecipes/" class="external autonumber" title="http://southernfood.about.com/od/biscuitrecipes/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for a variety of US biscuit recipes, sweet and savory, and <a href="http://coffeetea.about.com/od/scones/" class="external autonumber" title="http://coffeetea.about.com/od/scones/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for a variety of UK scone recipes, sweet and savory.69.22.239.42 15:40, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think scones are distinctly English, as we traditionally have them with a cup of tea, and they're often found in tea shops; definitely not "found as a side dish at fried chicken restaurants".

<p>This probably shouldnt go here, but what the hell. Who else thinks that the biscuit articles on Wikipedia need serious work? I'm talking about the English meaning of Biscuit, as in <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digestive_biscuit.html" title="Digestive biscuit">Digestives</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobnobs.html" title="Hobnobs">Hobnobs</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice_%28biscuit%29.html" title="Nice (biscuit)">Nice</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malted_milk_%28biscuit%29.html" title="Malted milk (biscuit)">Malted milks</a>.

<p>I made an easy first step towards this by moving Cracker (biscuit) to Cracker (food) and changed links to it as well as creating a Cracker (disambiguation) page redirecting to Cracker. Apparently the meaning of Cracker related to computers is extremely popular these days.</p>
<p>Since CE "biscuit" consists of AE "cookies" and "crackers" it would seem best to use "cookie" and "cracker" instead of "biscuit". This would be controversial.</p>
<p>It would also leave the problem of AE "biscuit". It would be less trouble to leave AE "biscuit" and CE "scone" separate but to cross-reference.</p>
<p>Suggestions on what to do next? <a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 17:37, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is interesting. Muffin and cupcake are problematic even without the language issue. <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=31051" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=31051" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 03:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I plunged in and did it since everyone seemed to agree on the basic plan.</p>
<p>There are disambiguation pages for Cracker and Biscuit. There is a Biscuit page that has a little on English biscuits and referrs to Cookie plus a good bit on American biscuits. This functions both as an edible Biscuit disambig page as well as the primary article on American biscuits. There is the Cookie page with a bit moved over about English biscuits (cookies).</p>
<p>There are at least 15 times as many references to edible cookies (subtracting computer cookies) on Google as there are to biscuits of all types and nationalities put together. According to Wikipedia naming protocols, that's what the Cookie article should be called.</p>
<p>I hope everyone can understand the articles and that no one feels slighted. <a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 06:12, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes Voortle. what is that line about? most likely a bit of playful vandalism - either that or an oblique reference to "Nice" biscuits (for american readers, a thin delicate sugar covered type of biscuit in the UK, pronounced 'neece' as in the french city)</p>

<p>The idea that Nabisco's name is somehow ironic seems to be based on the false idea that all American biscuits are soft, scone-type things. Not so. Lots of old cookie companies had the word "biscuit" in their names. There are plenty of instances of using "biscuit" to refer to crispy things, like Sunshine's "Uneeda biscuit" and Nabisco's "Chicken in a Biskit". We don't get confused just because they're called biscuits. There are also dog biscuits, which are incredibly hard (in fact, the soft ones are usually called "treats", rather than biscuits). Nabisco having the word "biscuit" in its name isn't any stranger than AT&amp;T having the word "telegraph" in its name, or the grocery chain A&amp;P still using the full name of "Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company". The idea of using "biscuit" for something like a cracker or a cookie isn't so unusual in America. It's just old-fashioned. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 16:42, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't disagree with you on the old-fashioned usage, but I always assumed "Chicken in a Biskit" was so named because it was suppose to taste like chicken and biscuits in the more modern sense of the word. (Really it tastes more like chicken boullion and grease, of course).Neilmsheldon 17:11, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uhh, I am rather certain that everyone is aware of that. It's ironic because an American company has a word with its British meaning in the name due to a change in meaning. That in a few cases the original meaning has been maintained in contrast to the general consensus is an exception, and exceptions don't disprove the rule. The rule is that biscuits are now called cookies, and thus the North American Biscuit Company sells cookies rather than biscuits. That one of their crackers is called "Biskit" doesn't change the fact that it's not a biscuit accoding to American useage of the word. 82.135.86.52 17:34, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed this restaurant from a list of 'fried chicken' restaurants that serve biscuits. CfA is known for chicken fillet sandwiches, and isn't technically the same as a fried chicken restaurant: it doesn't follow the same model as the other restaurants listed (specializing in serving quantities of whole fried chicken with optional side dishes).

<dd>The only difference is the bones. None of them leave bones in the chicken when they serve it in a biscuit. -<a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> 21:27, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
