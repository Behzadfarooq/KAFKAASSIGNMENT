<hr width="200" />
<p>I was born March 3, 1969, in Washington, D.C. to a mother from <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and a father from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>I spent my first seventeen years growing up in suburban <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> (on the southeast side of D.C.); first in Oxon Hill, and later in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf%2C_Maryland_f700.html" title="Waldorf, Maryland">Waldorf</a>. The only really unusual part of my childhood was the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> influence -- my mother's parents (and sometimes other relatives) visited about every other year for several months, and in the intervening years we would spend the summers in Germany.</p>
<p>Another strong influence was the presence of plenty of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teachers.html" title="Teachers">teachers</a> in my family, who were an encouragement to a lifelong love of learning and knowledge. Just looking two generations back in my family tree, there are six teachers amongst my relatives. From my youngest days, I always wanted to learn as much as I could about as many different topics as possible.</p>
<p>The other strong factor in my early years was exposure to, and an affinity for, computers. My father worked on them for IBM before becoming a teacher, and my mother studied computer programming and still works in Information Systems for the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Navy_8201.html" title="US Navy">US Navy</a>. I started programming on the <a href="../../../t/r/s/TRS-80_94b4.html" title="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> myself at age 12, moving up to the Apple II+ and eventually the <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_PC_7073.html" title="IBM PC">IBM PC</a> when I got to college. In college I began my exposure to [Unix] (primarily [AIX]), which has remained my OS of choice to this day.</p>
<p>At 17 I made the trip to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacksburg%2C_Virginia_4987.html" title="Blacksburg, Virginia">Blacksburg, Virginia</a> to attend <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_d1db.html" title="Virginia Tech">Virginia Tech</a>. This is where I would spend the next seven years, excepting a couple of summers, and one year of an internship with the US Navy. Some of my lasting friendships have come out of my time in Blacksburg, although by 1993 I was ready to leave, despite having not finished my degree. I headed back home to Maryland.</p>
<p>I began working at a small startup software company in suburban Maryland as a computer programmer, although much of my time was spent at one customer site in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. After two years, I was fed up with the way the company was being run, and was hired at a larger company in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> as a Unix System Administrator. When my contract with this company ran out in September of 1996, I didn't know just what major changes were coming up for me.</p>
<hr width="150" />
<p>In October of 1996 I attended the LISA conference in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>. At the end of the week, instead of flying home, I flew on to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>, intending to vacation in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> for a week. I visited with friends in S.F., and saw the city; after a few days I took the rental car and started driving down the coast for Los Angeles. I had arranged to meet my college friend Ken in L.A. for the rest of the week, after which we both would fly back home to Virginia.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles I not only vacationed with Ken, but also met some great locals. In Virginia I had become a fan of the online "soap opera" web site called <u><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Spot_15a4.html" title="The Spot">The Spot</a></u>. In L.A. I had the chance to meet up with the creators and actors of the site, some of which I still stay in touch with. I also became very close friends with Ken's online friend Stephanie, which inspired my next big jump.</p>
<p>When I got back to Virginia I stayed in touch with Stephanie and with <u>The Spot</u>'s creators. After three weeks I realised I had no job in Virginia, and no wife or girlfriend -- so I took the plunge. I packed a bunch of stuff into my car and drove cross-country, arriving back in L.A. on October 31, 1996. After a few days of just enjoying myself (and reconnecting in person with the people I'd been talking to online and by phone), I settled down in a hotel room to the serious task of hunting for a job.</p>
<p>I headed back home for Thanksgiving and for Christmas, but soon after my return on New Years' Eve I ended up with a contract to work on the web and mail services team for <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota.html" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> Motor Sales. I got a small apartment and started moving some of my important gear out to California, settling in and enjoying the beautiful weather and relaxing lifestyle near the beach. Stephanie and I stayed very close, and she was a great help in getting me acclimated.</p>
<p>After two and a half years, my time at Toyota came to an end. I started working for <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprint_PCS_ea02.html" title="Sprint PCS">Sprint PCS</a>, which was a longer commute, but allowed me to expand my skill set and meet new people in a different part of Southern California. Halfway through my time at Sprint, I moved to a small town about thirty miles north of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego%2C_California_4c0a.html" title="San Diego, California">San Diego</a>. It was a further commute, but I could take the train most of the way. I also began biking from the train station to my office, totalling 20 miles a day. I lost weight and felt much better!</p>
<p>I also began studying <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a> and spending time in <a href="../../../t/i/j/Tijuana.html" title="Tijuana">Tijuana</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. For about nine months recently I had a Mexican girlfriend from <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampico.html" title="Tampico">Tampico</a> who was living in TJ.</p>
<p>In January of 2003 Sprint finalised a merger of my office with a similar one in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_7148.html" title="Kansas City">Kansas City</a>. I was offered a position in KC, but decided to turn it down. I enjoy living in California too much to head someplace where there's ice and snow and rain.</p>
<p>Later in 2003 I started work at a major defense contractor, doing Unix System Administration for a Navy project. I'm also attending school at night, and do photography on weekends.</p>
