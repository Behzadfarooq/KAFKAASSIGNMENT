<p>you wont notice it because pcpcpc has deleted it from its talk page, but i made a few polite suggestions a while back, and pcpcpc's response was just insulting.</p>

<hr />
<p>Philip, I came here to remind you of something, but since I see you on this page still taking offence at polite suggestions wherever they offer the slightest opening for it, it hardly seems worth it. Apparently you still regard yourself as a "newbie" deserving of extra special wikilove but with no reciprocal duties of courtesy. It was a strange concept to begin with—most new users don't seem to entertain it in that form—and it's stranger now.</p>
<p>Your claim to "doing other people's work for them", as you write above, is simply unreasonable, apart from being badtempered. Everybody's a volunteer on Wikipedia. It's not anybody's duty to do <b>any</b> work: not for instance to add cats, to create cats, or even to get it right when they try to do these things. (I get annoyed at malformed cat trees too, but I'm resigned to the fact that the logic of cats defeats some people). It's not your duty either, nobody's forcing you to, as far as I know: I'm sure you're doing excellent work, that it <b>is</b> a very valuable project for Wikipedia, but then who is Wikipedia? If you don't like the work, don't do it. You needn't bother to blacklist me, I won't trouble you again.--<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 00:27, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good. Please stick to that. If you had read the above you will see that I have also had some appreciation. I wonder how many people you have driven away from Wikipedia <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 00:29, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My heavens! What an insulting comment! Why do you need appreciation for the work you've done from other people? Don't you achieve satisfaction from the work you've accomplished? You should seek the true cause of happiness and satisfaction within yourself. There is no satisfaction from anger or blame, and that is no lie. --littlebuddha, 14 January, 05</dd>

<dd>I think he is without doubt the most arrogant "know all" I have encountered on Wikipedia.

<dd>Ooops. I felt I had made a couple of edits that might have been seen as rude towards him, and was pouring oil on troubled waters. I'm just an innocent at large, it seems. I'm also going through a period of disenchantment with the whole project at the moment, I'm afraid, and am considering taking another, more extended, break when I finish <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cantos_4610.html" title="The Cantos">The Cantos</a>.

<dd>Did I leave "X-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.21"...I'm sorry, I'm non-plussed. Did what I left display like that for you? Going back to the RfA page, reloading it, I still see what I meant to leave, but, uh, if your browser takes my sentence as code for "X-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.21" there's not exactly any point in repeating it here, I'll have to talk round it. You see support vote number 9? The user who signed it? I wrote "<b>Support</b>, [that user]'s point is enough for me." That's not what you see on your screen...? Really? Or, is it what you see, and you upbraid me for leaving a silly vote...&#160;? I went to IRC when I saw your message, hoping to find you there and clear it up, because I guess it can get pretty long-winded in talk page back-and-forth. However. Please tell me how my vote reads for you. I'm about to go to bed, I'm afraid, and long overdue (it's 3 AM in my timezone), but if you reply within 10 minutes, I'll see it. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 01:56, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hi Bishonen, you don't have to apologize to "butt in" - getting a message from a non-german wiki is still one of the nicest things which have happened to me within wikipedia. In regards to "Short view..." Andreas has looked it up in a very large german literature lexica (the famous "Kindlers Literaturlexikon") and there its called "A short view..." - we have therefore moved it to "A short...". Nevertheless, within the german wikipedia I think users will mainly find it through the linkages within other articles ... Still, since I have translated it, two users have (to my utterly surprise) already gave comments on it on the discussion side...which proves, that articles really do get read. STill, I will make use of the hints to even further link it ... BS Thurner Hof 19:48, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a really interesting article--very well researched and completely thought out. (Think if what you'd have charged if you had been commissioned to write it!)</p>
<p>If I were forced to name a part that I was not completely sure about, it would be the Dunce section--specifically, the excursus on Pope and the Dunciad. I know this is a key part or Cibber's interest, but the level of detail seems to go way up here, and we almost get more Pope that Cibber. Maybe this section could be organized as more of a narrative, which might highlight the back-and-forth between Pope and Cibber and help the reader to place all the details? Just a thought.</p>
<p>The only other tiny thing I noticed was the use of the present tense in the Autobiography section. It's a matter of personal taste, but I wonder if the gain in immediacy is worth the loss in uniformity.</p>
<p>But these are all very minor points. It's a great article. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRiis_d9fa.html" title="User:PRiis">PRiis</a> 23:25, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sympathetic to afu's difficulties. Or would be, if he could bear them with so much as a grain of good grace. But it simply cannot be an editors' task to educate people who insist writing on topics they do not understand, in a language they have difficulties expressing themselves in, in a community the rules, principles and conventions of which they have no interest in learning about. WP is not a free-as-in-beer university. If I decided to contribute to the Italian WP (a language I imagine I am about as fluent in as afu is in English), I should be careful to confine myself to Talk pages. I would not expect people to educate me in Italian, in the subject I choose to write about <i>and</i> in good manners, or I should rightly be shown the door. So, no, I am not sympathetic to afu's plight, really. If you are not qualified to contribute, you should recognize that, and contribute somewhere else.</p>

Those in the Turkish Suite were in fact designed by the reknowned avant guardist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_de_Sade_9100.html" title="Marquis de Sade">Don Alphonso</a>.

<dd>I think it important that we do explore and discuss the psychological aspects of this important subject, and peoples perceived ideals and reactions to it, so many people see it without realising that possibly that juxtaposition, often the first act of a 24 hour life segment, will effect the next 24 hour period of their life. I think we must discuss the the way that it affects subsequent decisions that we make. Speaking from personal experience if the facilitator has not been correctly primed my mood can experience a huge swing, especially as the act of seeking assistance from the enclosed situation can invite ridicule in the family and office environment. This can have a detremental effect on the psychological health of the individual. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> 08:52, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll thank you young Bishoperson not to ask personal questions about my age, or that of my poor sister Olga. Its about time you knew a lady's age is her own business, and when your surname's Dracula age enters a whole new sphere, I'm surprised with all you learning about books and plays you never knew that. Perhaps you ought to read a few instead of casting aspersions on my age. And as for poor Olga, was it her fault men found her attractive, it was only Felix Yusupov who could resist her, (and he used to borrow her clothes) She just didn't like to say no and offend them, that's the sort of person she was. It was because of her kindness and hospitality she was made a regimental mascot of five brigades. When she arrived here in the land of the free, she just wanted to day "howdy" and "pleased to see yer" is it her fault, the business she set up in her five back bedrooms was misconstrued by people who just did not know the meaning of the word hospitality. So lets have no more of your asperic questions please; and you be nice to ma boy, if he had not decided to waste his life, he would be striker for Inter Milano now or at least captain of Italy Di Drakula (Mrs)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>PS: and there was that trouble with Olga seeling alchahol to her clients, but that was for medicinal reviving purposes only, and how was she to know alchahol was banned in the 1920s. 10 minutes in private was all she needed to explain, and that Judge agreed completely, after that he smiled and walked with a limp for the rest of his life. That's the effect poor sainted Olga had on folks. So no more of your asperics please! D di D (Mrs)
<dl>
<dd>Thankyou for your message. I'm sure you mean well dear, but since poor dear late lamented Olga "passed over" I am the custodian of her memory and few remaining artefacts, she was always so misunderstood during her lifetime. She was a great and "close" friend of that nice <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Mr Mcarthy</a>, untill she gave him one chritmas, a toilet seat that played "The Red Flag" when lifted, poor man had no sense of humour.

<p>Bishonen, I'm sorry if I treated you like a vandal. This could not be further from the way that I think of you! I was having a shitty day yesterday, and I managed to piss off quite a few good contributors. Hence today I am mending fences. Sorry! I missed/forgot about the whole debate on the talk page. The thing about the talk page was that it was just that: talk. I'd like to humbly ask that you come back to help me with peer review, but this time would you be able to update the instructions?

<p>Thanks for the note about the peer review page. I do think it deserves a chance since it did go through the VfD process; I'll probably just wait for someone else to relist it. My first reaction when I happened across it was to keep it. But as I thought about my reasons and how I thought it should be improved and realized there was pretty much no chance of it ever becoming useful, and most likely harmful - misinformative and serving to perpetuate stereotypes rather than explain them. I think it's saying something that the people who are adding new stuff to it don't bother to link to them that have their own wiki entries, usually opting instead to put them in quotes, as if that provides some additional meaning. The issue of people adding entires for slurs and the like - I think that a redirect to 'ethnic stereotypes' would be better. I think the most important issue to come out of this is that the reasons to keep apply to the case of adding a Racial Stereotypes section on each ethnic page - after all why have a list of features of things yet not talk about those same features on pages that already exist for those things? --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 00:37, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Bish (if i may be so bold w/ yr name), nice to hear from you, and i apologize over my typical difficulty putting much specific content with people's names. I'd have to go back and hunt for that interaction, as i'm afraid it's gotten pretty murky in my mind. But your tone abt it and the emotional surround your name has for me suggests a trip down memory lane, via our respective archives, would be a good use of time for me sometime next week.<br />
While i try to be careful abt using technical psych terms like "paranoia" this casually, i do understand why you might apply that one here: i was, e.g., quite surprised to read</p>
<dl>
<dd>How are you proposing to damage my "future" here?</dd>
</dl>
<p>in response to my saying</p>
<dl>
<dd>...but IMO you have no future here unless you recognize you've made a beginner's error, and learn from the experience.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my mind that was advice about putting off colleagues, and eventually making enemies of them, which i'd have thought (if i'd felt the need to even consider that Philip wouldn't assume good intentions) he'd understand it as i intended. He especially should see the pertinence of that in light of his already having had some interactions here that he finds worth complaining about!<br />
I assume (at least generally, and of course perhaps inaccurately) that editor-focused-RfCs will be more specific than the general "interaction style" issue you refer to, so that the ed in question already has their course of remediation clearly laid out for them when the comments concur with the certifiers. Thus my comments would probably be directed as much at trying to clarify the up-side option as at documenting the down-side offense. IMO this is also fairer to the ed whom the RfC is focused on, and may be necessary even when much more difficult. And i assume you'd agree that if feasible, such clarification would be more efficiently and less contentiously done before opening an RfC; perhaps in fact you already envision that, and i am the one who is getting the cart before the horse.<br />
As to waste, no one favors it any more than Luther favored sin, but IMO our "edit boldly" is based on the premise that we can't know in advance which edits will be wasted effort. Luther wrote "Be a sinner, and sin boldly", and i favor wasting effort, and wasting it boldly, since we don't know what's a waste in advance. There were plenty of things i could have said to Philip, honestly and with good intent, that i was pretty sure would make him angry again; i was pretty sure <i>those</i> were a waste. But he was clueless about something he wants to know, and the way his obsessions keep him from finding out <i>little</i> [wink] things like Contribs and collaboration is no reason to leave him clueless. I suspect my last to him was the only thing, other than (possibly) silence like Mav's, that wouldn't provoke him. And who knows what getting an apparently non-sarcastic thank-you out of him may mean? Probably that i wasted my effort, but i waste boldly. [smile]<br />

<p>I apologize for any inconvenience my deletion may have caused you. At the time, my intentions were to remove just my contributions to articles on Wikipedia; mine alone not anyone else's. In summary, I was personally attacked by another user and the attack supported by a second user for NOT criticizing the subject matter <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Bremer_809e.html" title="Paul Bremer">Paul Bremer</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_Provisional_Authority_0d21.html" title="Coalition Provisional Authority">Coalition Provisional Authority</a>. I believe the phrased used was "Why are you so dogged...?" for my defense towards this "person" and went as far as asking me if I had a personal connection with the subject matter. And as I explained to a Wikipedia Admin. yesterday, I will not partake in anything that mandates "criticisms" I do not agree with. Therefore, I submitted my request to have my contributions removed including my account if necessary. Paradigmbuff 13:25, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'm wondering how you "digitized" the image, exactly. Did you use a scanner? Or a camera? And whatever you used, did it produce PNG directly, or did you do some conversion afterwards?</p>

<dd>Well, you saw where it comes from on the image description page, right? "User:Bishonen has digitized this image from an early 18th-century portrait of John Vanbrugh, by artist Godfrey Kneller, reproduced on the cover of "Sir John Vanbrugh:A Biography" by Kerry Downes." That cover reproduction was very nice, high quality, glossy, excellent. I asked my kid to scan it, since I wanted the best possible digital image (for my baby article), and he's a lot more skilled than I am. So, a scanner was used, and I think he was able to make a .png directly, which he told me was the format I ought to prefer. I shouldn't think he'd do it a way that he'd need to convert it afterwards. But if you want better info than this on procedure, software, etc, I'm afraid it'll have to wait till he comes home, he's out in the streets presumably mugging oldsters and/or taunting skinheads. Back tomorrow morning, with any luck.

<dd>Kid's still alive, no skinheads out tonight, I suppose. He scanned it in GIMP and produced a .png directly (seemed indignant at the idea of such as he converting stuff). Looks good, doesn't it? I love the little cracks in the 300-year-old varnish showing up in the scan. Oh, and he actually scanned it at 600 dpi, which the original glossy couldn't quite live up to, and scaled it down to whatever it was that I uploaded. The humungeous unscaled version, which looks horribly pixely, is available, in case you'd like me to upload that? Btw, I think the book's author, Kerry Downes, should be mentioned in the Commons description, not that he has anything to do with the cover, but for maximum identification of <b>which</b> biography is in question. Just my 2 c worth, maybe it's not customary. (Or maybe it's even embarrassing, to be so indecently frank about ripping off a print source&#160;;-)) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">Talk</a> 03:52, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Outdenting.) Wrinkles, feh! That's Godfrey Kneller's varnish cracking all right. Yes, I thought you might prefer the one with the maximum info. I should mention that it turns out, though, that the scaled-down .png wasn't just scaled-down, it has also had the colors adjusted slightly—we made Van a little pinker, I think. (I figured the varnish would have gotten a little yellow in 300 years, too.) Adjusted amateurishly, since no one here is a big-time image expert. Somebody who was could doubtless color the humungeous one, which I will upload completely without messing, much more delicately, if desired. However. I should upload to Commons...? That's outside my experience. It would mean creating an account there, right...? And then overwriting the existing image...? Or can I just name the new one John_Vanbrugh_2.png and upload it on wikipedia as usual, and you can collect it there? Or would that mean yet more images would need to be deleted? Perhaps you could walk me through what you would like me to do?

<dd>Whatever you want to do is fine. I'm perfectly happy to clean up afterwards.

Then you could just upload over <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:John_Vanbrugh.png" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:John_Vanbrugh.png">Commons:Image:John Vanbrugh.png</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Uploading to the Commons is just about the same as uploading here. Just have your big original as John_Vanbrugh.png, go to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" class="extiw" title="commons:Special:Upload">Commons:Special:Upload</a>, put in something like "original untweaked version" as the upload summary, then say okay when it warns you about how there's already a file by that name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your amateurish color adjustment turns out to be a wonderful reason to upload the original, un-messed version. See <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pretzel.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Pretzel.jpg">Commons:Image:Pretzel.jpg</a> for an example where I did the same thing.</dd>

<dd>Man, that pretzel looks <b>delicious</b>. OK, I registered on wikimedia and tried, and got "Sorry, we have a problem. Your upload is too large. The current upload limit for Wikimedia is 8Mb." So I asked wtf on IRC, and got told the Commons upload limit is normally 20 Mb, but apparently now temporarily it's 8. The point, though, is that my file is too big anyway, it's 22 Mb. (Told you it was a big scan.) I suppose wikipedia is the same limit—anyway, right now it's 8 Mb, too. So I got a crapload of free advice about ways of making it smaller... had some trouble getting people to grasp that the *point* of the exercise was to upload the original, unmessed. (Shock and horror: "What <b>is</b> that, a .tiff?) Sigh. So, what would you like me to do? Send it to you via yousendit.com, as somebody recommended on IRC?

<p>Pardon me, but I thought the purpose of peer review was, I don't know, <b>peer review</b>. Review, by your peers, of articles. Just a crazy idea I had, I guess, since I couldn't find a single other outlet for getting, you know, peer review of an article. Not RfC, not Village Pump, nothing.

<dd>Never did kiss that stone, I'm afraid. My modesty re proofreadingis anything but false, as the few publishers I've ever had have always been keen to point out to me. Seriously, I am pleased overall with the article, but mortified by some of the errors you and others have found. The main thing is that the 'facts' are accurate, though. Don't think there is anything else on the internet that serves quite the purpose this article does at the moment, so for that reason it was worth doing. Plus I enjoyed rereading the poem after a gap of a few years. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 11:56, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)

<p>As I remember from my days as a student of mathematics (chalk and slate, the thwack of leather on flesh, great times) flowery language = words I don't understand and can't be bothered looking up and sentences with more than two clauses. I like the Colley Cibber article very much, and figured that by making the 18th c. factor public, I might deter those who object after reading the article, leaving you to face only objections from those people who have no intention of reading it. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 12:36, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>When you think about it, the fact that 14000 words on a modernist poem is likely to make FA means that the battle for acceptance of <i>high culture</i> on Wikipedia is all but over. There are a couple of other good candidates at the moment; Colley and the French cardinal, so let the Simpsons beware. Leaving all modesty aside, I do think it is a good article and something that could be of real use to people encountering the poem for the first time, and I'm really happy witht he comments on FAC, which make the huge amount of work that went into the article seem more worthwhile. Love the April 1st entry, which I had seen via the link you left on Giano's Talk page.

<p>Hi there! Thanks for your warning. I do believe his allegations against you are unfounded, not to mention uncalled for. As for me, I will not stand for his public libel against me or us on his talk page. I have asked him to remove it, and if he does not I will certainly call for mediation here. This has gone way too far, and he will only start picking on the next newbie (e.g. DaveTheRed) who disagrees with him if this is not somehow stopped.

<li>Well, that was fast&#160;:) Pcpcpc has removed the libel, and now simply states he will henceforth ignore all of our posts. I've checked his recent edits and he doesn't seem to talk a lot to other users on talk pages, so I guess we're ok for now. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 22:30, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>No! Only a little tiny one digitally low, which is part of a collage, I might have a go at editing it, but it will still only blow up to the size of a postage stamp. I've a bit more info to add yet - do you think its that good then, I'm not so sure, everything seems to have gone very highbrow, or stuff about which I do not understand.

<p>Hi Bishonen, upon reading our first interchange on the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Force_Dynamics_f9cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Force Dynamics">Peer Review request of Force Dynamics</a> again, I just want to say sorry for being a little pedantic. I guess I got carried away a little by my enthusiasm for Cognitive Linguistics when I was explaining some things. The whole chatter about the representational device was out of place because you pointed out yourself that you already had understood it. I always feel a little awkward myself if someone is ignorantly lecturing me, so I just want to say sorry for being that way. It's no big deal probably, but I want to let you know that I value your thoughts and judgement highly.

<dd>Hiya, Dbenbenn, I simply downloaded that Chuck Two image from the web, unfortunately, and cropped off an unwanted bit in Photoshop (that's why it's a .png, on account of the cropping). I'm pretty sure this is where I got him from: <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/files/images/charles-II_lrg.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.royal.gov.uk/files/images/charles-II_lrg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/files/images/charles-II_lrg.jpg</a>, though there are other versions out there. Pages on royalty aren't an interest of mine, but Raul mentioned on IRC that he intended to feature <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_ac38.html" title="Charles II">Charles II</a> soon, so I asked if he really wanted to disfigure the Main Page with the grotty BW image in that article (it's a mystery to me why people would pick the worst available image for their Featured article, Main Page or not, but perhaps there's some system to it). Anyway, predictably, Raul said {{sofixit}}, so I did, and he held off locking the template till I was done. But if it's nice high-res homemade scans in general that you're after, you could do worse than check out <a href="../../../c/o/u/Image%7ECountry_Wife_1st_ed_1675.png_d39b.html" title="Image:Country Wife 1st ed 1675.png">Image:Country Wife 1st ed 1675.png</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Image%7ECountry_Wife_1675_cast.png_faf5.html" title="Image:Country Wife 1675 cast.png">Image:Country Wife 1675 cast.png</a>, that my kid made the other day from a facsimile edition of Wycherley's <i>The Country Wife</i>, for an article I'm working on.

<p>I found another howling example of POV from a 1911 Britanica article on Wikipedia. The following is from The Lord Arlington (Behn's spymaster):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Arlington was a typical statesman of the Restoration, possessed outwardly an attractive personality, and according to Sir Temple "the greatest skill of court and the best turns of art of particular conversation," but thoroughly unscrupulous and self-seeking, without a spark of patriotism, faithless even to a good cause, and regarding public office solely as a means of procuring pleasure and profit. His knowledge of foreign affairs and of foreign languages, gained during his residence abroad, was considerable, but long absence from England had also taught him a cosmopolitan indifference to constitutions and religions, and a careless disregard for English public opinion and the prudential interests of the country."</dd>

<p>Yeah, that's NPOV. BTW, I had <i>wondered</i> where that "anecdote" section came from. I know I'm not fond of it at all.

<p>to thank me for my vote. Tobyox it is indeed - I'm Toby in English-speaking countries/circumstances, and I've added 'ox' to that, as 'Toby' by itself is usually already used by someone as a username. The 'ox' bit stands for Oxford - slightly pretentious perhaps... but that's where I live (and study). My Norwegian name is Torbjørn (not Gunnar, I'm afraid), which supposedly means 'really, really strong', but in my Tobyox incarnation I guess I'm a Toby that's as stubborn as an ox, or something like that;) I'm quite used to the discussion of original performers from the world of opera, where it usually was standard to tailor everything to the performers, and then of course having to change everything because your original prima donna got a cold/got pregnant/got married/disappeared/got a better job/refused to sing anything you'd written for her... My only 'problem' with your article is that when it appears on the front page, people are going to think all our Arts coverage must be <i>fantastic</i>, if that's what Wikipedia has on a relatively obscure play... But I think it might interest people who suspect Wikipedia is only for technology-lovers to join:) <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyox_7345.html" title="User:Tobyox">Tobyox</a> 00:10, Mar 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bishonen... You're right, I can see how would seem weird and rude for those comments to be deleted without comment. I don't remember doing that! And just now (when I went back and looked at history) was the first time I'd ever seen Georgre's! He doesn't have a talk page.

<dd>We are clearly talking someone with problems here. I made my mild intervention because I thought his list was so silly, and because I value you two so highly as contributors to this place; generally, I avoid acting like an admin. But now that I've read his talk page, it seems that we are dealing with something much more than silly here. My view is that I will now try to ignore him unless he is being disruptive, and next time, if there is one, I will be less polite. By the way, how do you get your talk page into your sig? <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFiliocht_c3e2.html" title="User:Filiocht">Filiocht</a> 08:36, Mar 25, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the info on the sig. My intervention was little enough, but his response really annoyed me. I really am one of the least active admins here, and have from time to time wondered about being de-admined. It's handy for deleting pages from time to time, and the rollback link I use occasionally. But in this case, I wanted to do something about his blatant rudeness. I suspect that this will not be the end of it, although I'd be happy to be wrong. Giano's description of me has quite gone to my head, by the way.

<dd>Oh, he's so gorgeous! Is that your work? Now imagine him at 25, galloping handsomely through the French countryside with secret depeches to William of Orange tucked inside his frilly shirt, ignominiously captured, but, nothing daunted, tunnelling out of the Bastille with a spoon! That all really happened (bar the spoon itself). Seriously, I love this version, the brightness and rosiness. It looks great. Mind you, it might not be a lot like the original looks today, but I bet it looks like the original when freshly painted.</dd>

<dd>Well, ETPH was on the Main page for for most of the day, something I didn't expect in my wildest dreams! Yes, the book sprelled it Shakspeare all right. This sprelling was so common in the 19th century that I wouldn't by any means call it a missprelling. It was one of the respectable variants, of which there were several knocking around the culturesphere. E. g., George Bernard Shaw consistenly sprelled it Shakespear.

It basically ensures that unless your proposal is so incredibly awesome or uncontroversial that people immediately embrace it, you actually don't have to bother with any sort of proposal. Local improvements: yes. Site-wide improvements: no, forget it. Of course, once you <i>get</i> to the vote, there's no time to make constructive improvement anymore. So it's do or die for the proposal, and the "do" depends on a simple majority vote. For user-initiated proposals, there is no possibility for consensus, unless you happen to strike gold with a brilliant idea that captivates minds and fulfills a real need.</p>
<p>Needlesst to say, CD isn't it. I did put CD on the Village Pump and I mentioned it on the VfD talk page and I dropped it in IRC for good measure. Short of asking <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> to go spam everyone on my behalf, I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>Proposals for deletion? Where flawed proposals can be eliminated?&#160;:-) Actually, while everybody is just brimming with ideas for improving the process (<i>vide</i> the comments generated by my little straw poll on the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">VfD talk page</a>, they don't agree with each other at all. Everyone seems to think there's a different crucial problem VfD is suffering from, so maybe VfD is the best flawed solution we have after all. It can't be all bad if everyone thinks something different is wrong with it. The one problem that <i>does</i> crop up with some consistency is that it doesn't scale: VfD nominations come in faster than we can process them, or at least have a tendency to do so if we don't watch it like a hawk. But deletionists think this means we need to expand CSD, while inclusionists think be much looser on VfD and simply use it less (or even not at all). Geogre has some very clear, consistent and useful ideas on the subject that, unfortunately, are based on premises inclusionists most soundly disagree with. Po-TAY-toe, po-TAH-toe, and unless Jimbo himself comes down from Mount Wikimedius and speaks out on what sort of encyclopedia this will be I don't see that changing.</p>
<p>There have been so many proposals for "fixing" the deletion process that people are probably tired of it; they sure were tired of the last batch. Deletionists and inclusionists never see eye to eye on anything, personal opinion with no basis in fact runs rampant, and at this stage, I can't see how things will ever be improved until the backlogs grow so large that the maintenance process really becomes intractable and we're forced to cut the knot one way or the other.</p>
<p>Deletion, pardon the pun, seems to be a black hole on Wikipedia where huge amounts of time and effort disappear into without noticeable improvement to the encyclopedia. Sane people stay away from it. I think it's time I valued my sanity again.</p>
<p>Now look what I've done, I've defaced your talk page with a brain dump. I'm sorry. Feel free to delete it.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 22:25, 2005 Apr 5 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry to say, JRM, that I came to largely the same conclusions with my Managed Deletion scheme. It wasn't just that people who came to vote didn't read the talk pages (where they'd have seen all their objections discussed), but they didn't seem to read the proposal itself. "Power grab!" was the most absurd charge of all, as you know, and yet that's what shot it down. I got pats on the head for trying, but no barnstar. No. The work I did trying to figure out something that would prevent abuse and deal with the issue of scale simply drew up the unthinking lines of "us and them" again. I'm interested in a far more academic encyclopedia than most of the "inclusionists" are, and for that I must be "OMG! Against information!!!" or something. It only takes 8-18 months of that kind of accusation to make you retreat to your cave, where you just write 18th c. articles and let the disks fill with TV jokes and then go off to abuse (technically) speedy delete powers. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:17, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there, many thanks for your message, it was kind of you to spot me:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hi! I saw your message on Geogre's talk page, which I was giving a check-over because I know Geogre is having major hookup problems atm and won't himself have much chance to read it. He'll be back, but I don't know when, so if your problem is at all urgent, I'm afraid you'd better take it elsewhere. As a housekeeper at peer review, though, can I just ask you about your statement that WP:AD "recommends that in cases of accuracy dispute, you should call for peer review, but WP:PR says that peer review is only for articles close to featured article status"? I thought I was finally finding out why people keep listing accuracy disputes on peer review (creating headaches for me), but when I checked out WP:AD, I wasn't able to find the recommendation you mention. Am I missing it, or is it possible you were thinking of a different page? I see one mention of peer review on WP:AD, indeed, but that's in the infobox, and states quite correctly that PR is for getting articles up to Featured status. I'd really appreciate it if you'd check it out and let me know—it might solve some of my housekeeping problems! Bishonen|Talk 03:09, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC) (P.S. If you do have an accuracy dispute problem, WP:RFC is the place to list it. Bishonen|Talk 03:09, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC))</i></dd>

You were just included to help make the point that such things need to be handled with a light spirit, and not taken too seriously. By the way, I see that somebody has decided to take his ball and go home after much "stress" and "harassment" (aka constructive criticism). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 17:27, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really have very little to say to you Ms. Bishonen on the subject of interior decoration, I am a wronged man, had you not wronged me (<i>you know what I mean and May the Lord forgive you your guilt, for I cannot</i>) I was going to upload a shot to prove "Ceasar is the man" a tasteful (semi-nude) portrait of myself displayed in my own home.

<p>Hi; there are several "invisible" techniques;</p>
<ul>
<li>list the facts (possibly as quotes from the article) in a notes section, put each reference with page number next to it.</li>
<li>put the references in HTML comments, I don't like this since we'll need manual searching to find them later. See <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geology_of_the_Grand_Canyon_area_f953.html" title="Geology of the Grand Canyon area">Geology of the Grand Canyon area</a> for an example of this</li>
<li>use an invisible notes template - just implemented see <a href="../../../i/n/o/Template_talk%7EInote_323a.html" title="Template talk:Inote">Template talk:Inote</a> - this seems best to me..</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to write a page documenting these and other referencing techniques.</p>

If you have a couple of months to spare perhaps you would like to take a peak at User:Giano/Blen Pal it concerns an old friend of ours, the page has needed a re-write for ages, but I had to wait until I had a day to do it (yesterday).

I am not part of her supposed IRC clique, and have never corresponded with her or any one else on IRC (or whatever it's called) suggestions of a clique are the ramblings of a paranoid.

<p>The guy is trying to use IRC for making a statement on RfA, and that's not allowed. What no one has done, though, is really tell him what a turd he's being. What drew the sour remarks was that he went to IRC to fart at the GFDL. Since Wikipedia is built on the GFDL and Wikipedians is made up of people who work on Wikipedia, what the hell else kind of response did he expect? Let's all go to the Opera Dei website and shout about atheism and then expect a nice reception! Sheesh.

<dd>I say again, "It's all about penises, in the end." That was a dynamite line. Yes, Bishonen, I saw that comment, but, knowing its adjectives to be untrue, I knew not what to make of its nouns. Masterpiece of wit, indeed! I work up a tight clinch, and no one sees it. I balance out the antitheses <i>just so</i> and it's passed over for a potty reference. I'm simply too good for the room. I've got to do something about getting better audiences. Plus, I told a stunning story of juvenile deliquincy to you in e-mail and what response did <i>that</i> get? I tell you, I was born too late.

I keep looking in to see if I can make head or tail of it, seems it all about mass hysteria, like when Princess Diana died, and to think you are the cause of it, and you did it in a much easier way than Diana too, clever old you! Anyway its because of the hysteria debate I found you a revolving barnstar, I think its really clever, it does it on its own you know, without any help, its fascinating isn't it, so much more interesting than all this debate on ethics. I found it nosing about on Everyking's talk page, he was given one, so I copied it and pasted it on your user page, neat! I'm still trying to think of a proper present for you, have no fear you will be the first to know when I find it!!!!

<li>If I may ask, do you think I'm overreacting here? I mean, it just boggles my mind that there are people like Geogre who stomp around belittling people's contributions, insulting them, calling them liars, and threatening to ban them. Surely I can't be the only one puzzled. Why does this guy have the power to ban people, anyway?</li>

<p>My last action on my talk page was to delete (not rollback or archive) a whine from the IP user. Look at the diffs, though. This dirk managed to post to my user page without showing up in the revision history? Astonishing, unless.... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:33, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Geogre: I offered, on your talk page, to leave as soon as you "stop badmouthing me here and elsewhere on this site," since the thought doesn't much appeal to me of having to defend myself against your obnoxiously inaccurate accusations for perpetuity and beyond. Since I wrote that about an hour ago, you've called me an "anonymous coward" (in fact, I'm tied to this IP), and now you're trying to portray my polite request as a "whine," as well as insinuating... that I'm some kind of poltergeist? What exactly is your "astonishing" observation about the history tab?</p>
<p>So let me offer again: Stop attacking me, and I won't bother you either. Okay? <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.65.88.245.html" title="User:66.65.88.245">66.65.88.245</a> 20:56, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bishonen, I'm sorry for cluttering this discussion page; the editing page says it's already "longer than preferable," in case you'd like to know. <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.65.88.245.html" title="User:66.65.88.245">66.65.88.245</a> 21:05, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Um, child, what makes you think that I'm referring to you? Did you, by chance, <b>read</b> the article <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_coward.html" title="Anonymous coward">anonymous coward</a>? The reason you don't know what the startling revelation is is that I wasn't talking to you. We're working on a technical issue, so please don't think the world revolves around you. Sheesh.

</ul>
<p>You're kidding, right? What makes me think you called me an "anonymous coward?" Could it be that you deleted my (polite and reasonable) request from your talk page with the note "Deleting anonymous coward"? -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geogre&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13574400" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geogre&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13574400" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geogre&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13574400</a></p>

<li>Again, kid, <b>read</b> the article <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_coward.html" title="Anonymous coward">anonymous coward</a> and you'll know why I called you that and why it's an accurate description. I know you're averse to reading anything on Wikipedia, as you seem not to know what it is we do here, but "this site" is rather large, and behind the scenes are a whole group of folks who are tracking down anomalies and keeping tabs on new articles, categories, abuses, etc. It's not about you, and if you'd bother to read (and I even linked the term in my edit summary to make it easy for you), you'd sleep better at night.

<dd>Oliver Chettle is my brother. I went to his defence on the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Icke</a> article. Slim Virgin was having difficulty believing that more than one person could be unreasonable enough to diagree with his point of view (although there are also others who do who are nothing to do with us) so he leapt to the conclusion that since we have made edits on similar subjects, and we have not edited at the same time, (difficult to do on the same computer), we are the same person. <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGillian_Tipson_3643.html" title="User:Gillian Tipson">Gillian Tipson</a> 04:27, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bishonen - just noticed you cleaned this ridiculous comment at RC patrol: <i>Tony Sidaway: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crudup" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crudup" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>] - User has been deleting all editions without any rhyme or reason and shortened the entire text to incomprehensible definitions.</i></p>
<p>I just checked a couple of page histories. I discovered that Tony reverted a spurious one-line addition to the article added by User:Harvarder. Surprise, surprise, it was Harvarder who wrote the comment at RC Patrol.

<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>Your page seems a suitably apt place to make known my feelings. I have been forced to break my self imposed exile from Wikipedia to complain in the strongest possible terms about the vandalism (both wicked and wanton) which happened yesterday to Dalek. This has horrified intellectuals around the world, many of whom like myself, in their youthful years and beyond, have spent many fruitful hours with a biscuit tin on their heads and a drain unblocker exterminating local goats. What is most horrific about this particular piece of malicious and unpleasant vandalism is that not since Wikipedia put on its front page that article (whose name escapes me) about about a Japanese computer game involving scantily clad girls has Wikipedia provided such a service to the education of the masses. The front page is Wikipedia's shop window, now it is known globally, and probably other places as well, that a wikipedia editor does not take such pages totally seriously, and has publicly displayed a tasteless senses of humour which many found distressing, indeed so tasteless and distressing that millions around the world are probably seeking counselling as we speak. This vandalism is far worse and more horrific than when the front page was soiled by a picture of an athaletic gentleman enjoying his own company in an anatomically impossible (for me anyway) fashion. My one consolation is that reading the wise words here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#User:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu.27s_strange_edits_to_featured_article_Dalek" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#User:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu.27s_strange_edits_to_featured_article_Dalek" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> I now realise there are enough right thinking people in the world to begin my noble campaign for the re-establishment of the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">inquisition</a>, an organisation which would deal with such heretical editors as "Ta bu whatsit" in the only proper fashion. Until the dawn of that happy day "Ta bu whatsit" must be banned for life, and thereafter allowed only to edit such weighty and boring pages as TPH etc. I could go on, but this whole sorry business has bought about a recurrance of my angina, and furthermore...................</p>

<li>Yes I see what you mean about the 26th, can it be stopped, I mean will anyone actually want to read it. I am currently working on a much greater work of literature, that appeals to a greater spectrum of society, I have read it many times, often aloud, and each time find a new nuance of social behaviour, many members of my family have enjoyed this in-depth and perceptive work and I'm surprised that Irishman hasn't written one of his very long pages on the subject. I am of course referring to the canine adventures of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairy_Maclary_e0e6.html" title="Hairy Maclary">Hairy Maclary</a> <a href="http://www.mallinsonrendel.co.nz/hairymaclary.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mallinsonrendel.co.nz/hairymaclary.asp" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> and his friends.

<p>That's a pretty abrupt swing--from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=14067048&amp;oldid=14060220" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=14067048&amp;oldid=14060220" rel="nofollow">Fabergé egg</a> to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Neutrality_%282%29&amp;diff=14154267&amp;oldid=14151376" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Neutrality_%282%29&amp;diff=14154267&amp;oldid=14151376" rel="nofollow">call for censure</a> in less than two days. Would you like me to take the egg off my user page? I won't pretend to understand why some people called for our censure in this case; an RfC is the recommended step in that stage of dispute resolution, and in this case it was effective where previous good-faith attempts to communicate had been ignored. I'm utterly at a loss as to how else the score of people who thought Neutrality's actions were a little excessive could have communicated with him, since he had steadfastly ignored all polite attempts to make our concerns known. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:29, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Check <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. There were (to my knowledge at the time I made my RfC listing) two people including me trying to talk with Neutrality, and he had blanked both of our attempts to communicate and resumed actions that, he was aware, both regarded as unreasonable. The next step to take is at the discretion of the parties involved but the first choice is to get more opinions. "Discuss with third parties". We did that. Two more people who had also attempted to discuss this with Neutrality also certified, with evidence. A further five people have endorsed. Nearly 20 people have said, with varying degrees of emphasis, that Neutrality's actions were not a good way of dealign with perceived low quality of school articles.</dd>
<dd>Now you suggest that mediation should have been undertaken <i>first</i>. There are some problems with this:
<ol>
<li>Mediation is normally only of much use for interpersonal problems, not when a group is in dispute with an individual;</li>
<li>Mediation is exceedingly slow and no use for airing problems with ongoing behavior (normally both parties would undertake to cease disputed behavior <i>prior</i> to mediation).</li>
<li>Mediation currently seems to be broken. TDC and I have been waiting for weeks for a mediator despite both having an honest wish to discuss our problems in a mediated environment.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No, clearly seeking third party opinions here was overwhelmingly successful and mediation could never have gotten near. And I'm actually surprised to see you suggest mediation <i>first</i>. In practise it is more common for parties to seek third party opinions. And I think this is the right thing to do. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 12:34, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not mad at you, I was just uncertain about your opinion of me. Calling for censure seems somewhat extreme, and certainly not commensurate with anything that I have called for for Neutrality. I think a number of people, yourself included, regard the RfC mechanism as something of a last resort. That is <i>not</i> Wikipedia policy. The words "request for comments" mean just that--a chance to get a third party opinion. Saying "you need to be censured for asking for third party opinions" makes no sense, so I think those who are calling for censure are saying something else was going on. The accusations of bad faith, which you endorsed, and the opinion that this was "an outrageous abuse of RfC" and that it was pointless are utterly incomprehensible unless I assume that the purpose of the RfC mechanism is not generally understood. I got nearly twenty people saying Neutrality shouldn't do stuff like that. How else could this have been achieved within a timescale that matched what he was doing? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:00, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony, from the way you phrase your latest message, I'm beginning to think with dismay that being "censured", as in the sentence "The people responsible for this should be censured", that I signed, must have some sense on Wikipedia that I wasn't aware of—being formally censured by some authority, scapegoated by the community in some way? I'll certainly go back and remove my signature and post an apology if it means something I didn't intend. I meant to say "The people who posted this RfC should be criticized"—you know, in the way that some people on the page <b>were</b> posting criticisms (including me, by signing the statements). Or even more exactly: "See how the people responsible for the RfC are being criticized here." That would be equivalent to what you called for for Neutrality, by posting the RfC: I mean, the very existence and purpose of the RfC was implicitly a Request for Criticism, not a Request for Compliments, right? In your message above, you do call it "overwhelmingly successful" for eliciting criticism of his VFD school listings.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the perception of an RfC by the community is that the mere fact of bringing it is a strong criticism. I wasn't aware that that isn't policy, but it seems to me to be so much the perception as to be "the culture". I went with the culture, and I'm not sure I wouldn't again. I'm not making an overarching argument that written policy needs to be disregarded, just trying to explain how I personally look at it. I do realize there's lots of room for disagreement. (The only really accepted and uncontroversial (IMO) example of culture trumping official policy that I can think of is the userspace: written policy is that everyone has the right to edit it just as much as other pages, while the culture is that users have a say-so over editing in their space.)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, I would never have endorsed any of the summaries accusing you and the others of <b>bad faith</b>! In saying I did, I suppose you mean that bad-faith accusations are implied. I hope not, but I agree that the wording is strong and probably unnecessarily angry, and I might have done better to have rolled my own.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't hold any particular brief for Neutrality, but I feel quite strongly about the issue at stake, just as you do, and I don't think he did a bad thing by making those listings. Anyway, I hope we don't have to rehash the schools/VFD issue, but can agree to disagree there. (See, I was <b>hoping</b> to avoid that cliché, but there it comes.)</dd>

Hi, Bishonen, I caught your discussion in progress from Tony Sidaway's page. I just want to simply add that had Neutrality responded to me in any way other than blanking his user page, I would not have certified the RfC myself. Surely that is the next step when someone not only refuses to communicate, but attempts to rebuff the attempts of others to communicate, isn't it?</p>
<p>He not only gave me no response to a legitimate concern, he removed my attempt to communicate with him, as well as the good faith attempts of others. Considering his other comment to me, " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FChristian_Liberty_Academy&amp;diff=13834537&amp;oldid=13834022|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FChristian_Liberty_Academy&amp;diff=13834537&amp;oldid=13834022|" rel="nofollow">I don't feel like showing the least bit respect for someone who—of his own free will—votes "keep" on dozens of schools</a>"; I thought RfC regarding <i>(not against)</i> Neutrality was the ONLY next step available to me in the dispute resolution process. You can't pick and choose who to respect based on how they vote in VfD, especially considering he's an administrator and one of only twelve arbitrators here on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Now he's blanked all record of the schools issue, from his user page, labeling it as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Neutrality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14166071|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Neutrality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14166071|" rel="nofollow">bullshit/spam</a>. This further edit summary is extremely inflammatory and disrespectful of myself, Tony Sidaway, Radiant!, and everyone else who tried to communicate with him in good faith regarding this issue, but is not part of the original RfC. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 16:41, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tried in good faith to communicate and the only response I got is a blanking and a statement that says he won't respect me because I'm voting opposite of him. I observed that he's done <i>exactly the same thing</i> (blanking his user page without response) to <i>at least three other good faith, polite attempts to communicate</i>. Am I then expected to make <i>another</i> good faith effort, to complain that he didn't respond when I complained the first time? I'm sorry, I never aspired to be <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a>!

<dd>Given that he had already said he didn't respect me, that he'd already blanked my comments from his page, and that the first step in the dispute resolution process beyond trying to communicate directly is RfC, how could it be in any way wrong to request comments from a third party? Now I'm criticized for participating in an RfC to try to get him to accept that his is not the only valid opinion that exists? Everyone "in the culture" of Wikipedia knows that keeping the lines of communication open is vital. There's no reason to hold an administrator and one of only twelve arbitrators to a lower standard, just because some see an RfC as a somewhat negative thing on a user's record. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 17:26, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I very much agree with Unfocused that the RfC was really the <i>only</i> thing to do here. Perhaps there's a culture arising that say we shouldn't try to communicate our concerns to people if they show that they don't give a stuff about them, even if there are a few of us. Well if so that culture is inimical to resolving disputes. If editors just feel free to go on ignoring disputes about their ongoing behavior then there can never be any kind of dispute resolution. I don't expect other editors to act on my concerns, but I do expect them to show good faith and not (as Neutrality did on his talk page) put up a notice that says, I quote: "I archive when I feel like it. Depending on my whim, your comments may or may not be archived. The odds of not being archived are inversely proportional to the amount you annoy me. Please do not annoy me." He also filed another eight VfDs, on top of nearly thirty he'd filed in the morning. When four people make reasonable expressions of their concerns on a user talk page, that is not the kind of response that can be regarded as reasonable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:38, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you go back to the RfC you'll see that my approach to Neutrality on his user talk page could not have been more reasonable. I suggested that listing so many VfDs on that particular day could be seen as excessive, and asked him to keep down to a maximum of ten per day. His behavior was tying up lots of editors in scrambling to vote this way or that, as well as causing a degree of polarization on this issue which I'm sure no editor wants to cause. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:38, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

How would you like beefing up the articles? All you need is a few good reference books like Bradley's <i>Shakespearean tragedies</i> and a Cambridge or Oxford guide to Shakespeare. I'm sure you can find lots of help on the way.

<p>Uh...? <a href="../../../d/e/v/Developed_country.html" title="Developed country">Developed country</a> is the first and only page I have protected, and I unproteted it and removed the tag simultaneously, after 24 hours. Did I miss something? Nothing is more likely, mind you, as the whole protection/unprotection procedure is a little intimidating the first time. Or, hey, did you simply mean that this maneouvre was unnecessary:</p>

<p>Right? I have mysterious editing powers that override the protection?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I meant that "maneouvre" was unnecessary. Your administrative powers overrides that protection, but as an Administrator... it means you shouldn't abuse it. It does give you a warning notice saying that you should not edit the page while the page is protected <b>other than to add the protection notice.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm replying on your page, as I usually do, but it unnerves me a little to note that <b>it</b> is protected. So, I can still edit it, but is it a faux pas and abuse of my superpowers to do so? Anyway, thanks for telling me, that'll come in useful! <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 09:51, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't like Willy on Wheels, and my page was swept with a page move vandalism. I don't like fixing pages of that nature, and certainly when it deals with my own user page... and for that matter my user talk page. Thus, I've protected it from moving only. As an Administrator, you see two types of protection: Page moves and general protection. Page moves removes the "move" feature button from the page, while general protection protects the page from editing and prevents the page from moving. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 23:44, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am the anon user (actually called Jaie) who created the "gay (homosexual)" page. I dont understand what the problem is. The word "gay" is clearly ambiguous, as it could mean happy or homosexual amonst other things. Therefor it clearly needs two pages, one talking about the emotion, and the other talking about the sexual persuasion. The only way you can do this is by linking the word "gay" to a disambiguation page, with links to pages discussing the two topics above. BTW, I dont know if this is the right way to post on a discussion page, being fairly newish, if its not my apologies.</p>

<li>I don't understand why homosexuals want to be called gay; all the ones I've met are all deep and introspective - far from gay in fact. Just wondered if there's a particular reason they cornered the word. I did meet a lesbian once who was gay but she was also an alcoholic, which I thought explained the happy demeanour, very good company in facto.

<p>I'm not sure I actually said "happy" was the main meaning of the word now, but it is still a valid meaning (in fact Wiktionary lists it as the primary meaning), and therefor there is ambiguity within the word surely?

<dd>I say again, "It's all about penises, in the end." That was a dynamite line. Yes, Bishonen, I saw that comment, but, knowing its adjectives to be untrue, I knew not what to make of its nouns. Masterpiece of wit, indeed! I work up a tight clinch, and no one sees it. I balance out the antitheses <i>just so</i> and it's passed over for a potty reference. I'm simply too good for the room. I've got to do something about getting better audiences. Plus, I told a stunning story of juvenile deliquincy to you in e-mail and what response did <i>that</i> get? I tell you, I was born too late. Where are the salons of yesteryear? I am a one-man club because no one else is clubbable. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:10, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I keep looking in to see if I can make head or tail of it, seems it all about mass hysteria, like when Princess Diana died, and to think you are the cause of it, and you did it in a much easier way than Diana too, clever old you! Anyway its because of the hysteria debate I found you a revolving barnstar, I think its really clever, it does it on its own you know, without any help, its fascinating isn't it, so much more interesting than all this debate on ethics. I found it nosing about on Everyking's talk page, he was given one, so I copied it and pasted it on your user page, neat! I'm still trying to think of a proper present for you, have no fear you will be the first to know when I find it!!!!

<p>I wish you would archive some of this fan mail, it takes so long to get dpwn here, I'm surprised you get any messages at all. I thought you must know something literary about CW that I didn't. Shakespeare designed Windsor Castle, not many people know that. No I can't think of anybody either, anyway I'm tired of writing long boring pages nobody wants to read, and am going to diversify my subjects into my second favourite recreational hobby building aquariam seascapes features for tropical fish. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 16:39, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK, thanks for explaining why you've been deleting my questions/comments to Geogre's discussion. I must admit it was gratifying to discover that I'm not the only one who dislikes the guy&#160;:p</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If I may ask, do you think I'm overreacting here? I mean, it just boggles my mind that there are people like Geogre who stomp around belittling people's contributions, insulting them, calling them liars, and threatening to ban them. Surely I can't be the only one puzzled. Why does this guy have the power to ban people, anyway?</li>

<p>My last action on my talk page was to delete (not rollback or archive) a whine from the IP user. Look at the diffs, though. This dirk managed to post to my user page without showing up in the revision history? Astonishing, unless.... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:33, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Geogre: I offered, on your talk page, to leave as soon as you "stop badmouthing me here and elsewhere on this site," since the thought doesn't much appeal to me of having to defend myself against your obnoxiously inaccurate accusations for perpetuity and beyond. Since I wrote that about an hour ago, you've called me an "anonymous coward" (in fact, I'm tied to this IP), and now you're trying to portray my polite request as a "whine," as well as insinuating... that I'm some kind of poltergeist? What exactly is your "astonishing" observation about the history tab?</p>
<p>So let me offer again: Stop attacking me, and I won't bother you either. Okay? <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.65.88.245.html" title="User:66.65.88.245">66.65.88.245</a> 20:56, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bishonen, I'm sorry for cluttering this discussion page; the editing page says it's already "longer than preferable," in case you'd like to know. <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.65.88.245.html" title="User:66.65.88.245">66.65.88.245</a> 21:05, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Um, child, what makes you think that I'm referring to you? Did you, by chance, <b>read</b> the article <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_coward.html" title="Anonymous coward">anonymous coward</a>? The reason you don't know what the startling revelation is is that I wasn't talking to you. We're working on a technical issue, so please don't think the world revolves around you. Sheesh. Some children! <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:15, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>You're kidding, right? What makes me think you called me an "anonymous coward?" Could it be that you deleted my (polite and reasonable) request from your talk page with the note "Deleting anonymous coward"? -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geogre&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13574400" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geogre&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13574400" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Geogre&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=13574400</a></p>
<p>Now that's kind of insulting. Seriously, man. Please leave me alone and stop spreading these petty little digs at me around this site. Is that really so bizarre to ask of you?</p>

<ul>
<li>Again, kid, <b>read</b> the article <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_coward.html" title="Anonymous coward">anonymous coward</a> and you'll know why I called you that and why it's an accurate description. I know you're averse to reading anything on Wikipedia, as you seem not to know what it is we do here, but "this site" is rather large, and behind the scenes are a whole group of folks who are tracking down anomalies and keeping tabs on new articles, categories, abuses, etc. It's not about you, and if you'd bother to read (and I even linked the term in my edit summary to make it easy for you), you'd sleep better at night.

<p>I just checked a couple of page histories. I discovered that Tony reverted a spurious one-line addition to the article added by User:Harvarder. Surprise, surprise, it was Harvarder who wrote the comment at RC Patrol.

<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>Your page seems a suitably apt place to make known my feelings. I have been forced to break my self imposed exile from Wikipedia to complain in the strongest possible terms about the vandalism (both wicked and wanton) which happened yesterday to Dalek. This has horrified intellectuals around the world, many of whom like myself, in their youthful years and beyond, have spent many fruitful hours with a biscuit tin on their heads and a drain unblocker exterminating local goats. What is most horrific about this particular piece of malicious and unpleasant vandalism is that not since Wikipedia put on its front page that article (whose name escapes me) about about a Japanese computer game involving scantily clad girls has Wikipedia provided such a service to the education of the masses. The front page is Wikipedia's shop window, now it is known globally, and probably other places as well, that a wikipedia editor does not take such pages totally seriously, and has publicly displayed a tasteless senses of humour which many found distressing, indeed so tasteless and distressing that millions around the world are probably seeking counselling as we speak. This vandalism is far worse and more horrific than when the front page was soiled by a picture of an athaletic gentleman enjoying his own company in an anatomically impossible (for me anyway) fashion. My one consolation is that reading the wise words here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#User:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu.27s_strange_edits_to_featured_article_Dalek" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ANI#User:Ta_bu_shi_da_yu.27s_strange_edits_to_featured_article_Dalek" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> I now realise there are enough right thinking people in the world to begin my noble campaign for the re-establishment of the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">inquisition</a>, an organisation which would deal with such heretical editors as "Ta bu whatsit" in the only proper fashion. Until the dawn of that happy day "Ta bu whatsit" must be banned for life, and thereafter allowed only to edit such weighty and boring pages as TPH etc. I could go on, but this whole sorry business has bought about a recurrance of my angina, and furthermore...................</p>

<li>Yes I see what you mean about the 26th, can it be stopped, I mean will anyone actually want to read it. I am currently working on a much greater work of literature, that appeals to a greater spectrum of society, I have read it many times, often aloud, and each time find a new nuance of social behaviour, many members of my family have enjoyed this in-depth and perceptive work and I'm surprised that Irishman hasn't written one of his very long pages on the subject. I am of course referring to the canine adventures of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairy_Maclary_e0e6.html" title="Hairy Maclary">Hairy Maclary</a> <a href="http://www.mallinsonrendel.co.nz/hairymaclary.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mallinsonrendel.co.nz/hairymaclary.asp" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> and his friends.

Would you like me to take the egg off my user page? I won't pretend to understand why some people called for our censure in this case; an RfC is the recommended step in that stage of dispute resolution, and in this case it was effective where previous good-faith attempts to communicate had been ignored. I'm utterly at a loss as to how else the score of people who thought Neutrality's actions were a little excessive could have communicated with him, since he had steadfastly ignored all polite attempts to make our concerns known. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:29, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Check <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. There were (to my knowledge at the time I made my RfC listing) two people including me trying to talk with Neutrality, and he had blanked both of our attempts to communicate and resumed actions that, he was aware, both regarded as unreasonable. The next step to take is at the discretion of the parties involved but the first choice is to get more opinions. "Discuss with third parties". We did that. Two more people who had also attempted to discuss this with Neutrality also certified, with evidence. A further five people have endorsed. Nearly 20 people have said, with varying degrees of emphasis, that Neutrality's actions were not a good way of dealign with perceived low quality of school articles.</dd>
<dd>Now you suggest that mediation should have been undertaken <i>first</i>. There are some problems with this:
<ol>
<li>Mediation is normally only of much use for interpersonal problems, not when a group is in dispute with an individual;</li>
<li>Mediation is exceedingly slow and no use for airing problems with ongoing behavior (normally both parties would undertake to cease disputed behavior <i>prior</i> to mediation).</li>
<li>Mediation currently seems to be broken. TDC and I have been waiting for weeks for a mediator despite both having an honest wish to discuss our problems in a mediated environment.</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No, clearly seeking third party opinions here was overwhelmingly successful and mediation could never have gotten near. And I'm actually surprised to see you suggest mediation <i>first</i>. In practise it is more common for parties to seek third party opinions.

<dd>I'm not mad at you, I was just uncertain about your opinion of me. Calling for censure seems somewhat extreme, and certainly not commensurate with anything that I have called for for Neutrality. I think a number of people, yourself included, regard the RfC mechanism as something of a last resort. That is <i>not</i> Wikipedia policy. The words "request for comments" mean just that--a chance to get a third party opinion. Saying "you need to be censured for asking for third party opinions" makes no sense, so I think those who are calling for censure are saying something else was going on. The accusations of bad faith, which you endorsed, and the opinion that this was "an outrageous abuse of RfC" and that it was pointless are utterly incomprehensible unless I assume that the purpose of the RfC mechanism is not generally understood. I got nearly twenty people saying Neutrality shouldn't do stuff like that. How else could this have been achieved within a timescale that matched what he was doing? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 13:00, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tony, from the way you phrase your latest message, I'm beginning to think with dismay that being "censured", as in the sentence "The people responsible for this should be censured", that I signed, must have some sense on Wikipedia that I wasn't aware of—being formally censured by some authority, scapegoated by the community in some way? I'll certainly go back and remove my signature and post an apology if it means something I didn't intend. I meant to say "The people who posted this RfC should be criticized"—you know, in the way that some people on the page <b>were</b> posting criticisms (including me, by signing the statements). Or even more exactly: "See how the people responsible for the RfC are being criticized here." That would be equivalent to what you called for for Neutrality, by posting the RfC: I mean, the very existence and purpose of the RfC was implicitly a Request for Criticism, not a Request for Compliments, right? In your message above, you do call it "overwhelmingly successful" for eliciting criticism of his VFD school listings.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the perception of an RfC by the community is that the mere fact of bringing it is a strong criticism. I wasn't aware that that isn't policy, but it seems to me to be so much the perception as to be "the culture". I went with the culture, and I'm not sure I wouldn't again. I'm not making an overarching argument that written policy needs to be disregarded, just trying to explain how I personally look at it. I do realize there's lots of room for disagreement. (The only really accepted and uncontroversial (IMO) example of culture trumping official policy that I can think of is the userspace: written policy is that everyone has the right to edit it just as much as other pages, while the culture is that users have a say-so over editing in their space.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, I would never have endorsed any of the summaries accusing you and the others of <b>bad faith</b>! In saying I did, I suppose you mean that bad-faith accusations are implied. I hope not, but I agree that the wording is strong and probably unnecessarily angry, and I might have done better to have rolled my own.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't hold any particular brief for Neutrality, but I feel quite strongly about the issue at stake, just as you do, and I don't think he did a bad thing by making those listings. Anyway, I hope we don't have to rehash the schools/VFD issue, but can agree to disagree there. (See, I was <b>hoping</b> to avoid that cliché, but there it comes.)</dd>

<p><br />
Hi, Bishonen, I caught your discussion in progress from Tony Sidaway's page. I just want to simply add that had Neutrality responded to me in any way other than blanking his user page, I would not have certified the RfC myself. Surely that is the next step when someone not only refuses to communicate, but attempts to rebuff the attempts of others to communicate, isn't it?</p>
<p>He not only gave me no response to a legitimate concern, he removed my attempt to communicate with him, as well as the good faith attempts of others. Considering his other comment to me, " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FChristian_Liberty_Academy&amp;diff=13834537&amp;oldid=13834022|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FChristian_Liberty_Academy&amp;diff=13834537&amp;oldid=13834022|" rel="nofollow">I don't feel like showing the least bit respect for someone who—of his own free will—votes "keep" on dozens of schools</a>"; I thought RfC regarding <i>(not against)</i> Neutrality was the ONLY next step available to me in the dispute resolution process. You can't pick and choose who to respect based on how they vote in VfD, especially considering he's an administrator and one of only twelve arbitrators here on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Now he's blanked all record of the schools issue, from his user page, labeling it as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Neutrality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14166071|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Neutrality&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14166071|" rel="nofollow">bullshit/spam</a>. This further edit summary is extremely inflammatory and disrespectful of myself, Tony Sidaway, Radiant!, and everyone else who tried to communicate with him in good faith regarding this issue, but is not part of the original RfC. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 16:41, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tried in good faith to communicate and the only response I got is a blanking and a statement that says he won't respect me because I'm voting opposite of him. I observed that he's done <i>exactly the same thing</i> (blanking his user page without response) to <i>at least three other good faith, polite attempts to communicate</i>. Am I then expected to make <i>another</i> good faith effort, to complain that he didn't respond when I complained the first time? I'm sorry, I never aspired to be <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a>! Isn't observing the failure of three other attempts enough, or do you believe I need to personally experience each of those failures myself to make a valid RfC?</dd>

<dd>Given that he had already said he didn't respect me, that he'd already blanked my comments from his page, and that the first step in the dispute resolution process beyond trying to communicate directly is RfC, how could it be in any way wrong to request comments from a third party? Now I'm criticized for participating in an RfC to try to get him to accept that his is not the only valid opinion that exists? Everyone "in the culture" of Wikipedia knows that keeping the lines of communication open is vital. There's no reason to hold an administrator and one of only twelve arbitrators to a lower standard, just because some see an RfC as a somewhat negative thing on a user's record. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#000099">focused</font></a> 17:26, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I very much agree with Unfocused that the RfC was really the <i>only</i> thing to do here. Perhaps there's a culture arising that say we shouldn't try to communicate our concerns to people if they show that they don't give a stuff about them, even if there are a few of us. Well if so that culture is inimical to resolving disputes. If editors just feel free to go on ignoring disputes about their ongoing behavior then there can never be any kind of dispute resolution. I don't expect other editors to act on my concerns, but I do expect them to show good faith and not (as Neutrality did on his talk page) put up a notice that says, I quote: "I archive when I feel like it. Depending on my whim, your comments may or may not be archived. The odds of not being archived are inversely proportional to the amount you annoy me. Please do not annoy me." He also filed another eight VfDs, on top of nearly thirty he'd filed in the morning. When four people make reasonable expressions of their concerns on a user talk page, that is not the kind of response that can be regarded as reasonable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:38, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you go back to the RfC you'll see that my approach to Neutrality on his user talk page could not have been more reasonable. I suggested that listing so many VfDs on that particular day could be seen as excessive, and asked him to keep down to a maximum of ten per day. His behavior was tying up lots of editors in scrambling to vote this way or that, as well as causing a degree of polarization on this issue which I'm sure no editor wants to cause. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:38, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am the anon user (actually called Jaie) who created the "gay (homosexual)" page. I dont understand what the problem is. The word "gay" is clearly ambiguous, as it could mean happy or homosexual amonst other things. Therefor it clearly needs two pages, one talking about the emotion, and the other talking about the sexual persuasion. The only way you can do this is by linking the word "gay" to a disambiguation page, with links to pages discussing the two topics above. BTW, I dont know if this is the right way to post on a discussion page, being fairly newish, if its not my apologies.</p>

<li>I don't understand why homosexuals want to be called gay; all the ones I've met are all deep and introspective - far from gay in fact. Just wondered if there's a particular reason they cornered the word. I did meet a lesbian once who was gay but she was also an alcoholic, which I thought explained the happy demeanour, very good company in facto. All answers on a post card please, confine yourselves to 50 words. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 19:20, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not sure I actually said "happy" was the main meaning of the word now, but it is still a valid meaning (in fact Wiktionary lists it as the primary meaning), and therefor there is ambiguity within the word surely? Will copy the above post to the "gay" talk page, anyhow, and see what they make of it....</p>

<p>The feet sticking out from under the house won't be wearing long striped socks (the Bishonen Witch of the East) but, instead, will have curly toed shoes (Munchkin Geogre). I set the Restoration to exclude Bill and Mary, as I took a very narrow and very literal, political view of the period. I did that on purpose, of course, but, now that I think of it, it kind of excludes a lot of stuff. The literary epoch goes to 1700, but I figured that moving over to the political epoch would save gray hairs. See what I mean by being so in love with my voice that I'll committ the grand sweeps of an arm and leave the details for some later day? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:47, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

I will also suggest that people ask before adding someone as well.

<p>I figure that we don't need to be so precise. Let's put it this way, I can <i>define</i> the Restoration as the last of the Stuarts in a direct line (my way of tap dancing around Mary Stuart and Anne Stuart, who are both peripheral but Stuarts), but that doesn't mean that a discussion should follow such rigors. "Restoration literature" ends at different times for different genres. Arguably, it ended in prose in 1688, when the tumult of Whig and Tory meant lots of new satire and economic writing and the beginnings of periodical journalism. Arguably, it ended in theater in 1700. In poetry, it may not have ended until, if you think about it, 1735 (or, if not, then in 1667). It kind of depends on when the <i>next big thing</i> happened. We call it all "Restoration" because it's more homogenous than the other things, not because it obeyed a timeline, and so I think even my overview ought to express this hesitance with definition and voice a willingness to violate chronology. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:48, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mhm. Is it the drama section that's too pedantic, or my post on your page? The section really is just a start. I figured I should discuss the more-or-less standard taxonomy before going on to use it. (And I wanted to say "the bloodbath.") <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 15:14, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's no such thing as too pedantic. My problem is that I can't reference things properly, working as I must from the squishy stuff in my memory and whatever bits of foil I can collect for my nest. (I still have no Internet access at home; I'm doing this from work, to my shame.) You can see now, though, how I thought of proceeding. I have covered, to some small degree, prose and religious writing. These sections are hasty as heck and rife with the sorts of generalizations that overviews have to traffic in. I also added a warning about dating at the head, but that's because I think it's a warning that needs to be offered. After all, I have to go past 1689 to have journalism at all, and yet it's something so almost-formed 1660-1685 that I think it's irresponsible not to discuss it. The big gulp will be poetry. My fingers are too tired for that right now. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:14, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First thing, I'd lose the "this list is incomplete" tag. And 50% of the links are red, so some stubs required. An annotated references section sounds good.

<dd>Thank you, ALoan, your appreciation is appreciated! There's a problem with the online library search link, though: the only remotely complete hitlist would be at the LOC or the British Library, and their links are treacherous.

<p>Hello Bishonen (beautiful boy in Japanese?)</p>
<p>"Soda80, please take your concerns to the talk page instead of automatically reverting." I would be happy to talk or revise any text, however El C reverted repeatedly with no explanation, despite the fact that revision should ideally be used minimally, if I recall correctly. It would be great if you could answer me the simple question of who is obliged to talk first -- the deleter or contributor.</p>
<p>"Please source your claims. Any editor will be quite justified in removing statements based on Wikipedia's own Deep Throat "Some People". The points were taken from the external links at the bottom of the page, which include this argument, such as this one: <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Critical_views_of_Wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Critical_views_of_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Hi, Soda80. You can sign a message on a talk page by typing four tildes, which will convert automagically to your signature (provided you're logged in) and timestamp. Removing unsourced speculative claims from articles is considered proper. I see you had a source, but how was El C to know that? He can hardly be expected to start digging through the external links on the off-chance that one of them will turn out to be your source..! The best thing to do is put in some kind of reference to your source in the place where you make the claim itself: it doesn't have to be perfectly formatted or a proper footnote, somebody else can fix that, as long as you make it clear that "I got it from here". In this case, that would have allowed others to see that your souorce is in fact dubious. I don't blame you--it was among the external links--but if you scroll down to the bottom of the wikinfo page, you'll see that it's a Wikipedia fork: you're using <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> as its own source.

<p>I cannot say I'm surprised at the results of your bold merging, but the effort is appreciated regardless.

<p>Ah. In this case, I was referring to something that, I think, is much more benign. It's just the disambiguation talk page that I was referring to. That other stuff is still under investigation and advisement, and I'd prefer (still) not to address the person until I have a very wide board in my hand. My feeling is that I can craft a nice thick stick away from the drama of personal incommunication and then use it to drop from on high. Not as messy that way, especially emotionally. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:40, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Irish Hospitality is legendary, but Shadwell is not; to describe his contribution as modest is to overestimate its worth. He was an English emigrant who, like so many of his countrymen, had to come to Ireland to fulfil his full potential and is definitly only ever discussed with an Irish cultural context (and hardly ever then).

<p>I, for one, take issue with the <a href="../../../f/a/r/FARC_b65a.html" title="FARC">FARC</a>'s reliance on narcotic sales for financing operations (and since they are the military wing of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombian_Communist_Party_f5d6.html" title="Colombian Communist Party">Colombian Communist Party</a>, I largely direct that criticism to them). A revolutionary struggle needs to draw from the people, and narcotics, in that sense, are a form of international lumpenism.

<dd>Poteen? Peyote? Nothing so crude. It's just the old bardic trance, induced by sipping honey and communing with the great world spirit ("where the bee sucks, there suck I" and all that).

Frightened ye should be, for a bardic satire can raise boils on the skin of its target the size of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrantuohill.html" title="Carrantuohill">Carrantuohill</a> and it with the mist of Ireland crowning its peak. One verse from the poet so inspired can cause the maiden's heart to break for the love of the hero and him in the arms of another, and the strong man to weep for want of his sweetheart.

<dd>I thought .png was supposed to be the preferred format for that, but, anyway, Geogre's images are scans of etchings and woodcuts and stuff—not photos, unless "scan" is a subset of "photo" (it may be, I don't know). I don't really know about formats, but I think these .gifs look great. Take a look at the flea! Incidentally, the big-ass professional subscription database <a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/" class="external text" title="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/" rel="nofollow">EEBO</a>—the complete collection listed in the famous Short-Title Catalogue— gives you a choice of downloading their scans of early books, which is what Geogre has, as either .gifs or .pdfs. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:19, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just for reference, I scanned them using photoshop. I have never seen .png as an option for saving files with Photoshop. If it existed, I'd do it. However, since these are black and white photos (16 color), I use .gif. Gif is a superior format for low-color images and JPEG for high color images. Generally, the file will be smaller as a GIF if b&amp;w than a JPG, but the reverse if there is true color involved. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:13, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A scan is a type of photo. <a href="../../../p/n/g/PNG_5550.html" title="PNG">PNG</a> is a lossless form of compression, so it's suitable for images where you want each pixel to be exactly what you specify, for example icons, diagrams, and graphs.

Not me, man. I'm not vain. Anyhow, I really went to GIF because of the Kyd title page, where there are words. I'll bet that a jpg and gif version of that are dramatically different, with the jpg's text being much harder to read. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:16, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right. Turns out, I hadn't done my job properly. I hadn't drained the color from the channels in Photoshop or told the scanner to use gray scale instead of color, so the sacrifice was made at the outset. I should have scanned in gray scale and then saved as gif. (shrug) Oh, well, live and relearn.

<p>Sheesh. Some people's children have no manners at all. Don't sweat it, Bishonen. It was bound to happen that you'd run across one of the peevish. Simple statistics means you were overdue for an irrational rant from <i>someone.</i> BTW, I also rediscovered a nice <i>folio</i> book of Hogarth's engravings. (Also please for you to note that no one comes along to <i>my</i> user page to tell me what great things I'm doing for literature articles... except you, of course, so I think the balance point is way over toward the good, and you needn't worry about the petulant.) I'll be getting around to Hogarth after a while. I've still got assorted images before I get there.

<dd>Thanks for explaining, and I'll leave it up to you, but I still don't think colloquial local Seattle usage ought to be part of the disambiguation of the word <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish.html" title="Swedish">Swedish</a>. There may be 1,500 playschools all over the US known locally as "Swedish", for all I know. There's very likely a type of candy known in Baltimore as "Swedish", and several cafeterias in Minnesota called "Swedish". If there are these things, they shouldn't be on the disambiguation page, and neither should the Medical Center, IMHO. A Google search <b>for "Swedish Medical Center"</b> lists the Seattle Center as the top hit..&#160;? Uh, so..? How do you mean?

<li>You want theater history? I can help. <a href="../../../s/e/t/Image%7ESettle-Morocco.png_f4c4.html" title="Image:Settle-Morocco.png">Image:Settle-Morocco.png</a> is an engraving of the stage used in the Dorset Garden Theatre for the premiere of Elkannah Settle's <i>The Empress of Morocco</i> in <a href="../../../1/6/7/1673.html" title="1673">1673</a>. So there!</li>
<li>Literacy in the 18th century? Well, I've seen grown men get into fights arguing about when and where the first circulating library was. I know full well that it was somewhere at some time. Beyond that, I won't even guess. However, <a href="../../../n/o/b/Image%7ENobles-library.png_d007.html" title="Image:Nobles-library.png">Image:Nobles-library.png</a> shows an ad for Francis Nobles's library. My source says that Bath had the first in 1725 and "by the 1780's they were everywhere." Well, not everywhere. I was misled by my caption into thinking this was an illustration from the first generation of libraries, but it's clearly not. That woman is wearing Regency clothes. Anyway, Pat Rogers (the caption author) said that libraries were associated with female patronage, and the illustration shows a lady being led about. Oh, and 5 points for anyone who can tell me <i>what the heck that animal on the floor is.</i></li>

<p>Alas, no. I have done what I could with what I have. Unfortunately, no pictures of anyone acting except Garrick, and that's already on the site. I know full well that portraits of that type exist, but I just don't have them. I think they <i>do</i> exist, myself. Given the fact that they'd make engravings for library subscriptions, gallows tickets (in my Wild article), etc., it would be absurd to think that they didn't make their own version of the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farrah_Fawcet_ab0f.html" title="Farrah Fawcet">Farrah Fawcet</a> poster. I'm sure they're all sitting in the National Gallery, too. Once upon a time, I would have thought there weren't any, since scholars and critics writing on theater history haven't put them in books, but, lately, I've begun to believe more strongly in the passion of laziness in all scholars and critics working after 1945.

<p>Okay, but make it accurate please. <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Chettle_48b4.html" title="User:Oliver Chettle">user:Oliver Chettle</a> is defunct (he's a character from a novel by the way). <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGillian_Tipson_3643.html" title="User:Gillian Tipson">user:Gillian Tipson</a> will not be posting again either at this IP. All three accounts should say "has posted" not "is posting".</p>
<p>This saga has been by far the most unpleasant experience I have ever had on the internet. I know I can snap at people sometimes, but I am prepared to reason and to apologise in cases where there appears to be a hope of compromise. I hope that you can see that some part of the blame for this horrible feud lies with Giano, even if only 0.1%. He has caused me great emotional distress, and all I have asked is that he leave me alone. If he has been upset too, ideally I would be sorry, but I am not noble hearted enough for that. I find it astonishing that his ire seems uncooled after five and a half months, and that it made no difference that "Oliver" made contributions which he praised (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatsworth_House_fc30.html" title="Chatsworth House">Chatsworth House</a>) and helped him out when he asked for assistance.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's value is as a reference work. As a "community" it is horrible. Perhaps you know many people who feel differently, but the long standing contributors must mostly be either more thick skinned or more laid back than the average person. I feel sure that large numbers of good contributors must be driven away every month, and I think there should be some means for users to protect themselves without going through long procedures which require them to relive all their bad experiences, and end in feeble and ineffectual punishments. (<a href="../../../i/r/a/User%7EIrate_d7f6.html" title="User:Irate">user:Irate</a> was posting abuse again within 24 hours of his "three month ban", and also sent me obscene emails, though I haven't seen him lately.) Not to mention that powerful users with their established friends are at an unfair advantage in any such proceedings. All I wanted was to be left alone to contribute. I don't have a problem with users who attack me once and move on, but this has been intolerable. The present system doesn't work, and giving people the power to block certain users from posting on their user page would be much more effective at keeping the peace. I believe that very few discussions which would improve Wikipedia would be prevented, and on the other hand more good contributors would be retained. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.35.37.118.html" title="User:82.35.37.118">82.35.37.118</a> 03:40, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again with the leaving you alone? I notice you never had anything to say to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Worldtraveller/Old_stuff_1&amp;diff=11475136&amp;oldid=11474373" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Worldtraveller/Old_stuff_1&amp;diff=11475136&amp;oldid=11474373" rel="nofollow">this</a> cry of distress from myself, not back in March, and not now. Yes, it has been intolerable. Giano quit Wikipedia for a time because of you, and I'm quite surprised at myself that I never did.</dd>
<dd>I was nevertheless very sorry to see you fall foul of the notorious Irate. I did the only thing I could, which was to e-mail you offering to keep his posts off your pages. If you received my message, you didn't have the grace to reply.</dd>
<dd>I will change the reference to your other accounts as you request. If you have more of them, please bear in mind that the way you speak when displeased is characteristic, even unmistakable, so don't expect it to make a lot of difference if you post from a different IP or change to a dynamic IP. SlimVirgin and Giano never had any technical means of identifying your reincarnations. They simply recognized how you talk, and if you go on talking like that, under any name, they will recognize you again.

<p>Sorry.

<p>Absolutely! Thanks a ton. The reference will be in the epic poetry section (the inline ref). I'll add it in, if you can do the reference, since your formatting of that section is superior, to say the least, to mine. The Satire ref isn't exactly what I was thinking of (the one I'm thinking of is his preface to his own translation of <i>The Satires of ____</i> some Roman whose name I forget, and that's why it's called "The Preface to the Satires," but that's for another day), but the one on the epic is perfect for Dryden's talk on the heroic verse.

<p>Thanks to you, I was on Questia today and found a full BOOK on the theory of the epic 1660-1800. Woohoo! (Yes, I know: I'm the only person on earth to find that interesting, but that just proves the Great Chain of Being is true.) Anyway, I'm going to have better references for the Auggie lit article. This person (Swedenberg is his name, of all things) quotes from his sources liberally and has good notes, etc., and he's from 1944, so he's untainted by theoretical neuroses and is still in that generation that had to fight Macaulay tooth and nail.

<p>I looked at the Wesley article to see if I could help. Indeed, that lead was 2 lines. The whole article is dry reiteration of A Child's Book of Protestants or something. Then I thought perhaps I ought to tell the nominator the ways the article could be improved via his talk page. Well. That was something.

Then, though, I saw a reference to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Talk%7EStephen_Spender_74fd.html" title="Talk:Stephen Spender">talk:Stephen Spender</a>, so I went there. Gasp. Unbelievable.

<p>Hey Bishonen, got your message. Look, I'm sorry if I came off brusque in my comment, I didn't mean to suggest the POV or bad writing on the PC page was due to you or anyone else in particular. I sometimes forget that these faceless pages are actually cared for by real people, so I apologize. As for your comments about the page, I agree that the article is in dire need of a rewrite, and that it probably will always be a problem due to passersby adding/changing whatever strikes them as fun or interesting. I would be more than happy to help out in any way I can. I'll comment on the talk page and try to come back to the article every so often...

<p>However, if you look at <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_literature.html#Augustan_literature" title="English literature">English literature#Augustan literature</a> and compare the diffs before and after my last edit, you'll at least see what I <i>want</i> to do with the Auggie Lit article. The Rest Lit article was easier to break down into prose, poetry, drama than the Auggie would be. In this, authors of one are always authors of the other. Pope, Swift, Fielding, and Gay wrote prose, poetry, and drama. Richardson and Smollett are the only one-trick guys in the lot. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:12, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jayjg, Linuxbeak had blocked 207.200.116.132 and WBardwin wrote a message on <a href="../../../l/i/n/User_talk%7ELinuxbeak_c40b.html" title="User talk:Linuxbeak">User talk:Linuxbeak</a>. I noticed it—I'm watching the pages because Linux is doing some heavy vandal-fighting—and unblocked the IP shortly afterwards, say 20:15 UTC. I interfered because I figured Linux might be gone for the weekend, as he hasn't been editing, and WBardwin and maybe others too would have an unconscionable wait. Perhaps you checked for the block after I'd already removed it? I was a little uncertain, since the range wasn't listed on Special:Blockip, but I checked with JRM on IRC and he told me to go ahead and unblock (and then he put the range on the list, too). Thanks for your patience, WBardwin.

<dd>The IP mentioned is an AOL cache proxy and should not be blocked for any length of time. I did some probing in the range and it seems to be wholly or mostly comprised of caches, so I added the range to the exclusion list. We can always narrow it down if that should be necessary, but better safe than sorry. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 22:31, 2005 Jun 24 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately there was a death in my family right around the time of my RFA, so I haven't been able to spend as much time and energy as I would like on Wikipedia stuff.

<dd>Also, thanks a ton for the proofing and adding you've done there. I've been tinkering with the rougher sentences, and there are still some potholes in the prose.

<dd>Thanks for the dates. They were much needed. ("So, did you have a good date?" "I don't know. It says 'January 22.'") BTW, I got e-mailed like crazy from the user I banned earlier. He said his cousin and his brother used his account and vandalized, but not him. I didn't feel like writing back to tell him that letting your cousin or brother at your account is, similarly, grounds for a ban. I suppose I'll go to his talk page and explain it there. Even if he doesn't log in, he can go check the talk page. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:21, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please have a second look at the article. I've removed the examples of POV you noted, but as I wrote the article, I won't be able to easily spot my own two cents in amongst fact.

<li>I'm really happy with how the article is improving with your help. Any criticism I expect to see coming in the FAC will most likely focus on the article's conciseness, and your work has really helped improve that. Most of these long sections came out of the first FAC for the page, when Ambi provided a long list of stuff she thought should be added. Unfortunately, the FAC failed before anyone hada good chance to review my new additions. Please continue reviewing and criticing the article, as I'll take all the outside assistance I can get. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> June 28, 2005 22:35 (UTC)

<li>The FAC is pretty slow at present, but I'd really appreciate it if you'd go over the article thoroughly and weed out any unnecessary stuff you find.

<li>What is IRC? How do you get there&#160;:P? I now its a chat room for Wikipedia, but could you give me a link or something? About the buildings, I think it is important info, but could definitely be shortened. Give me some details about IRC and we'll talk again.

<p>I'm not going to start on IRC just yet (I'm on school holidays here, but need to be doing homework, and am spending too much time on the net as is&#160;:) ), but may start up soon. Anyway, I'm wondering what problems you still see in the article, and how close you are to supporting it for FAC. I'd really like to see this article featured, even if not on the main page, and am going to address some of your problems re: coeducation and the buildings in the next few minutes.

<li>I've fixed up this stuff.

<li>I'll delete that stuff you hid. The halls are set to open late this year, and the opening has been planned since 2003 (the construction is way over the deadline), and its going to be a pretty big deal. I might add a note about the halls then. The Thompson Centre is pretty much just a gym and a room for functions and dinners, so it can go. Thanks for that. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> July 5, 2005 00:05 (UTC)</li>
<li>Very good edit. See, this is the sort of stuff I'd <i>never</i> notice looking over my own work. The student no. in the infobox was a typo; changed "one of the most prestigious independent schools" to "well-regarded independent school". How does that sound? Basically, the APS is <i>very</i> prestigious in Melbourne - think of the Ivy League on a local scale - and needs to sort of show its importance. Granted, I've said that in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Public_Schools_of_Victoria_acab.html" title="Associated Public Schools of Victoria">Associated Public Schools of Victoria</a> article, and I think the new language should be NPOV.

<li>I like the new changes, especially the additions to the lead. I've tried to add the middle school into the first academics paragraph, but feel it shouldn't get a whole explanation right there, so I've given a bookmark to the middle school section. See what you think. Thanks again for your help. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> July 5, 2005 22:26 (UTC)</li>

<p>You brought up Ned Ward, giving me a nasty shock, as I hadn't mentioned the man in the Satire section. Oopsie. London Spy unmentioned? Not good. While we're at it, what about Poor Tom Durfey and Tom Brown? Gulp. Well, I couldn't find online any references at all to <i>Pills for Melancholy</i> that weren't "AMAZING ALL NATURAL VIAGGRA PILLS FOR MELANCHOLY" (plus all other search terms), so I couldn't date it. I did get some Ned Ward info and a smidge of Tom Brown. Far too little, even in an overview. I tsk at myself. Thanks for the dating you've done so far.

<dd>I think I've got it right now, unless you've been edit conflicting me, I darent'look. If you have, I'll just kill you with my bare hands, think of it as Swedish massage. Meanwhile, what the people at FAC are asking for is <b>more</b> inline refs, in the form of either bracketed references or footnotes. The footnote about Nash and Edward VII is <b>long</b>, that's why it needs to be a footnote, but normally I prefer inline references. They're less daunting for the reader, and more immediately visible and informative. Easier to do, also. In fact, I'm going to remove the stupid Blaikie footnote right now, add Blaikie to the references section, and put a short inline reference in place of the note. See how it looks now? That's the way. You're supposed to put in anything from the references section that supports your statements into the text in that very shortened way—surname in brackets only (plus a page reference <a href="../../../i/f/f/Iff.html" title="Iff">iff</a> the support is hard to locate in the book). That's what the people are after. (They may call it "footnotes" but ignore that.) I'd be happy to do it, if I knew which reference supports which statement, but of course I don't. Let me know if any more actual footnotes are wanted, I'll do them, I've got the hang of 'em now. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 28 June 2005 14:58 (UTC)

Anyway I'm done with it. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 29 June 2005 13:11 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pay? Pay? Don't know what you're talking about there, there's no paying. You were just born to be conned by Google shysters, weren't you? Get one of those kids of yours to set up an IRC client (a piece of widely available free software) for you and show you what to do. Don't tell me you've got all those boys and not a useful one among them. As for what us kewl kids talk about on #wikipedia, er.. no, no, you're quite right, I have absolutely no idea.

<p>PENIS Giano, you can hide PENIS any comments you like PENIS by just putting a PENIS in front of it PENIS. Bishonen won't notice it PENIS as long as it's PENIS four words or less.

<dd>Now Geogre, please do not use dirty filthy words on Bishonen's page. That word is particularly bad because it will encourage impressionable young people to touch their "tinkle bells" (that may have lost something in translation) which as we all know will lead to blindness, and walking with a limp and many other infirmities and also as I was once informed by a very senior nun at my old school, "tinkle bells" have a tendency to drop off if manhandled. I was only explaining too <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> earlier today we have to behave in a mature fashion on this site and ignore juvenile behaviour - so I am not going to mention your preoccupation with "tinkle bells" again, but I will just add an aunt of mine had a preoccupation with "tinkle bells" and she came to a very sticky end indeed. Please remember there are young people (not only myself and Filiocht) who are shocked, but also seminary priests etc. who all contribute. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 29 June 2005 17:26 (UTC)

<dd>Download the program mIRC, yes. IRC is just something you do (=Internet Relay Chat), not a program or a download. That site looks like a place to get mIRC from. I can't see nothing about no £30. If you succeed in having to pay for mIRC, you're unique, that's all I can say. Install it and then...oh you want to get to a place called "freenode". (I don't know how, I think it may just appear as an option.) Once you're there, type /join #wikipedia and hit Enter, and you're in. Note the slash, that's part of it. As for the blindness and walking with a limp discussion, I cannot believe it's taking place here, have you guys even noticed where you are? Shoo!

<p>Obviously, Bishonen DOES see the PENISES, and she must know what they are if she's shocked by them. Perhaps we can find out the root of the problem with a little free association. Oh, and Giano is being totally confused by Bishonen's instructions, so that's what <b>I would call</b> low level vandalism. Presumably, she doesn't want Giano to find IRC and therefore find out what she's been saying about him there. Granted, most of it was pretty pitiable and would make us all treat Giano better...considering all the handicaps she's described...but Giano can find the IRC room without trying to "find something called freenode." All he has to do is go to Wikipedia and type "WP:IRC" in the search field. Then he clicks on the <i>FIRST</i> of the channels mentioned, not the second, third, or fifth. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 29 June 2005 23:33 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for reconsidering! No, I can't do that, I'm afraid.

I can protect the page, but only for a short while while differences are being worked out, and I'd like to avoid it. I have just posted a plea to GabrielSimon on the talk page. Some of his edits seem a little extreme, but as long as he's arguing for them in a reasonable way on talk, I'd rather not clobber the discussion with the big Protection Stick. Nobody can really delete any material, after all! It's all still there in the History, and easily restored.

<p>I hit them in textual criticism, in 18th c. stuff looking for things to edit, and in Biblical contexts. I thought they were commonplace. Also, I think I hit them just in <i>reading</i> 18th c. literature. In <i>A Tale of a Tub,</i> Swift has <i>"hic multa dissideratur MSS"</i> several places (where he has the Hack saying that he'll give all the reasons for this or that outlandish statement). It doesn't <i>hurt</i> to expand them, but all the medieval lit. articles are littered with the abbreviation. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 8 July 2005 16:18 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Brian. No, I don't think you should take any action, or me either ATM, as I don't see Njyoder violating his injunctions. That "a tendency to... contribute nothing of value" is rude, I agree, and certainly unnecessarily personal—he ought to be discussing content, not people's "tendencies"!—but calling it a personal attack might be a bit strong.

<p>Can you do the Interregnum? I'd be useless at it. BTW, I read the 1911 on Swift. It's not as bad as the usual 1911, but it still has pontification about his erroneous politics and blatant misanthropy. He failed to have the true love of a patriot, it said, for he hated vice without loving truth. How about Sensibility? I can't do that, either. I could do Romantics, but it's already done well enough, and, while I know great amounts about it, I don't know the history in its minutia the way I do my own period. Without Reform Bill and Napoleon, which are both just nouns to me, any article on the Romantics is silly stuff. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:46, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

It didn't even stop to think about it, not a moment of hesitation, attempting to come to terms with bread falling from the sky (and note, significantly, than I have no memory of that particular squirrel), started munching.

<dd>Thank you for the sandwich. I could barely open my mouth wide enough to take in both loaves and the wheel of cheese at the same time. Since I just ate at Mary's Kitchen (why isn't there a wikipedia article on it? it affects hundreds of lives, and it's an old building, and notability isn't in the deletion guidelines), that was a nice supplement. My goal in the Augustan drama article is to explain why "there was no drama in the Augustan period." What I like about the article is that I think I present the case so that readers understand very well why no one studies Augustan drama, why there "wasn't any." At least I satisfied my own curiosity on the subject. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:51, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Is it more "dramatic?" Is it an explanation you've heard before?

<p>Impossible! I go to look for "spectacle 18th century," and I come across a number of sites. Everyone mentions it. No one actually discusses it. Staging sites are potentially useful, but they're all "under construction" for the last few years. Then I go to look for "Addison Cato" to document what we all know about it, and things are fishy as a sailor's net: all the sites are either a) American libertarians or b) Objectivists or c) both. What they say is useful, but heck if I'm going to cite one of those hare brains. I'll have to do the research on Questia or not at all.

<p>You were very helpful last time I was blocked from contributing due to the ongoing AOL IP multiple user problem. Looks like, from Jwrosenzweig's talk page, that this vandal is or may be permanently blocked. During the previous incident (please see my talk page), you and other admins decided that the IP number should not be blocked for any length of time. Could you intervene and see if a permanent solution to this issue could be found?

Suddenly I feel a strong force pulling me towards the Village Pump.&#160;:-). No, I think I'll keep it casual this time. But it's nice to see that everything has remained as I left it (give or take 125 000 articles).

<p>Thanks! On a related note, how about putting your other classic-era English theatre articles out in Wikispace?

Hogarth's 1733 <i>Southwark Fair</i> detail.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here are notes on this detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detail information, from Shesgreen, Sean. <i>Engravings by Hogarth: 101 Prints</i>. New York: Dover Publications, 1975. Page/plate 27.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"In 'Southwark Fair' Hogarth plays on the incongruities between the high and low, the sublime and the ridiculous that appear in the scene. Exalted forms of art and entertainment (or what pass for these), many of them employng mythic subject matter, are being performed literally above the heads of the crowd. On the ground scenes from common life take place along with entertainments of a criminal or firvolous nature. At several pooints the high and the low mingle in a chaotic human circus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"At the extreme left the stage collapses (in a pun on the play, <i>The Fall of Bajazet</i>), heaving earthward, with complete loss of dignity, a company of regally costumed players who include the famous Cibber and Bullock. They fall into a china shop and onto a dice player and a gambler who are too engaged in a dispute to hear the warning of the latter's child.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The showcloth below the terrified monkey, 'The Stage Mutiny,' is a copy of a print by John Laguerre. It portrays a rift in the Drury Lane theatre that occurred after it was taken over by John Highmore, a gentleman turned amateur actor and director. Under the banner 'We'l Starve em out,' Highmore, who had bought control of the theater, points to a scroll reading 'it Cost L6000.' On his side are the company's scene painer, part-owner Mrs. Wilks (in mourning) and her daughter. Between the opposing factions hangs a monkey, Highmore's surrogate, protesting, 'I am a Genleman.' Under the banners 'Liberty &amp; property' and 'We eat,' Theophilus Cibber ('Pistol's alive') and the bulk of the actors advance on the owners. Colly Cibber, who has sold his shares to Highmore, sits apart from the fray, 'Quiet and Snug,' with a money bag on his lap. The showcloth for a freak show below this one advertises the presence of a giant."</dd>

<p>Hey, Bishonen, there's this site called Wikipedia. I'm on it, like, all the time. You should check it out. It's kind of addictive, though, so don't edit articles, or you'll get hooked. It has this amazing ability to seem perfectible, even though it isn't, so you get suckered into continually thinking that you can make a difference, get rid of the bad, and supply the good. When you find out that the bad is like an ocean tide and that the good is like a towel under the door, you'll probably storm off. However, you end up coming back, thinking that you'll "just" do this or that, and that it'll be ok. Pretty soon, you find yourself trying to swap towels and run the drier. It's this cycle, until you realize that it's not perfectible, and you decide to just try to keep the old set of family photos dry or try to throw a life preserver to people you see out there who don't have boats. Anyway, so that's my welcome. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:47, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, babe. keep in mind that the person posting the copyrighted stuff, is probably someone in advertisement or marketing, which means they are impervious to instructions such as "how to submit an article" or "please do not submit copyrighted material".

<dd>Bah, you silly man. Have you by any chance got, or do you know <b>of</b>, any books with nice *old* illustrations relevant to late 17th c theatre design, that I could scan and nick? I have access to plenty of good diagrams of modern reconstructions and toy models, but of course those are copyright. This is a famous section of perhaps Drury Lane by perhaps Wren, but unfortunately Drury Lane isn't that interesting for my purposes, I want Dorset Garden preferably. And drawings of the flying machines! French and Italian theatres of the right period also of interest. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 14:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding your sarcastic edit summary: Yes I did see it, but I feel my prose to be superior, capturing the essence and spirit of that golden age of literature which has alway so inspired me, why I remember as a small child at school high in the Sicilian mountains, we children used to sing that glorious opera, with the bleating of the goats joining us during the chorus - Oh I can hear it now as as we rode our goats convincingly disguised as camels, through the olive groves, infront of the makeshift pyramids as poor old Don Watsit was tortured by the inquisition - Oh happy days</p>

<p>Ok, I put a couple of questions on the talk page. Also, though, I was going to point out, and this is gassy in that charming way that my comments can be gassy, that the image I sent you from "Southwark Fair" shows the Revolt of the Theatres, right? Well, the rich man who bought out Covent Garden is supported by the scene painter. N.b. today a scene painter would never rate highly enough to be depicted as one of the principal and vital personages in a theater revolt. The fact that she was then shows what you're talking about in the article.

<p>Good idea, taking an IRC break. IRC is a disease, not a protocol, and it is the enemy of writing articles. It's also an invitation to every block battle and pogrom Wikipedia has.

<p>Thanks for the pictures for Elias. Scans of (sufficiently) old books and prints definitely fall under Bridgeman, or at least that's been my assumption. Anyway, to tell you the truth, I was starting to get a little bit nervous about the old "firestorm of indifference" over the FAC, but then again the whole thing always wigs me out more than it should. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPRiis_d9fa.html" title="User:PRiis">PRiis</a> 22:28, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ha ha, you take these things too seriously, remember it's only the Internet! There are some real copyright hawks watching FAC, so my feeling was that by saying what I did out there, in full view of the basilisks, we might finally find out what the latest official policy <b>is</b> on image copyright. It's been discussed a lot on the mailing list recently, and I've been a bit surprised at what a lot of arguments it's possible to make against the Bridgeman principle. It shouldn't do any harm to old Elias, at least—if he gets uncomfortably hot, you can always just remove them! Bookcovers are a bit of a counsel of desperation, anyway—not quite the most fascinating illustrations in the world. Still, there's a nice bit of text on the <i>Theatrum</i>—"faithfully" collected!—and I like the way it's <b>pink</b>, too. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:26, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are correct. I only used your edit as the easiest way to highlight the user's comments, not to imply that you were a participant in a revert war. The difference between <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">user:Func</a>'s edits and mine is minor but, I think, significant. Func removed all traces of the comments and provided no reason or alternative location where the complaint <i>should</i> be made. In doing so, he/she gave the impression that the edit was made as an objection to the speech itself and reinforced the anon's claims of "censorship". Your edit, in contrast, clearly documented that comments had been removed and cited an appropriate policy. While reasonable people could disagree with whether or how the policy should have been applied, it was much harder for the anon to make the claim of "censorship". (See <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_Temp_51eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks/Temp">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks/Temp</a> for a proposed modification of the guideline which standardizes your approach as the preferred method of redacting personal attacks.) I thought that my approach would "stick" where Func's had not because I also was citing an established rule and attempting to establish that "censorship" had no part in the motivation. Obviously, my approach also backfired. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a>

<p>Good afternoon, Bishonen. Thank you for your articulate reply. Unfortunately, we are still talking at cross-purposes, neither I think hearing what the other is trying to say. You ask some interesting questions that we could continue to discuss theoretically but I don't believe that it would change anything at this point. Since this continuing discussion is raising my stress level to no productive end, I have taken the step of purging the discussion off my Talk page. I apologize if what I said or did appeared insensitive. That was not my intent.</p>

<p>I just left this same word over at Geogre's talk page. The more admins, the merrier. I've been going round and round with two rather contentious users as of late who are either one and the same or working in cahoots. They are rude, their edit summaries are even ruder and I for one feel they need some talking to. They are <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">User:Mirror Vax</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">User:Sherurcij</a>. That last one in particular has been hanging stub notices off of vandal bot entries and leaving the rudest edit summaries you've ever read. The first guy just has a bad attitude in general. Never heard of him before he flamed my talk page. Can you help? - Lucky 6.9 21:56, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had, but, well, no, I wasn't looking for a project. Instead, I kind of thought that I was bringing stuff up. Nevermind. Anyway, I thought I'd hinted rather broadly. A telescoping of John Dennis could do the trick, you know? ("One reason we lack information is that stage machines were trade secrets. As such, the houses were zealously guarding their techniques, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dennis_9400.html" title="John Dennis">John Dennis</a>'s comment on "steal(ing) my thunder" shows us that machines would remain closely held information in the theater for long after the era of the Machine House." That's what I mean by telescoping -- a way of dropping in the definite information we have (prob. in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dennis_9400.html" title="John Dennis">John Dennis</a> article) in a place where we wish we had information and allowing the known to imply the unknown. It's totally honest, but a rhetorical trick. (And I either explain too much, like this, or be cryptic, I suppose.)) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:43, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(Not a project, just a stub for the redlink!) But that would mean a sentence you can't understand until after you click on a link? Unless you already know about Dennis, which is kind of remote. I do have a prejudice against them. I try—prolly fail—to make it so the reader who just wants to read straight through is able to follow the thread.

<p>(I won't write a stub. Seriously, it gives me the hives to think of writing only what I can off my head for some of those. They'd have to be researched.) I still think that it's possible to telescope and not destroy the historical integrity of your article, partly because Dennis's comment is so strong, so clear, and so striking. His comment is extremely effective for a reader who doesn't appreciate the topic in communicating the stakes, and there isn't anything else we can lay our hands on easily that communicates so strongly. Anyway, this is not an argument, just an explanation. Never mind.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>.5 cup butter</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 cups <i>sifted</i> cake flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>.5 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
<li>.75 cup of milk</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
<li>Cream the butter very well, adding the sugar gradually, and cream until fluffy.</li>
<li>If mixing by hand, beat in the eggs one at a time; else put them all in.</li>
<li>Add the vanilla to the milk.</li>
<li>Sift the flour with the baking powder and salt.</li>
<li>Add the flour and the milk, alternatingly, and <b>fold</b> (not beat) into batter.</li>
<li>Turn the mixture into either
<ol>
<li>two greased (with butter for best results, but with whatever you've got if you don't feel like it) and floured 8" or 9" layer cake pans or</li>
<li>a single 10" x 13" x 2" sheet cake pan or</li>
<li>a single bundt pan (what I used).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, if you're doing two pans, or 35 minutes, for a single pan.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cake will pull away from the pan edges when done, or you can push down with your finger in the center of the cake and see it spring back to test for doneness. Let the cake cool on a wire rack, and frost it when done. My frosting was a caramel frosting that is a bit more like a glaze than a true frosting, but it's absolutely fantastic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:16, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. What's "vanilla"? Vanilla sugar? There's one regular and one turbo vanilla sugar at the store, there are also vanilla pods. What's cake flour? Don't know what a bundt pan is, but I'll use my wit on that one. Cream until fluffy, hmm. I love those instructions to do something "until" SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN. You know, "bake until golden brown". Yeah, right, that'll be the day the cows come home.

<p>That's exactly right!&#160;:-) As for the rest, umm, use lightly salted butter, and butter counts (not margarine). With the milk, you're better off with whole milk than skimmed milk, but 2% milkfat is ok. Just don't drop the milkfat content lower than that, or it doesn't give the happiness molecules anything to bond onto. (It's going to trun lightly brown. The big thing is to remember that dark pans reduce baking time, and shiny pans increase it. Also, I really recommend using a fingerful or two of butter to rub all over the inside of the pan. You can also use confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar) instead of flour, esp. if you're not planning to frost the cake. If you don't frost it, apply some confectioner's sugar to the pan atop the butter you put down, and then top the cake with hand-made whipped cream with sugar and then dash lots of grated fuit or cinamon on top.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:36, 27 July 2005 (UTC) the master baker.</p>

<p>Ok. I still think that a tiny bit saying that it doesn't end is a good thing. If you disagree, cut it.

<p>I greatly appreciate your tactfulness in pointing out that my edit was intrusive. I apologize. Of course I wear the newbie "cloak of no blame", but while that's an explanation it's perhaps not an excuse. Point taken. Thank you. As to the word at issue, I can well imagine that your sources constructed a use context that let the word work well for them. Your sense of the word is now formed by that. Problem is, I do not have the benefit of that exposure, nor will most of the article's readers. I was only drawn to make the point because you write very well and I felt that word as a distinct "bump" in an otherwise well paved road. As to the title, I like your suggestion fine. But do you have to worry about getting search terms into the title? I don't understand the searchability issues. Again, thank you for your kind forbearance. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohanus_dbc0.html" title="User:Johanus">Johanus</a> 18:30, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Permit me a final point in defense of my suggested phrase. "Innovatively" is in no way redundant with respect to "first time" later in the sentence. The word characterizes an enterprise as having been done "creatively" with no implication of its place in a possible temporal sequence. Thus this stuff might have been innovatively employed not just initially, but intermittantly, reliably, chronically, tediously, constantly, etc. Best regards, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohanus_dbc0.html" title="User:Johanus">Johanus</a> 19:59, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My only concern is that folks from Italy may be less amused by the choice of graphic than I would hope. After all, the actual Red Brigades did some rather nasty stuff. The <i>natural</i> pun was "Admin Rouge" and to adapt the logo/banner from the Khmer Rouge, but that would have been unquestionably offensive. Anyway, having Photoshopped an ensign, I thought of having the Association of Rouge Administrators on Meta, since everyone has to have an association on meta (it's in the project bylaws) that they belong to whose aims are contrary to the rest of the project's. I even thought that, for fun, the text of said page could be ROT-13. Then I figured, "What the hell. I'm just one guy, and the joke'll be long dead in a few days.
