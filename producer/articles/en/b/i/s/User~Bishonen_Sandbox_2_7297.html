	    <p>I'm certainly not part of any group of users habitually defending Ghirlandajo; in fact in the only dialogue I've had with him, in April of this year, he was wounding and inconsiderate, and I've given him a wide berth ever since. Nevertheless, I urge arbcom to reject this case. In fact I urge Cowman109 to withdraw it. I believe, after a sampling of Ghirlandajo's more recent contributions, that he is already well on the way to communicating on-wiki with more consideration for others. (Or that he <i>was</i>, as the circumstances around his recent 3-hour block and around this RFAr will surely tend to the opposite effect.) The recent diffs posted by Cowman on ANI are IMO by no means personal attacks or incivilities, they're mere expressions of opinion in appropriate venues. I clicked on them lazily, expecting to have my preconceptions confirmed—"oh, yeah, Ghirlandajo, rude bugger"—and was astonished to see what kinds of edits are now being called "incivility and trolling". Please just look at them, <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> lays them out above. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=74121124#Ghirlandajo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=74121124#Ghirlandajo" rel="nofollow">ANI discussion</a> following on Cowman's list of diffs, some strong protests were lodged against the treatment of Ghirlandajo, and incomprehension of why these diffs were even being posted (a puzzlement I share). See especially the fully argued <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=73973501&amp;oldid=73972751" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=73973501&amp;oldid=73972751" rel="nofollow">comment by Irpen</a> on Tony Sidaway's actions (<i>"dangereous, unwarranted and harmful"</i>, as italicized by Irpen). What Tony did was post a warning on <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">User talk:Ghirlandajo</a> that referred to the edits in question as "gross incivility and what appear to be trolling or deliberately inflammatory comments"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73958160" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73958160" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (IMO a provocative description) and then he blocked Ghirlandajo for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=73959887&amp;oldid=73958332" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ghirlandajo&amp;diff=73959887&amp;oldid=73958332" rel="nofollow">this response</a>. The block reason given is "Unreasonable and defiant response to request to tone down after multiple instances of gross incivility"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway&amp;page=User%3AGhirlandajo" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Tony+Sidaway&amp;page=User%3AGhirlandajo" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I'm flabbergasted by this. "Unreasonable" might equally well be applied to Tony's insistence that these edits are grossly incivil, and as for <i>defiant</i>, WTF? (That stands for "What The Flap-doodle".) Users don't get to <i>defy</i> admins now—that's a block reason? What are we, 19th-century headmasters at a really strict <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public school</a>? If this kind of treatment "encourages" Ghirlandajo to be more civil, I'll eat my cascading style sheets—where's the realistic psychology? There is too much blocking for putative, subjectively defined (as there is no other way of defining them), "NPA violations", and it only seems to be getting worse. The idea of blocking an editor one finds abrasive in order to give him/her "time to cool down" or an "opportunity" for introspection or whatever (a notion also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=72944334&amp;oldid=72909730" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=72944334&amp;oldid=72909730" rel="nofollow">mooted</a> in the recent <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">User:Giano</a> debacle) seems to me to be mere <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspeak.html" title="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>, and just about equally patronizing as planting officious warning templates on established users. Did anybody ever improve in civility, let alone introspection, by being talked down to in this way?<br />
The most important point I want to make is that I think Ghirlandajo had already seen the light and was being much more collegiate. This impression I've formed from a sampling of his recent contribs. Of course I may have missed stuff, but Of course I may have missed stuff, but better-informed editors are saying the same thing above, I see. (See statement by <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr">Grafikm_fr</a>). I believe that the complaints made at the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ghirlandajo" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ghirlandajo" rel="nofollow">RFC</a> which is listed as evidence above and which was brought in December 2005, are essentially obsolete. I would fully endorse Ghirlandajo's request for more recent evidence. Finally, it's not an admin job, or even an arbcom task, to fix people. Yes, Ghirlandajo probably does think the project needs him more than he needs it; yes, he goes on a <i>lot</i> about his contributions; yes, it's annoying; so? I'm annoying, you're annoying. Wikipedia is not the bed of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procrustes.html" title="Procrustes">Procrustes</a> for reworking people's personalities all into the same approved mold. For instance, and this is just one minor example, we're not all Americans. There needs to be room in the project for a fiery Sicilian like Giano, a rancorous Swede like me, an ... annoying Russian like Ghirla. To some of us, the dominant American/British wiki discourse (which I'll refrain from offering any stereotype of) can even be annoying in and of itself. More headroom, please. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:11, 6 September 2006 (UTC).</p>

Matt Crypto puts it very well, but Elonka has heard these points eloquently expressed before. As explained in my top post, the reason I took the problem to ANI in the first place was that many people had been trying to explain about dispute resolution to her, in a nice friendly way, but had gotten nowhere. (Here are the diffs again, a small selection out a a large material: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36724847&amp;oldid=36705177" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36724847&amp;oldid=36705177" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36905616&amp;oldid=36905202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36905616&amp;oldid=36905202" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36558971&amp;oldid=36557982" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36558971&amp;oldid=36557982" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36799795&amp;oldid=36797548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36799795&amp;oldid=36797548" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Obsessive typo corrections aside, Elonka's responses are just the next post along.) Her responses ask, puzzledly, how <i>else</i> she's going to "make DreamGuy be polite", get satisfaction, get her apology, and get the criticisms of her removed. Or else she explains that she's too famous to "walk away". Either she just doesn't get it or she doesn't want to get it. I don't oppose the reduction of the block; a week is a hefty block. In fact I'd be glad to see Elonka unblocked immediately, if she <i>now</i> showed any signs of getting it, but I don't see any such signs on her <a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">talkpage</a> or her <a href="http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.elonka.com/wikipedia" rel="nofollow">new site</a>.

<p>Astounding PAs on Android's page. "Sociopathic tendencies". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36889173" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36889173" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Followed up by astounding hypocrisy about skirting actually <i>calling</i> DG a sociopath (classic wikilawyering). "I know that it would be improper for me to accuse DreamGuy of being a sociopath: However, I do stand by my statement that "an admin with sociopathic tendencies" would be a bad thing for Wikipedia." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36893060" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Android79&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36893060" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Oh, LOL again. "The users who support DreamGuy say "file the RfC, get it over with," and the users who support me, say either to wait, or don't do it at all. These two sides make me very confused. Wouldn't those who support me <i>want</i> the RfC, and those against me to counsel against it? Why is it the other way around? I'm still not understanding something.&#160;:/" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36905202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=36905202" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<p>Uncivil and untrue comments on Bishonen. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36907384&amp;oldid=36906753" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36907384&amp;oldid=36906753" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>The rest of those are on Elonka's talk and my talk. Her grimly joking message on Jan 23 asking EnglishRose to help her harass DG so he'll delete more posts on his page and help her build her "case" is also on Elonka's page.</p>

<p>WTF? Here shes suddenly offering advice on "any other questions about Wikipedia structure or etiquette", in a post clearly designed to give the impression <i>she'</i>s one of the "experienced users" she mentions.

<p>In my opinion it's time to block <a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">User:Elonka</a> for her ongoing smear campaign against DreamGuy, as she has been impervious to all suggestions that she stop voluntarily, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36724847&amp;oldid=36705177" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36724847&amp;oldid=36705177" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36905616&amp;oldid=36905202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Encyclopedist&amp;diff=36905616&amp;oldid=36905202" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36558971&amp;oldid=36557982" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36558971&amp;oldid=36557982" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>; see especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36799795&amp;oldid=36797548" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=36799795&amp;oldid=36797548" rel="nofollow">this</a> kindly and exemplary message from <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a>.

<p>Very recently, <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastanea_dentata_a7aa.html" title="User:Castanea dentata">Castanea dentata</a>, who has been having a disagreement with DG over templates, has joined in dialogue with Elonka, as well as contributed to her "DreamGuy dispute" subpage: "You should know that this user is probably several users and I suspect a couple of admins all rolled into one... formatted exactly as another user who also displays similar sociopathic behavior. One award is from Haukur Þorgeirsson who also is associated with one Dieter Bachman and one Padraig somethingorother each of whom frequent many of the same pages as DreamGuy (myths).

If you revert it, then it will either fix the page or force him to revert it a fourth time. It will also induce him to blank more templates, as he threatens in the history, <i>which will help you immensely</i>". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=37162722&amp;oldid=37157523" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Elonka&amp;diff=37162722&amp;oldid=37157523" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> (my italics).

<p>I don't think any wikipedian needs to put up with this persecution, let alone a constructive and useful contributor like DreamGuy (even if he <i>is</i> of less than perfect tact).

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_Sandbox_2_7297.html" title="Edit section: Hollow Wilerding's block extended for block evasion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hollow Wilerding's block extended for block evasion</span></h3>
<p>64.231.128.57 immediately above is according to Kelly Martin's CheckUser check <b>probably being used by Hollow Wilerding</b>. It's in the same dynamic address range as the IP Hollow Wilerding posted from before she was blocked; it could theoretically have been used by another customer of the same ISP. But I don't believe that for a moment. (And no, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> actually <i>doesn't</i> mean "pretend you're stupid"; it means <i>assume</i> good faith, and if the assumption is disproved, so be it.) Here are some curious coincidences besdies CheckUser:</p>
<ol>
<li>The newbie anon is a wholehearted supporter of HW, which, not to put too fine a point on it, is a very unusual attitude outside of the small flock of users who live in HW's computer. No single user voted Support on HW's RFA.</li>
<li>HW has specifically expressed frustration at not being able to post to WP:ANI, and the anon has remedied that by moving a selected post from her talkpage here. The anon also actually raises the same point. Another similarity is that they share the same obsession with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, perhaps the only policy "they" know the name of, yet probably not the first that most people would refer to in a case like this.</li>
<li>After posting here, 64.231.128.57 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/64.231.128.57" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/64.231.128.57" rel="nofollow">went on to edit</a> several pop music articles, which is HW's great interest on Wikipedia. <i>Please note especially that the anon edited two articles, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garlic.html" title="Garlic">Garlic</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, that have nothing in common except the special interest HW takes in bringing them to FAC quality</i>, as shown on her talkpage (now deleted, but see the history).</li>
<li>64.231.128.57 talks like HW. Some people may consider this a subtle point, but I'm confident they'll know what I mean if they've read HW's articles before copyediting, or her input on talkpages. HW's writing style is very characteristic. Consider for instance the anon's phrase "over-powered admins whom have the ability to taunt oneself a bad name".</li>
</ol>
<p>IMO these points together easily amount to 100% certainty. I've blocked 64.231.128.57 for 8 hours only, on Kelly Martin's advice, to minimize any risk of collateral damage. I have also extended Hollow Wilerding's block to two weeks, starting now, for egregious block evasion and the attempt above to falsely insinuate support for her position as expressed <a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHollow_Wilerding_0116.html" title="User talk:Hollow Wilerding">on her talkpage</a> (go read it, folks!). If any more IPs from the same range should appear to edit HW's special-interest articles and/or support her position, I encourage admins to block them on sight. --<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 20:01, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't doubt that there are others out there.

Even though Beckjord's cryptozoological opinions are, er, non-mainstream, he might well have some worthwhile material to contribute, but it value is negated by his disruptive insistence on "owning" the articles and having them express his own views. Thereby he keeps lots of good contributors dishearteningly busy arguing with and reverting him and his socks, and he keeps the articles themselves in a miserable, battle-locked, low-quality state. I'm sorry to say this, but instead of a "contributor" to the encyclopedia, he's a mere drain on it.</p>
