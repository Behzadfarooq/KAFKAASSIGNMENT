<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>Bismallah requested the testimony of his brother. The President of his Tribunal ruled that his brother’s testimony would be relevant. But the request from the Department of Defense to the Department of State to request the Afghanistan embassy to request the Afghan civil service to help locate Bismallah’s brother didn’t produce any replies. So his Tribunal’s President ruled his brother’s testimony “not reasonably available”.</p>

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>

<p>Bismallah’s Board convened on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Guantanamo counter-terror analysts compiled factors for and against the continued detention of each of the captives who remained in detention in December 2005, with the exception of ten captives who were to face charges before a military commission, and the remaining captives from the 38 who had been determined, by their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, not to have been "enemy combatants" after all. The "Summary of Evidence" memo that contained these factors always broke the factors into those that "favor continued detention", and those that "favor release or transfer". The factors that favor continued detention were always broken down into subcategories, like <b>"Intent", "Training", "Commitment"</b>. The factors listed in each subcategory were always numbered. Most transcripts recorded the categories and subcategories. Most transcripts recorded the factor's numbering. But Bismallah's transcript doesn't.</p>

<li><i>Activity by United States Special Force teams in Gereshk, Afghanistan was monitored by Afghan military on duty at checkpoints throughout the city.
