<p><b>Bishop Carroll High School</b> is a Catholic <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> located in Ebensburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Bishop Carroll has long been known for its dominance in academic excellence, sports, and graduate success.</p>
<p>Mascot: Huskies</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
<p>Through the efforts of the Most Reverend J. Carroll McCormick, D.D., Bishop of Altoona-Johnstown Diocese, plans were made for the needed expansion of facilities to serve secondary Catholic education in central and northern Cambria County in late 1960 and early 1961. Prior to this point, Bishop Howard J. Carroll had established St. Joseph Academy for Girls and Aquinas Hall for Boys, both in Ebensburg, in September 1959.</p>
<p>St. Joseph Academy, on Honor Street, welcomed its first class in September 1959 in the building that was the former St. Joseph Infant Home. One hundred forty-seven girls registered for the first school year. The building has now been converted into an apartment property.</p>
<p>Aquinas Hall, formerly the Ebensburg Inn, was built by David E. Park, head of the Crucible Steel Company, in 1900. Aquinas Hall stands on the 34 acre tract of land which is home for Bishop Carroll High School. Registration for the fall of 1959 showed an enrollment of one hundred fifty-one boys. Aquinas Hall is now home to the Nulton Digonostics.</p>
<p>The new facility was named in honor of the fourth Bishop of the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese, Howard J. Carroll. Ground breaking ceremonies took place on March 8, 1961. Dedication was held on June 10, 1962, with the most Reverend John J. Krol, Archbishop of Philadelphia present. Bishop Carroll High School became the new identity for the merger of Aquinas Hall and St. Joseph's Academy.</p>
<p>The campus includes playing fields and seven buildings. Six of these, an art area and band room, a science wing with biology, chemistry, and physics labs, three classroom wings with a home-ec department, and a chapel-library-computer room-main office area, are all inter-connected and arranged around a central courtyard. The seventh building, a gymnasium, is connected to the main building by two underground halls. Situated atop "Husky Hill," the attractive red brick and glass structures are designed to provide students and faculty with as many perspectives as possible to the surrounding countryside. The scenic splendor cannot help but inspire thoughts of the beauty and grandeur of God's world.</p>
<p><b>PHILOSOPHY</b></p>
<p>Bishop Carroll High School is a Catholic, co-educational secondary school, which acknowledges that each child is a unique creation of God with dignity and talents. Its faith challenges members of the school community to cherish each child: spirit, heart, mind and body. BCHS strives to educate the total person in an atmosphere of love, discipline and honor.</p>
<p>The school fosters growth in the Catholic Faith in knowledge and in virtue. As a Catholic Community, it is called to provide spiritual direction and reinforcement so that its students will live to express their faith, demonstrating compassion and respect in their loving service to others. All members of the community are called to be role models of the Catholic faith and of the Gospel commandment of love.</p>
<p>Bishop Carroll provides a supportive environment where students can acquire academic knowledge and strive for academic excellence. Faculty and staff stress that it is equally important to learn to think critically, to discern truth wisely, to live by high ethical standards, and to think and act independently according to gospel values.</p>
<p>This faith centered community acknowledges that the best possible students are products of vital interacting forces--the Catholic Church with all of its traditions and teachings, a challenging curriculum, a dedicated staff, active families, and a community that offers learning opportunities and support. To enrich the learning experiences of our students this school enlists the aid of many generous, talented people from the community and church.</p>
<p>Bishop Carroll High School continues to provide an atmosphere where students are prepared for the educational and employment challenges of the future. It strives to empower young people to be role models of the Catholic faith, sustain an intellectual curiosity about the world, remain joyous in their humanity, and demonstrate love in their personal relationships and service to others.</p>
