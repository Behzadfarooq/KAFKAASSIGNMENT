<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Maria_Visconti_9400.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h3>
<p>Born near <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settimo_Pavese_9df6.html" title="Settimo Pavese">Settimo Pavese</a>, Bianca Visconti was the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimate.html" title="Illegitimate">illegitimate</a> daughter of <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filippo_Maria_Visconti_c330.html" title="Filippo Maria Visconti">Filippo Maria Visconti</a>, Duke of Milan and last of the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visconti.html" title="Visconti">Visconti</a> rulers, and Agnese del Maino, the only person the shy, secluded Filippo ever loved. The couple had a second daughter, Caterina or Lucia, also born in Settimo in <a href="../../../1/4/2/1426.html" title="1426">1426</a>, but she died shortly after her birth <a href="http://www.sardimpex.com/Visconti/viscontiducali.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sardimpex.com/Visconti/viscontiducali.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>When she was six months old, Bianca and her mother were sent to a castle in <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbiategrasso.html" title="Abbiategrasso">Abbiate</a>, where a rich residence had been established for the two of them. The Duke spent much of his time in Abbiategrasso, where he was impressed by Bianca's strong character.</p>
<p>Bianca spent her childhood and adolescence in Abbiategrasso, where she received a humanist education. The Ducal library contained a wide variety of works: Latin classics, narrative texts in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proven%C3%A7al.html" title="Provençal">Provençal</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, scientific and didactical works, as well as texts in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a> and <i>volgare</i>, mainly by Tuscan authors. Both Bianca and her father were passionate hunters and lovers of horses.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Maria_Visconti_9400.html" title="Edit section: Marriage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/4/3/1430.html" title="1430">1430</a>, at the age of six, Bianca was <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrothed.html" title="Betrothed">betrothed</a> to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condottiero.html" title="Condottiero">condottiero</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_I_Sforza_6974.html" title="Francesco I Sforza">Francesco I Sforza</a> of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Sforza_345b.html" title="House of Sforza">House of Sforza</a>, a man twenty-four years older than her. In that year the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condottieri.html" title="Condottieri"><i>condotta</i></a> (contract) between Milan and Sforza came to an end, and the betrothal was a move to keep the powerful general tied with Milan. It has also been suggested that Visconti enticed Sforza with the promise of appointing him as legitimate heir to the Dukedom. Sforza probably also accepted because of the rich dowry, which included territories in the areas of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cremona.html" title="Cremona">Cremona</a>, Castellazzo and Bosco Frugarolo. The contract was signed on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_23.html" title="February 23">February 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/3/1432.html" title="1432">1432</a>, in the castle of Porta Giovia, the Visconti residence in Milan. Bianca's official spokesperson was her godfather, Andrea Visconti, general of the Humiliates order. The presence of Bianca and her mother at the ceremony is not certain; according to some sources, she visited Milan for the first time when she was already of marrying age.</p>
<p>In the following years, the suspicious Filippo Maria tried two times to dissolve the betrothal with the ambitious Sforza: in <a href="../../../1/4/3/1434.html" title="1434">1434</a>, after the latter had sided with <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Eugene_IV_9b21.html" title="Pope Eugene IV">Pope Eugene IV</a>, who sent him to fight Milan, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Gonzaga_6715.html" title="Carlo Gonzaga">Carlo Gonzaga</a>, the son of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_of_Mantua_3587.html" title="Marquis of Mantua">Marquis of Mantua</a>, was contacted. The later project of betrothing Bianca with <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonello_d%27Este_c0e1.html" title="Leonello d'Este">Leonello d'Este</a>, marquis of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrara.html" title="Ferrara">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modena.html" title="Modena">Modena</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggio.html" title="Reggio">Reggio</a>, was only a political move to pressure Sforza to leave the alliance formed by the Republic of Venice/Venice against Milan. Bianca's trip to Ferrara at that time (September 1440) was also her first confirmed trip outside Abbiategrasso. The attempt to force Sforza to change alliances was fruitless, and Bianca returned to her castle in April 1441.</p>
<p>In the same year <a href="../../../n/i/c/Niccol%C3%B2_Piccinino_ab48.html" title="Niccolò Piccinino">Niccolò Piccinino</a>, captain of the Milanese troops, created difficulties for Francesco; he asked Visconti for lordship of <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piacenza.html" title="Piacenza">Piacenza</a> in return for his capture of Sforza. Visconti then moved toward reconciling with Sforza, suspending hostilities and sending him peace proposals, together with the proxy for the marriage with Bianca.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a> of 1441, Filippo Maria issued a decree reducing the rights of his vassals, Francesco included. The latter preferred to establish himself in the safer territory of Venice/Veneto, in the hamlet of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanguinetto.html" title="Sanguinetto">Sanguinetto</a>. In the same years Francesco and Bianca were invited to <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a> by the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Doge_of_Venice_98d5.html" title="Doge of Venice">doge of Venice</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Foscari_3a86.html" title="Francesco Foscari">Francesco Foscari</a>. Shortly thereafter, news that Piccinino was menacing Sforza's possessions in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marche.html" title="Marche">Marche</a> reached the city. Bianca then accompanied her husband to <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimini.html" title="Rimini">Rimini</a>, where they were guests of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigismondo_Pandolfo_Malatesta_3310.html" title="Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta">Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta</a>, in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gradara.html" title="Gradara">Gradara</a> and then in <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesi.html" title="Jesi">Jesi</a>. Here she remained in the castle while Francesco led the military operations against Piccinino. In <a href="../../../1/4/4/1442.html" title="1442">1442</a> Bianca (then 17 years old) was named regent of the Marche. This choice may seem surprising, but numerous contemporary chronicles state that Bianca had repeatedly proven her skills in administration and diplomacy. As for the ducal couple's personal relationship, if it is certain that Francesco had strongs feelings towards Bianca, it is also true that he was frequently unfaithful to her. Bianca usually reacted with nonchalance. On one occasion, however, in <a href="../../../1/4/4/1443.html" title="1443">1443</a>, one of her husband's mistress disappeared and was killed in dubious circumstances<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/4/4/1442.html" title="1442">1442</a> Francesco was excommunicated. Four years later, ill and declining, Filippo Maria Visconti approached Francesco for a reconciliation. The latter, however, remained distrustful, and, despite Bianca's pleading, preferred to concentrate on the defense of his territories, menaced by <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_States_4dbf.html" title="Papal States">Papal</a> troops. In <a href="../../../1/4/4/1447.html" title="1447">1447</a> Sforza, feeling more confident, accepted the position of <i>lieutenant</i> of the Duchy of Milan, but Visconti, jealous and suspicious after the popularity of Sforza in Milan, soon changed his mind. At the same time the new Pope, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Nicholas_V_2b5b.html" title="Pope Nicholas V">Nicholas V</a>, demanded the restitution of Jesi. It was a very difficult time for Francesco and Bianca.</p>
<p>Francesco Sforza gave back to the pope the town of Jesi in exchange for 35,000 <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florin.html" title="Florin">florins</a>, and moved towards Milan along with his wife. News of the death of Filippo Maria Visconti, who died in the night between 13 and 14 August 1447, reached Francesco in <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotignola.html" title="Cotignola">Cotignola</a>. Bianca was very angry when she heard about the depredations suffered by the Visconti properties in Milan after Filippo's death. Bianca and Francesco were marching toward Milan, with 4,000 knights and 2,000 infantry, when the new-born Ambrosian Republic/Aurea Repubblica Ambrosiana, under the menace of a Venetian invasion, offered Francesco the title of Captain General. Bianca favored refusing, but Francesco accepted, starting three years in which he strove to reconquer the cities that had declared independence from the Duchy after Filippo Visconti's death.</p>
<p>In May of 1448, when Sforza was in <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavia.html" title="Pavia">Pavia</a>, the Venetians attacked Cremona. According to the chronicles, Bianca donned a suit of parade armor and, along with some troops and the populace, hurried towards the bridge that connected the city to Pavia. She fought in the battle that ensued for the whole day. This episode gained her fame as a "warrior woman".</p>
<p>After the Venetian danger had been repulsed, Bianca settled in the Visconti Castle of Pavia, together with a large court. Her good relationships with her Visconti relatives gained popular support, as well as loans and funds, for the fragile new state created by her husband. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/5/1450.html" title="1450">1450</a>, a revolt broke out in Milan. The Venetian ambassador was killed, as the State of Venice/Serenissima was deemed responsible for the famine that had struck Milan. A meeting of nobles and citizens recognized Francesco as lord.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Maria_Visconti_9400.html" title="Edit section: Duchess of Milan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Duchess of Milan</span></h3>
<p>The date of the entrance of the new duke and duchess in Milan is disputed: <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>. Francesco and Bianca refused the triumphal wagon (they called it <i>superstizione da re</i>, "kings' superstition"), instead reaching the Duomo riding on a couple of horses. It was the first time that a duke's title had been awarded by the citizens of the city.</p>
<p>During the first years of their reign, Bianca collaborated with her husband in recovering her father's assets and restoring the Ducal Palace. Francesco was again entangled in a war against Venice. Remaining alone in Milan, Bianca devoted herself to the administration of the Duchy, as attested by the correspondence with her husband, which gives precious insights on the education of their children (see <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Maria_Visconti_9400.html#Children" title="Bianca Maria Visconti">Children</a> section), state affairs, the financial difficulties, and details of her daily life. The letters also show the assertive character of Bianca, who did not hesitate to express her opinions even when they differed from her husband's. The letters include also accusations of his extramarital adventures.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/4/5/1453.html" title="1453">1453</a> in Pavia, Bianca hosted <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9_I_of_Naples_559b.html" title="René I of Naples">René I of Naples</a>, who was asked to go to Cremona with his army to fight alongside Sforza. She later showed him the construction site of the large new <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castello_Sforzesco_abcb.html" title="Castello Sforzesco">Castello Sforzesco</a> in Milan.</p>

<p>After the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Lodi_b262.html" title="Peace of Lodi">Peace of Lodi</a> in 1454, Bianca devoted herself not only to diplomacy and the restoration and embellishment of the several Ducal residences, but also to public works. The ducal couple had a large hospital built in Milan, the <a href="../../../o/s/p/Ospedale_Maggiore_e82d.html" title="Ospedale Maggiore">Ospedale Maggiore</a>, and often Bianca offered direct help to numerous poor women. In <a href="../../../1/4/5/1459.html" title="1459">1459</a> <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_II_9965.html" title="Pope Pius II">Pope Pius II</a> summoned a council in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantua.html" title="Mantua">Mantua</a> to prepare a crusade against the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turks_1d9f.html" title="Ottoman Turks">Ottoman Turks</a>. Bianca offered 300 knights, and Francesco was proposed as military leader of the expedition. The crusade never materialized, but Francesco and Bianca's support of the papacy gained them bulls of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indulgence.html" title="Indulgence">indulgence</a> for the Duomo and the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/4/6/1462.html" title="1462">1462</a> Francesco Sforza, who suffered from <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gout.html" title="Gout">gout</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/e/Edema.html" title="Edema">dropsy</a>, fell ill. During his absence from the government, Bianca's political and administrative capabilities prevented the state from crumbling after some rebellions spurred by Venice. She acted effectively as co-regent of the Duchy. Bianca also promoted a marriage between Jacopo Piccinino, the son of Niccolò, and Drusiana, Francesco's illegitimate daughter.</p>

On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1465.html" title="1465">1465</a>, her mother, Agnese del Maino, died. Not much later, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1466.html" title="1466">1466</a>, Duke Francesco Sforza died also. Bianca quickly took the reins of the duchy and called back Galeazzo Maria, who was fighting alongside the king of France, to succeed as duke. The latter's behavior was initially one of gratitude and deference towards his mother, but soon greed and ruthlessness led him to act independently against Bianca's advice. As time passed, the Duke relegated his mother to an increasingly secondary role and in the end forced her to leave Milan. She then moved to Cremona, her dowry city. According to some sources, she was thinking of giving the control of the city to Venice, and she had frequent contacts with <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_I_of_Naples_921b.html" title="Ferdinand I of Naples">Ferdinand I of Naples</a>, who was aiming to overthrow Galeazzo.</p>

<p>Against the advice of all her counsellors, Bianca decided to take part in Galeazzo's marriage on (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">May 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/6/1468.html" title="1468">1468</a>). At the end of the feasts she accompanied her daughter Ippolita to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serravalle.html" title="Serravalle">Serravalle</a>, whence she set off to Cremona. However, when midway, in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melegnano.html" title="Melegnano">Melegnano</a>, she fell ill. A high fever obliged her to stay in bed until August, but she kept up an intense correspondence. At the beginning of October, her condition worsened further. She died on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_28.html" title="October 28">October 28</a> of that year, after having recommended her younger children, Elisabetta and Ottaviano, to their brother Galeazzo. She was buried in the Duomo of Milan, next to her husband. The funeral oration, commissioned by Galeazzo, was written by the humanist <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Filelfo_8b4c.html" title="Francesco Filelfo">Francesco Filelfo</a>.</p>
<p>Her death raised suspicions; Galeazzo Maria Visconti was accused by various men, including <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolomeo_Colleoni_ef57.html" title="Bartolomeo Colleoni">Bartolomeo Colleoni</a>, of having poisoned her. It is certain that during her illness, there were in Melegnano certain men close to Galeazzo, some of whom were later involved in other cases of poisoning.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. According to Bernardino Corio, Bianca "died of natural ungratefulness more than poison".</p>
