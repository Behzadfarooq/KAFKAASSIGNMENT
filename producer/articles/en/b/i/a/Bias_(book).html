<p>Bernard Goldberg argues that the mainstream news media has a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_bias.html" title="Liberal bias">liberal bias</a>. He argues that these journalists don't see their views as "liberal", but "merely reasonable and civilized". He quotes <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ailes_67bb.html" title="Roger Ailes">Roger Ailes</a>, who said that the news media divides America into "moderates and right-wing nuts."</p>
<p>Goldberg wrote critically of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rather_4eca.html" title="Dan Rather">Dan Rather</a>, whom he worked with at <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_News_c061.html" title="CBS News">CBS News</a>. Rather, he suggested, believes that colleagues who complains are like <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiro_Agnew_94aa.html" title="Spiro Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a>. He mentioned something Dan told him: “Bernie, we were friends yesterday, we’re friends today, and we’ll be friends tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Goldberg introduced “Dan-ish”. When Dan Rather says “it’s my fault”, he means “It’s your fault”. Goldberg implied the difficulty of working with Rather, stating that there has been a Vice President “in Charge of Dan” at CBS since the 1980’s.</p>

<p>Goldberg introduced Jerry Goldberg, a friend, who worked on his <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> home in 1992 during <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Andrew_b913.html" title="Hurricane Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a>. Jerry complained about a <i>Reality Check</i> report Eric Enberg did for the <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_Evening_News_9ea9.html" title="CBS Evening News">CBS Evening News</a>. The piece was critical of a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_tax.html" title="Flat tax">flat tax</a> proposal by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Forbes_6e33.html" title="Steve Forbes">Steve Forbes</a>, a then candidate in the 1996 Presidential Elections.</p>
<p>After seeing the report, Goldberg agreed that the piece was slanted and unfair to Forbes' proposal. He called it "Junk Journalism". Enberg used terms like "wacky" and "scheme" to describe the proposal. Goldberg attributed it to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>'s “need to wage class warfare.” He cited <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Woodward_db31.html" title="Bob Woodward">Bob Woodward</a> quoting <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Begala_6942.html" title="Paul Begala">Paul Begala</a>'s speaking of the rich: "Fuck them". Goldberg response: "<a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> couldn't have said it better."</p>
<p>Goldberg complained to executives about the Enberg report but met hesitation. <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Fager_a4f3.html" title="Jeff Fager">Jeff Fager</a> was "too cool" about the situation. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Heyward_1012.html" title="Andrew Heyward">Andrew Heyward</a> said about Dan Rather, "If anyone around here ever takes Dan on, he’ll find a way to get even." On February 12, 1996, Goldberg informed Rather of a critical piece he wrote in the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>, of the media having a liberal bias. Rather's reaction: “I’m getting viscerally angry about this.” Rather was among many critics of the article, including <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Schieffer_3c1c.html" title="Bob Schieffer">Bob Schieffer</a>, who described Goldberg's claims as “Weird...Wacky...Bizarre”.</p>
<p>Goldberg wrote that his media critics used a tactic of protecting their own by attacking their accuser. He suggested that the May 1995 firing of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Chung_c280.html" title="Connie Chung">Connie Chung</a> was orchestrated by an insecure Dan Rather. Rather, he wrote, derided Chung as a "second-rate journalist" when she covered the <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_Bombing_1c7a.html" title="Oklahoma City Bombing">Oklahoma City Bombing</a> before him. He implied that Rather was upset that Chung was getting more air time on the day of the bombing.</p>
<p>The problem with the 'media elites', Goldberg argues, is <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a>. He compared the news media to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Podhoretz_7354.html" title="John Podhoretz">John Podhoretz</a>'s summary of New Yorkers: "[they] ... can easily go through life never meeting anybody who has a thought different from their own."</p>

<p>Goldberg recounts his many conversations with <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Heyward_1012.html" title="Andrew Heyward">Andrew Heyward</a>. One quote from 1993, when Heyward was the executive producer of <i>Eye to Eye</i>, hosted by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Chung_c280.html" title="Connie Chung">Connie Chung</a>. Heyward supposedly admitted the networks are biased, then saying he would deny it Goldberg mentioned it in public. “... Of course there’s a liberal bias in the news ... If you repeat any of this, I’ll deny it.”</p>
<p>Goldberg's February 1996 <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a> <a href="../../../o/p/-/Op-ed.html" title="Op-ed">op-ed</a> criticized Eric Enberg's report piece, and the media's liberal bias. Goldberg was criticized and praised. He mentioned a few of his supporters:</p>

<p>To prove his <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thesis.html" title="Thesis">thesis</a> about a <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_bias.html" title="Liberal bias">liberal bias</a> in the news media, he wrote about <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Smith_%28television%29_8765.html" title="Harry Smith (television)">Harry Smith (television)</a>. In 1981, Smith co-hosted CBS <i>This Morning</i>.

Golberg summed it up: “In the world of the [Peter] Jenningses and [Tom] Brokaws and [Dan]Rathers, conservatives are out of the mainstream and need to be identified ... That which is right of center is conservative. That which is left of center is middle of the road.”</p>

<p>According to Goldberg, since 1980s, the homeless depicted on the networks were not drug users, crazy or criminals. They were “likeable” homeless depicted to appeal to the audience. He said that such depictions won sympathy for the homeless, because they were made attractive. The media were exaggerated to the millions of homeless in the US.</p>

<li>“A lot of news people, after all, got into journalism in the first place so they could change the world and make it a better place.”</li>

<li>“Afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.”</li>

<p>Goldberg: “For reporters who were too young to cover the great <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> struggle of the 1960s, the homeless story twenty years later was the next best thing.” He argued that during the 1980s, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was seen as the cause of homelessness. Then homelessness decreased during <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s Administration because such stories received less media coverage.</p>

<p>According to Goldberg, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> activists worked to scare the hell out of America to get attention. If the general public continued to believe that the victims were limited to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> men or (drug addicts), he wrote, the activists were concerend that no one would care. This led to a $5 million Federal ad campaign: “AIDS doesn’t discriminate.”</p>
<p>Goldberg used a study by the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_for_Media_and_Public_Affairs_07ce.html" title="Center for Media and Public Affairs">Center for Media and Public Affairs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>On TV, 6% of AIDS victims were gay men. In reality, it was 58% of gay men who had AIDS.</li>

Once, the bulk of network profits came from its entertainment division. News was "special" and not expected to make money, because it was a public service.</li>
