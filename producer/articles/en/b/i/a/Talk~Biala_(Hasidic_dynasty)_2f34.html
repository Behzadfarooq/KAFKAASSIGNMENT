<dd>Agreed. I don't have enough knowlege to weed out the superfluous images, but 14 for an article of this size and depth is beyond excessive. What's worse, looking at the copyright tags for the images reveals a questionable rationale for fair use. I think this article needs no more than 3 or 4 images illustrating notable dynasty members, and they should be ones with a better copyright status than theese. I'll try contacting the uploader and see if better licenses are available. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasDex_c4f8.html" title="User:TexasDex">TexasDex</a> 03:51, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>you are not presenting the NPOV view, you are only pushing Lugano, saying that the others "set themselves" or "style" themselves to be rebbes. What was wrong with the geneology before, except for leaving out the London Rebbe, which truthfully should have been added. Reb Shmuel never said to be Rebbe, he's the Biala Ruv in Bnei Brak, Reb Volf Kornreich of Shidlovtza though is a memalei makom of R' Duvche. <a href="../../../i/t/z/User%7EItzik18_2109.html" title="User:Itzik18">Itzik18</a> 00:10, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very mature making fun of typo. Here's another one for:</p>
<p>1. I don't give a damn about the pathetic politics involved.</p>
<p>2. The baal shem tov etc have no place in the genealogy.</p>
<p>3. Lugano is the main one, he was chosen by the father, he has BY FAR the largest following, and public profile.</p>
<p>4. The others are presented equally to him in any case, however</p>
<p>5. The current generation are not known widely, have and apart for one in bnei brak have no profile. No one appointed them, they merely claim the style of rebbe. If they must all be listed here in all their fatuous pretensions they cant yet be placed on a par with the previous generations.</p>
<p>6. Kornreich is not part of the Biala chasidus, which is the subject here.</p>
<p>7. The title is "Rabbi" not "Rebbe" for the purposes of giving their names.</p>
<p>8. Since these people are all essentially self appointed, in order to be be NPOV, we must not present their positions as though they have the force of law behind them</p>
<p>If you want to revert my changes again, please take issue with the above points here. Be a men shitzik.</p>

<dd>2. Almost all of the other articles concerning Hasidic dynasties begin from the Baal Shem Tov, zy"a.</dd>

<p>3. The Biala-Lugano Rebbe, shlit"a, was not chosen by his father. The <i>Chelkas Yehoshua</i>, zy"a, did not chose a successor. When the <i>Chelkas Yehoshua</i> passed away, none of the sons wanted to become Rebbe, so the Biala Rebbe of Lugano said he would become Rebbe on the condition that the other brothers did not become Rebbes. However, many of the Hassidim of the <i>Chelkas Yehoshua</i> did not want him to be their Rebbe, so many chose one of the other brothers to be Rebbe. It was the Hassidim who made the other Rebbes, not the Rebbes themselves. Many of the Hassidim of the Biala-Lugano Rebbe, shlit"a, were not Hassidim of the <i>Chelkas Yehoshua</i>. Reb "Duvtche", the Biala Rebbe of Bnei Brak, zt"l, had a great many of the Hassidim of the <i>Chelkas Yehoshua</i>. The present Biala Rebbe of Bnei Brak has a considerably large Chassidus, as does the Biala-Shidlovtzer in Jerusalem, as a succesor of Reb "Duvtche". The Rebbe from Lugano made a din Torah against his other brothers, while the other brothers were b'shalom. The original Chassidus of Biala cam from Rebbe Nosson Dovid of Shidlovtza, zy"a. <b>All</b> of his sons became Rebbes. The <i>Divrei Binah</i>, zy"a, the first Biala Rebbe, was the youngest son of Rebbe Nosson Dovid. The <i>minhag</i> of the Rabinowitz family was already established that all of the sons would become <i>Admo"rim</i>. There was certainly a precedent in the family for all three brothers to become Rebbes. In any event, it was the Hassidim who declared them to be Rebbes, not they themselves.</p>
<p>6. Grand Rabbi Wolf Kornreich, shlit"a, the Shidlovtzer Rebbe of Jerusalem, is certainly a part of the Biala dynasty. The only reason that he did not take the name Biala was in order to avoid conflict with his brothers-in-law. He has many of the original Hassidim of the <i>Chelkas Yehoshua</i>, zy"a, who went to Reb "Duvtche", zy"a. His beis medrash was a Biala-Bnei Brak shtibl of which he was the Rav during the lifetime of his father-in-law. If you ask many of the Hassidim who daven in the Shidlovtzer Beis Medrash, "where do you <i>daven</i>?" many say "Biala", even though the Rebbe has told them to say Shidlovtza, in order to avoid conflict with the other Rebbes of Biala, with whom he has very good relations. It was those Hassidim who declared him Rebbe, not he himself. He merely said that he would not take the name "Biala", to avoid conflict, but still he is recognized as one of the Admorei Biala, including by his brothers-in-law, the other Biala Rebbes.</p>
<p>7. There should be some differentiation between those who became <i>Admorim</i>, and those who did not. If "Rebbe" is not good, then "Grand Rabbi" for those who are called <i>Admor</i> and "Rabbi" for those who are not.</p>
<p>8. They were not self-appointed, they were appointed by their Hassidim, who were Hassidim of the previous Rebbe, zy"a.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure that either the <i>Piskei Tshuvos</i> nor Rabbi M. Rabinowitz have been declared as Rebbes. I think the other sons were, I'm not sure exactly.</p>
<p>Additionally, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, shlit"a, the eldest son of Reb "Duvtche", zt"l, is not a Biala Rebbe. He is the Biala <b>Rav</b> of Bnei Brak. He is the Rav of his brother's (Rebbe Yaakov Menachem) shul.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing mainly on the dynasty itself and the lines of succession, we ought to say more about the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">teachings</a> of the dynasty. (That ought to go for other Hasidic sects and dynasties, too.)
