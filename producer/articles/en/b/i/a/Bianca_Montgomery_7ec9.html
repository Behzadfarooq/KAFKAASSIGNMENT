<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Montgomery_7ec9.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Lifeline: Born February 8th, 1988. Birthday changed to February 9th, 1984 [Jan 31st, 2002]</p>
<p>Bianca Christine Montgomery is the daughter of <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Kane_eb13.html" title="Erica Kane">Erica Kane</a> and the late <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travis_Montgomery_218d.html" title="Travis Montgomery">Travis Montgomery</a>. Her middle name is from her paternal aunt, Christine Montgomery. She was born in <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Valley_bd72.html" title="Pine Valley">Pine Valley</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. She is well beloved in the community and was well cared for by her famous mother.</p>
<p>During the course of the show, Bianca has suffered from <a href="../../../r/e/y/Reyes_Syndrome_8eb4.html" title="Reyes Syndrome">Reyes Syndrome</a> (when she was a baby); and <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_Nervosa_106c.html" title="Anorexia Nervosa">Anorexia Nervosa</a>. Her sweet nature is often related to her late grandmother, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Kane_191d.html" title="Mona Kane">Mona</a>; and sometimes goes by the nickname, "Binks".</p>
<p>Although she is very kind hearted, Bianca will not tolerate any nonsense from anyone. These traits she shares with both her parents and her grandmother. For a time, she lived in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, with her father and her stepmother, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Montgomery_768b.html" title="Barbara Montgomery">Barbara Montgomery</a>. She, like everyone in Bianca's family, is protective of her, and although they didn't always agree with one another, Bianca loves her stepmother, and her stepsiblings very much.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> after a teenage Bianca returned from rehab for her eating disorder, she stunned her mother by revealing she was a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> and she had a relationship with a girl in rehab named Sarah. Sarah's family disapproved and Sarah ended up getting engaged to a man, despite still being in love with Bianca, ending the girls' relationship.</p>
<p>Bianca's second girlfriend was <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Stone_ab4a.html" title="Frankie Stone">Mary-Frances "Frankie" Stone</a>. Frankie came to Pine Valley to help out her Aunt Vanessa, aka "Proteus," in a plot to distract Bianca. Frankie, however, developed true feelings for Bianca and was murdered by one of Vanessa's henchmen.</p>
<p>Soon after, Frankie's identical twin sister Mary-Margaret, or <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_Stone_222c.html" title="Maggie Stone">Maggie Stone</a>, arrived in Pine Valley. She became good friends with Bianca and would often stand up for Bianca when she was harassed and bullied by <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic.html" title="Homophobic">homophobic</a> classmates. The two shared an up and down relationship where eventually both girls seemed to mutually be interested in one another. They never could get together though. Bianca was interested in Maggie but Maggie stated she was straight, despite their close dynamic. Later on, Maggie was interested in Bianca but Bianca was in a relationship by then.</p>
<p>Bianca met Polish-born newcomer <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lena_Kundera_07c4.html" title="Lena Kundera">Lena Kundera</a> at Enchantment Cosmetics where Bianca worked for her mother, Erica Kane. Lena, a bisexual and a spy for rival <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Cambias_02f0.html" title="Michael Cambias">Michael Cambias</a>, began dating Bianca and the two fell in love. They experienced ups and downs when Lena's original intentions were revealed, but the two managed to stay together. When the two women shared a kiss, chaste by soap standards, it was a first time two women kissed romantically on a daytime soap opera.</p>
<p>After Bianca was raped by the villainous Michael, Bianca pushed Lena away. Bianca kept her rape a closely-guarded secret, initially telling only Maggie. Eventually the entire town of Pine Valley learned of the rape which encouraged Bianca to get closer to her mother, Erica, with whom she had felt an estrangement.</p>
<p>During a normal doctor's physical, it was discovered that Michael's rape of Bianca had left Bianca pregnant. Bianca decided to keep the child. The pregnancy helped bond Bianca with her older sister, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendall_Hart_d4b2.html" title="Kendall Hart">Kendall Hart</a>, who until then, had always scorned her.</p>
<p>Michael was charged with rape but was acquitted, to the outrage and collective disgust of the entire town. During that same time, Kendall had announced she had married her sister's rapist, and was pregnant with his baby. This so-called "announcement" however, was a ruse, planned by Dr. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hayward_42e6.html" title="David Hayward">David Hayward</a> and Kendall, which was meant to fool Erica, and to protect the emotionally ravaged Bianca.</p>
<p>But Michael was later found murdered. It was eventually discovered that Bianca, herself, had shot him in <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_defence.html" title="Self defence">self defence</a>, and blocked it out of her memory due to the trama of the rape. (Much like her late grandmother, Mona, had done when she shot Jason Maxwell, to protect Erica, and blocked it out of her memory). His "funeral" was attended by Bianca and her closest family and friends, who threw venomous "eulogies" at the deceased.</p>
<p>Bianca gave birth to a daughter, whom she named <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_Montgomery_cb8b.html" title="Miranda Montgomery">Miranda</a>. Miranda, because she loved the name, and her middle name, Mona, after her beloved maternal grandmother.</p>
<p>The child was later thought to have died in a plane crash, but in reality, she had been kidnapped by Bianca's friend, Babe's conniving former husband, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cramer_36b8.html" title="Paul Cramer">Paul Cramer</a>, and renamed Bess.</p>
<p>Bianca eventually discovered that Bess was Miranda, her daughter, but during an attempt to steal the child back Bianca was pushed from a second story balcony by <a href="../../../j/2E/r/J.R._Chandler_fa0b.html" title="J.R. Chandler">J.R.</a> and wound up in a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a>. Bianca has never remembered how she fell. Miranda was recovered and brought to Bianca's hospital room and Bianca woke up from her coma.</p>
<p>Although she has very few enemies and is the most compassionate of people, she and J.R. are avowed arch-enemies, due to his antics while they were in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>; and she holds him totally responsible for her injuries.</p>
<p>Lena had to go back to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> to take care of her mother and the two eventually broke up. Bianca and Maggie's confusing relationship became an issue again. Though the two women's relationship wasn't exactly made clear, Bianca, baby Miranda, and Maggie, went to Paris together so Bianca could head up the international division of Cambias Industries, which Enchantment now owned.</p>
<p>Bianca, Maggie and Miranda lived in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_France_1fae.html" title="Paris, France">Paris</a> off-screen for several years, where she worked for Cambias Industries' international division; and is the proxy shareholder of her daughter's shares, since Miranda is a Cambias by blood. Maggie and Bianca became lovers off screen and were very happy. It is still unclear whether she still works for Cambias International, now that she has returned to Pine Valley, but it is presumed that she still does. She is also now a partner in <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusion_Cosmetics_3c60.html" title="Fusion Cosmetics">Fusion Cosmetics</a>, the company her sister, Kendall, helped found.</p>
<p>She recently returned to Pine Valley but without Maggie, who cheated on her in Paris with a woman named Cecelia. She is getting to know her older half-brother, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Madden_fec7.html" title="Josh Madden">Josh Madden</a>.</p>
<p>Maggie returned to Pine Valley on January 15, 2007 with hopes to reconcile with Bianca who admitted she is still in love with her. Sadly, Bianca and Maggie ended things temporarily. With the story still open ended, it may allow for them to reunite.</p>
<p>During the recent <i>Satin Slayer</i> storyline, where Babe had apparently been murdered, Bianca showed genuine remorse over Babe's "death", as well as the fact that she had not forgiven Babe when she had the chance. However, upon learning that Babe was alive and well, she wasted no time in doing so, much to Babe's joy. Bianca is also enjoying a interesting relationship with <a href="../../../z/o/e/Zoe_%28All_My_Children%29_fe3a.html" title="Zoe (All My Children)">Zarf/Zoe</a>, a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> rock star. Her sexual orientation has caused a rift between her and Barbara which has caused her to deny Bianca contact with her half-sister, Molly; and her bigoted and insulting remarks toward Zoe has caused Bianca to lash out and verbally attack Barbara.</p>
<p>However, Barbara made an appearance at Miranda's birthday party and apologized to Bianca for her criticism about her sexual orientation, and her nasty remarks toward Zoe; Bianca forgave her and allowed Barbara to give Miranda a present that Bianca's father had treasured.</p>
<p>Bianca gave up her lesbianism on 4/5/07 when she admitted to her brother Josh that she fell in love with Zoe when Zoe first came to Pine Valley and was still a man known as Zarf. With this declaration, Bianca is no longer the iconic lesbian character of daytime television and is now bisexual.</p>
