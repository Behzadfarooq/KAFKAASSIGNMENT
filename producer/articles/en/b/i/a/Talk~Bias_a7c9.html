	    <p>Are we missing "strategic bias"? This is the bias that a respodent puts on a test when they are trying to alter the outcome for their own ends. For example, if you ask a group of employees "are we getting enough training?" they might all respond with a resounding "NO" in an attempt to win more funding for their training budget.</p>
<p>Bias can also be a result of game theory, such as when 360 degree feedback surveys are "rigged" by groups of people who collude in order to rank each other highly.</p>
<p>Lastly, bias can creep into social research where respondents second guess the questioner. This is especially true in cultures where there is an emphasis on not being disagreeable.</p>
<hr />
<p>this important entry lacks references.</p>
<hr />
<p>This WP definition of 'bias' has nothing scientific and seems mainly informed by 'media' and 'pop culture' considerations. Informed by political 'gut' feelings and not a by rational, articulted or analytical approach (not even attempted). In my opinion the definition should be re-edited from scratch to attempt a scholarly definition considering the point of view of natural as well as social sciences.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my opinion the passage:</p>
<p>An example of bias is having an Americo-centric point of view (the point of view of an American, in particular one from the US), or similar for another country.</p>
<p>is unfair. Whilst I am no sympathiser with America (I doubt they need any), using any particular country in an example of bias is bias itself.</p>
<p>I think references to particular countries should be deleted from this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Funnily the first section seems to be quite Americo-centric since it mentions only American examples&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFornadan_2aca.html" title="User:Fornadan">Fornadan</a> 20:05, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I deleted the following para:</p>
<p>"Bias is used in <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modulation.html" title="Modulation">modulation</a> to create a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrier_wave.html" title="Carrier wave">carrier wave</a> from the <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscillator.html" title="Oscillator">oscillator</a>. In <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_modulation.html" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a>, the bias is quite high, and defines the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_frequency.html" title="Center frequency">center frequency</a>. In <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amplitude_modulation.html" title="Amplitude modulation">AM</a>, the bias is only as high as the peak of the normal audio input signal, and defines the average <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amplitude.html" title="Amplitude">amplitude</a> of the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_frequency.html" title="Radio frequency">RF</a> output signal."</p>
<p>As someone who has designed many AM and FM transmitter circuits, this is more or less rubbish. It may refer to one particular type of design, and one I'm not especially familar with at that - but it is not a statement that is in any way generally true. The first sentence in particular is simply wrong in any interpretation I can make of it. An oscillator produces a carrier wave, period. It does not need "bias" to make it produce a carrier wave - it just does. A certain design of oscillator may include an element that changes the frequency of the oscillator, and is sensitive to voltage - a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varicap.html" title="Varicap">varicap</a> diode for example - in such a circuit, a bias voltage would be usually needed to establish the center frequency, and an AC signal applied here would cause frequency modulation - but this is all a particular implementation detail, it does not belong in this article. This use of the term bias is covered by the para that is already there. The mention of AM in this para is also erroneous, I have no idea what the author was trying to say. The AM modulators I've designed don't fit this picture, and I don't think my designs are especially wacky. In any case it's another implementation detail that doesn't belong in this article. Stay focused, people!</p>
<p>I should also say I have some issues with the para that talks about DBS receivers. I feel it is also very specific to a caertain kind of design, as well as being not terribly clearly written. However, I don't know enough about the subject to simply remove it, so I've left it in. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">GRAHAMUK</a> 23:47, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to suggest that perhaps there should be a better definition on bias here since bias is taken to mean several things depending on which European root it was ultimately taken from. I would think that the <b>English</b> bias is ultimately an amalgimation of the two.</p>
<p>A) The Ancient Greek <i>bia</i> (pronounced Vi-a), means (when applied):</p>
<pre>
1. strength, force, opression, violence.
</pre>
<p>B) The Middle French <i>biais</i> (pronounced ), means:</p>
<pre>
2. a slant, an angle,
</pre>
<p>C) In English <i>Bias</i> means:</p>
<p>3 : a line diagonal to the grain of a fabric; especially : a line at a 45Â° angle to the selvage often utilized in the cutting of garments for smoother fit 4 a : a peculiarity in the shape of a bowl that causes it to swerve when rolled on the green b : the tendency of a bowl to swerve; also : the impulse causing this tendency c : the swerve of the bowl 5 a : BENT, TENDENCY b : an inclination of temperament or outlook; especially : a personal and sometimes unreasoned judgment : PREJUDICE c : an instance of such prejudice d (1) : deviation of the expected value of a statistical estimate from the quantity it estimates (2) : systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others 6 a : a voltage applied to a device (as a transistor control electrode) to establish a reference level for operation b : a high-frequency voltage combined with an audio signal to reduce distortion in tape recording</p>

<p>We have other sections, such as for 'statistics' 'computer science' ,etc. Yet bias plays a very important role in historical analysis. What of intentional bias in this field? though omission, eg: a document that may have omitted certain fact, details, and moreover, been written with a certain literary style so as to present a certain viewpoint, or perhaps guide the reader to adopt that viewpoint. Perhaps unintentional bias of this style could be covered as well? <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeeaxid_b28b.html" title="User:Seeaxid">Seeaxid</a> 02:59, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. One thing I remember is that I once tried to sort out the interlanguage links of the various topics this article discusses. In the end, not all articles could be linked.

<p>I added the section about institutional bias. I feel compelled to note that I am not 'Jedi' (nor 'Sith') nor have ever ticked 'Jedi' on a census form. So have no beef to make in promoting the topic. If someone else wants to place a different example, feel free. I just found this a relevant and useful example that stuck out in my mind. UnterlandingZo 11:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The following I had posted and was removed which I am fine with, however (below): 'Another example of institutional bias is the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_census_phenomenon.html" title="Jedi census phenomenon">Jedi census phenomenon</a> in which governments of Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Canada, despite having a statistically significant number of people mark 'Jedi' on the census, in some cases in greater percentage than traditionally recognized religions, continued to not recognize 'Jedi' as a religion. - It would also be institutional bias to not recognize something like 'Jedi as a religion' on the sole basis of governments, i.e. institutional authority, not acknowledging it.'</p>
<p>It was removed reasoning this: '(Not recognising "Jedi" as a genuine religion is not "institutional bias", since few people think "Jedi" is a religion, as opposed to a joke, mocking both the census and organised religions.)'</p>
<p>IMO I listed two types of institutional bias, 1) that the governments refused to recognize it, ok, apparently I am only guessing at their reasoning, perhaps this is not good. I am assuming they did not recognize it because it was not an organized religion; it was not institutionalized. They are therefore bias towards religions being institutional. I can now see it was correct to take it down, because I was only speculating at their reasoning for refusing to recognize Jedi as a religion. However, if it was official policy to recognize a religion as legitimate if x number checked it on the census, (I do not know if this was the actual case) if it was official policy and they ignored it, regardless of the reasons for ticking Jedi, then it is institutional bias, perhaps on the official's part, but institutional bias none-the-less. Perhaps someone else can come up with a good example, as the definition of institutional bias needs to be fleshed out. 2) individuals or perhaps other institutions that do not recognize some matter unless some form of authority officially recognizes it. This fits with what remains and the second part of what was removed. UnterlandingZo 21:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
