<p>I think the list of Wiradjuri words you uploaded is inaccurate in a few places.

<p>Hi, you have contributed to the article <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagga_Wagga_Marketplace_b1a5.html" title="Wagga Wagga Marketplace">Wagga Wagga Marketplace</a>. I am on a bit of a jaunt? quest? to improve shopping centre articles. Most of them do not show how the shopping centre in question is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a>, ie why is this shopping centre different to any other shopping centre? Would wikipedia be worse off if this article did not exist but there was a generic article <b>Shopping Centres in Australia</b> which mentions that a shopping centre called the Wagga Wagga Marketplace exists. Could you please suggest something that could be added to the article to make it notable compared to all the other articles for shopping malls on Wikipedia? I ask this because I cannot see what makes one shopping centre notable compared to the one in the next suburb. Not every house has an article, why should every shopping centre? Thanks, I hope to implement some of your suggestions. I am happy to conduct a reasonable amount of web-based investigation to implement some of your thoughts. Or ideally, you could add some information to the article yourself, which shows how/why/when the Wagga Wagga Marketplace is notable. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 04:27, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi i have seen the idea on what you want to do to Westfields and thought whether if it would be possible to do the same for the Marketplace since i know of at least 4 other Malls that go under the same Marketplace brand and logo. Just a thought. -- RobertM 21:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That would help a lot - a <b>chain of malls</b> is approaching notable. A single shopping centre however - that is trivial!

<dd>I think why they say Wagga Wagga is in NSW is due to it being in the Federal electorate of the Riverina and also Visit NSW[15] have a large area which seems to go up into the Tumut area which I find hard to believe as they are more to do with the South West Slopes. So I say trying to get a source who is right is going to be very hard to find. -- Robertmyers 02:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hope NSW there is a typo which was meant to be Riverina? I grew up there, I always thought Wagga is in the riverina... are you telling me I'm wrong? (look up Irons in your phone book - they're all my brothers / parents / cousins)</p>

<p>I saw the point above re: your image, that's a nice shot it's a shame about the WWCC traffic barriers in the background. The opening paragraph of that article isn't in the best wiki style - generally, articles have</p>
<p><b>article name</b></p>
<p>pretty much in the opening sentence. In it's current form that part is well down the page. Also, without going to the linked Wagga Wagga article, you don't mention where in the world Wagga Wagga is.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's a sence in pre-emptively disambiguating the page by having it at say "VMG, Wagga Wagga" or someting (VMG in full though)? Looking at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Category%7EParks_in_Sydney_352d.html" title="Category:Parks in Sydney">Category:Parks in Sydney</a>, many of the park names are pre-disambiguated (I can't see there being too many Sydney Parks around the world, but the article is ]]Sydney Park, Sydney]] - Sydney Park is a redirect!)</p>

<p>Hi - I will be away for the weekend.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that I hope your flu gets better.</p>
<p>In connection with the contributer to Gundagai and related articles, if you have any issues, go to Snottygobble (who endorsed the RfC), PetaHolmes or WP:AWNB. I know I suggested WP:AN/I but they seem to not always be focussed there. In requesting assistance, reference the RfC so that people can see it is not a one-off but a pattern of behaviour.</p>
<p>Note her use of caps lock - it says a lot but not what she means it to say. As a result don't take her comments personally, she probably can't help it poor thing. I strongly suggest sticking to the tempated grid of warnings at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_talk_namespace_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace">Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace</a>. She seems to be back on about Coolac. See my comments at <a href="../../../h/u/m/Talk%7EHume_Highway_9407.html#Coolac_by_pass" title="Talk:Hume Highway">Talk:Hume Highway#Coolac by pass</a> if it helps.</p>
<p>There's a new wikipedian from Wagga. Perhaps you can give him a hand - see <a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html#Thank_you.21" title="User talk:AYArktos">User_talk:AYArktos#Thank_you.21</a> and my response on his talk page - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave.the.dog_5819.html" title="User talk:Dave.the.dog">User talk:Dave.the.dog</a>. Note I was going to let him do the move himself once he can because there is nothing like learning by doing and it isn't urgent.</p>
<p>As per message at <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html#WP:Riverina_and_SW_Slopes" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">User_talk:GarrieIrons#WP:Riverina_and_SW_Slopes</a>, I am thinking the Outback scope is too big and not focussed enough, or as you have pointed out focussed west of the Newell Highway which is not where I know a lot about. Like to go there but haven't yet. Lots of work to be done on NSW Regions generally though as per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Outback_New_South_Wales_Places_0db3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Outback New South Wales/Places">Wikipedia:WikiProject Outback New South Wales/Places</a> even if they are not all outback, just not metropolitan.</p>

<p>Hi, the guide for disambiguating names is at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)</a> and scan down also to the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html#Australia" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Australian section</a>. There was a recent discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Australian_places_6c79.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Australian places">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Australian places</a> which may shed some light - as the Aust naming conventions section was updated accordingly. I think <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Bridge_131d.html" title="Hampden Bridge">Hampden Bridge</a> becomes a dab page (see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">MoS</a> if you aren't familiar with how to lay out). I would move the Kangaroo Valley bridge to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Bridge_%28Kangaroo_Valley%29_963a.html" title="Hampden Bridge (Kangaroo Valley)">Hampden Bridge (Kangaroo Valley)</a> and create the one you wish to write about at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Bridge_%28Wagga_Wagga%29_5530.html" title="Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)">Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)</a>. I don't think we need to append the NSW to the name - not solving any likely ambiguity.</p>

<dd>I also look forward to seeing a good article about this historic crossing of the river.

<dd>Nice article! There is some room for additional information but it reads quite nicely as a complete article. As an article related to structures it could do with some engineering type information such as the load rating, clearance, what the design flood it was meant to stay open for, etc., but well done with what you have put up there.</dd>
<dd>Hopefully if it does get torn down we can get some pictures included in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What would be worthwhile including is some informtion about the type of crossing that was in place before the bridge opened, and the impact of the alternate <i>Wiradjuri Bridge</i> crossing (doesn't traffic to North Wagga have to go quite a bit further now?)</dd>

<li>Great diagram. I think I have some questions about the left hand side, but for the moment focussing on your edit summary which saud <i>Can't get it to go were I want it to</i> - what did you want to do? Can I help. Hard won advice is that Americans can't spell "centre" - you might need to use "center" to place it. But I am not sure what you are trying to do so that was just a guess.

<li>I added the reason for reversion to the talk page of the list of massacre article. The warning series {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7EComment2_9704.html" title="Template:Comment2">comment2</a>}} {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7EComment3_61fc.html" title="Template:Comment3">comment3</a>}} {{<a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7EComment4_8f2b.html" title="Template:Comment4">comment4</a>}} seems right too, but I liked the {{<a href="../../../n/e/e/Template%7ENeedsource_05e0.html" title="Template:Needsource">needsource</a>}} {{<a href="../../../n/e/e/Template%7ENeedsource2_3375.html" title="Template:Needsource2">needsource2</a>}} - given she has been around before and been warned before, I would use level 4 of the comment warning, but in fact I like the idea of teling her to play in the sand box with level 2 comment&#160;:-). Anyway no citations, no record of massacre in Wikipedia - I think it is really important to keep such unverified information out - if it is verified I of course have no problem with its inclusion. She knows how to cite sources and should know better than to included unreferenced material having claimed she goes to uni. (Don't forget to <i>subst:</i> your warnings - people seem to prefer it).

<p>Thanks for letting me know about the re-appearance. They've resurfaced again today and received a 1 week block at their current ip. Whilst I generally dislike blocking shared ip's for this length of time, it's us who have to deal with the rubbish - and we're mostly sick of it.

I tryed to help Longhair and Golden Wattle with Anon but it failed and I wasn't going to waste my time in putting were the Anon's comments were meant to go and add the unsigned tag since I have other things to do so I reverted with popups and I also reverted comments when the Anon was block since I thought blocked uses can't add anything until there are unblocked but maybe I have misunderstood. I always have had a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> here and I always try and never let my point of view get in the way but the Anon has broken <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> a number of times. The Anon is very abusive, hides behind a changing IP and attacks you if you do not agree with them. I have no idea why they do this but I don't think it's fair that they should continue to keep on doing this for the last few months and something needs to be done now. I'm now looking at quiting Wikipedia since it has lost interest due to what has happened in the last week. -- <a href="../../../b/i/d/User%7EBidgee_34fa.html" title="User:Bidgee">Bidgee</a> 07:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Given your feelings it seems like the best thing to do would be to make a statement in the case. I have not been involved before and I included the reversions in my case description because they are important and would have been discussed anyway. I also included plenty of diffs of her incivility, POV-pushing, etc. I did not say everything there was to say as the statements at this stage should be concise; however it might be useful if you described some of your early efforts to deal cooperatively with her which I seem to see in the page histories from the May-June time frame, so you can show that many good faith efforts were made to deal with her before the RFC was filed. Anyway, your choice. I'm not surprised you feel like a break. I wish there was more I could do. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 11:44, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No probs Bidgee, but I only blocked her for an hour because I figure she'll just dial-up again and be back shortly with a new IP.&#160;:/ Sarah Ewart (Talk) 10:06, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sarah, at this point I would suggest blocking for 24 hours for incivility; yes, she can get a new IP any time but then you can immediately block that IP for the remainder of the 24 hours for block evasion.</dd>
<dd>Bidgee, I think I would cut out the requests to sign at this point.

<p>Hey Bidgee, I don't think we can do much about the talk pages. We could protect them so she can't edit but that seems pointless given she gets a new IP each time she dials-up. At least she is currently confined there and not roaming the article talk pages. Sarah Ewart (Talk) 19:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Bidgee. At User_talk:Sarah Ewart you asked <i>Is it possible to see whether the IP for Gretaw is the same as the Anon's as they are claiming not to be <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGretaw_58cb.html" title="User:Gretaw">User:Gretaw</a>?</i>. Yes.

<p>Hey Bidgee, I saw the checkuser was inconclusive, but I personaly find the idea it is someone else who just happened upon that talk page and signed up just to defend our friend, <i>extremely</i> unlikely. Her IP ranges are now blocked, so hopefully we'll have a little peace on that front. Have a good weekend, mate. Cheers, Sarah Ewart (Talk) 09:20, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There you go. I think I rounded up all of them.

If there are any more I've missed, please do tell me.</dd>
<dd>The problem is that I am working on translations of articles on some Australian rivers for fr:Wiki, namely <a href="../../../../fr/m/u/r/Murray_River_%28Australie%29_743b.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Murray_River_(Australie)">Murray River</a>, <a href="../../../../fr/d/a/r/Darling_River_%28Australie%29_8f19.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Darling_River_(Australie)">Darling River</a> and <a href="../../../../fr/m/u/r/Murrumbidgee.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Murrumbidgee">Murrumbidgee</a>, and I thought it would be much easier to upload the photos onto Commons so as to not overload each Wikipedia with the same photos.</dd>

<dd>It's quite all right. I myself have been very stressed lately, and I've been working far too much in Wikipedia in an attempt to forget it all. I tend to bury myself in work when I am angry. Yesterday it was around midnight when I uploaded your photos, and I was probably not in the right frame of mind to do anything but sleep or read.</dd>
<dd>I'll give you some time to think about whether or not to leave the photos on Commons. There's no rush, really, as even if they're deleted quickly, I can always re-upload them with the correct copyrights. I wouldn't mind, as I very much like working in Commons.</dd>
