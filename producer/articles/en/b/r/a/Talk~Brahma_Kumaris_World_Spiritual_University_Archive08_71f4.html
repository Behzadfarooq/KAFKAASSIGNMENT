<dd>I am quite happy to use the academic sources you do Luis. Albeit, including parts you are trying to supress. But two admins have expressed a more complete understanding of policy than yours in which self-published materials are acceptable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I am not so personally interested in websites but defend others' right to use such. The same published books the academic papers reference and the printed materials of the BKWSU including the easily referencable and citable channelled messages from God called the Murlis are fine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Note that material from an organization's website and literature, can be used in an article about that organization providing that it is properly attributed, not unduly self-serving, and not defamatory to third parties. For example, a book published by an religious organization if available from stores, or online outlets, can be used to describe the views/beliefs/traditions of that organization (attributed to them and not asserted as fact, of course). Same applies for materials/statements/opinions, etc. described in that organization's website, under the same caveats of notability, of not contentious nature, and not unduly self-serving</b></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Firstable The Ip you mention is me.. riveros11. I have never denied that. See the post by TalkAbout requesting me to use only one user name. Sometimes, it is more convenient for me to use the IP rather than signing in.</dd>
<dd>However, since you brought the subject on sockpuppets I have a little request for admins to take a look at it. I will make sure admins will take a look at this.</dd>
<dd>Tomorrow is your last day to present reliable sources for the headers in dispute. Please present them here in the talk page. I believe I answered your questions before. Take a look at the archives. You do a good job archiving this site.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me ask you this question: User 195.82.106.244 are you the user brahmakumaris.info?</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just to once again try and qualify the word ‘reliable'’ in relation to ‘source’:</dd>
<dd>News media articles are typically only reviewed by a single editor before going to press. References are often not checked and consequently, at least in the West, legal firms continue to enjoy lucrative returns from the pursuit of news publication editors for libel. Just contrast this with the rigorous review that academic papers are subject to prior to publishing.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the citing of sources originating from personal websites, can everyone familiarise with point 2 made by Jossi in the now archived discussion section ‘<i>User .244 (alleged) misinterpretation of Admin Jossi's writing</i>’ [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University/Archive07#User_.244_.28alleged.29_misinterpretation_of_Admin_Jossi.27s_writing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University/Archive07#User_.244_.28alleged.29_misinterpretation_of_Admin_Jossi.27s_writing" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>].

<dd>This is not accurate. '<b>Please note the name of the article has not changed</b>. There is no discussion going on. Just a lot of pointless and repetitive accusation and counter-accusation.

<p>Dear .244, It seems that you like for me to repeat things "ad infinitum." Please do not defame me. I have never refused the mediation nor the arbitration. The mediation was never signed by anyone but yourself. No even a single member of your supporters. Next time let us know here what you are planning to do rather than informing us after the fact. As far as your arbitration petition as stated by an admin in the page you archived without letting us know, the desicion was taken rather quickly. Now, I hope you are happy with my lenghty explanation. I just have a very simple question for you. Actually it is a "yes"/"no" question: Ready?</p>
<p><b>User 195.82.106.244 are you the user brahmakumaris.info?</b></p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply. Best, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 22:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User TalkAbout: following steps of .244</span></h2>
<p>Dear TalkAbout, Please do not change the contents of this article without previous discussion. Your comments of "fixing mess with references." (history) it is not appreciated. No one has asked you to do that task. Please let us know in this page what you are up to before you do it. I will revert that and next time I will place a "vandal tag" in your talk page. You are being kindly warned. Also, Friday is the last day for yourself and .244 and supporters to present "reliable sources" for the headers in question. Here is a copy of the article:<a href="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> take a look at "controversy", "destruction", "virgin birth", "front organizations" and "splinter groups." Evidence means that a link to a "reliable source" supports the paragraph in question. You have selected words for those paragraphs. Some of those words are "weasel words." In your supporting material you should point out so there is no doubt that the researcher used those words. If you point to a site it needs to be a reliable source, researched material. I will be looking forward to seeing that by the end of Friday in this page. In the past I have placed the quoted material in this talk page before updating the BK page. I am expecting the same from you. One last question: There is an IP coming from California in the "history" it is 64.121.65.67 Is that You? It seems that this IP has been involved with user .244 in the past. That Ip had changed this article as well without discussion. I will place a warning in that IP talk page. To make you happy and to be fair, I will make every attempt to sign as "avyakt7." If I couldn't I will add <b>avyakt7</b> after my IP. here is a link of contributions of that IP, FYI<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=64.121.65.67" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=64.121.65.67" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Best Wishes, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 14:09, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time for changes</span></h2>
<p>Dear All, As explained before in this talk page, I will go ahead and delete the material following admin Jossi's suggestion. There is not a single reliable source in this page which supports the tags left by Jossi in the article. Perhaps user .244 and supporters do not understand that their links are not reliable sources. Need to be researched materials by experts in the field. You have failed to provide those.</p>
<pre>
<b>To admins Jossi and Sethie:</b>
</pre>
<p>Please note the following:<br />
1)I have asked a simple question to user .244 which (he) has ignored. Is he user brahmakumaris.info? Likewise user TalkAbout has not responded yet.<br />
2) User .244 even though was blocked previously, still continues with his old behavior and is modifying this page without further discussion.<br />
3)User .244 is using my real name instead of my user name. He is defaming me by labeling me a "recruiter." I would like to see his proof on this. He has posted my real name and location in the talk of "Maleabroad."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Maleabroad" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Maleabroad" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><br />
4) User .244 keeps defaming me. User Maleabroad has been blocked before for editing this page and insulting users. See admin Addhoc's reply<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:72.91.4.91" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:72.91.4.91" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><br />
5)See this link about user .244 intentions:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:195.82.106.244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:195.82.106.244" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><br />
6) User brahmakumaris.info has been creating several pages with different names which refer to Brahma Kumaris. I strongly suspect that user is a sockpuppet of .244. Is there a way to test this? (His unwillingness to respond to my simple question leads me to this request.)<br />
7) User. 244 has blanked his talk page. He was advised by an admin not to do it before. He is not willing to listen. See admin Mer-c talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MER-C#My_Talk_page" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MER-C#My_Talk_page" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><br />
8) Finally, and I would like to bring this up to show his character. He has threatened me to contact my employers about using Wikipedia. He has published my personal information as well.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Searchin_man" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Searchin_man" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><br />
9) User .244 was caught misrepresenting (lying) about his membership to the antagonistic site brahmakumaris.info which he denied.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University/Archive04#Proof_which_demonstrates_user_195.82.106.244_is_part_of_the_.22team_effort.22_on_the_BKINFO_forum" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University/Archive04#Proof_which_demonstrates_user_195.82.106.244_is_part_of_the_.22team_effort.22_on_the_BKINFO_forum" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p><b>My question to both of you Jossi and Sethie is, how long do we (Brahma Kumaris) have to put up with an user like this?</b> Thank you.. and now into the changes.

<dl>
<dd>Just to be clear, I am not an admin. I would speak with admin Jossi or Mer-c about some of these charges, specifically the defaming, threat and publishing your personal information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I asked Jossi to look into the #6 and I have not recieved a response from him, so I think we need to look elsewhere for that specific action.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy and progress</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And just to be fair, both ways, how long do we have to put up with a user that refuses to listen or participate in a "middle way" discussion or involve third parties, e.g. arbitration or mediation? I am sorry <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> but it cuts both ways, it takes "two hands" to clap.</dd>

<dd><b>The wiki is full of people screaming "vandalism", and using all sorts of methods to block or intimidate others, when someone else adds or changes what they have written. I have stated that I perfectly well accept to use the citable sources Luis accepts BUT also that self-published sources are also acceptable. Two admins have corroborated this policy. I am receiving a complete blanking from <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">Riveros11</a> over this which is the source of dispute.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If an organization publishes extreme beliefs, and even academics report them in papers the other editors reference, e.g. their founder "<i>glowing red</i>" and a "<i>different voice speaking through him</i>", "<i>God descending into him</i>" then that is not defamation; that is objective, cited reportage. In such a central claim to the BK faith, of God incarnating into their founder only, it cannot be ignored - even if it does not fit into their current or Western orientated PR.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If we can come to a decision over the self-published material within the limits that Wiki policy sets, I will be very happy. This to me would appear too be the only bridge left to cross. That is hardly an unreasonable position. With Luis, we have faced two immense resistances, a) to the channelling issue and b) to the Destruction issue despite, again, both being referenced in academia AND he himself putting the points forward them on other website. Again, it comes down to whether the Wikipedia is PR for such organizations and individuals OR accurate reportage.</dd>

Dear Sethie, Please note: That link is not a reliable source. It is not a researched document. Note that none of the authors have any academic credentials or demonstrated expertise in the article. And.. because a report comes from France, a particular location.. it cannot be generalized...unless the link is meant to be detrimental on the image of BK... as the editor is hoping to accomplish.

<p><br />
You are welcome to argue all of the above, and welcome to do so with someone else. My only concern at this point is that those articles ARE cited and it was incorrect to say they alledge it is a sect, they don't say that.</p>
<p>I've done the whole "reliable sources" argueing back and forth thing and have no interest in debating that with you or anyone else. <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 00:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To Sethie</span></h2>
<p>Dear Sethie, The changes I have made after following admin Jossi's suggestion have been removed by user .244. Note that even the section which he tagged to be re-written by me (since I was the author) has been taken away by .244 in a forceful manner without discussion... The re-written version will be published this week. I am following Wikipedia policies and practices. A user who has been recently blocked comes back and does the same vandalism again and ... nothing happens to him! I am certainly looking forward to hearing about the 9 points above. I have never refused to go into mediation nor arbitration. However, I request the article be changed as it was yesterday when I changed it while we wait for mediation or arbitration. User .244 has nothing to lose with this request on the other hand Brahma Kumaris does. I feel this inmediate change by a recently blocked user fits the "clearly out of wack" statement you made.</p>
<p>Below is the exchange I had with admin Jossi, it is unfortunately that he is not here to follow up on this at this moment, but perhaps he will a bit later... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jossi#Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University_2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jossi#Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University_2" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Dear Jossi,</p>
<p>Thank you for clarifying in the article. I need to point out that at least 3 days were given for a final attempt to provide reliable resources. Note "3 day drill" in the talk page for every single part of the article. Needless to say, the previous editors have never produce a single reliable resource. User TalkAbout and the IP address ending in .244 (user known as .244) were the main editors of that article. Since previous notification was given, when do you believe I should erase those parts without reliable resources? Thank You, avyakt7 21:17, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Three days is quite minimal. Be generous and wait a few more days. You can place a note that "unless sources are provided by such and such date, the material in secton X and sction Y will be removed." That way it is transparent and you give notice. ≈ jossi ≈ t • @ 21:59, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have placed a note per Jossi's instruction in the talk page and performed the changes yesterday. I will wait for your answer on this, Sethie.</p>

There appear to be several examples of weasel words in this article, which cannot be conducive to any apparent neutrality (which I notice is disputed anyway). Under Controversy, it states "Seen by <b>many</b> as a cult". Please can you justify that term - <i><b>many</b></i>. Only two sources have been cited (leaving aside the question of how authoritative they are). Surely, that can't justify the term "<b>many</b>"? I'll amend it to "<b>some</b>", unless further evidence can be submitted. How much time should I allow? I think a week is reasonable. More to follow...Appledell 21:40, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes in Article</span></h2>
<p>Dear All, Note that changes have been made without making a revert to a previous version. Rather whatever version was in place was modified according to discussions and suggestions from admin. Took care on leaving out remarks related with Hinduism which user Maleabroad seems to find not suitable. I placed a warning in his talk page as well. If user Maleabroad finds something which needs to be changed, he must discuss that issue here. Also, the segment on "beliefs and practices" which was tagged by admin Jossi for a re-write, was fianlly re-written. I had valuable help to re-write this part, being careful of maintaining the substance in Professor Kranenborg's cited article. One of the paragraphs named "activities" inside "beliefs and practices" was moved into "achievements."</p>
<p>Your contribution to make this article a researched and neutral one is appreciated. Best Wishes, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 03:20, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
