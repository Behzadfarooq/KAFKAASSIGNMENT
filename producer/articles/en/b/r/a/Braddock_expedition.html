<p>Braddock's expedition was just one part of a massive British offensive against the French in North America that summer. As <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander-in-chief.html" title="Commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> in America, General Braddock led the main thrust, commanding two <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiments</a> (about 1,350 men) and about 500 regular soldiers and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militiamen</a> from several <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_North_America_0dc2.html" title="British North America">British American colonies</a>. With these men Braddock expected to seize Fort Duquesne easily, and then push on to capture a series of French forts, eventually reaching <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Niagara_b513.html" title="Fort Niagara">Fort Niagara</a>. Twenty-three year-old <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, who knew the territory, served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General Braddock.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Braddock's attempt to recruit <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> allies from those tribes not yet allied with the French proved mostly unsuccessful; he had but eight <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mingo.html" title="Mingo">Mingo Indians</a> with him, serving as scouts. A number of Indians in the area, notably <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenape.html" title="Lenape">Delaware</a> leader <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shingas.html" title="Shingas">Shingas</a>, remained neutral. Caught between two powerful European empires at war, local Indians could not afford to be on the side of the loser. Braddock's success or failure would influence their decisions.</p>

Braddock had received important assistance from <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who helped procure wagons and supplies for the expedition. Among the wagoners, incidentally, were two young men who would later become legends of American history: <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Boone_e1f1.html" title="Daniel Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Morgan_b098.html" title="Daniel Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a>.

<p>The expedition progressed slowly, in some cases moving as few as two miles a day, creating <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braddock_Road_%28Route_40%29_ea54.html" title="Braddock Road (Route 40)">Braddock's Road</a>—an important vestige of the march—as they went. To speed up movement, Braddock split his men into a "flying column" of about 1,500 men (commanded by him), and a supply column with most of the baggage (commanded by Colonel Thomas Dunbar), which lagged far behind. They passed the ruins of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Necessity_78f7.html" title="Fort Necessity">Fort Necessity</a> along the way, where the French had defeated Washington the previous summer. Small French and Indian war bands harried Braddock's men during the march, but these were minor skirmishes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Fort Duquesne, the French garrison consisted of only about 250 regulars and Canadian militia, with about 640 Indian allies camped outside the fort. The Indians were from a variety of tribes long associated with the French, including <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawas</a>, <a href="../../../o/j/i/Ojibwa.html" title="Ojibwa">Ojibwas</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potawatomi.html" title="Potawatomi">Potawatomis</a>. The French commander, after recieving reports from Indian scouting parties that the British were on their way to besiege the fort, realised that his fort could not withstand Braddock's cannon, decided to launch a preemptive strike: an ambush of Braddock's army as he crossed the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monongahela_River_63ad.html" title="Monongahela River">Monongahela River</a>. The Indian allies were initially reluctant to attack such a large British force, but the French commander donned Indian war dress, complete with war paint, and convinced them to follow his lead.</p>

19th century engraving of the death of Major-General Braddock at the <i>Battle of the Monongahela</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1755.html" title="1755">1755</a>, Braddock's men crossed the Monongahela without opposition, about nine miles south of Fort Duquesne. The advance unit under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Gage_4ff3.html" title="Thomas Gage">Thomas Gage</a> began to move ahead, and unexpectedly came upon the French and Indians, who were hurrying to the river, behind schedule and too late to set an ambush. In the furious skirmish that followed between Gage's soldiers and the French, the French commander was killed, although apparently his death did not have a negative effect on French morale as the French and their Indian allies continued to advance. The battle, which came to be known as the <b>Battle of the Monongahela</b> (or the <b>Battle of the Wilderness</b>, or just <b>Braddock's Defeat</b>), was joined. Braddock's impressive column of almost 1,500 men faced less than 900 French and Indians.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After an initial defense, Gage's advance group fell back. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with the main body of Braddock's force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militamen and Indians enveloped them and continued to snipe at the British from the woods and ravines on the sides of the road. At this time, the French regulars began advancing from the road and began to push the British back.</p>
<p>Following Braddock's example, the officers kept trying to reform units into regular order within the confines of the road, mostly in vain and simply providing targets for their concealed enemy. In a fruitless attempt, cannon was used, but in such confines of the forest road, it was ineffective. The colonial militia accompanying the British either fled or took cover and returned fire. In the confusion, some of the militiamen who were fighting from the woods were mistaken for the enemy and fired upon by the British regulars.</p>
<p>Finally, after three hours of intense battle, Braddock was shot off his horse, and effective resistance collapsed. However, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">Colonel Washington</a>, with no official position in the chain of command, was able to impose and maintain some order and formed a rear guard, which allowed the force to evacuate and eventually disengage. This earned him the sobriquet <i>Hero of the Monongahela</i>, by which he was toasted, and established his fame for some time to come.</p>
<p>By sunset, the surviving British and American forces were fleeing back down the road they had built. Braddock died of his wounds during the long retreat, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_13.html" title="July 13">July 13</a>, and is buried within the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Necessity_78f7.html" title="Fort Necessity">Fort Necessity</a> parklands.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 1,460 men Braddock had led into battle, 456 were killed and 421 wounded. (Commissioned officers were prime targets and suffered greatly: out of 86 officers, 63 were killed or wounded.) Also, of the 50 or so women that accompanied the British column as maids and cooks, only 4 survived. The roughly 250 French and Canadians reported 8 killed and 4 wounded; their 637 Indian allies lost but 15 killed and 12 wounded.</p>
<p>Colonel Dunbar, with the rear supply unit, took command when the survivors reached his position. He ordered the destruction of supplies and cannon before withdrawing, burning about 150 wagons on the spot. Ironically, at this point the demoralised and disorganised British forces still outnumbered their opponents, who had not even dared to pursue.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braddock_expedition.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Braddock's defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela was a momentous event for the people of the region. The French and their Indian allies gained the upper hand in the struggle for control of the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Country_073f.html" title="Ohio Country">Ohio Country</a>, and a ferocious frontier war quickly escalated. Indians in the area who had been inclined to remain neutral now found it nearly impossible to do so. And the colonists of "backcountry" Pennsylvania and Virginia now found themselves without professional military protection, scrambling to organise a defence. This brutal frontier war would continue until Fort Duquesne was finally abandoned by the French as a result of the successful approach of the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Forbes_%28General%29_9761.html" title="John Forbes (General)">Forbes Expedition</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1758.html" title="1758">1758</a>.</p>
<p>Another notable outcome of Braddock's defeat was the effect it had on the reputation of George Washington. Washington, despite being in poor health before the battle, distinguished himself as being calm and courageous under fire.

<p>The debate on how Braddock—with professional soldiers, superior numbers, and bigger guns—could fail so miserably began soon after the battle, and continues to this day. Some blamed Braddock, some blamed his officers, some blamed the British regulars or the colonial militia. George Washington, for his part, supported Braddock and found fault with the British regulars.</p>
<p>Braddock's tactics are still debated. One school of thought holds that Braddock's reliance on time-honoured European methods, where men stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the open and fire mass volleys in unison, was not appropriate for frontier fighting and cost Braddock the battle. Skirmish tactics that American colonials had learned from frontier fighting, where men take cover and fire individually ("Indian style"), was the superior method in the American environment, so the argument goes.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A less popular interpretation, though perhaps the one favoured by military historians, counters that the European use of concentrated firepower was unmatched when properly executed, and that the superiority of frontier tactics is an American myth. Braddock's failure, according to proponents of this theory, was not that he did not use frontier tactics. He failed because he did not adequately apply traditional military doctrine, particularly by not using distance <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> Some accounts state that Washington commanded the Virginia militia on the Braddock Expedition, but this is incorrect. (Though it is true that Washington commanded Virginia militia before and after the expedition.) As a volunteer aide-de-camp, Washington essentially served as an unpaid and unranked gentleman consultant, with little real authority, but much inside access.</li>
<li id="_note-1"><b><a href="#_ref-1" title="">^</a></b> The Battle of the Monongahela has often been mistakenly described as an <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambush.html" title="Ambush">ambush</a>. The encounter was actually a <i>meeting engagement</i>, where two forces clash at an unexpected time and place. The quick and effective response of the French and Indians led many of Braddock's men to believe they had been ambushed. However, French documents reveal that the French and Indian force was too late to prepare an ambush, and had been just as surprised as the British.</li>
