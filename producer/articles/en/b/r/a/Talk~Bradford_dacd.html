<p>On the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_UK_geography_6ecd.html#Resources_and_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography">project page</a> you can find detailed guides on how to write about counties and settlements, as well as where to find statistics, references and other useful things. Additionally, the following have been identified as specific improvements this article needs:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Cite sources, see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> for fmting info</li>
<li>Twin towns in the history section? Most UK settlements it's a top-level section.</li>
<li>Geography: include geology, climate, ecology, etc.</li>
<li>Population data might go better in a Demographics section, including population change, age &amp; sex structure, race, religion, etc. Compare stats to regional and national averages.</li>
<li>Why are there two sport headers, one of them empty?</li>
<li>Prose is better than lists</li>
<li>Examine external links for spam. See <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> for how to judge the merits of an external link.</li>
<li>Religion section: don't start a new sub-section for every sentence. The religous buildings section does not need to be divided at all, and the "conversion" header is entirely redundant.</li>
<li>Transport: the canal info is probably more relevant to a history section. Is it best to order transport by mode of transport or into local vs (inter)national? I'll leave that to you to decide.</li>
<li>Start an economy section including major industries and employers, GDP, unemployment. Is there any notable tourism? If so include tourist revenue &amp; visitor numbers. Statistics should always be in context, e.g. by comparing to regional and national averages.</li>

<p>I believe that Bradford college seems to be associated with Leeds Uni now and not Bradford Uni. The college seem to be going through a re-branding exercise.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that Bradford wasn't formed in the way that most cities are. e.g they tend to grow from the middle outwards. Instead, the city centre was formed because of the growth and merging of (I think three) other areas. I don't know the terminology for a city formed this way, but there is one. Very loose on facts, sorry, but if you're dedicated to writing about Bradford I think these points could be included.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so: the centre formed around the church (now the cathedral) and spread. It did later swallow several separate townships (Bowling, Great and Little Horton etc) but I don't think that's unusual. Please provide a reference. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 23:42, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We've spotted some strange new 'kids' on the Bradford block. The work of artist Otmar Alt, they too are from Hamm. Take a look!". It is one of a number of sites which claim this.

<dd>These facts taken together seem to me to imply that Hamm is indeed twinned with Shipley, but prefers to advertise the prominent city of Bradford rather than the unknown town of Shipley as its partner.

<dd>Hello everybody, here comes the answer:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"Guten Tag!</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent enquiry.</p>
<p>I am pleased to confirm that Bradford is indeed twinned with Hamm in Germany and last year we celebrated our thirtieth anniversary. The link is a very active one and the Oberbuergermeister of Hamm marked the anniversary with a cake-cutting ceremony here in City Hall on a visit to Bradford last year.</p>
<p>Please allow me to clear up the confusion about the towns. Shipley (which became part of the much larger Bradford Metropolitan District Council in 1974) had originally enjoyed informal links of friendship with Hamm.</p>
<p>By the time a formalisation of that friendship (through twinning) was being discussed Shipley Urban District Council no longer existed as a legal entity. Therefore the twinning, in 1976, was between Bradford and Hamm but special emphasis was placed on the link with the Shipley area as this was the point from which the friendship had grown.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up the problem for you.</p>
<p>Mit freundlichen Gruessen!</p>

<p>Can anyone help me? I don't know what to so with this. I want to write about the famous incident in 1858 in which seventeen people died and 200 or so others were taken ill after eating peppermint lozanges accidently adulterated with arsnic. At the time it was commonplace for food to be adulterated (for example chalk would be mixed with flour, etc) and sugar was often mixed with "daft" (plaster of paris) to make the sweets heavier. The sweets were sold in Bradford market, having been purchased from a sweetshop in the town. The sweetshop owner obtained the plaster of paris from a druggist (Mr Hodgson - a possible relation of mine) from Shipley, who was ill that day. He sent a young employee to get the plaster of paris but he accidently used arsenic. Each lozange contained enough arsnic to kill two people.</p>
<p>I think this is a facinating peice of our history and led to legislation banning the adulteration of goods. however, I'm not sure if it warrents its own article of where I could fit it into this one. Until that point, here are two accounts for anyone interested. <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/ENG-YKS-BRADFORD/2003-03/1046972834" class="external autonumber" title="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/ENG-YKS-BRADFORD/2003-03/1046972834" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.pjonline.com/Editorial/20001223/articles/arsenic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pjonline.com/Editorial/20001223/articles/arsenic.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 20:42, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sure that the lengthy section on the history of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Cathedral_80ef.html" title="Bradford Cathedral">Bradford Cathedral</a> should be moved to that article. Would the writer of the section like to do that?</p>
<p>I am doubtful whether the long list of churches belongs in an encyclopaedia, but if it does, it should not be in the Bradford article. I suggest that if it's worth keeping, the various churches should be discussed in the articles for the various localities (Allerton, Baildon etc) with perhaps a 'List of Churches in Bradford' article. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 19:04, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seconded, the section on Bradford Cathedral is longer than the cathedral article itself. There should be a summary here &amp; the detail there. I would kind of prefer the list of churches to be a category and there to be pages about churches or groups of churches but that would be a lot of work &amp; I'm not volunteering to do it so Colin's suggestion of putting the discussion in the various local pages is more practical. <a href="../../../m/g/s/User%7EMGSpiller_fd07.html" title="User:MGSpiller">MGSpiller</a> 00:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, a lot of the material on the cathedral needs to go to the article on the cathedral. I think some of the churches in Bradford are noteworthy, but I don't think the complete list is all that helpful. --194.217.194.139 18:26, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have removed the list of churches, together with the intended headings (they weren't syntactically headings) for other places of worship. I think a section discussing places of worship would be worthwhile, but this list is simply not appropriate for an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 18:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many of the points in the UKgeo box are valid, and I will address some of them. But while it may be true that for "Most UK settlements [twin towns i]]s a top-level section", it isn't for the two settlements currently listed as featured articles on the project page: <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> has it under <b>Government and Politics</b>, while <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> puts it under <b>tourism</b>!</p>
<p>I do prefer transport organised by mode. I see the point about the canal, but other parts of the transport section include historical information, so I'd rather not split it on the accident of whether a mode of transport happens to exist today or not.</p>
