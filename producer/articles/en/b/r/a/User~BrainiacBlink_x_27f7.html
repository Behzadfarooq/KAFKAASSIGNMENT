	    <p>&gt; &gt; &gt; *restores trimmed stuff* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for saving me the time/effort. &gt; &gt; Bah! Bah, I say! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was fully aware it _COULD_ be read that way, but without it being spelled out, I chose to read it as a mugging/beating (Zod knows, if I was an evil violent vagrant, I'd be more concerned with stealing teenaged girls' money to buy myself alcohol/drugs/a-dog-on-a-bit-of-string or whatever else it is bums spend money on, than I'd be with that). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's the patterns, and what they DON'T show [since they wouldn't go as far as showing the thing explicitly, thank grife] that make it clear. Ironically, showing her getting punched would have made it <i>less</i> clear - If she'd "simply" been beaten up, they'd probably have shown her actually getting hit [maybe kicked on the ground], and bandaged/beaten/bruised in a hospital bed next, rather than doing the "secret shame" routine that she'd only told her therapist. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose you're right, although I was perfectly ready, willing and wanting to believe "I was beaten into a hospital bed and mugged by a vagrant" as her "secret shame". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We never saw her in a hospital bed though - that was pretty clearly her room. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was? Damn, I'll have to go check that. &gt; &gt; So she was beaten into her room? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But really, who keeps that sort of thing a secret? I mean, it'd be sort of hard for people not to notice you'd been beaten into the hospital, right...? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What he said. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know if I was beaten up by a vagrant, child, or inanimate object, I wouldn't be rushing to admit it to people. &gt; &gt; So how would you explain away turning up in the hospital in a battered condition? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what was this letters page which mentioned WM and the KB thing? I know the **Handbook** flat-out used the r-word, but I don't recall any letter-replies in the latter YA lettercols full stop (and certainly not in YA10, the one that dealt with the YASpecial) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pretty sure it was #11. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *will check later, if he gets the chance* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wonder Man-related, and no r-word used. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll have to check again, there is an issue where someone writes in praising it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm no help -- I avoided the comic the second I heard the unutterably stupid title. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was, indeed, the last letter in #11. &gt; &gt; I'll take G's word on this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And in other news, stabbed your eyes about the Bendis-written pimpsuit WonderMan yet? It's not worth it... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why why why do so many Avengers writers seem to have so much love for comics' worst character? Why do Marvel think it'll ever equal sales? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They all secretly have man-crushes on the Beast and think we do too? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And yet any fool knows that Beast is a better character in the pages of X-Men. While the Satan is always worthless. &gt; &gt; Though if you ever become a vampire, I guess we know what would ward you off.... &gt; &gt; &gt; And yet so many Avengers writers seem to love it the way Geoff Johns loves Hal Jordan. Which is about the only way you can make any sense at all out of certain plot-developments and characterisations in the book. &gt; &gt; I always figured they saw him as some kind of cheap Superman surrogate or something. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right now, give Bendis any character and it'll sell. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he could at least have the decency to take that challenge with a better character. Just stop it. All of you. No matter how much you polish a poop, it's still going to be a poop that <i>Stan Lee created to die</i>. &gt; &gt; Just Imagine Stan Lee Creating....A Poop Meant to Die! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Granted, it will bear no resemblance TO the character beyond the art, but it'll sell. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Outside of potty-mouthed Cage, and his treatment of Norman Osborn and Carnage, I'm not really having huge characterisation-problems from him, myself. &gt; &gt; I tend to think he writes a fairly crap Wolverine, though in NA it's nowhere near as bad as in Secret War (particularly the interminable airport scene). It's less that he gets characters wrong than that he never seems to have anything for half of them to *do* All that stuff about needing Logan in case they need a killer, and it looks like he'll be off the team before he ever actually does anything important to the plot. Instead, it's the Tony-Cage-Drew show, with sidekicks. &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, his Frost seemed somewhat...off, but I was more annoyed at having to read about her in New Avengers than caring about how she was portrayed. &gt; &gt; Has anyone explained how she became British? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, "how do you deal with it?" is the biggest argument against mainstream superhero comics ever going anywhere near the subject, since none of them seem capable of dealing with it as anything other than "motivation for become a crime-fighter", or "motivation for male heroes to 'avenge' her". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And this case seems to be "Stock Motivation A". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. Something has to be done. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And between that, and the Patriot steroids thing, two of the Young Avengers got screwed over with offensive and wrong origins. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yep - and has been pointed out, it was the black guy that was the druggie. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, intentionally or not, that just looks bad. Comics do seem to have an aversion to giving us a well-adjusted, black teen character with no drugs/crime/ghetto to him. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there was Synch and Prodigy. Granted, one's now dead and the other's depowered, but still... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's only proving my point, no? &gt; &gt; I guess Gateway doesn't have drugs/crime/ghetto in him, unless you count his involuntary servitude to the Reavers... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's not true! You're forgetting....that guy from...uhm....hm. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Point granted. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Steel faked his death, Luke Cage got his powers *from* drugs... plenty of NON-teen black guys in comics afflicted too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, there is that. Someone fix this, and give Bishop and War Machine back their own books. &gt; &gt; Bishop, sure, but I wouldn't mind seeing Jim Rhodes just being super-badass Jim Rhodes. The guy was kicking supervillain butt long before he ever put on armor. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Incidentally, is it just me, or have they gone from treating Truth-guy as mentally-screwed-over to just having him be mute-but-otherwise-normal? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll get back to you on that once I've gotten up to date on my comics, and then had time to read Truth. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be prepared for boredom -- the first issue appears to contain no actual plot advancement. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wasn't that standard for Jemas-era series? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Less "standard", and more "the law". Better comics than we've got now, my shiny metal butt. &gt; &gt; And let us not forget the ungodly terror that was Marville. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plus, they screwed up the timeline, since the "Black Cap"'s origin is set AFTER Steve Rogers/Cap's origin. Thus making the "first Cap" think crap. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, as I understand it, Truth itself was clearly set after Cap was already in existence, and takes this into account in one of the later issues. Yet every other book to reference it, or make use of the characters, has been working from the original idea that it pre-dates Cap. &gt; &gt; In fairness, the only characters making those references seem to be Josiah X and Isaiah/Patriot, and both of them seemed to have reasons to wilfully misrepresent the facts. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And while we're talking about the badness of rape-comics, let's mention <i>Get Kraven</i>, as yet another reason why it's so awful. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But really, could one ever run out of reasons that series is awful? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "It wasn't funny. Not even once." still stands as the best, though. &gt; &gt; Making us listen to the Vulture complain about his sex life might be even worse, though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It had a talking dog? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Wasn't this series supposed to be seven issues? And why'd I wait until the end to talk?" &gt; &gt; "If you just give him shifty eyes, people will *suspect the dog*." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But we already have _A_ Mysterio in action before that miniseries, regardless of when it's supposed to fit. And the new Mysterio doesn't look like he'd fit into the upcoming storyline in F'N Spider-Man, since his stated goal is just to use the costume to trick Spidey into a sense of familiarity with one of his regular sparring-partners, then teleport a fist into his head. Once he inevitably fails, he has no real reason to keep using the Mysterio costume. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thing is though, PAD was on record as saying he wanted to use Mysterio, but had no clue who it was? Even with the HBs saying "Beckhart"? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, and now he _IS_ using Mysterio, and we don't know which one he is going to use. It's possible he'll just dodge the issue like every minor Mysterio appearance has over the last few years, and keep the bowl on his head. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8-ball say, "Highly probable" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know if I was running the Spidey office, I'd have just decreed that everyone keep doing that until Quesada was gone and Quentin was safe to come back. (Seriously, we're, what, 8 years on now? Does anyone STILL think 'Guardian Devil' was THAT good?) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was good? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I...uh...liked parts of it at the time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the press-conference-call a couple of days ago talked about Mysterio<b>s</b>, plural... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I saw that. Is he going to make it all make sense? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FNSM13 solicit: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Mysterio, Mysterio, Mysterio! Who is the real Mysterio? It’s a question that has been perplexing Spider-Man (and his fans) for quite some time, and now the web-slinger is head-to-bowl against three Mysterios! Is it all another elaborate illusion or is reality stranger than any spectacle even the true Mysterio could conjure? The answer will shock you!" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So... maybe. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Three Mysterios? I wonder if he can make it all make sense? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We'll see. PAD's gone in recent times from the guy who made the "ignoring continuty undermines suspension of disbelief" quote on &lt;a href=<a href="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/" class="external free" title="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/</a>&gt;the Appendix front page&lt;/a&gt;, to... being far looser about it. Stuff like, when he needed someone to be puzzled over Madrox's dupes' activities, picked the one cast member who'd experienced the example first-hand and got her heart broken over it. Not to mention the Nightmare's-a-walking-retcon from his second <i>Hulk</i> run, and turning the Hulk-game adaptation into a MU-Abomination-history do-over, complete with a gamma-powered Samson before his origin. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, he's also the guy who asked the fans which villains they wanted to see, saw all the Hobgoblin votes, and effectively flipped them off by bringing in his own, incredibly obscure Hobgoblin, rather than using the original, whose lameness-once-unmasked he's expressed disdain for. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think he was scarred by having to write the unmasking issue after the character he'd been told to write it had already been killed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The way he tells it, he makes it sound like he took a no-win situation and turned it into something he genuinely believed in, and he's right, it was unique, memorable, something (as far as I know) never done before or since, and at the same time he put the new Hobgoblin over as a serious threat. &gt; &gt; True dat, and it was probably the only way out, since once the ID was revealed the character wouldn't have had much of a plotline left. &gt; &gt; &gt; All of which beats "Bring back the original Hobgoblin so Spidey can effortlessly whup him in 3 pages, then unmask him as an obscure nobody/poor-man's-Norman-Osborn who hadn't appeared in almost a decade". &gt; &gt; Any mystery solution that relies on someone's wussy twin brother in a wig is not good. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And you won't be seeing Hobgoblin 2211 again, don't worry&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stab your spoiler-giving eyes! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that still leaves Secret-War-Hobgoblin out there. &gt; &gt; Though at this point, some random thug in a Hobby outfit from a lame mini looks fairly pale next to Norman Osborn. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the preview of FNSM11 says that the Klum-Mysterio is at least one of the Mysterios involved... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yay. Let's hope it's not butt-rape ahoy for F'N Spidey. &gt; &gt; Spider-Man's fighting Doctor Light now? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though in fairness, the Hulk stuff was arguably a (misguided) attempt to sort out the mess Bruce Jones made with things like the Pointless Conspiracy, Superspy Betty Ross. and Wife-Beater Abomination and his Bruce-banging Ex-Wife. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While the BJ-Hulk was almost entirely a crap so big it had a vein in it, and the above-mentioned problems did need dealing with, I'm just not happy on principle with the idea of throwing out that many comics with a "some of it happened, but probably not as you remember it, some of it didn't happen at all", especially when the implication was that this also affects the Jenkins run, which I did enjoy most of, outside of the weak finale. &gt; &gt; PAD was apparently very upset about the Professor retcon. And using the "it was a dream!' excuse, plus leaving everything fairly unresolved at the end of the arc, wasn't much help in the longer term. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They would have cared anyway? When asked about the Purple Man mess where Bendis had Luke Cage beat the PM to a pulp while he was being actively used in <i>New Thunderbolts</i>, Bendis was reportedly surprised that there WAS a Tbolts series. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure that was a joke. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only in the same way as "READ IT AGAIN NOWING [sic] WHAT YOU KNOW NOW ABOUT WANDA!" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which a brief rant on got me banned from the Bendis board... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, that only got annoying when people started trying to apply that to non-Avengers books/stories. As an excuse for why any given thing in the post-Heroes Reborn, pre-Disassembled Avengers was stupid and/or nonsensical, I'm fine with it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It got annoying when it became the stock response to every plot hole - i.e., D1. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "D1"? Maybe it's just because it's 0730 AM, but I'm utterly blanking on that right now. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same here. And it's not 7:30 AM now, so 'splain, please. &gt; &gt; &gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; To find out what a D1 is, write to:</p>

<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because he's going to write back? Isn't he too busy planning to invade Mexico and Canada or something? &gt; &gt; "With Commander Cuckoo-Bananas in charge, anything is possible!" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And...you can't stand Bendis, but went to his board? Isn't that self-abuse? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went there to slag him off for the "NOWING [sic]" thing. Three lines later, I was banned. None involved swearing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eh, evreewun noes Bendis kant spel nd hiz editorz haf to fiks it forr hims. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It wasn't about the typo, although I may have mentioned that. It was just using that same damn excuse every for each and every one of the innumerable plot holes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most of the "plot holes" seem to me to be more "developments and characterisations people don't like" than actual "holes". &gt; &gt; I've rarely if ever accused it of plot holes, just of shoddy construction. And based ont he solicit for N.A. #26, it doesn't look like any of the longer-term ramifications of the story will stand a decade hence. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Y Kant Brian Reed? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because he's too busy writing Carol Danvers fail to save whole towns from getting blown up? "Best of the best" at what, exactly? &gt; &gt; Squatting on Shazam! trademarks? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although that whole Purple Man in New Thunderbolts storyline takes us right back to <i>STOP DOING RAPE COMICS DAMMIT</i>.... . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then again, Jenkins made a similar mess in GenM1 with Chamber (of course, he wrote everyone pre-established waaay out of character in that mini, and the Jubilee mess was worse...). And judging from the NewExc9 preview, Tieri - in trying to fix THAT mess - is creating another one, since the X-Men were nowhere near to get him onto life support (Jenkins said Beast grabbed him in time), so he should be dead. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, without yet having seen how Tieri tries to fix it, uh....let's see. Assuming the present-day events of Weapon-X: DoFN #1 have actually happened, then after Chamber offs Sublime a second time, Colcord and his Sentinels attack the Weapon-X crew, Brent Jackson escapes, Chamber and Agent-Zero disappear to parts unknown, and Colcord regains control of Weapon-X, including Sauron, Mesmero and Wild-Child. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chamber...uh...returns to the X-Men, then Decimation happens, and Mesmero, Wild-Child and Agent-Zero all get screwed over by it too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't work - New Excalibur #9 says he's in the middle of a muddy field, fighting, when most of the combatants powers' cut out [and that it was his Weapon X lower-face-and-sternum implants exploding which caused him to be in the mess of M-Day. BTW - Mesmero was there, and Wild Child still looks like Nosterafu]. Generation M #1 says he was at the Mansion [behind the scenes of HoM8?] and Beast got to him quickly. Basically, as far as NExc says, he should be dead. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .......I got nothing. Chamber, why you not dead? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dunno. He... just not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Luck? Skill? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Must have been luck. Were any of the non-depowered students teleporters [or even unknown-powers?] that might have been sent to look for him by Wolverine? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Confession-time: Outside of the New New Mutants and the New H*llions, I've barely bothered to keep track of the names/powers of any of the other students aside from the handful who got time in Milligan and Whedon's issues. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why should you, when the writers can't be arsed to? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did ANY writers use the NXMAX characters rather than making up characters on the spot? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .........Not that I can remember. Austen used some NXM background-fodder in his run, and that's about all I can remember. &gt; &gt; It;s good not to remember Austen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *remembers when him and Rad got very, very bored and spent half an hour looking over the student crowd scene in AXM9, only to find no recognisable characters except for the obviously-pasted-in-later Icarus. And considering that it had more characters than were meant to be students, and that most of the NMs/Hellions, except Rockslide, Dust and Icarus, should have been at least potentially identifiable without special treatment, that was amazing...* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man, when I get that bored, I just fall asleep. But do we blame Whedon or Cassaday here? &gt; &gt; Whedon, all the way; after all, it's not like he bothered to get Genosha's anti-tech field right either, is it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hasn't SHIELD's list got Mesmero and Wild Child as depowered, though? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mesmero went from green to not-green. Wild Child, well, was the Nosterafu appearance a mutant thing? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I remember right, it's at least part Weapon-X enhancements. And muteness from a Sabretooth-related throat injury. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, it happened in the flashback at the start of his one-shot, after an attempt to recruit Sunfire goes wrong. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of which, what was with that whole "launch a team book with a bunch of plot-thin solo character one-shots trend a few years back? Did any book actually *benefit* from that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Power Company is the only other book I can think of, and it certainly didn't benefit...the one-shots were the #1 reason why I never tried the series. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure the writer would have put G:DR off&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yeah, I wasn't going near that one with a 50-foot-pole. And I'm also blanking on any other series that tried that tactic. &gt; &gt; Oddly, his JLA arc and Astro City are quite good -- the former doesn't read much like his usual scripting and plotting style, and the latter is simply *good.* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, since it effectively quintrupled the cost of the first issue in the same way as the variant-interiors of <i>Slingers</i> #1, and essential info on Washout as well as some general stuff on Weapon X was included in the Wizard-exclusive #½ issue... it's amazing WX got past it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Wizard-free-#0 of Slingers was far more essential to that series. That, along with the four variant-interior #1s, surely doomed the book so much it's amazing it made it to #12.&#160;:( &gt; &gt; What really irked me was that it was just waaaaay too much setup; despite the 4 variants and the #0 and all of it, next to nothing was ever explained with things like Dusk's resurrection or just what the hell Prodigy's powers were actually supposed to be. Instead, we got two issues of the Griz, some nice stuff with Hornet and Ricochet, and a necessarily rushed and sloppy ending. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the utter lack of her in the three core books from 2005 onwards is enough to me to believe she'd left. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *pointing out that no-one in-the-mansion-but-not-on-an-active-X-team appeared in any of the three core books pre-DeciMation. Writers made up their own students, and the closest thing to an exception was Moonstar's one-page cameo... In Millar's Wolverine.* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moonstar _WAS_ teaching there at that point, though. Writers ignoring the students and non-combat-active teachers was acceptable enough for any storyline that didn't involve attacks on the school itself, like Austen's last one, or the Danger thing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was what I was talking about though, mostly. It's the same as creating a bunch of brand-new paper-thin "characters" every time they used a student rather than even using some of the non-NM/Hellion NXMAX characters to flesh them out some more. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And people wonder why I was so strongly against the idea of boosting the mutant population so much. &gt; &gt; I liked the basic idea of Mutant Town and mutants acting like a proper minority group. The real problem was in having so many mutants turn up *at the school* where they'd have to keep appearing in the background and so forth. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though we've still got writers assuming that their book's roster is the only roster, so that when Xorneto/Exodus/Danger beat one sub-team they have Defeated All the X-Men. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, uh...."destroy the team Wolverine's on at any given time, and all the others will fall"? &gt; &gt; It's even worse when the villain does stuff like attack the school head-on, and none of the other teams even notice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AXM's second arc really didn't make any sort of sense on that score. Even if you ass-u-me that both other teams were away, which is possible, you've got the homebody teachers - and some of the students, like Hellion, would probably have attacked too. Whedon j8st had them as an amorphous mass. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, that did call for more recognisable students to show up, yet Josh is about the only student he's used that isn't his creation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And even then, only as a plot device to fix the results of another plot device. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To be fair, he used most of the background students like Match, Gleason, Pixie, Anole, etc. in Astonishing X-Men#13. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Post-Decimation. He really didn't have much choice by that point (literally) if he wanted a multi-student scene. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And most of these guys are <i>so background</i> that I'm still barely bothering to register many of them as having names. &gt; &gt; Though NXMAX seems to be solving a lot of that problem..... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And not only would H*llion have defended himself and the others from Danger, he'd have surely taken a shot at Logan in the more recent training session. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fairness, though, it seemed like that session was just for a small group of the students who'd panicked and done nothing when Danger attacked. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wasn't that ALL OF THEM going by the published issue? Even Hisako-pet needed a stern talking to from Kitty to do anything, and that amounted to "run away as a group." Plus, with Decimation and all the NXM-no-AX carnage in-between, the Danger thing is significant? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, that's what you get when you're largely ignoring the other books. &gt; &gt; AXM is the flagship, though, and based on what that seems to mean for things like the Spider-titles, everyone else is supposed to use Whedon's characters instead of vice-versa. Not that I'm advocating that approach, mind you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a big fault with AXM. These are the major X-characters, supposed to be the senior, central team - and yet, it behaves in all but the most minor ways as if the other books and events don't exist. You can get away with that where you don't have three other ongoings and umpteen minis set in the Mansion and the X-team which is the first port of call for X-Men guest appearances. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd presume this is because the entire run was at least loosely plotted out so far in advance that if it WAS monthly, all of these storylines would've happened before the Decimation and other such events. &gt; &gt; Again,t he flagship exception. Just like the way ASM gets to tell the other Spider-writers what's up, and NA apparently has the "lead" in plot points for many of its associated comics. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, were we supposed to think Danger had killed any of the kids in the Room during that execrable arc? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't think so. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....uh....pick one you haven't seen since, and just pretend he/she died there? &gt; &gt; Can't I just assume that the lack of consequences means the story never happened? Wait, you say Danger was in the last....awwww, crap. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I figure "j8st" is probably a typo, but I badly want it to be some kind of incomprehensible term... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Give it time, and teh Internets will make it so. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I h8s 2 b j8st. &gt; &gt; $up4r &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know what you say about focusing on the core cast of a book, which is fair enough, but you shouldn't set up an arc like that. It would be like having an <i>Angel</i> episode in Sunnydale without mentioning Buffy, Willow, et al. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [And, more generally, I haven't been impressed with AXM anyway, and haven't even bothered reading it post-hiatus] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's some hilarious Wolverine/Beast scenes in the most recent issue, but otherwise it's a tired re-tread of stories you've seen done before. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd heard as much. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It has talk of moose. &gt; &gt; Say, are we supposed to assume that's what [character] would have been like if [character] hadn't been a mutant, or at least not learned he was? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the general plot direction and the extremity of events in issue #14 might mean that this is building to the end of Morrisonclops and the return of a better Scott. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While the set-up for ending the Scott/Frost debacle is there (and needs to be done to even begin restoring Scott to his old self), I still utterly fail to see how the powers-revelation is in any way helping the character. It just makes him look even more horribly psychologically screwed-up than ever before. &gt; &gt; Well, one can always hope that it's all a big fakeout and Perfection is somehow affecting Scott instead of Emma's thing being the truth. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In-character or not, nuthouse Prism was funny, though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given up by that point, although I saw the blink-and-you'll miss it Moonstar cameo. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine Prism talking like he was an A-list, Doom-style villain, lording it over other asylum inmates. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....would anyone notice or care whether Prism was in-character or not? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I bet someone did, though... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D'uh... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although you'd have to wonder why they'd bother. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prism's been cloned a hundred times. Call it a clone that didn't "bake" right, and it doesn't matter. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure I said "why bother"? &gt; &gt; Can you repeat that for us? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone complains, they'll just say it's Coronary and hope no one remembers he's not a mutant. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure I said "why bother"? &gt; &gt; Can you repeat that for us? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did we ever get anything about whether clones/genetic samples of DeciMated mutants got DeciMated too? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No. Nor Savage Land Mutates, for that matter. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When does Claremont get back to Excalibur? I'm sure it won't be long afterward... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #16 or #17, I think. And yes, you just watch him spend a year or two a Savage Land/H*llfire Club/Murderworld/Mojoverse/Belasco-Limbo/The Brood/Shi'Ar tour, then keep repeating. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Brubaker's doing the Shi'ar and <i>Carol Danvers: The Series</i>¹ did the Brood (And Planet Hulk's using *a* Brood... well), and <i>The Thing</i> did Murderworld and AXM's doing the Hellfire Club... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grife, even when Claremont's not doing them... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, at least a number of those are non-X-books using the concepts. I'm less averse to them being used at all than I am to these utterly-irrelevant-to-the-X-Men concepts clogging up the books for months, and dragging us far away from the core themes of <i>good mutants fighting bad mutants and giant purple robots</i>. &gt; &gt; Not to mention the core theme about the untrustworthiness of bald people. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ¹ - there are some series names just <i>too crap to type</i>.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm repeatedly confused by how much pointless-nostalgia there is for that name/costume. &gt; &gt; I like it better than the weirdly unaerodynamic military outfit Coipel gave her. If she'd drop &gt; the thigh-highs and the sash, he Byrne costume is fairly sleek and cool-looking, IMHO. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't forget the inevitable pointless efforts to reenact the Moore/Davis Captain Britain stories. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And drag them into the X-books where they're painfully out-of-place. &gt; &gt; And water them down badly in the process. "In my version, the Fury breaks the rookie's arm, but no one dies!" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Plus, while they've said the X-gene has gone, the fact that the Son of M Terrigenees get (sometimes twisted) versions of their prior powers back suggests that the X-gene is just the "On" switch. Meaning that if you inserted a generic X-gene into a DeciMatee, they'd get their original powers back (regardless of the powers of the donor). Just a thought] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interesting theory. Although it may be overthinking things, and Marvel will probably do whatever they want, sense or no sense. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably - I'm just trying to look for some logic in it all... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes there is no logic. Least of all in the Witch's powers, which tend to do whatever the writers want them to do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fairness, there's never been much of a sense of what she can or can't do since the Stan Lee "women are useless" days. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I've long thought that Wanda was ill-conceived from the start-- her powers were murky from day one, so subsequent writers have simply heaped confusion upon confusion. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It wasn't so much the start - yeah, they were murky, but it was just things going wrong ("oh, paperclips..."). Then they moved away from that to ever more generic and powerful stuff... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, it's not that her powers were originally a problem, so much as that almost every single Avengers writer seemed to feel the need to redefine her powers, heaping confusion onto confusion, until she's just a freakish mess that really can do whatever the plot requires, with no real limits anymore. &gt; &gt; Of course, that takes us all the way back to Engelhart again. And before him, frankly, she was ridiculously low-powered, restricted to things like making people spill their drinks or shorting out Comme robots. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Really, most of the Gen M stuff is like giving someone a drinking problem in an *-M*n Unlimited story - no-one's going to care. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And didn't Smith say Mad Jack sold the Mysterio costume to the Kingpin in the book? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I....don't remember that. If I could find where I left the miniseries, I could check, but I don't recall any Mad Jack reference. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yep - &lt;a href=attachments/060703211105/JackKlumMysterio.jpg&gt;see attached&lt;/a&gt; (granted, he says Jack O'Lantern, rather than Mad Jack, but I think the intent is clear). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, it's hardly going to be either of the other Jacks selling him a Mysterio costume. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And was that attachment not there last night when I read the post? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [I had it ready, but forgot to attach it.

Why, I even had a "if the picture was there, I could look at it and see" line ready to go, but then you went and added the image in. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spoilsport that I am sometimes&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At least I noticed the picture had been added in time to remove that line... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would have been amusink&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For everyone who's not me, anyways. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good thing I only ever care about my own opinion. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that's why we Appreciate G: DR! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Truth be told, I do value the opinions of a select few others, but admitting it doesn't help my evil image much. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vulcan - G:DR = separated at birth? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man, if only I was a Summers brother. Then I'd probably be from the future or have clones or something. &gt; &gt; True, but you'd also end up sleeping with a crazy woman and have creepy Goths trying to harvest your love juice. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The whole Mysterio situation is just more proof that Marvel need to reign in writers from killing Spidey villains outside of the core 2-3 Spidey books, though. We'll have to wait until Quesada's gone before anyone dares raise the obvious solution of just bringing Quentin Beck back, though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't they need a mystic resurrection at this point? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That, or reveal that the Mysterio in the Dead Girl miniseries was one of the others somehow. But then, that series states that Colossus was genuinely dead, so maybe Mysterio can also settle for an "aliens brought him back". More people want him back than wanted the Piano Man back. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wasn't Mysterio demoted a few levels of hell at the end though for trying to get back to life? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the Pitiful One (whoever he may have been) was, so the implication would be that his allies were, too. And as we saw, Kraven belongs there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And wasn't the Piano Player a good guy? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not if we judge him by his costume-sense, no. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's that - but then, Namor wears an open-waistcoat thing when he's feeling modest, and swimming trunks when he isn't... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, well, Namor _is_ a bi-polar nut who declares war on the world with more regularity than most full-time villains do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is that, yes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does make you wonder why we need other Atlantean villains like Attuma, doesn't it? Attuma doesn't even try to steal other heroes' wives. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seen the Turner Civil War #6 cover then? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Who in the world is actually out there pulling for this, to make Marvel keep going back to it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ATTENTION, WRITERS, ARTISTS AND READERS: YOU ARE MORE REED THAN YOU ARE NAMOR. THE NAMORS OF THE WORLD ARE THE GUYS WHO BEAT YOU UP AND DECLARED WAR ON YOUR RACE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not with the "Zi ram just followink horders" Reed of Civil War.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even with Civil War Reed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The "same" Reed who, of course, argued against the whole concept in Simonson's F4, lest we be allowed to forget... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't have a huge problem with "he changed his mind" there. Heroes ARE a lot more out-of-control these days. &gt; &gt; Maybe, but having him not care when Johnny gets beaten into a coma is just...wrong. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He really is the geeky hall monitor from Hell, isn't he? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; People are moaning about IM being out-of-character here, but I'm seeing the Reed-screw-over as far worse... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not getting how/why the pro-registration side are supposed to be "bad", "wrong", or "opposing civil liberties", when the alternative Cap's fighting for is unregulated masked vigilantes who are unaccountable for their frequent screw-ups. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How is this any worse than the real world, where most civilised nations have some level of gun-control, and masked vigilantism is against the law? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn't talking about that, more about Reed's reasoning as JMS gave it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I...haven't gotten to that issue quite yet. &gt; &gt; It is genuinely, truly offensive. I mean, like, Byrne-comment offensive. Basically, Reed thinks everyone should be a good little German, regardless of circumstance, and he gives one of the most inflammatory examples of such a thing in post-WWII American history as if it supports his point. &gt; &gt; I genuinely don't want to know what JMS was thinking, nor do I want him anywhere near the FF after that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, the difference is that you don't have people born with guns in their arms or eyes in the back of their head. And they're being annoyingly unclear on what the whole SHRA is about - is it "everyone with powers must register", "everyone who wishes to USE their powers must register", "all masked vigilantes must register, even the ones with no powers and thus aren't 'Super Human', but you can quit and avoid it" or something else/some combination? I've seen all of these, including some mutually-exclusive stuff, given. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is all a bit too vague. And it seems like they've had to tack on a sort of SHIELD-draft to the Act to make registration seem the objectionable choice, &gt; &gt; Though the Gestapo-esque enforcement seen in books like X-Factor is a problem too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what DOES constitute a power? Is an eye on the back of your head a "power", or the ability to fart in the scent of your choice? It's stuff "normal" people are biologically unable to do, but hardly likely to let them blow up a school... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, most "useless" powers like that are in the hands of the mutants, all of whom seem to be already registered. As would be any villains who've ever been incarcerated. So it'd just be superheroes with useful-in-combat abilites left unregistered. &gt; &gt; Also foreign nationals, extradimensionals, and possibly people with magical abilities, since technically anyone can develop those. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hee, yeah, whiich is why it's so funny to see self-proclaimed conservatives on these boards get so mad at Cap being anti-Reg in Civil War when it's as much an anti-gun-control story as anything. It's like they actually believe all the interview hype that the story is somehow about Guantanmo Bay or he War on Terror when it's really just a "police shootout gets out of hand, public hates guns" analogy with some vigilantism stuff thrown in. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. Ignore the "War on Terror" comments being made, and you get a story where Cap's gang come across looking more like NRA-nuts at best, and at worst, fighting to preserve a system where superheroes are largely untrained, unsupervised, and fail to effectively regulate themselves. &gt; &gt; Maybe, but to be honest, it's another one of those things you're sort of supposed to ignore for the whole concept of superheroes to work. As a short-term story,it's fine; as a long-term direction, I don't see it helping anything. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That Stark has on his side a number of ex-Avengers who'd be accountable for their screw-ups if registered, is kind of amusing, though. Stark himself included on that list. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's be honest, though: do the sides in this mini make any sense to anyone, or are they just a cheap effort to make Cap's side the underdogs in every fight? We've got Thor siding against Steve Rogers and with a bunch of mortals trying to tell him what to do, Tony Stark deciding the government knows best and that he should just roll with popular opinion, Reed doing an about-face from the last time this was an issue and not giving a crap about his own family... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems like nearly everyone with a public ID is on Stark's side. Except Cap himself. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cage is on Cap's side, too. &gt; &gt; Well, considering how he apparently used to feel about PI licensing.... &gt; &gt; &gt; And until Stark started his slide into morally-questionale jerk-iness in the '80s, Thor was way closer to him than to Cap. They had trusted each other, and no-one else, with their secret IDs, remember. &gt; &gt; True, but even so, do we really see Thor as believing in working for the government and having to file a bunch of peperwork in order to hit people in the head very hard with a hammer? &gt; &gt; &gt; But that we have Cap going against the will of the government AND the people, while Stark's side has guys like Hank Pym, the Satan, (and Stark himself) who have too much questionable crap in their pasts to possibly support "being answerable for their actions", is just weird. &gt; &gt; Except that if it's a gun-rights analogy, it's perfectly in keeping with Cap's past adherence to Constitutional idealism over all else. After all, he was always against Mutant Registration, and that was supposed to have been a popular and legitemately passed law too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And how do you know it's the Thor we know? He hasn't even had one line. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it doesn't look like Beta Ray Bill to me. And if it ain't Beta Ray Bill....wake me up when it is. &gt; &gt; Naaaay! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really hate it when they upgrade superheroes that way, because it's a pig for anyone to then get rid of the upgrade and restore them back to normal. Also see the original concept for Phoenix being Jean reaching her "full potential", which necessitated the "replaced by a cosmic entity" retcon as much as Phoenix being a genocidal maniac did. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, didn't they say it was an F4 origin riff - get hit by Cosmic Rays, get powered-up? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Initially, yes, but then Moira examines her in #125 and starts claiming that the events pushed her to her "full potential". That's the stuff that those crazies Sinister wars against on a certain other site just can't let go of. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then you get people suggesting that she actually died and resurrected herself in #101... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Didn't Nate Grey actually, officially, do that at one point? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think so. But if he did, I have totally purged such an event from my memory, and will thank you to not remind me of it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometime in the 40s of his series, IIRC... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read most of the #40s. The fight with Holocaust, the crossover with Cable. Don't remember him ever doing that. And don't want to remember such a thing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Rad said he remembered it in the chat the other night as well... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Betrayed by Rad? Stab his eyes, remember such things not! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You were there at the time, cuddling with SkeksisGirl *kiss* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't remember having any choice in that. DON'T JUDGE ME! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; G: DR cuddled with a girl? That is *so* gay! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ........that's gay? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like life didn't have me confused enough already. &gt; &gt; Sexually confused? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What happened, bruh? I used to think you had morals. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So did I. Uh...I mean, I do, dammit! &gt; &gt; Riiiiight. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He's fallen so far... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, there are still plenty of new lows to hit. &gt; &gt; You'd think so, wouldn't you? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe someone(like David Hine) will come along and make her a workable character again(Daughter of M? Scarlet Witch Chronicles?) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure I _want_ her to be redeemed anymore. In Disassembled, she unknowingly killed 3 team-mates with her out of control powers. It was concievably forgiveable if she worked her way back to sanity, and lost the amped-up powers that let her do this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But Decimation? Intentionally and willingly de-mutanting millions of people, and killing untold numbers, and crippling others, like poor Chamber, all because she was throwing a stupid hissy-fit at her father? Why forgive her for all that damage she did in a moment of stupidity? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just wait for the "Evil Red Chaos Demon" to turn up&#160;:/ &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aren't I the one who first speculated something so stupid would happen. I can see what others are saying by way of "blame writers for crapping up characters", but once they get this crapped up and irredeemable, should we really set aside all logic, reason and sense of good storytelling just for the sake of having them back the way they were as if nothing had ever happened? I say "No." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, they've reached what I'll call the Phoenix Point by now - what she's done is at a level that she can only get away with it if it's proven she was at least mind-controlled the whole time, and probably outright replaced. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is indeed true. The important point that needs to be considered by any writer thinking of doing so is, of course, <i>do we NEED to hit the reset button on her?</i> Does the Marvel Universe need her back as she was, or is it doing just fine without her. She doesn't have her own book, and didn't pre-Disassembled, and her presence doesn't seem to have ever been a sales-affecting factor to Avengers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I stand by my belief that she can stay crazy, and/or get killed off, and it's not going to really matter to Marvel as a company, nor to the needs of the Avengers franchise, and thus any "fix" is going to be done for the sake of nostalgia and fanboyism, rather than any pressing need to do so. And we all know the kind of 'quality' stories that tends to produce. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've hit the point where I'd really rather see justice be done in some way than see her get away with it all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Faint hope - especially now that we seem to have a list of depowered mutants, and she isn't on it (even if there were mistakes like Sabra and Sunfire). You'd think the NAvs would have looked, so I think we can safely presume that she didn't even DeciMate herself... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which really wouldn't make much sense, given that she's surely aware by this point that her powers are the source of all her woes, and rendering herself powerless would give her a shot at reclaiming her sanity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, given the "paper thin" stuff from HoM, if she was depowered, the whole house of cards would collapse and all the DeciMatees - including her - would get their powers back... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Overthinking it again, I'd imagine. Whether thinks she did with her powers last when she's de-powered and/or dead will probably not obey any kind of logic, and just work on the principle of "what Marvel wants to happen". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah... I know. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The thought occurs tho - why throw the "paper-thin" mess in in the first place? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wait. "Paper-thin" in HoM? I remember the "paper-thin" Kree ship in Avengers #502, which left us not-knowing if she'd created fake-Kree, or just influenced a bunch of Kree to show up and start shooting. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Pulse tie-in: Hawkeye reads the "real" newspaper, talking about Disassembled, where the reporter sees something about the HoM world on the same piece of paper. Lots of repetition of the phrase "paper-thin". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ......uh.....Hawkeye isn't any more "real" than the House of M? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I got nothing. &gt; &gt; Hawkeye's anorexic? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does it really matter, since everything in that arc was basically Wanda's fault? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read the scripts, but I probably understand the story less than anyone. It *seems* as though the Kree were all supposed to be fake. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Damn, that way's less fun. &gt; &gt; Again, does it matter? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, then, Iceman was supposed to be there... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You'll have to wait a little longer for your Amazing Friends reunion, "together again, for the first time!" &gt; &gt; It doesn't count if Ms. Lion isn't there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although if we were putting any logic into it, there's probably a difference between "things she created", which could then cease to be, and "things she made happen", such as the Decimation, which would not un-happen, because it's already done. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But have they really lost their powers, or is a mystic "mask" hiding them? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, just "gone" makes for an easier explanation, doesn't it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously, but if they're planning to be consistant... *watches everyone fall about laughing at the idea of Marvel being self-consistant* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have they EVER been? Really? &gt; &gt; They used to try, at least. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't even keep track of whether Wanda's powers are "mystic" or something else anymore. Not that the editors and writers can be bothered to keep it consistent either.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They're still magic. Even if you take everything Strange says @ face value re: chaos magic, he still out-and-out says they're magic. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, before she got all crapped up, she had both mutant AND magic powers. No reason she can't be using one and not the other, rather than the sheer retardity of them being one and the same. &gt; &gt; I dunno, it seems like calling her mutant powers a "hex" was just opening that door right from the start. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then there's DS:SS #85, that DeZago/Zircher fill-in G:DR retroactively hates... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, like anyone actively liked that comic in the first place? Isn't it more that they're using it to try and support other crap comics? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I'm more hating that fandom can be so collectively stupid as to talk as if Strange was "using chaos magic through that entire era", with the last issue of the series being cited a lot. I _OWN_ that issue. Not a mention of it. &gt; &gt; Maybe, but I still think properly-written chaos magic -- it is a "real" version of magic -- would be frickin' cool in a comic. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And is this a bad time to mention that Ion #3 has Hal Bloody Jordan apologising for something Bad that Kyle did during a blackout with "he's not usually like that"? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .........even Marz has betrayed us?&#160;:'( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dammit, what made them think the blackout killing-sprees was a good idea for Kyle beyond "At least Hal's awake when he goes nuts"? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dunno. At least they seem to be implying mind control AT THE TIME though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Better than doing so over a decade after the fact, I suppose. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah. It's the difference between a "plot" and a "whitewash." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, what a difference forward planning makes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I still can't see one solid reason WHY they needed to whitewash the mass-murdering-psycho anyways. If Kyle really wasn't selling comics anymore, either create a new GL, or give the series to John Stewart, who's probably the most well-known GL to non-comics-readers due to his cartoon role (you can just imagine comics-novices seeing a GL comic and being confused) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No argument from me on that score. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And Ion #4 reveals that it was a ringer with a yellow ring that was apparently doing the killing, posing as Kyle/Ion. Unfortunately, after a lot of Mass Murdering Psycho You-Know-Who airtime.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, does DC think he = sales or something? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, yeah -- Rebirth did very good numbers, and DC have mistaken that for "people love Hal" rather than "Johns and Van Sciver are sales draws." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *still doesn't get WHY Johns is a sales draw...* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He appeals to...uh...Silver Agers who want occasional outbreaks of hardcore-violence? &gt; &gt; His Flash was actually pretty damn good untilt he last arc. His Zoom was genuinely scary, for instance, and he actually gave Captain Cold a worthwhile personality. &gt; &gt; &gt; Say whatever you like about his writing, but he does apparently go above and beyond the call of duty for the fans at conventions, though. I watched in shock as he proceeded to sign copies of <i>everything he's ever written, variant-covers and tpbs included</i> for Guy From Singapore, who you just know was selling it all online as soon as he got home. &gt; &gt; How did they guy physically get all that stuff to the table in the first place? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You might just as well say that the big sales numbers on Emerald Twilight were because "people love Kyle." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Much as I hate to do this... Kyle had but two small cameos in ET. It wasn't until the next issue where he actually, y'know, became the lead (not to mention that no-one "loves" a brand-new character, but you know that). So bad example. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, Emerald Twilight sold because "people love seeing a hero fall from grace and become a mass-murdering-psycho". &gt; &gt; Works for Logan. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still thumbs up to Marz for not making Kyle also a mass-murdering-psycho. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But thumbs down for having no better plot better than the standard "villain frame-up" bit &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd thumbs-down it overall. Mostly for too much Mass Murdering Psycho Hal Jordan airtime, but also for the frame... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, but at least Kyle _isn't_ a mass-murdering-psycho. There's still that. &gt; &gt; True, but he's still Kyle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and riffing on one of his own clumsiest stories to set it up. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ummm... Nero was a Judd Winick creation. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I only ever read one issue of his run. &gt; &gt; I was referring to Emerald Twilght. Hal needed to be swept away at that point, but let's face it, his heel turn was done as fast as possible. &gt; &gt; What is it with the crappiness of hasty deck-clearing exercises in comics? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand, G can now blame the Identity Crisis Dr Light flashback, and the Green Lantern whitewash on Superboy Prime totally Spocking up the timeline, while DC also have him as an explanation for why the fools allowed Hawkman, Power Girl, Wonder Girl Version 1.0, The Moon Patrol and The Legion to become walking continuity nightmares. Not that it's not stupid, but I suppose it beats no explanation for why certain characters' continuity keeps rebooting/re-writing itself. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Legion wasn't screwed up AT ALL continuity-wise this side of Zero Hour until Waid stuck his big nose in again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well...uh...they HAD been rebooted two or three times before. Although I suppose if it was just 2, they at least had Crisis and Zero Hour as the explanations for those. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They'd been rebooted (in Day One fashion) Once and Once Only, in Zero Hour. (plus two mini-reboots, in Crisis and in 1990 or 1991. The cumulative screwing-up effect of which led to the ZH reboot when the people working on the then-two Legion books realised that, with the editorial mandate to sum up the history of all the characters in the #0 issues, they literally could not coherently sum up Legion history in two issues. Hence the reboot. The current reboot has no such excuse.) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, you know I'm just messing with you, right? I'm aware of the Zero Hour reboot being "necessary due to how screwed up the series got", and that the current reboot was needless beyond "Waid wanted to reboot it", &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I guessed, but even with that, it's a button I can't avoid replying to. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, now you know how I feel, the number of times people here deliberately push my rage-buttons. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, I already did. Doesn't stop me.&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I suppose if nothing else, it makes a change for me not to be the one raging. Need to find more people's rage-triggers here, though. Well, for people other than fans of the Goblin Queen, and NXM fans. I'm sick of arguing with people who scare me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How about Care Bears fans? Or are they still too scary?&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They...still have fans? I'm not afraid of either of them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless they're furries. Those guys do scare me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Care Bears Furries? Some circles you move in...&#160;;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I didn't mean mixing the two groups. Although I wouldn't be surprised if such people do exist. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But no, The G caught the start of a documentary on Fuurries on tv once, and it did scare him. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I'd rather just talk with friends, or debate with people who are at least somewhat on the same page as me, than beat my head against brick walls trying to enlighten the lost and the damned. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fair enow. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've got to make the effort to stick to this as much as I possibly can, too. For the sake of my time and my sanity, else I'll end up like Sinister, fighting his never-ending-battle against insane Phoenix-fans. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey look, it's someone saying Morrison wrote the Best Jean Evah! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THEY'RE LIKE ANIMALS! I HATE THEM! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Made you look&#160;;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Urge to kill rising.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *turns TV on.* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, there's anything good on? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not since they cancelled <i>Arrested Development</i>. *Cries* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I stopped watching TV 2 years ago...and haven't missed it at all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, unless downloading Battlestar Galactica counts. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *hasn't watched a new US show since... umm... Farscape...* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't since...uh...the last day of 24 ended. &gt; &gt; I only watch stuff on DVD, technically. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not as if you've not got any of them&#160;:) [Scarlet Witch resurrected Hawkeye, so she can resurrect the dead whether you like it or not!] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then Hawkeye is as 'alive' as Harkness was. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The alternative is just plain retarded, and I will rage against anyone who actually wants otherwise for their retardity. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But Harkness was alive in every way that mattered - &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Except that everything she ever said and did is now suspect. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Said, perhaps, if it's true. Did is a matter of record. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, look at the things she's been involved in, such as manipulating the (apparent) demise of the twins, and the resurrections of Mephisto and the Satan, or blindly leading the Witch to Lore in her miniseries. She had been very shady for quite some time, only showing up when Bad Poop was happening, and usually being a factor in things getting worse. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is any of that actually <i>out-of-character</i> for her, or just proved that she's really a villain? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it all involved her being VERY CRAP at being "a good guy", and manipulative with questionable motives, enough so that exposing her as a villain and/or impostor would've easily worked at any time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But "walking corpse" works well enough for me, since it's still discrediting her as a source of information, and it got rid of her. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why does it discredit her, even if true. That's Zombieism! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It discredits her in that she's not really Harkness, she's just a corpse subconsciously animated by the Witch's power. She can't really know anything the Witch didn't already know, so all the exposition and "explanations" she provides about the twins and about her powers, are all just crap. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Legion-Lost-Apparition defence? Saying that's probably more akin to saying Dinobot II can't really do/know anything Rampage didn't. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dinobot II is a clone of Dinobot I, not a mystical re-creation of. Work with me here, for the perfectly reasonable goal of discrediting the "twins are fake" and "your mutant power is to use magic" stuff. &gt; &gt; What a pity I let lapse my subscription to the Journal of Clones and Magical Duplicate Reasearch. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As opposed to the wise council of Dr. Strange, whose role in Bendis stories is apparently to sit on his duff while people die until tedious exposition is required. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given how Strange tends to sit out most regular-superhero stuff, I'm inclined to cut him a break and believe he was busy doing his job whenever *insert name of hero* dies. &gt; &gt; And yet whenever anyone needs to talk to him, he's just in his house drinking tea and forgetting that their girlfriend died and he attended the funeral. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which I guess explains why he's taking off rather than deal with Civil War. "Bugger this. If they want their exposition, they can pay Reed." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really hate the way Millar's playing Strange &amp; Reed as archetypes rather than characters. "Fasting for forty nights" in the hope it fixes it? Strange is a LOT smarter than that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Strange probably _CAN_ sit Civil War out and not really have it affect him much at all. So call it fence-sitting. &gt; &gt; Until his teammate Namor's cousin gets blown up real good in the precipitating event, and he's on some kind of useless board of arrogant superpeople. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for "said", well, her whole "truth about your powers" exposition speech has been discredited. The "truth about the twins" exposition also looks set to be discredited (and that NEVER worked, since in what world would Dr Strange deliver the twins and not-know that?) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thing I'm disturbed about with the latter, is that it seems we're supposed to take Wiccan's conclusion-leap as gospel. <i>Oi, Heinberg, you actually need to bring in a character who would know what they're talking about to prove that. Like Dr. Strange</i>. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Good point, but that IS a flaw that could be thrown at a huge number of comics, where massive leaps in logic are taken as Fact simply because the writer wants it that way, so no-one questions it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, but retcon of a retcon (of a retcon?), you really need to make some sort of effort to prove your point... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, if the book was monthly, we might be getting there by now. As it is, they can hardly do a DNA test with their father. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither of our sources on "the twins aren't real" was very reliable, and dammit, people want the twins to be real, so yes, we may be ready and willing to share in Billy's leaps of logic just to reach the result, but yeah, they're going to have to prove it sooner rather than later. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about all the nannies that kept getting fired after the twins kept disappearing? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, obviously SOMETHING was going on with the twins, but not the "they're not real, just parts of Mephisto" thing we were told. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We'll see. I honestly don't expect Heinberg to actually address this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And is there some sort of time travel meant to be at work here? Three of the four founding YAs have screwed-up-timelines for their origins... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, if Billy and Tommy ARE the twins, I can see that being explained with some kind of time-displacement thing, but what's Teddy's excuse? &gt; &gt; I don't read YA. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hide-and-go-seek as played by nigh-omnipotent mutant toddlers? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the "puppet of flesh" thing was never established in-comic, IIRC. You could just as easily read that scene as "she warped things so that she got eaten to death by maggots" or somesuch. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hate that you're right about this, and so many things need to be explained online these days. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thing is though - Online Explainations Don't Count (remind me to tell you about the JSA one that the co-writer gave that completely contradicted the story in an attempt to explain why people didn't realise they'd missed six months of their lives). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, nobody _LIKES_ exposition, but there are times when we need things explained clearly in-story, dammit, so we have a clue what the Spock just happened. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why am I thinking of Shatterstar's "origin" so much when I say that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most incoherent story until Disassembled? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again with the Disassembled-hate? That wouldn't even rank on a list of most incoherent stories within the Avengers books (AWC #51-2, take your prize as the winner) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And back to Byrne again.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it is deservedly true. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surely not as incoherent as the way the Pacific Overlords story was resolved, with Doctor Demonicus suddenly deciding to literalize his name and become a demon-worshipping loon when all it could possibly have done was lose him his country. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wasn't that explained as him "exploring the caves on his island, and falling under the control of a demon lurking there", rather than him just "choosing to become a demon-worshipping-loon"? &gt; &gt; The one bit of explanatory dialogue we got suggested that he voluntarily worked with the demon thinking he'd get more power out of it, which still makes him an idiot rather than a thrall. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See also Eve-of-Destruction Magneto. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, like you've never wanted to put on a sweet new black costume and declare war on humanity? &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but I like to think I'd be less dopey about it if I lived in a world with something like a zillion superheroes who would surely try to stop me and my island of mutant henchmen, some of whom know how to build planet-sized Neutralizers or cast huge magical spells. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *still bitter over the Handbook writers insisting that Her/Asyhea (sp?) from Claremont's FF run was Kismet, despite it having no basis in the story and the only thing that indicated it was the assistant editor's reply on a letters page...)* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't like it either, but we took the issue to editorial and were told that they're the same person, even though it wasn't clear in the stories. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C'mon, it's not as if you can check with them on EVERY point. They'd go nuts. And start shouting. Loudly. And probably either write it themselves or stop the whole idea. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could have written a bio differentiating it and footnoting Ayesha (or Kismet, depending on which the bio was for) as a separate character and why and hoped they wouldn't notice it, or would agree with you after that was done or something. I've read that story umpteen times. I've read the Quasar story that left Kismet with the Enclave. I've read the HR-era <i>Spider-Man Team-Up</i> w/Tbolts issue where there's the Enclave and no Her of any sort. And I've read Pak's <i>Warlock</i> series since, where they're making <i>another</i> Her, from scratch, and which fits best between the SMTU issue and the F4 issues. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And It. Makes. No. Sense. for Ayesha to be Kismet. It's easier for them to make a new Her than to capture Kismet, brainwash her and physically remake her - which basically amounts to starting from scratch anyway. It fits with what they were apparently doing in-between per <i>Warlock</i>. And there is not a shred of evidence in the published stories to fit with the theory that an assistant editor probably dashed off on his own when getting a letters' page out of the way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's this sort of stuff, like Moreels' insistence that the Erista thing came from somewhere with no proof, or the Mysterio ID that G:DR moaned about up-thread, that gives the Handbooks a bad name. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .......yeah. What you said. That, and after the "Cyclone II skiing accident" thing, I'm living in fear of some cracktard getting to do the Century bio and mentioning rats (when ARE we getting the '80s and '90s Legacy books, anyway?). &gt; &gt; I really don't wanna go 'round on this with you, so I'll let Michael shout the word "we asked the editors and writers if it was ok" into your ear as loudly as possible. &gt; &gt; For Zod's sake, no one griped about it when the old Handbooks gave Mystique's Brotherhood members and half the Marauders brand-new real names and backgrounds, among a number of other examples. &gt; &gt; &gt; So...uh...anyone else spot the MODOK-history error in the new issue? &gt; &gt; Shop screwed up the order, so no. &gt; &gt; &gt; *ashamed to admit noticing, as it means admitting to having read Defenders vol.2, officially the Worst Comic Ever* &gt; &gt; Eh, I enjoyd Defenders v.2. It was The Order I couldn't stand. Yeah, that's right, I'm a mark for the Headmen and dumb Hulk jokes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or the Marvel Necronomicon making use of that "it was always Evil-Fake-Maddie Pryor in the pages of X-Man", an online explanation which jibed with the published story, and had been said in the ignorance that the character had also made appearances in Cable, leading to a bizarre "well, she was real in Cable, but not in X-Man" statement. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know, considering the defensive attitude the Handbookers always take, you sense they <i>know</i> that they're adding their favourite fanfics in. And desperately repeating, "Well, it's Official Now," when they get caught on message boards. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I really can't complain too much about them fitting in mentions of Marvel novels (or the Avengers videogame) that don't impact things at all, or giving un-named characters the real-names of people we know, but working in anything like that, or "things the writer said online" really shouldn't be done if it's going to in any way contradict actual published comics. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Word on the latter. Although the earlier stuff mostly takes up space - Moreels was moaning about the fact that they have to work to word counts, then they fill paragraphs up with stuff that doesn't matter and leave themselves next-to-no space for the important stuff for each character. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, if you've got the sort of page-count the Wolverine profile in his own Handbook got, or it's a new enough character that it's hard to distinguish what's going to be important because the character's not nailed down yet and their earlier plots aren't resolved; that's one thing. But if you've got two pages to cover Hank Pym or the Vision, or one page to cover Quasar or USAgent, you need to prioritise, and if that means leaving stuff out, So Be It. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, pretty much agreed all round there. But I do get angry at seeing them make use of "writers' online comments" that flat-out contradict published comics (the Maddie Pryor thing), making stuff up that contradicts comics (the Mad Jack thing), or a writer's lame-joke response to "What happened to the second Cyclone?" of "He died in a skiing accident" actually seeing print. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Worse is them taking Lobdell joke about the AFv3 Sunpyre's origin seriously.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ......that was Lobdell's joke? I thought that was just some handbook-writer going completely insane. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They asked Lobdell what his origin for her was, and that's what he told them. Given that AF v.3 was a (not very funny) comedy book, it's probably what he really did intend, and it's not like anyone from that series is going to turn up again... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, we spend a lot of time asking the writers/editors what their intentions were for unresolved/unclear material (which among other things will lead to G:DR being happy with issue #11, I think). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #11? Ooh, throw G a hint... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given the obviously-hasty recolour of Silver Samurai (who was also meant to be dead, but got better for <i>Rogue</i>) as "Ebon Samurai" in that story, I really think that Sunpyre was meant to be the original and no-one knew about that UXM story... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was my guess, too. Only replacing "knew" with "cared". &gt; &gt; Sigh...see above. Lobdell, the character's creator, told them what to write in the entry. Honestly, you're just carping for carping's sake at this point. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Massive logic-leaps like the non-Australian comedy-Kangaroo being the roided Australian monster from Tangled Web tend to irritate, too. Wouldn't kill anyone to say they're clearly different guys. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Supposedly, Alonso, the Spider-Man editor insisted on that, and a few other not-entirely-sensical Tangled Web-related things.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like them having to make up a name for Rhino so idiots like whoever writes for Wizard would get that "Alex O'Hirn" was obviously not his real name? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm hardly impartial where the OHOTMU is concerned, but I like the cementing of the Rhino's Eastern European background fromt he 1990s Spider-books, since it was the closest he's ever come to having a distinctive personality beyond "dumb thug." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And frankly, for a while there it really did look like Bendis and Alonzo were trying to throw that background out or at least pretend it never was. The Ultimate Rhino's real name apparently <i>is</i> Alex O'Hirn, for instance. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, G:DR pretty much called it there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where <b>did</b> the idea of making Rhino Russian come from anyway? He's always written as a dumb thug with a Brooklyn speech pattern from what I can see. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been living under the (possibly-mistaken) impression that Rhino's been from a former-commie nation since Day One, but the 1993 ASM annual clearly shows him importing his family to the USA. &gt; &gt; Originally, he was just recruited by Russian spies, but not specified as anything other than a dumb thug of indeterminate origin. In the 1990s, an Annual backup established that he was Russian himself, and had been recruited with promises relating to his relatives back home. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but what were the extents of the two "mini-reboots", and was there any necessity to them at all beyond Crisis giving them a Superboy-ectomy? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was a double-Superboy-ectomy. Crisis made it into an alternate ("Pocket") universe Superboy (they didn't bother addressing Supergirl), &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But not the same 'Pocket Universe Superboy' as the Byrne Supergirl/Phantom Zone Criminals. Which would've been too easy? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, it was the same one, actually. Hence them having to force that story (and only that story) back in after going to the trouble of doing a story to remove all mentions of Superboy. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ........OK. And this is why I just spend years of my life not-reading-DC so as not to confuse myself with things like this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes, you can be sensible&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then came Space Year 2001, and they go and lure me in with the Zod, while Marvel is actively trying to chase me away by making Spidey, the Avengers and the X-Men all suck. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And now? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And now? Now my Superman comics make me I remember exactly what I've been missing from my Avengers comics since mid-2001. Dialogue and narration that literally hurts my brain to read. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There you go. Drop. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But isn't Nicieza working on one of the books about now? To be replaced by the Secret Mystery Writer? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a reversal of the earlier New Tbolts issues, FN's co-plotting with Busiek, while the latter scripts. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dang. The only good thing about them working together on NTB and Avengers/Thunderbolts was how it was usually so obvious who was responsible for which plot-element or character-usage. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I dunno, I liked the early issues of NTB, if only for the Speed Demon/Blizzard interplay. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Genis wasn't on-panel, they weren't so bad. When he was, my enjoyment shot through the floor. I know the he-can't-be-Captain-Marvel was editorial, but that doesn't excuse the Photon bad-joke, any time he was on-panel in #1, or... really, every panel he appeared in in that book. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There were some elements I did like, but so many of the original T-Bolts cast have changed so much that anything I did like about them has been largely bled-out in exchange for turning them into C-list heroes, and I'm still not overly thrilled about even more villains getting the same treatment. &gt; &gt; Though Zemo's back leading them now, and he seems to be one of those "antiheroes who will kill a hundred innocents if it saves a thousand" types. &gt; &gt; &gt; And while he was surely coming back eventually, overturning Strucker's death so quickly just feels unneccessary. Let the new guy from ASM run Hydra for a while. &gt; &gt; Meh. Nicieza had plans for Strucker as evidenced by the Swordsman's ID, which Millar ignored in order to give us an unrecognizeable version of the character, treat him like a joke, and kill him off unceremoniously to push a villain Created to Die. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, Marvel? Mostly Not Sucking. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although, I find Bendis-dialogue literally hurts my brain to read.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, how hard is it to avoid reading UltSpidey and New Avengers? It's not like he's writing everything the way he was a year or two back. Nor like Jemas is still around forcing everyone to write with Bendis-style pacing. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't read them. Im just saying, since you gave examples of the same thing... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you have similar issues with Claremont, too? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bendis, Claremont and DeFalco are the three I have real trouble reading the script/dialogue of. There are other writers whose stuff I avoid for other reasons, but those are the three really, really bad scripters. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DeFalco, too? I thought you were down with the Spider-Girl? &gt; &gt; Zuh? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's not forget things like Nicieza's technobabble, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really don't remember that being so noticeable in his early-'90s work. It seems to have really gotten out of control during his original Thunderbolts run. &gt; &gt; True. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Engelhart's "all sentences end in exclamations!" dialogue, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Was this as noticeable in the '70s? But by the '80s, it looks horribly out-of-place, like he'd failed to evolve at all. &gt; &gt; Yeah, this is true. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; James Robinson's "<b>this</b> word <b>is inappropriately</b> bolded" scripting style, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is he the only one to do that? I'm sure I've seen people complain about that in lots of comics. &gt; &gt; Robinson does it to an extent and at a level of awkwardness that surpasses most people. Read a few of his Starman stories and you'll see what I mean. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kurt Busiek's tencdency to have every character speak in folksy Midwesternisms and for energy attacks to "splash off of" force fields, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And overuse of flashbacks and Wonder Man. &gt; &gt; Only on the one title, really. I'm talking about more general things. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark Millar having every character bluntly call someone else "idiot" at the end of a sentence, and probably eight or nine dozen other examples of this sort of thing from various well-known comics writers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, we could go on forever. &gt; &gt; Exactly the point. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; J.M DeMatteis: villains are traumatized little boys; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Vermin was his own creation, but it's not like Helmut Zemo and Harry Osborn didn't offer plenty to work with in that respect already. &gt; &gt; True, but he added abusive/traumatic childhoods to the backstories of the Chameleon and even the Red Skull. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PAD: pop culture references, usually to his favorite tv shows (Twin Peaks, B5, Trek); &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's a BAD WOLF on the wall in FNSM10... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You're just as likely to get stories with thinly-veiled analogues to real-world events/problems. Although Marvel as a whole used to do a lot more of that. &gt; &gt; Yeah, and they're trying to again now, it seems. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brian K. Vaughn: obscure-historical/pop culture-reference-o-rama...and while I can't think of specifics, you can recognize tics in Gail Simone &amp; Keith Giffen's writing with little effort. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, every writer has tics (and, of that list, DeMatteis only gets a bye for his comedy-scripting. His mystical stuff (Dr Strange, Spectre and anything else involving magic, including his <i>Martian Manhunter</i> mini) is frequently horrid)). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DeMatteis' original Spectacular Spider-Man work is still The Awesome, dammit. Although that mystic-themed Puma story was the weak link in it. And I liked most of his other Spidey work, too. &gt; &gt; Yeah, it was mostly a lot of fun. I did sort of get tired of the endless revisiting of Kraevn, though. It's not like the guy was ever a good villain outside of that one story, and after about the fifth sequel to "Last Hunt" I just wanted it to go away. &gt; &gt; &gt; His X-Factor ran right into the ground once Lobdell stopped co-writing it with him, and he went right into that quasi-mystic Haven thing, and much of his Silver Surfer was The Suck, too. I always use him as proof that no writer is consistently always-good or bad. &gt; &gt; I liked the first couple of issues of his Surfer, especially the rather welll-written Hulk guest-shot. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The question becomes how distracting they are, and how much they hurt the story. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can't think of many that actually bother me so much they automatically kill my ability to enjoy of a book. &gt; &gt; Same here. Though once they're pointed out to me, I can't help but see them constantly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still reading any titles OYL, or have you finally given up? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm giving the Superman books a chance, and am...whelmed. Other than that, I'm still reading Birds of Prey, and giving Ion a chance. Sleep-killing and all. Oh, and 52, because it's full of characters I like. Although we did indeed call the "he's gonna make Booster Gold suck" part right.&#160;:'( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, Morrison wrote that bit, and Waid and Johns are writing chunks too, course it'll suck by the end (not just Gold). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the last issue I read sucked all over, possibly due to Mass Murderer Hal Jordan being all over it. But that creative team does have me wondering why I'm punishing myself with it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly, drop. Even if a character you like appears, it'll just be to be crapped over. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sound advice, and yet buying it enables me to hurt myself and make a cry for help, without actually having to physically scar my body. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure there must be cheaper non-physically-scarring ways,... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I'm open to suggestions. Buying 52 is a cry for help nobody hears, it seems. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Watch <i>Celebrity Love Island</i>². Even more scarring than 52, and so cheap it's free! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ² - NB; Don't. Seriously, don't. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ....those aren't even real celebrities. If they were charging you to watch it, you should ask for your money back. &gt; &gt; Love Island? What? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We hear, we just don't care. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Make the effort, yo? If you were G, he would for you. &gt; &gt; No you wouldn't. You'd just point and laugh. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No fanbase is scarier than Byrne's. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At least they're not living under the belief that Byrne is creating timeless works of Art that deserve to be studied. They're just scary comics-fanboys, and that, I can handle. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scary literature-students-turned-fanboys, not so much. There's only so many times you can repeat "it's not that we're stupid because we don't get it, it's that we just don't care" before you snap. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some truth in it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I've had all I can stand, and I can't stand no more. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although I wouldn't be convinced some Byrnebots DON'T think he's creating Art. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For both groups, there's the "name value = it's above criticism" problem to deal with. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And deal with it you won't? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I'd gladly avoid them all if I could, but they keep coming down here to G's territory. And pointing out the worthless garbage produced by said "names" is an unwinnable battle, it seems. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it would rather depend on loads of MorrisonLovers U-turning. Which isn't going to happen in any significant number. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; THEY'RE LIKE ANIMALS! I HATE THEM! &gt; &gt; Though nothing is worse than those guys who wantt o defend the work of genuinely untalented writers to the death. "No, dude, Terry Kavanagh's Spider-Man stories were AWESUM! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What of we folk who like and dislike elements of the same run, but on the balance like what Morrison does in his comics? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, you seem to be the living exception, as the guy who can stand up and say "I like some things he does, but other things I didn't." I may not get what's to like, but that is at least a viewpoint a person can communicate with. Unlike how every comics site online seems to be loaded with people who worship the man as a "genius", berate all other mainstream comics for the sin of being written by other people, and somehow regard the man as the "saviour of fun comics". &gt; &gt; I am a mass of contradictions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even the dress-up-as-Klingons-and-speak-Klingon Trekkers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about Star Trek Furries? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *I <i>hope</i> those guys are just an online myth created to scare us all, and that they're not really real* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there IS a Klingon language, I've seen an English-Klingon dictionary, believe it or not. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And people DO dress up at conventions, sometimes for better, usually for worse... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But hopefully not simultaneously as furries and in Star Trek uniforms. Please no. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your homework for this evening is to prove or disprove your theory&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't want to know. I just don't. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I brought it up&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let's nobody go look and find out, huh? &gt; &gt; Okay. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could be worse. Could be Man-Faye. Bad as Trekker and furry stuff gets, it's nothing compared to the sheer insanity of some anime/manga cosplay. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....I don't want to know about that either, do I? &gt; &gt; No, you don't. Though after your dalliance with SkeksisGirl, the sight of Man-Faye may restore your abstinent ways. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure I've heard something about how some Doom Patrol run ends up being all someone's dream or something. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that may have been the last pre-Byrne lineup, but I'm not sure. I certainly remember a fake Robotman for the first few issues until he faded out and they went to find the real one lying wrecked on a cliff. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all those years, no-one bothered to bury him? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why would they? They just rebuilt him again when they found him&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [It was an off-panel wrecking, just to make it clear] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ah. I'd interpreted that as "he'd been there for years". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that's also the series, come to think of it, that brought Metamorpho back without providing anything in the way of an explaination. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does that have anything to do with how we ended up with two Metamorphos, or is that an entirely-unrelated screw-up? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think the "two Metamorphos" was all Winick. Metamorpho made appearances in Birds of Prey and one or two other places pre-Crapuation Day, then Winick brought back a second Metamorpho as an aside in Crapuation Day regardless. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then, when he finally brought in the real Metamorpho to explain it all, managed to screw up even more by ignoring the JLA/JSA SF&amp;O story that belatedly explained how he'd come back (which made little sense, I grant you...) **AND** the fact that he'd not only been dead, but also buried. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .......my brain hurts. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pretty much as expected &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This kind of thing is why I stuck with Marvel for so long. Cable makes perfect sense in comparison to all this. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yup. Hell, Gateway being related to Bishop makes perfect sense in comparison to anything DC's done in the past three years... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But Bishop's from Vegas. And Gateway's an Aborigine. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure DC have done SOMETHING that made more sense than that within the lst 3 years. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ....... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ....... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ....... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .......dammit, I'll think of something. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not gonna happen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....I'll think of something. Eventually. &gt; &gt; They gave Paul Dini a real Batman comic at long last? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gail Simone's Birds of Prey? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predates. Not changing is different from actively making something better. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And while it probably is the best thing DC is publishing, it arguably loses points for some of those costumes, and for having Huntress sleep with that creepy guy after repeatedly saying she wouldn't. &gt; &gt; Yeah, this is true. How about Gail's Secret Six? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They'd had a series less than two years before Byrne after all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Donna Troy - Byrne. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Didn't the Titans series run at least TWO storylines rewriting her origins and telling us who she was, long, long before Byrne, though? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was the Wonder Woman post-Crisis reboot's fault. The first one was simply a "writing" - they'd screwed up by including a character who was meant to be Wonder Woman-as-a-girl the way pre-Crisis Superboy was Superman-as-a-boy in the Teen Titans originally, and went something like twenty-five issues before bothering to give her an identity of her own. The next one (post-Crisis) rewrote her origin to exclude the Wonder Woman-related stuff but, because she'd never actually been acknowledged in the <i>Wonder Woman</i> book itself, didn't actually change much with respect to her history except giving her a load of magical gadgets and a really ugly costume &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And tying her into the "titans of myth". That almost tempts me to go off on a rant about Byrne-stealing her return miniseries, in which once she recovers her memories, she loses the boots and armor parts of her costume, in exchange for a cleavage-exposing top, and high-heeled boots. Buh? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could get it if she was bring brainwashed to dress like that. But shaking off the brainwashing frees her up to do that? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .......yeah. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it's still better than the Pérez-designed monstrosity that was her original Troia costume. Go google it if you don't believe me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now can I stab my eyes out so I can't see it any more? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You saw it then?&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Thank you so much for inflicting that travesty upon me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't make you do it, I didn't even post a link&#160;;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Call it train-wreck curiosity? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You still did it&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it'd have killed this part of the thread if I didn't, no? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So instead you killed Somebody's eyes to save the thread? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, no. I killed HIS eyes&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could've at least offered me robot-eyes by now. &gt; &gt; Mojo wants ratings! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm still trying to figure out whether the preliminary design for that was worse or not. Still not good. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't see the preliminary design, and probably don't want to. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was similar, but blockier and with not so much trim... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just just a different kind of crap, then? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't find the pic now... I've seen it before, but I can think not where... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm too tired to go look now. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tired is but an excuse, X-Chicken! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tired isn't an excuse, it's my natural state. &gt; &gt; I ddn't think you <i>had</i> a natural state. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't see YOU looking. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't we just say "she had a lot of crap costumes", not look, and not say we did? &gt; &gt; Okay. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm telling you, Deathstroke and Taskmaster were the man's two stopped-clock moments. Every other costume he's ever designed was Spocking awful, especially the womens' ones. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently, being popular for being able to draw big crowds of superhumans doesn't mean you need to draw them well, or well-dressed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One tends to think writers would not draw attention to his costume-designing 'skills' with the "Hey everyone, check out my crap new costume!" scenes, but we were still getting them as recently as Justice's costume of evil. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Justice's last two appearances, IIRC, have involved his (latter) New Warriors costume and first Avengers costume - the Vance-Astro-with-a-cape-and-open-mask one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let him stick with the NW one, it's about his only good costume. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Legion-esque stripe, can live with it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it's horribly bland, got accidentally coloured as Quasar on a couple of advance-covers, and just isn't as good as the NW costume, and if a costume isn't an improvement, it shouldn't stick that long... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Um... I was TALKING about the NW costume... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh. Right. Well....uh...I stand by my statement that the man has designed no good costumes besides Deathstroke and Taskmaster, and defy anyone to prove me wrong. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about Raven, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Outside of the bird-styled-hood, it's not got that much going for or against it has it? &gt; &gt; Fair 'nuff. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phobia, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Picture, anyone? &gt; &gt; Hm...&lt;A HREF="<a href="http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/brotherhood.html#phobia" class="external free" title="http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/brotherhood.html#phobia" rel="nofollow">http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/brotherhood.html#phobia</a>" TARGET="none"&gt;here ya go.&lt;/A&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mammoth, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it's not a <i>bad</i> costume, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a <i>good</i> one either. Inoffensive is a step up from the norm, though. &gt; &gt; Eh, I liked it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the second, armored outfit for the Anti-Monitor? All solid costumes, from where I sit. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmmmm. Tough call. The original Ani-Monstor look is a bit too busy, but I think it looked better than the second Ani-Minitor costume. But my main thought about the guy was always "so there's this guy who rules an anti-matter universe and wants to destroy all positive-matter universes to expand his territory? It'd be cooler if this was an Annihilus story." &gt; &gt; DC had an antimatter universe about a decade before the Negative Zone first appeared. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And hear about Quasar?&#160;:( .... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *cries* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Bangs fist on desk in grief* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Poor Wendell. No room for nice guys in the cosmos. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know&#160;:( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The shame of it is how damn obvious it was that the poor guy was guest-starring just to die, too. Nova dying in his own book would at least have been more of a surprise. &gt; &gt; A pleasant surprise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Should've been Nova, I tell you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He really is sort of generic, isn't he? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only in the sense that he's Peter Parker meets Hal Jordan...but Kyle Rayner did it better... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No good character can be described as "[anything/anyone] meets Hal Jordan". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he's a Peter Parker-style character (without the brains), with Hal Jordan's origin. I only ever really cared when he's "early-'90s-grunge-slacker-Nova", and the day of "grunge slacker" characters has long since come and gone. &gt; &gt; I was also thinking in terms of his powers, because there just aren't <i>enough</i> super-strong guys who fly in comics. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although the Vance Astro-esque one isn't bad, it's just the Avengers v3 #25 one... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...which warranted a "check out my crap new costume" scene, no less. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wait, forgot the I♥M one-shot where he split with Firestar. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know, for characters in limbo, editorial should declare "This is their costume, use it", to be used in all appearances until someone actually brings them into a cast &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I totally agree. Outside of Justice (who is probably a justifiable exception to such a rule), I've not noticed this a lot, from Dr Strange's 1997 guest-shot in Sensational Spidey as the first time I saw it and registered it, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, to be fair, he NEEDED a reset at that point, after the fustercluck of powers and costumes the DS:SS entailed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps he did, yet it shouldn't have been done in an otherwise inconsequential guest-shot. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was still more than just a costume. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And it DID stick... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, these costume resets in throwaway guest-shots tend to stick, don't they? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm just saying, what was a major development in status-quo-resetting for Strange shouldn't have happened in a guest-spot in a Spidey book. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps not, but I suspect the alternative was for no one to use him again until the next writer wanted to do soemthing even screwier with him than had already been done. After all, that's what seems to be happening now with JMS's Strange obsession. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Truth. I didn't mind the trenchcoat, but it was inevitable that the old red cape would return; considering that Strange went almost 30 years in his 2nd outfit, there's no way ANYONE will bury that costume now, no matter how worthy the replacement might be. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, the white blouse (!) with Bling (!) necklace-thing and red trenchcoat wasn't THAT bad. But it certainly wasn't an improvement. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone could tell me WTH artists (like Erik Larsen and the guy about to draw BKV's Dr Strange series) occasionally revert to the facial model that Ditko dumped by the time of his fourth story (his origin), I'd be much obliged. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The creator's original vision was the right one. So sayeth Byrne! &gt; &gt; *makes you read Chapter One for your sins* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What's ridiculous is when Iron Man goes back to an old design...he's the only character in the MU who should never go back to an old outfit. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, you could argue that it's old only cosmetically. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unless your name is Joe Quesada. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could've tolerated that as a VERY BRIEF deal with the "Tony's new armor just came to life, tried to kill him, then died, and he doesn't have a spare suit around, and hasn't had time to build one yet", but that he went for such an old model, and kept it for around a year, wasn't really excusable. &gt; &gt; And the worst part was, Quesdaa's whole reason was exactly the sort of fanboyish nostalgia he otherwise mocks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really think Strange works better as a guest than as a main character, actually. When he's in a starring role in an ongoing, writers are inclined to depower him and make him not-Sorceror Supreme... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just like Silver Surfer, Namor and Nick Fury, who also have trouble holding down their own books these days? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But when he's a guest-star, too many writers tend to feed him to their own magical villain or Claremontian Super-Sorceress to make them look more formidable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There IS that (I couldn't believe what Claremont tried in the Nightcrawler's birthday issue on that score...) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although Roger Stern fired back by exposing Margali as a faker in the pages of Dr. Strange. Not that Claremont paid attention when he wrote Margali later on. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course not... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So which part of "Sorceror Supreme" isn't he getting? &gt; &gt; The part where he's not a vaguely bisexual dominatrix? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't the last time he did something like that, either (also using the boringness-that-walks that is Selene?) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He also punked Strange out to Marie LeVeau way back in some 70s issues of Marvel Team-Up. And I feel certain that Claremont also punked Strange out to one of his British Isles fantasy characters as well, even though I can't remember an exact instance right now... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Claremont even wrote Dr. Strange for awhile, where Strange was punked to the Shadowqueen. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't want to know. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I second that. &gt; &gt; I third that, and I already know. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then there's his occasional grotesque misuse of Doctor Doom to consider.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once every 15 years isn't that bad. Walter Simonson made a good case for Englehart as having done the most damage to Doom with his Kristoff stories. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah. And the Heroes Reborn Event and Reed-in-Doom's armour wasn't THAT bad. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, although I could've done without the Claremont-stock-super-women he surrounded Doom with, that storyline was the high-point of his FF run by far. &gt; &gt; True dat. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the Heroes Return Avengers, Captain America and Thor relaunches putting a truckload of heroes in older costumes for the sake of brief guest-shots or background appearances. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There IS that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. Thanks to that, we have Hercules back in a skirt, talking bad Thorspeak and being a pathetic drunk, and US Agent going past "regression" into a parody of a one-dimensional jerk. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But it should extent to all manner of status quo, not just costume. A throwaway guest-shot shouldn't really have any effect on the character in question. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yep. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And certainly no sex with otherwise throwaway guest-stars, eh Juggernaut and She-Hulk? Funny as it was to see the fan reaction. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't we just say "Not unless it's She-Hulk," so they explode again &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If there has to be an exception to the rule, that really should be it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about the Felicia Hardy exception? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She-Hulk exception is foremost &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There even IS a Black Cat exception? What heroes has she had casual guest-star-sex with? &gt; &gt; Well, she definitely got around int he Spider-books, managing to hit it with Spider-Man, the Foreigner, Flash Thompson, and apparently more as of her miniseries. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (it DID screw over another character, however, because they rebooted her mother in the process to exclude her. No-one cared enough about Lilith for it to make a difference though.). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No-one even seemed to care when she died, either... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, the DC boards got ugly about it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, nobody in-comic ever seemed to care much at all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Considering that Crapuation Day is quite probably the worst comic story I have ever read, bar none, that's hardly a surprise. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously, all the stuff people say is bad about 90s comics. In there, plus a whole load more Bad. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not having any particular attachment to either of the dead, to me it was just...there, a dud of an "event" comic with some glaringly noticeable errors. But I never found it as flat-out bad or offensive as the comics that push my rage-buttons are. Probably helps that there aren't any nutjobs out there holding up Graduation Day as being any good. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It got everything wrong though - the YJ lineup (and leadership), the Titans lineup (including Lilith, who wasn't on the team and was in an old costume to boot), everyone was out of character, the deaths were stupid, they felt the need to give Robin and Nightwing stupid one-off costumes for the latter half,... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't even remember the costume changes. I do remember the YJ lineup was wrong, but never read Titans to know they were wrong too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cyborg and Lilith (who was called "Omen", which she hadn't used for years) were there and shouldn't have been. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There might be others, but I dumped my copies into the waste paper receptical for recycling into toilet paper. Or whatever. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Man, this thing seriously offended you. And it didn't really *affect* the YJ characters much aside from disbanding them after they were cancelled, so, big Titans fan? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, you never answered! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So?&#160;:-p &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seriously, I'd been loosely following the Titans, but it was a book less than the sum of its' parts. Craputation Day was just Bad-On-Every-Level. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I figured you'd have been a seriously hardcore fan to be hating that book as much as you do. &gt; &gt; Yeah...I can barely name the members of the current Outsiders or Titans. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And it **was** a stupendiously idiotic death, the precognitive telepath not noticing the Evil Robot Superman was a robot, and was going to kill her.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, what was the point, exactly? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well... umm.... you see... ah... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, no idea. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See, it's a completely pointless death, in that nobody even reacted to it much at all, mourned her or anything. Gratuitous body-count than in no way affected the story. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And she's still dead, too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unlike all those GLs that were killed by various things and have reappeared without explaination... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, like those ones Mass-Murdering-Psycho-Hal-Jordan left to die in space, who were actually held as POWs by aliens for years? Somehow involving the Cyborg, apparently? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *cries* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the one Major Force killed in Guy's series. The one involving force-aging and the Mass Murdering Psycho's child-abuse... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, if Mass Murdering Psycho Hal Jordan has to be alive, well, and all his crimes whitewashed, he damn well should be a practising child-molestor, and have regular cross-company team-ups with Colossus. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though Jordan never had a threesome with some random women he met in a jungle. Prior to the Engelhart thing and Mark Waid's "womanizing Hal" retcons that Johns is running with, Hal was a serial monogamist who dated people his own damn age. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So now he's a serial pologamist who likes to brainwash little girls into "liking" him. And blames Yellow Fear Demons for stuff that was his own damn fault. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And he never did anything for the black people, either. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *wonders if that Green Arrow/Lantern series is worth reading* &gt; &gt; Not really. It's pretty dated, and frankly everyone in it seems sort of like a whiny asshole by 21st century standards. &gt; &gt; &gt; But at least we've established that he and Stupit Pitor are The Scum. Isn't it time we all supported some kind of, say, superhero registration system, so we could have heroes who are worthy of our support? &gt; &gt; Hal was actually cool once upon a time, when he was a monogamous test pilot space cowboy, but he gradually became a middle-aged whiner, in no small part thanks to Denny O'Neil, and that was the end of that. By the time of EmTwi, it was way too late to try and recool him. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Granted, it lead to a load of stuff involving uber-power, depowerment and her becoming a Darkstar (low-rent Green Lanterns); but none of that was retcons. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, but it all adds up to enough, that when you factor in the Byrne-stuff below, I stand by my belief that she was Hawkman-ed enough to consider 'Graduation Day' a mercy-killing that probably deserved to stand. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Depends. The series the uber/depowering happened in was crap enough that they didn't just kill the characters off, they **retconned them out**. And had mostly been forgotten by the point Byrne came along. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then came Byrne. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then came Byrne. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Says it all, doesn't it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As always. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a yearning to read that Wikipedia entry on Byrne again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The one Byrne took offence to, I take it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the one which talks about what he's best known for. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being an argumentative, hypocritical, trigger-happy sod? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *reads some of that stuff himself, and chuckles...* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's the calling-attention-to-his-racist-statements that was funniest. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, the funniest part of it is that he made on of those statements as part of an argument about speech balloons vs. speech bubbles. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can't beat that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, and it's now what he's best known for. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And...the Internets are calling him "Old Balls" now? &gt; &gt; I can't *know* that!!!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then Byrne had her yanked out of Green Lantern, where she was a major supporting character at the time, and retroactively turned her into a Wonder Woman clone. In the Ben Reilly sense of the word. And revealed that she'd been reincarnated a thousand times or so. Then mindwiped her. Then had her get memories based on Flash's memories of her, meaning no-one knew what she remembered and what she didn't, and gave her Carol Danvers-memory-syndrome. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .........dear Zod. I mean, I know it's Byrne, but still, what was any of this supposed to achieve? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, in Byrne's head, it probably seemed like a good idea at the time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, in some other cases, I can see how he _thinks_ he's restoring them to the original concept. But unless he's going with the original concept that the character was never supposed to exist? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I think it was some demented attempt to homage that original error, by making her Wonder Woman as a Girl - or at least WWaaG's clone. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, "Demented attempt to homage an error". Probably made some kind of sense to him at the time. After all, this is the man who took the Vision "back to basics" by removing his personality and ability to feel. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Betchu that if you went onto the Board Of Evil, he'd still maintain he was right to do it... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And his underlings would support it. I've read that board before and seen the freaks referring to the character as "a toaster". The tragedy is that he succeeded in poisoning the minds of an entire generation of Avengers readers who accepted his line of thinking. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The weird thing is, way back in Englehart's original Avengers run, Vision is attacked by an anti-mechanical-life terrorist group, yet this <i>fictional prejudice</i> ended up becoming a reality amongst a vocal group of the book's readership. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Even an android can die..." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I really don't get it, though. If you don't want to accept the Vision's aliveness, individuality and humanity, so much that it bothers you like that, why would you bother to read a book with him in? Crazy fools. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why, it could be like reading an issue of 52 focused on Hal Jordan. Or Dr Light. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, don't compare me to those fools! I have perfectly legitimate reasons for disliking characters. Particularly those two. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you're still buying 52, you bought the Mass Murdering Psycho Hal Jordan issue. And having a legitimate reason to dislike a character is MORE reason to avoid them, no? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I'd likely have to not buy any DC books at all to completely avoid the git, wouldn't I? If I wanted to see what's going on with Ralph, Steel and Booster, I had to suffer through the Hal-fighting-Chinese-stereotypes and buy the issue. &gt; &gt; *points and laughs* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But...there's a whole Dr Light issue now? ......dear Zod, why? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because people inexplicably bought many copies of DC's recent Crises. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Emphasis on "inexplicably." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what, somehow DC got the impression that Dr butt-rape = ratings, rather than "heavily promoted events with 'Crisis' in the title = ratings"? &gt; &gt; Well, they saw the sales figures for Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do Three Years Past Deadline. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notwithstanding that none of the stories with Donna actually mentioned Wonder Woman until her origin - which, of course, made it clear that she wasn't, and got her a costume devoid of WW symbols. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not that any of this would register to Byrne-logic as anything other than the character "going wrong". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd say he should just stick to drawing, but then I remember how DC were having other artists "fix" his faces. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not just his faces. And he should have been thanking them. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know I am. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You read it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was reading the Action Comics run he drew, yes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then you remember Byrne's curious renderings of eight-year-old Jimmy Olsen...and the much worse way he chose to depict the Schumann character, which went oddly unremarked among comics fans... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Huh? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The old Jewish guy who was working alongside Jimmy, and seems to be the only new supporting-cast-member sticking around post-Crisis. (not that there were many others besides that cop from Rucka's <i>Adventures of Superman</i>, and Trashy OMAC Intern from <i>Superman</i> &gt; &gt; That's the one. God, was Byrne's version as stereotypical-looking as all get out. "AN old Jewish guy? I'll be sure to give him a giant nose and have him wear a yarmulke 24/7." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then, after another Titans arc (<i>The Titans</i> #23-25) sorting all that mess out and putting it all to bed as best they could, repowering her to her original powers and fixing her memory problems in the process, they killed her in Craputation Day. And then, in the bring-her-back mini, revealed a load of pre-Crisis multiverse-related crap just to complicate things more. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For her major role in the Crisis, that necessitated the Colu wanting her dead so they'd rule the galaxy post-IC? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; None of which actually happened, since she did nothing in Crisis, and nor did Braniac and his homeys. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **didn't read it, and hearing about the Multiverse stuff made his head hurt enough that he didn't want to even Byrne it** &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I envy you for that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do so&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, I do. I'll always have "Get Kraven", remember. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of which, Al Kraven's just reappeared in Beyond! Albeit a bit closer to how he was before. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If only they'd just called it "Secret Wars 3". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *holds out hope for the Beyonder being restored to the original concept, before all the Cosmic Cube/gender-change crap was piled onto him* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They referenced the Cube-thing in #1. Although, how the hell this fits with her being mortalised in Thanos and killed in Annihilation: Silver Surfer is a your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, my *hope* would be that the death of that body released the old-school Beyonder back to his original self. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Taking him back to basics means we could have a moment where Spidey has to remind him how to dump, too. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *sees the new Beyond cover and is crippled by fear* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What, the Miek-Spidey one? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now we both know that's not who it is. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Admit it though, there is a resemblance&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now that I think about it... &gt; &gt; Miek is a Space Phantom now? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While there's the potential for some repair-work to be done, and undo some stupid retcons AND restore the guy's viability as a villain by re-establishing him as the only member of his race with any powers, I doubt anyone's going that way anytime soon. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever your opinion of the retcons, do we really need him back as a recurring villain? Even if Av. For. was totally undone, he's still a rather crap villain., the sort of cheesy alien you'd expect to find in issues of Action Comics from 1953. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Got a point. If he'd appeared in Avengers #22 rather than Avengers #2, he'd be loooonnng forgotten about... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, look at it less as "he's a good villain we need repaired", and more as "the principle of it". As much of a lame Silver Age villain as he was, there was SOME decent material to come from him as the unwilling-servant of Immortus, trying to escape Limbo. Making him just one of many, whose every thought and action is the result of what he's been brainwashed to think, utterly invalidates his every appearance. &gt; &gt; Except that in the original story, he's clearly a generic alien invader, saying that he wants to conquer Earth for his race and coming in disguised as a meteorite. The Immortus thing was tacked on about 20 years later, and even in that story it's hinted that the whole thing is some kind of ruse so Immortus can keep Thor from time-traveling. &gt; &gt; &gt; And that's without even getting into having thousands of the things with the same power opens the gates for anti-talents to use them as a means to undo any story they don't like or are just TOO DAMN FREAKING LAZY TO DEAL WITH. &gt; &gt; This is true. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, all that really matters is that we've got the Michael Collins Deathlok back. Best of all Deathloks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isn't that being rather reversionary? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, that would be supporting original-70s-Deathlok, wouldn't it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm just happy I'm not the only guy who likes the Robocop-influenced Deathlok best. &gt; &gt; Me love it too! Love it!!!!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Power Girl's main problem was that some writers (*cough*Johns*cough*) couldn't get over her Not Being Kryptonian. Other than that, all they needed was a clear statement that, yes, she had been in the JSA before (which some early post-Crisis stuff had been confused about. That was BEFORE she joined the JLI though.), and never to mention her son again. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See, this is why, if DC was going to do Crisis, they should've relaunched all their books from Day One, severing ties with all past history. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wasn't there something about her being Atlantean, though? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, when she was revealed not to be Kryptonian, they did a <i>Secret Origins</i> issue revealing her to have been sent from the past, from pre-sinking Atlantis, and tying her into a minor swords'n'sorcery character, and led to a mini or two centred around that (which pissed off Byrne, since he'd reportedly wanted to do something involving her being found mindwiped and naked in the Arctic Circle in Superman. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....the dirty old git. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice the mindwiping theme too... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Is it true he also had Superman brainwashed into doing a porn movie? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.comicboards.com/xmb/attachments/060706004659/ActionComics592.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.comicboards.com/xmb/attachments/060706004659/ActionComics592.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicboards.com/xmb/attachments/060706004659/ActionComics592.jpg</a> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.comicboards.com/xmb/attachments/060706004659/ActionComics593.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.comicboards.com/xmb/attachments/060706004659/ActionComics593.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicboards.com/xmb/attachments/060706004659/ActionComics593.jpg</a> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .........whywhywhywhywhy would he do this? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isn't he the man who gets a-raging whenever someone does a "disrespectful" portrayal of superheroes? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh yes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why, that hypocrite! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You only figure that out now? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, there are degrees of hypocrisy. Byrne attacking others for things he's done himself is to be expected. But Porn Superman? That's hitting all new lows. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It IS Byrne we're talking about. Hitting new lows is what he does... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Admit it, you can't wait to see the next low he hits. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So many of his quotes sound like retooled Cartman dialogue. And they're even funnier if you imagine that's what Byrne would sound like saying them aloud. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Works for me. Except that one is funny-offensive, and the other is just offensive. And anti-semitism is probably about the only type of offensiveness Byrne hasn't tried yet. &gt; &gt; Unless you ask me... &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd pay to see him (or any comics pro, for that matter) use "I kick you in the nuts!" as their entire argument, if I hadn't started doing it myself. &gt; &gt; I'm 100% sure Garth Ennis uses it all the time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would eventually turn into the MatrixSupergirl-origin story) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For which we're probably better off. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, Lex Luthor's better off for it, at least. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I'm sure he found a shapeshifting girlfriend fun. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, Lex can be strange like that. You can sum up his last miniseries as "Lex Luthor builds an android-woman so he can have sex with it, then Superman destroys it." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I never finished that. Is that true? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, all of those events did occur during the miniseries, although that would be an example of an online summary worded to make it all sound stupider than it was. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ah. D'Oh! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more reliable summary would mention how Lex created the android to be Metropolis' new heroine, but manipulated a battle between her and Superman, which forced Superman to destroy her, making him look bad in the eyes of the people. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But yeah, he still got naked and sweaty with the android he made. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does that mini even fit into what passes for DC continuity? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I......have.....no idea at all. I believe it was initially supposed to, as part of the planned Superman spin-off books that mostly didn't see print, back in 2004. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What ones didn't see print? I remember it being announced about the same time as the Azz/Lee Superman run, but seeing print somewhat later. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recall some Question project being talked about, but never happening. &gt; &gt; Yeah, it was supposed to be set up by the miniseries and be written by Veitch or something. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, of course, Luthor was long-President by that point. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By that point, he was hiding underground and not-forming-the-Society, even. &gt; &gt; Yep, and having the brain problems &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brian Azzarello is DC's answer to Daniel Way, or at least his stories come out exactly like Way's. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eh, at least Way has that "Poor Man's Ennis" thing going for him on those Nighthawk and Bullseye comics. Mr Azz managed to make a "Jim Lee draws Superman fighting General Zod" story not-good. How DO you mess that up? &gt; &gt; I..don't know. It's his super-power? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hawkman was genuinely broken, partially through history (they declared in the early 90s that the post-Crisis origin miniseries for Hawkman was set in the present day [so they could do a sequel ongoing]. Which wasn't the original intent, and since that Hawkman had been around since the Silver Age and been used up to and including the JLI, led to a lot of gaps being plugged with the Golden Age Hawkman and a new fill-in Hawkman), but mostly because some idiot thought it was a good idea to merge all the Hawkmen and women ever (Except Hawkwoman (the one adapted for JLU)) into one, which led to the character being literally dumped into Limbo at the end of his series and avoided like the plague. They eventually brought the Golden Age Hawkman, who was slightly less screwed-up, back instead. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...........words....failing me. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's the effect it has on most people. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How exactly did they work all of this out? I did enjoy what I've seen of modern-Hawkman, so it's good that they did fix him, somehow. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, they said the alien guy that had been merged with everyone had died off-panel, he'd only REALLY merged with the Golden Age guy, and pulled the now-deaged-demerged-and-dark-haired GA guy out a magic pool. The last part is entirely literal. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do I really want to read this, or just say to myself "so, Hawkman's back, and he's not a mess. Just go with it."? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It wasn't <b>that</b> bad - the guy who later wrote <i>Batman Begins</i> was the lead writer at the time, Johns was only his junior partner. I think that and the ending were Johns' contributions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't feel in any hurry to read it though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I _may_ have some of the issues in a pile of JSA issues I got from a bargain-bin, and have been in no hurry to read indeed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And now Hawkman is MIA anyway. Bah. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, OYL and all that... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's no excuse! Why bother bringing Hawkman back just to lose him in space. At least lose him down the back of the sofa, where he'll be sure to turn up eventually. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, he'll turn up. A few fakes later. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And another continuity-headache later? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's DC. They're what they do. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How does all this not end up hurting them more? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because they own Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman and frankly, I'd say that even after two X-Men movies Spider-Man and the Hulk are the only Marvel characters with the sort of instant brand recognition of those three names across both generations and national borders. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But we're not talking about the general public. We're talking about that subsection thereof which follow DCU "continuity" and stories set therein. Which, tops, numbers around 300-400k if we count all those who buy at least one DCU book on a regular basis. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, you'd think the sheer level of confusing-ness would alienate more comics-readers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still remain baffled by the thought-process behind original-Crisis only rebooting some books, not the whole line. &gt; &gt; Originally, it wasn't supposed to be much of a reboot at all, but then individual editors wanted to use it as an excuse, and DC figured they could relaunch Batman and Superman with much hype, and it sort of snowballed. If you read Crisis #12, it's clear that everyone's supposed to be roughly the same and that all the heroes remember the multiverse.</p>
<p>Other way round - it was originally meant to be a Total Reboot, ending with the Fade To White of Crisis #10 (with #11 and #12 being what became <i>History of the DCU</i>), with #1s of EVERYTHING the next month (Superman #1, Action Comics #1, Batman #1, Detective Comics #1, Wonder Woman #1, Flash #1, the lot). Then they wussed out, mostly because they had a couple of titles still doing really well.</p>
<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind of wish I'd picked up his figure back at the convention. Or the Batman/Bane/Killer Crock ones, which I've never seen anywhere since. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I'd rather no explaination than that, TBH. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I <i>read</i> the Titans/Legion one-shot that had the latest reboot in it, and <i>I have no Spocking clue what the H*ll was going on with that, or even WHY the timeline rebooted itself</i>. I'll live with "Superboy-Prime did it" over "well...uh...the timeline just rebooted itself because...uh...it's the Legion. It happens." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To quote Hellboy, "I like not knowing. I sleep good not knowing." &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't had a good night's sleep in over a year (which is probably why I'm so pitifully lethargic). Knowing or not-knowing isn't going to help me there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if a comic features a sudden timeline-reboot as part of it's plot, yes, I'd like some kind of reason why. Even if it ends up being a really, really stupid one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Time Trapper playing a game usually works for the Legion. As far as I've not been able to avoid overhearing, they were suddenly grabbed out of the timestream, which would fit. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was a dangling probable-Time Trapper plot hanging around anyway. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, that WOULD have beat "Superboy-Prime punched reality until it broke". But most things would have. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, ANYthing would have. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even yellow fear demons? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't even have to hesitate about that one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ........I wouldn't have gone quite that far myself. I'd at least be torn between the stupitude of the two. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yellow Fear Demons as explaination are Absolutely Stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Punched Reality" is INFINITELY Stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All about levels, and the latter is overwhelmingly imbecilic. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I the only one who finds the Yellow Fear Demon more intelligence insulting just because it's explaining away something that never needed to be explained away? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the Punches didn't? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [BTW - your answer is "no"] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the punches explain away some apparently unexplained timeline alterations and character-transformations. Albeit in a really stupid way. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The yellow-fear-demon serves no "explanation required" purpose, it's just there to whitewash Jordan's guilt for being a mass-murdering psycho. That offends me more than the stupid explanation for DC's latest stupid timeline-rewrite. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, stupid as it is, it doesn't involve PUNCHING REALITY WITH A FIST. Therefore, it is marginally less stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, if you think about it, regardless of the method, any kind of reality-altering power is just stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The yellow-fear-demon stupidity wasn't reality-altering though, but a "EVERTYHINK YOU NOW WAZ WRONG!!!" story. So you agree with me&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that it was stupid, but the GL thing offends and bothers me more. &gt; &gt; Let's just say it was all stupid. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd argue that the power isn't inherently stupid, but the uses to which such powers are put in comics invariably are. After all, reality-alteration as a power seems to work just fine in religious texts. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Hides from the angry theists* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The last religious-text I tried to read was The Book of Mormon, because my hotel room had a copy, and I was bored. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I gave up, and remembered I had <i>X-Men: Deadly Genesis</i> to read. The X-Men are more new-reader friendly. &gt; &gt; But now you'll never understand how Jesus saved the Native Americans! &gt; &gt; &gt; But as far as comics characters go, the harder it is to clearly define or explain a character's powers, the less of a good idea they are. &gt; &gt; True. The best powers are simple enough to be explained in a simple sentence or two, but versatile enough to have infinite applications. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, Waid and Johns' DC-Silver-Age fanboyism doesn't make any sense, so why should any stories they write? I avoided that badly named "Special" like the plague. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I...uh...was reading Titans at the time because...uh...because Robin was in it, and I hadn't yet given up on the Batman books. And that "Special" was the final part of a Titans time-travel storyline. Unfortunately, it was "Special" in the same way that Beak and his classmates were. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I expected. (Remember Kid, Flash! Whoops, I put the comma in the wrong place *rhe*) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That name is a form of child abuse, I tell you. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And now he's Man-Flash, and then he's not, and tin-hat-guy (whose name I'm blanking on, and I know I'll remember it like five minutes after I get offline), &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jay Garrick&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Five minutes after, I tell you! I often forget his name, and original Green Lantern's. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alan Scott&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *remembers reading a <i>Starman</i> issue where they misspelled his name as "Allen Scott" for the whole issue. And I read it in TPB, meaning they must have had it pointed out to them and they STILL didn't bother fixing it.* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could be worse, he could lose an eye. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....wait. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not reabsorbing the Starheart properly, I tell you. If he had, rather than making it into a ring superficially resembling his original, he could just have wished his eye back... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And he could've kept the "Sentinel" name, which is far cooler than "Green Lantern" is. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No argument. I moaned about that at the time. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can't get a codename much cooler than "Sentinel", can you? Why, people should be calling their kids "Sentinel"... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for spelling names wrong, try being a Carnage fan. The sheer number of ways people have managed to spell "Cletus Kasady" wrong is staggering. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You wouldn't think it would be so hard to spell, would you? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really - it's probably the Kasady-with-a-K-and-one-s that throws people off, remembering that it's not "Cassady", but not quite how. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn't excuse the "Kletus", does it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They were channelling Stan Lee with the alliterating names? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps. Well done for catching it, editors. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Editors <i>edit</i>?! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it is the name of the job. Am I just expecting too much? &gt; &gt; Apparently so. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just can't believe no one's ever done a "Slack-Jawed Yokel" joke with him yet. Or did it happen, and I missed it? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Never happened so far as I know. Don't think he's ever been written by anyone who would be dropping Simpsons-references. &gt; &gt; Why hasn't this happened yet, dammit? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the new-old Flash. But at least, if nothing else, Crisis rid us of the Speed Force. Never liked that idea. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</p>

<p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not ridded. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spock it all.&#160;:( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And everything I've read about it, including the preview but not the issue itself, suggests that: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) It's crap &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) They appear to have fusterclucked Bart's entire history, removing Max Mercury and the speed-aging-in-computer-games &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) It's crap &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) Bart's not talked to the ex-YJ kids in a whole year &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5) It's crap &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6) Bart gets drunk &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7) It's crap &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8) It has the worst supporting characters on record (can't verify this, but thar's what a lot of people are saying) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9) It's crap. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So it's crap, then? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I'm not sure I've ever seen Bart voice an opinion one way or the other on alcohol, so is him getting drunk a problem? Not talking to his friends in a year? Lame, but allows him to meet them again on-panel rather than have it lost in the missing year, I suppose. And the new age-gap must be weird for him. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still, it's Bart In Name Only, it seems, with as much resemblance to Impulse as something that almost, but not quite, resembles Impulse in no way whatsoever. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hardly a new criticism, though. That's a problem that's been ongoing since he became 'Kid Flash'. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, but it's just getting farther and farther... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; May as well give up on the poor guy, he's beyond repair now.&#160;:( &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sad, but true. Same reason I ended up giving up Robin, whose life has become one big depressing ball of suck, with all his friends and family dying around him. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And now Batman's trying to adopt him. Run, Tim, RUN!!! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, didn't Bruce try that with Jason once? And look how that turned out. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe it involved a fart in reality's direction resulting in a clinically-stupid resurrection. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I still can't BELIEVE they went there for their excuse as to why he's alive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On some level, the idea of taking a hero that readers <i>voted and paid to have killed</i> and bringing him back as a villain is brilliant. But that's their excuse? That's all you've got, DC? &gt; &gt; And then giving him and Nightwing to Bruce Jones....why????? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I defy anyone to worse than the Byrne-Spidey era TriCorp supporting cast, who were so lame they were hardly used at all, ever, and quietly forgotten about. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "How'd your daterape go last night" is apparently his opening line. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ........stop mentioning rape in comics, you DC cracktards! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Convinced yet? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I...actually read this thing now, and yes, it was crap, but thankfully that line did not appear in #1 anywhere at all. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *shrugs* I was misled. Not as if I wanted to read it in the first place... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, you really don't. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought as much... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So...how did the previous Flash die, anyways? If he is dead? For all I know, he could just be on safari on the Moon. &gt; &gt; It's complicated....apparently he, Bart, and a bunch of others all got sucked into Mark Waid's hind...I mean, the Speed Force, and only Bart eventually came back. Or something. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't get why they've gone with the writers they have -- it's not like the Flash TV series was some sort of masterpiece, is it? I mean, isn't it fondly remembered mostly because no one else was doing a straightforwardly superheroic live-action series at the time? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .......no idea. Never saw the series. (Was it even shown here?) &gt; &gt; Where's "here?" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No mention of the other YJ kids at all, and the two supporting cast members were....there. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But...why do DC go to the trouble of getting rid of the Speed Force concept, only to bring it right back as if anyone wanted it in the first place? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *shrugs* &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly. Make the bad speed go away. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently, it's eevvillll now though. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it is named after a drug, and does empower heroes whose codename suggests they like to expose themselves. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Especially the Kids Flash... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kid Flash? Was that an order or a request? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still better than the Whizzer and his yellow costume.... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If only that was intentional. &gt; &gt; How could it *not* be? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The trouble with all the Silver-Age-DC fanboyism that the writers inflict upon us all is that it's not the Silver Age DC that readers want to see. Give us the insane covers, insane-er plotlines, the panels that look dubious when taken out-of-context, the how-could-they-not-know-what-they-were-writing homoeroticism, the heroes and their supporting cast acting like jerks and/or retarded children, and all the other stuff that people post online for laughs. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Give me an out-of-regular-DC-continuity book with jerk-Superman who forces Jimmy Olsen to marry a gorilla, ambiguously-gay Batman, Bizarro World and all the rest. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hear Hear! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would buy such a book, read it, and love it like a retarded child that just didn't know any better. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know you all would. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So YOU say&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Believe me when I tell you there is no hardcore comics fan who has internet access who doesn't love to laugh at Silver Age DC madness. Not a one. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember <a href="http://www.superdickery.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.superdickery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superdickery.com/</a>&#160;? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's precisely what I was thinking of. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suspected as much, but had to check&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's what classic comics are made of. Marvel's Silver-Age SuperMysogeny just can't compete with Superman being a jerk, or Batman and the Joker comparing boners ("it's not that they said it, it's that they keep saying it"). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And here I thought classic comics were made of woodpulp&#160;;) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [I'm tired, all right...] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No amount of tiredness is an excuse for that. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, sure, like YOU'VE never made a stupid pun when tired&#160;:) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, my puns are always masterworks of super-genius. Even Hawkeye would've avoided that one. &gt; &gt; And yet he still would have died, somehow. He's like the Kenny of the Marvel Universe! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "I couldn't sit down all night, after what that robot did to me!" -- Lois Lane, some random Superman panel from the 60s &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And now whenever I hear "Great Caesar's Ghost!" I'll think of Superman using his x-ray vision to animate pictures and statues to teach Perry a valuable lesson. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See it, and be downright scared: <a href="http://www.superdickery.com/seduction/58.html" class="external free" title="http://www.superdickery.com/seduction/58.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superdickery.com/seduction/58.html</a> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They'll never beat this one: <a href="http://www.superdickery.com/seduction/3.html" class="external free" title="http://www.superdickery.com/seduction/3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superdickery.com/seduction/3.html</a> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I want to see Boner from Growing Pains play Joker. &gt; &gt; A show called *Growing Pains* had a character named *Boner* on it? How'd that get by the censors?</p>
