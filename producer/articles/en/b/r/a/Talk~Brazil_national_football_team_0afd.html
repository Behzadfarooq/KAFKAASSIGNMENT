<p>A SeleÃ§Ã£o (The Selected is the official nickname... Other nicknames is also used, bu the official is that...</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, first of all, "SeleÃ§Ã£o" happens to be short for the official name of the team, but that does not make it an "official nickname" (if that's even possible, by the way -- nicknames are chosen by the fans, not by an executive decision). And yes, in Brazil if you happen to talk about "the SeleÃ§Ã£o" without further specification, it is understood that you are talking about the national football team (although the term is also used for other team sports, such as volleyball, basketball and such). But this does not a nickname make, the term is not particularly affectionate; it's just descriptive, like calling the Uruguayan team the "National Team" instead of "La Celeste OlÃ­mpica." Sportcasters have nicknamed the team the "SeleÃ§Ã£o Canarinho" a long time ago, and the name, although not the primary way to refer to the team, kinda stuck.MCBastos 22:59, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i don't think Brazil national football team is the best one in the world through it really has a large number of talented footballers.On the one hand,they lack unity.On the other hand,they are lacking of passion</p>

<dd>That's an opinion, and this is an encyclopedia. On the other hand, the article doens't state "best" but "most successful", which happens to be true and can be ascertained by just looking to the statistics. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiceMan_169e.html" title="User:SpiceMan">SpiceMan</a> 22:55, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And "best" also fits because it has been ranked number 1 by the FIFA Ranking since its beggining, except for a couple of brief months when France defeated Brazil in the 1998 Cup, and even then remained in 2nd place. Brazil has been number one for almost 15 years now.<a href="../../../l/t/d/User%7ELtDoc_16d4.html" title="User:LtDoc">LtDoc</a> 21:07, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the past Three and a half years, Brasil has been and will remain, THE BEST IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p>That's what they fought for during all of the qualifying rounds and throughout the entire World Cup itself.</p>
<p>As for the team not having any unity...That's just an opinion you have. I beg to differ. I don't think there are many teams on the planet that are more united than that of the Brasilian National Team.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are some teams in the world that have fewer problems then that of Brasil but, that comes with winning The World Cup!</p>
<p>Brasil has the most talent on one team that anyone could ask for. Sure that can present problems but, the bottom line is this... Brasil is THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD until another country takes that title away.</p>
<p>And even if that happens...There will never be a more talented team to grace the pitch than that of a team from BRASIL!</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for the team being the best in the world, that's just an opinion you have, I beg to differ.</dd>
<dd>Now, aside from parodying your bias, the word "best" is not of encyclopedic value because of it's subjectiveness. You might say it is ranked as the best, or that it has the best record so far, anything else is a judgement call. Who knows, maybe Honduras has been the best all along and was just unlucky for so many years. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 19:17, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'SeleÃ§Ã£o' means selection. So in this context, I think it means 'selected' in the sense of premier players, i.e. of special quality or value. At least in English, selection has the meaning of being the best of the best; the selected.</p>
<p>Yes, I can see why you reach this conclusion, however, since the term "SeleÃ§Ã£o" can be applied to any football team / squad in the other (specially the nationals), I think the translation to squad or team is more correct, because I believe it's saying that it's The (best) squad. Although, to be honest, I'd never even heard of the nickname "A SeleÃ§Ã£o" before reading it here in wikipedia, so maybe we should remove the reference completely (on the other hand, "Canarinho" is very famous and well known nickname).--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo200_7ba1.html" title="User:Vertigo200">Vertigo200</a> 01:31, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>SeleÃ§Ã£o is not a nickname is the name. Don't know other <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_languages.html" title="Romance languages">romance languages</a>, but in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> the word used is "selection" (of players to represent the country in a given sport): pt "SeleÃ§Ã£o", es "SelecciÃ³n". e.g. <a href="../../../../pt/s/e/l/Sele%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Brasileira_de_Futebol_de03.html" class="extiw" title="pt:SeleÃ§Ã£o_Brasileira_de_Futebol">pt:SeleÃ§Ã£o Brasileira de Futebol</a> (Brazilian Football Selection, usually just <i>SeleÃ§Ã£o Brasileira</i>), <a href="../../../../es/s/e/l/Selecci%C3%B3n_nacional_de_f%C3%BAtbol_de_Argentina_aedd.html" class="extiw" title="es:SelecciÃ³n_nacional_de_fÃºtbol_de_Argentina">es:SelecciÃ³n nacional de fÃºtbol de Argentina</a> (Argentina National Football Selection, usually <i>SelecciÃ³n Argentina</i>, the article's title on w:es was created to comply with standard spanish, ie: not <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rioplatense_Spanish_ad37.html" title="Rioplatense Spanish">Rioplatense Spanish</a>). Both in Brazil and Argentina, when saying "A SeleÃ§Ã£o" (pt) or "La SelecciÃ³n" (es), you're referring to the national team, and unless there's a particular context about another sport, it sure means the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> one. About <i>canarinho</i>, using the word in Portuguese is usually a reference to the late 60's early 70's national team, and <i>sometimes</i> refers to the national team altogether.

<p>You're probably right SpiceMan. Someone must have become confused and thought that "A SeleÃ§Ã£o" was the nickname when it's most likely not (I-ve certainly never heard it here in Brazil... and I really, Really like football). I vote we take away that nickname (if both of you agree, I'll remove it myself). But let we should Canarinho stay, because it can and is used to describe both the squads from 60-70's and the current squad (although I agree with you that's it much more common for the former than the latter).</p>

<p>That's fine. BTW, I took 'SeleÃ§Ã£o' from an article on the FIFA website detailing their qualification problems in past World Cups.</p>
<p>Hi. I am Brazilian. Every single match of the Brazilian team is referred to as "jogo da SeleÃ§Ã£o". The media, the players, the public, everyone refers to the team as "a SeleÃ§Ã£o". It has been so for at least the last three decades.</p>
<p>Indeed "SeleÃ§Ã£o" is the common term used to refer to the Brazilian National Football Team in Brazil. "Verdeamarela" is seldom used (let alone it's bad grammar - if anything, should be "Verde e Amarela", which means "Green and Yellow", and is always used after "SeleÃ§Ã£o" - I'm Brazilian too btw). What about "Scratch du Oro"? That's neither English nor Portuguese. It is not uncommon to find the Portuguese form "Escrete de Ouro" in the press, which translates to "Golden Scratch". girco 15:49, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hope my addition is appreciated. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreamless_02e2.html" title="User:Streamless">Streamless</a> 19:49, 1 February 2006 (UTC) Actually, it is "Little Canary Selection".</p>
<p>I don't know which nickname the world wide media uses, but we, brazilians, use that when mention the selection. Officialy (e eu nem sei escrever este raio) is "the Selected".</p>
<p>The word "SeleÃ§Ã£o" (Selection or Selected, as anglo speakers translate) is a general term for any National Team. We say "SeleÃ§Ã£o Inglesa" (England National Team), "SeleÃ§Ã£o Francesa" (France National Team) and on. So, I suggest that we remove the term "The Select" as a nickname for the Brazilian National Football team. --Mrzero 20:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we should put SeleÃ§Ã£o, just put a note next to it expaining it can mean any national team, ex. next to it put "SeleÃ§Ã£o (refers to any other national team as well)". SeleÃ§Ã£o is always used to describe them and even though it can refer to any national team it has become a nickname for Brazil. <a href="../../../a/b/r/User%7EAbreuzinho_e0a5.html" title="User:Abreuzinho">Abreuzinho</a> 15:32, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, again. Sorry, I don't know how to start a new sub-topic. Just to comment that I removed the reference to Zagallo saying "You will have to swallow me".

<p>I have try to correct all the international caps and goals. However, I find something interesting that Brazil often has non-official friendly match (such as vs Selection of Catalunya, vs Sevilla FC, vs Lucerne Selection, and more recently vs Al-Kuwait SC <a href="http://paginas.terra.com.br/esporte/rsssfbrasil/sel/brazilaunof.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://paginas.terra.com.br/esporte/rsssfbrasil/sel/brazilaunof.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). As these are unofficial matches, FIFA does not count the caps and goals from these matches. I have correct them all, but if anyone find a mistake please tell me and correct the stats, thanks. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 03:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another think that I forgot to mention is that if anyone use www.sambafoot.com as a reference for international caps and goals, there are some mistakes on that website statistics. That website includes caps and goals from unofficial matches and also from matches played by Brazil Olympic Team. Since Brazil Olympic Team is technically Brazil U-23 and not managed by the current senior coach, these caps were not counted. One special case is the CONCACAF Gold Cup 2003, where the Brazil senior team were invited, but they send the Brazil U-23 instead. However these matches are recorded as senior team matches and therefore the caps and goals from Gold Cup 2003 are counted as senior team caps. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 03:53, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we lose the notable former players section? With five World Cup wins there are many notable Brazilian players, but without specific criteria for inclusion the list is inherently POV - the list is currently based on the personal opinion of the editors who added them.

<dd>Well I believe that arsenal.com has incorrect stats. I usually use the website sambafoot.com for Brazillian players' caps and goal. In <a href="http://www.sambafoot.com/en/players/90_Julio_Baptista.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sambafoot.com/en/players/90_Julio_Baptista.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> it shows that Baptista has 29 games and 6 goals. However as I mention in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBrazil_national_football_team_0afd.html#International_caps_and_goals" title="Talk:Brazil national football team">previous talk topic</a>, we need to subtract the caps from unofficial matches which are the matches from Brazil Olympic team on January 2003 (5 caps and 3 goals from matches against Norway, Czech, Egypt, Chile and Germany) and also the matches against clubs or selections team (3 caps and 3 goals from matches against Tokyo Verdy, Selection of Catalunya and FC Sevilla). This resulted in 21 caps with no goal. However, I'm pretty sure that the last time I updated his caps it was 20 caps and no goals, just as soccerbase says. But right now I honestly don't know which one is correct because it is difficult to find complete lineups from Brazil matches since 2001. I only start collecting the lineups since season 2003-2004 onwards and I can only confirm that the matches that they listed seems correct. Maybe arsenal.com ignores the caps from 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup (July 2003) in which Baptista participate. In this competition Brazil chose to send their Olympic team due to their national team commitment on Copa America 2003. However , the matches were considered as senior team matches because this is a senior team tournament, the caps are counted for senior team. Well, honestly I still doesn't know whether to put 18/3 or 20/0 or 21/0 on his stats. It's just to complicated to find exact stats. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 15:21, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

However he listed 11 caps and 2 goals as of 29 June 2005. If I'm not wrong he only plays 2 more times after that under Parreira in 2005 and another 3 games under Dunga in 2006.
