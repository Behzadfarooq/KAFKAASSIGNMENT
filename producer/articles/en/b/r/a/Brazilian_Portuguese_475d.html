<p><b>Brazilian Portuguese</b> is the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialect</a> of the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese language</a> written and spoken by virtually all the 188 million inhabitants of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and by a couple million Brazilian immigrants, mainly in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraguay.html" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>.</p>
<p>The differences between <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_language.html" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> from <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and Brazilian Portuguese are comparable to those one might find when comparing <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>, although some claim they are much greater especially considering the differences in Brazilian and Portuguese grammar. The Brazilian formal written standard, which is defined by law and by international agreements with other Portuguese-speaking countries, is very similar to the European one; but there are nevertheless many differences in spelling, lexicon and grammar. European and Brazilian writers also have markedly different preferences when choosing between supposedly equivalent words or constructs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the cultural prestige and strong government support accorded to the written standard has maintained the unity of the language over the whole country, and ensured that all regional varieties remain fully intelligible. Starting in the 1960s, the nationwide dominance of TV networks based in the southeast (<a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_23d2.html" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minas_Gerais_4450.html" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>) has made the dialect of that region into an unofficial standard for the spoken language as well.</p>

<p>The existence of the Portuguese language in Brazil is a legacy of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_colonization_of_the_Americas_908a.html" title="Portuguese colonization of the Americas">Portuguese colonization of the Americas</a>. The first wave of Portuguese-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil in the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_Century_f644.html" title="16th Century">16th Century</a>, yet the language was not widely used then. For a time Portuguese coexisted with the <a href="../../../l/%C3%AD/n/L%C3%ADngua_Geral_23a8.html" title="Língua Geral">Língua Geral</a>, a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_franca.html" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a> based on <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerindian_languages.html" title="Amerindian languages">Amerindian languages</a> that was used by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> missionaries; as well as with various <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">African</a> languages spoken by the hundreds of thousands of slaves brought to the country between the 17th to 19th centuries.</p>
<p>By the end of the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, however, Portuguese had affirmed itself as the national language. That status was further consolidated with the arrival in Brazil of over 1.4 million new immigrants from Portugal during the 19th and 20th centuries. The aborted colonization attempts by the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> in <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in the 16th century and by the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> in the Northeast in the 17th century had negligible effect on the language. Even the substantial non-Portuguese-speaking immigration waves of the late 19th and early 20th century — mostly from Italy, Spain, Germany, Japan, and Lebanon — were linguistically integrated into the Portuguese-speaking majority within a couple of generations.</p>
<p><a name="Influences_from_other_languages" id="Influences_from_other_languages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Influences from other languages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influences from other languages</span></h3>
<p>The evolution of Brazilian Portuguese has certainly been influenced by the languages it supplanted: first the Amerind tongues of the natives, then the various African languages brought by the slaves, and finally the speeches of the European and Asian immigrants. The influence is clearly detected in the Brazilian Portuguese lexicon, which today is full of words of <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupi-guarani.html" title="Tupi-guarani">Tupi-guarani</a>, Yorubá origin, among others.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, words deriving from the <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupi-Guaran%C3%AD_51b4.html" title="Tupi-Guaraní">Tupi-Guaraní</a> family of languages are particularly prevalent in place names (<i><a href="../../../i/t/a/Itaquaquecetuba.html" title="Itaquaquecetuba">Itaquaquecetuba</a>,</i> <i><a href="../../../p/i/n/Pindamonhangaba.html" title="Pindamonhangaba">Pindamonhangaba</a>,</i> <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Caruaru.html" title="Caruaru">Caruaru</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../i/p/a/Ipanema.html" title="Ipanema">Ipanema</a></i>). The native languages contributed the names for most of the plants and animals found in Brazil, such as <i>arara</i> ("<a href="../../../m/a/c/Macaw.html" title="Macaw">macaw</a>"), <i>jacaré</i> ("South American <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alligator.html" title="Alligator">alligator</a>"), <i>tucano</i> ("<a href="../../../t/o/u/Toucan.html" title="Toucan">toucan</a>"), <i>mandioca</i> ("<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manioc.html" title="Manioc">manioc</a>"), <i>pipoca</i> ("<a href="../../../p/o/p/Popcorn.html" title="Popcorn">popcorn</a>"), <i>abacaxi</i> ("<a href="../../../p/i/n/Pineapple.html" title="Pineapple">pineapple</a>"), and many more. Many of these words entered the Brazilian Portuguese lexicon already in the 16th century, and some of them, like <i>pipoca</i> and <i>abacaxi</i> were eventually borrowed by European Portuguese and later even into other European languages.</p>
<p>The African languages provided many words too, especially related to food, such as <i><a href="../../../q/u/i/Quindim.html" title="Quindim">quindim</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/c/a/Acaraj%C3%A9.html" title="Acarajé">acarajé</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/o/q/Moqueca.html" title="Moqueca">moqueca</a></i>; and household concepts, such as <i>cafuné</i> ("caress on the head"), <i>curinga</i> ("<a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28playing_card%29.html" title="Joker (playing card)">joker card</a>"), and <i>caçula</i> ("youngest child"). <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capoeira.html" title="Capoeira">Capoeira</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marimba.html" title="Marimba">marimba</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samba.html" title="Samba">samba</a> are also the African (<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantu_languages.html" title="Bantu languages">Bantu</a>) words borrowed by Brazilian Portuguese that gained popularity, and these were also gained by European Portuguese and English.</p>
<p>There are also many borrowings from other <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> languages such as <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> (esp. words connected to technology and finance), <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> (food, furniture and luxurious fabrics and concepts), <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a>, and, to a lesser extent, from Asian languages such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>. The latter borrowings are also mostly related to food and drinks or culture-bound concepts, such as ‘’quimono’’, from Japanese <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimono.html" title="Kimono">kimono</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of those languages in the phonology and grammar of Brazilian Portuguese have been minor. Also, it is claimed that the virtual disappearance of certain verb inflections in Brazil, such as the past pluperfect and the second person plural, and the Brazilian's marked preference for compound tenses, recall the grammatical simplification that is observed in the formation of pidgins. However, the same or similar processes can be verified in the European variant.</p>
<p>Regardless of these borrowings, it must be kept in mind that Brazilian Portuguese is not literally a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_creole.html" title="Portuguese creole">Portuguese creole</a>, since both grammar and vocabulary remain real Portuguese.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Written and spoken languages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Written and spoken languages</span></h2>
<p>The written language taught in Brazilian schools has historically been based on the standard of Portugal, and Portuguese writers have often been regarded as models by Brazilian authors and teachers. Nonetheless, this closeness and aspiration to unity was in the 20th severely weakened by nationalist movements in literature and the arts, which awakened in many Brazilian artists the desire of a true national writing, uninfluenced by standards in Portugal. Later on, agreements were made as to preserve at least the orthographical unity throughout the Portuguese-speaking world, including the African and Asian variants of the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the spoken language suffered none of the constraints that applied to the written language. Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look up to what is considered the national standard variety, and never the European one. Moreover, Brazilians in general have had very little exposure or sometimes even interest in the European speech, even after the advent of radio, TV and movies. The language spoken in Brazil has evolved largely independently of that spoken in Portugal.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Formal written Brazilian Portuguese">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Formal written Brazilian Portuguese</span></h2>
<p>The written Brazilian Portuguese standard differs from the European one to about the same extent that <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="American and British English differences">American written English differs from British English</a>; or to the same extent observed among the national variants of French and Spanish. The differences extend to spelling, lexicon, and grammar.</p>
<p><a name="Spelling_differences" id="Spelling_differences"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Spelling differences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spelling differences</span></h3>
<p>The Brazilian spellings of certain words differ from those used in Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries. Some of these differences are merely orthographical, but others reflect true differences in pronunciation.</p>
<p>A major subset of the differences relates to words with <i>c</i> and <i>p</i> followed by <i>c</i>, <i>ç</i> or <i>t</i>. In many cases, the letters <i>c</i> or <i>p</i> have become silent in all varieties of Portuguese, a common phonetic change in Romance languages (cf. Spanish <i>objeto</i>, French <i>objet</i>). Accordingly, they stopped being written down in BP, but are still written in other countries. For example, we have EP <i>acção</i> / BP <i>ação</i> ("action"), EP <i>óptimo</i> / BP <i>ótimo</i> ("optimum"), and so on, where the consonant is silent both in BP and in EP, but the words are spelled differently. Only in a small number of words is the consonant silent in Brazil and pronounced elsewhere, or vice-versa.</p>
<p>However BP has retained those "silent" consonants in a few cases, such as <i>detectar</i> ("to detect"). In particular, BP generally distinguishes in sound and writing between <i>secção</i> ("section" as in <i>anatomy</i> or <i>drafting</i>) and <i>seção</i> ("section" of an organization); whereas EP uses <i>secção</i> for both senses.</p>
<p>Another major set of differences is the BP usage of <i>ô</i> or <i>ê</i> in many words where EP has <i>ó</i> or <i>é</i>, such as BP <i>neurônio</i> / EP <i>neurónio</i> ("neuron") and BP <i>arsênio</i> / EP <i>arsénio</i>. These spelling differences are due to genuinely different pronunciations. In EP, the vowels <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> may be open (<i>é</i> or <i>ó</i>) or closed (<i>ê</i> or <i>ô</i>) when they are stressed before one of the nasal consonants <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> followed by a vowel, but in BP they are always close in this environment. The variant spellings are necessary in those cases because the general Portuguese spelling rules mandate a stress diacritic in those words, and the Portuguese diacritics also encode vowel quality.</p>
<p>Another source of variation is the spelling of the [<span class="Unicode">ʒ</span>] sound before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>. By Portuguese spelling rules, that sound can be written either as <i>j</i> (favored in BP for certain words) or as <i>g</i> (favored in EP). Thus, for example, we have BP <i>berinjela</i>/ EP <i>beringela</i> ("eggplant").</p>

<p>The linguistic situation of Brazil can be described as one of extreme <a href="../../../d/i/g/Diglossia.html" title="Diglossia">diglossia</a>, the intimate coexistence of two varieties or "registers" of the language — "formal" and "informal" — which are used simultaneously, mixed in continuously varying proportions depending on the speaker and occasion. While diglossia inevitably develops in every literate society, it is much more striking in Brazil than in English or in European Portuguese.</p>
<p>The formal register of Brazilian Portuguese has both a written and spoken form. The written formal register (FW) is used in almost all printed media and written communication, is uniform throughout the country, and is the "Portuguese" officially taught at school. The spoken formal register (FS) is basically a phonetic rendering of the written form: it is used only in very formal situations like speeches or ceremonies, by educated people who wish to stress their education; or when reading directly out of a written text. While FS is necessarily uniform in lexicon and grammar, it shows noticeable regional variations in pronunciation. Finally the informal register (IS) is almost never written down (basically only in artistic works, or in very informal contexts such as adolescent chat rooms). It is used to some extent in virtually all oral communication outside of those formal contexts — even by well educated speakers — and shows considerable regional variations in pronunciation, lexicon, and even grammar.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following sample of formal written Portuguese (FW), as it would be written by a secretary, and its formal spoken version (FS) in the São Paulo dialect and semi-literal English translation (EN):</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>EN:</b> "We need to inform everybody that there won't be power in the elevators."</dd>
<dd><b>FW:</b> <i>Precisamos informar a todos que faltará energia nos elevadores.</i></dd>
<dd><b>FS:</b> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[presi'zɐ̃muz infor'mar a 'todus ki falta'ra ener'ʒia 'nus eleva'doris]</span></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is how the same person could deliver the same message orally, in informal spoken register (IS):</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>IS (as it would be written):</b> (A gente) tem que falar pra todo mundo que vai faltar luz nos elevadores.</dd>
<dd><b>IS (IPA):</b> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a 'ʒenti 'tẽĩ ki fa'la pra 'todu 'mũdu ki vai fal'ta luz nus eleva'doris]</span></dd>
<dd><b>EN:</b> "(We) have to tell 'all the world' that there won't be light in the elevators."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This examples shows that FS and IS can differ in</p>
<dl>
<dd>lexicon: <i>precisamos</i> ("we need to")→ <i>temos que</i> ("we have to"), <i>informar</i> ("to inform")→ <i>falar</i> ("to talk") - in IS there won't be a big difference between "falar" (talk/speak) and "dizer" (say), since only the the form "falar" is used. <i>energia</i> ("energy")→ <i>luz</i> ("light")</dd>
<dd>change of grammatical person: <i>temos</i> (verb "ter" conjugated in the first person plural) → <i>(a gente) tem</i> (the expression "a gente" (lit. "the people"), in this case ommited, replaces the pronoun "nós" (we) in IS; also, the verb shall be conjugated in the singular (which in general causes confusion among uneducated speakers)</dd>
<dd>choice of verbal form: <i>faltará</i> → <i>vai faltar</i> (the form "ir" (go) + infinitive is used in IS rather than the simple future);</dd>
<dd>contractions: <i>para os</i> → <i>pros</i> ("for the");</dd>
<dd>loss of final <i>-r</i>: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fa'lar]</span> → <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fa'la]</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Plural: it may also disappear depending on the level of education of the speaker "os elevadores" &gt;&gt; "os elevador". But it is considered inappropriate even in IS.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Change of existential verb: <i>há</i> → <i>tem</i> (both can be transalated as "there is/are", but the second one uses the verb "ter"(have)in a sense of existence, whereas it is not possible in the in FW);</li>
</ul>
<p>This example is somewhat extreme and hypothetical: the speech of most people will be some mixture of the informal (IS) and formal (FS) spoken registers, the proportions varying according to the speaker's education and the situation. Thus, for example, the same person may deliver something close to the FS version when speaking in a TV interview. The adjustment is largely unconscious, and it is not unusual to hear informal and formal constructs mixed in the same speech, or even in the same sentence. As is usually the case in diglossic communities, an educated person who has to write down a spoken text (e.g. a secretary taking dictation) will unconsciously translate IS into FW, and back again when delivering the message in person.</p>

Since Brazil joined <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercosul.html" title="Mercosul">Mercosul</a>, the South American free trade zone, Portuguese has been increasingly studied as a second language in Spanish-speaking partner countries. A <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_language.html" title="Mixed language">mixed language</a> of Portuguese and Spanish, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nicknamed</a> <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portu%C3%B1ol.html" title="Portuñol">Portuñol</a> or Portunhol, is spoken in regions bordering countries such as <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguay.html" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>.</p>
<p>Many words of Brazilian origin (also used in other Portuguese-language countries) have also entered into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>: <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samba.html" title="Samba">samba</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bossa_nova.html" title="Bossa nova">bossa nova</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruzeiro.html" title="Cruzeiro">cruzeiro</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milreis.html" title="Milreis">milreis</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capoeira.html" title="Capoeira">capoeira</a>, and especially <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marimba.html" title="Marimba">marimba</a>.

<p>After independence in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>, Brazilian idioms with African and Amerindian influences were brought to Portugal by returning <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese-Brazilian_8064.html" title="Portuguese-Brazilian">Portuguese-Brazilians</a> (<i>Luso-Brasileiros</i> in Portuguese) [and some Amerindian Brazilians (<i>Índio-Brasileiros</i> in Portuguese), <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Brazilian_3f14.html" title="Afro-Brazilian">Afro-Brazilians</a> (<i>Afro-Brasileiros</i> in Portuguese), <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulato.html" title="Mulato">mulatos</a>, and <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zambo.html" title="Zambo">cafuzos</a> (known as zambos in English-speaking countries)], who brought rich culture mixed with African and Native American elements.</p>

<p>The vocabularies of Brazilian and European Portuguese also differ in a couple of thousand words, many of which refer to concepts that were introduced separately in BP and EP.</p>
<p>Since the Brazilian independence in 1822, BP has tended to borrow words from English and French. However, BP generally adopts foreign words with minimal adjustments, while EP tends to apply deeper morphological changes<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. However, there are instances of BP <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterating</a> English words, whereas EP retains the original form - hence <i>estoque</i> and <i>stock</i>. Finally, one dialect often borrowed a word while the other coined a new one from native elements. So one has, for example</p>
<dl>
<dd>BP <i>mouse</i> ← English "mouse" versus EP <i>rato</i> ← literal translation of "mouse" in Portugal, but means "rat" in Brazil</dd>
<dd>BP <i>esporte</i> (alternatives: <i>desporto</i>, <i>desporte</i>) ← English "sport" versus EP <i>desporto</i> ← Spanish <i>deporte</i></dd>
<dd>BP <i>jaqueta</i> ← English "jacket" versus EP <i>blusão</i> ← EP <i>blusa</i> ← French <i>blouse</i></dd>
<dd>BP <i>concreto</i> ← English "concrete" versus EP <i>betão</i> ← French <i>beton</i></dd>

<p>Some words, which are often mistakenly given as examples of dialectal lexical differences, actually do not denote the same concepts. For example: "abacaxi" and "ananás" designate two different kinds of pineapple; "grama" often refers to any kind of grass in a garden or urban area whereas "relva" or "relvado" refers to natural grass of forests, etc. Some of the words shown in only one column (like <i>comboio</i>, <i>atendedor de chamadas</i>, and <i>mamadeira</i>) do exist in the other dialect, but are rarely used. <a name="Grammar" id="Grammar"></a></p>

<p>The Portuguese language makes extensive use of verbs in the progressive tense, almost as in English.</p>
<p>BP seldom has the present continuous construct <i>estar a</i> + infinitive, which, in contrast, has become quite common in EP. In BP, the present continuous must be expressed by <i>estar</i> + <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerund.html" title="Gerund">gerund</a>. Thus Brazilians will always write <i>ela está dançando</i> ("she is dancing"), never <i>ela está a dançar</i>. The same restriction applies to several other uses of the gerund: BP always writes <i>ficamos conversando</i> ("we kept on talking") and <i>ele trabalha cantando</i> ("he sings while he works"), never <i>ficamos a conversar</i> and <i>ele trabalha a cantar</i> as is the case in most varieties of EP.</p>
<p>It must be noted, however, that BP retains the combination <i>a</i> + infinitive for uses that are not related to continued action, such as <i>voltamos a correr</i> ("we went back to running"), and that some dialects of EP will also tend to use <i>estar</i> + <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerund.html" title="Gerund">gerund</a> in the same way as Brazilians.</p>

<p>In a few compound verb tenses, BP uses the auxiliary <i>ter</i> (originally "to hold", "to own"), where EP would normally use <i>haver</i> ("shall, will"). In particular, the EP construction <i>há-de cantar</i> ("he will sing" or "he shall sing") is hardly ever used in BP. BP also uses <i>ter</i> in existential sense, whereas EP would use <i>haver</i>, hence "não tem dinheiro" instead of "não há dinheiro" ("there is no money").</p>

<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_pronouns.html" title="Portuguese pronouns">Portuguese pronouns</a></i></div>
<p>The informal spoken BP has the particular construction "2nd person singular personal pronoum (tu) + verb in 3rd person singular (ele)", to represent a possible future situation (like a conditional situation - "Tu vai cair se não se segurar direito" - <i>You'll fall down if you don't hold yourself properly</i>) or to ask somebody to do someting ("Tu vende o livro pra mim?" - <i>Do you sell the book for me?</i>). Formal BP seldom uses the personal pronoun "tu", using the pronoun "você" instead. In most regions it is also common to use "você" informally.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Syntax">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Syntax</span></h4>
<p>Brazilians normally place the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pronoun.html" title="Pronoun">object pronoun</a> before the verb (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Proclitic.html" title="Proclitic">proclitic</a> position), as in <i>ele me viu</i> ("he saw me"). In many such cases, the proclisis would be considered awkward or even grammatically incorrect in EP, in which the pronoun is generally placed after the verb (<a href="../../../e/n/c/Enclitic.html" title="Enclitic">enclitic</a> position), namely <i>ele viu-me</i>. However, formal BP still follows EP in avoiding starting a sentence with a proclitic pronoun; so both will write <i>Deram-lhe o livro</i> ("They gave her the book") instead of <i>Lhe deram o livro.</i></p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Contracted forms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contracted forms</span></h5>
<p>Even in the most formal contexts, BP never uses the contracted combinations of direct and indirect object pronouns which are sometimes used in EP, such as <i>me</i> + <i>o</i> = <i>mo</i>, <i>lhe</i> + <i>as</i> = <i>lhas</i>. Instead, the indirect clitic is replaced by preposition + strong pronoun: thus BP writes <i>ela o deu para mim</i> ("she gave it to me") instead of EP <i>ela deu-mo</i>. But this form is practically used only in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>The mesoclitic placement of pronouns (between the verb stem and its inflection suffix) is viewed as archaic in BP, and therefore is restricted to very formal situations or stylistic texts . Hence the phrase <i>Eu dar-lhe-ia</i>, still current in EP, would be normally written <i>Eu lhe daria</i> in BP. Incidentally, a marked fondness for enclitic and mesoclitic pronouns was one of the many memorable eccentricities of former Brazilian President <a href="../../../j/%C3%A2/n/J%C3%A2nio_Quadros_aabf.html" title="Jânio Quadros">Jânio Quadros</a>, as in his famous quote <i>Bebo-o porque é líquido, se fosse sólido comê-lo-ia</i> ("I drink it [liquor] because it is liquid, if it were solid I would eat it")</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Reflexive verbs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reflexive verbs</span></h5>
<p>Brazilian Portuguese often treats as intransitive certain verbs that in EP are reflexive, and therefore would require a reflexive weak pronoun. Thus, for example, BP would often say <i>ele lembra</i> ("he remembers") instead of <i>ele se lembra</i>, or <i>eu deito</i> "I lie down" instead of <i>eu me deito.</i> An exception to the rule may be the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where such verbs are often used as reflexive, possibly because of influence from Spanish as spoken in neighbouring Argentina and Uruguay - and formerly in Rio Grande do Sul as well.</p>

<p>There are many differences between formal written BP and EP that are simply a matter of different preferences between two alternative words or constrictions that are both officially valid and acceptable.</p>

<p>BP often uses <i>iria cantar</i> ("he would sing") instead of the synthetic <i>cantaria</i> ("he would sing"), using the verb "ir" as a verb that expresses modalitiy. Some simple tenses, except from the simple present, simple past, imperfect past and subjunctives, are usually replaced by a complex tenses, such as in:<br />
<br />
S. Future&#160;: <i>eu cantarei</i> , complex form: <i>eu vou cantar</i> ("ir"+infinitive)<br />
Hypothetical Future&#160;: <i>eu cantaria</i> , complex form: <i>eu iria/ia cantar</i> ("ir"+infinitive)<br />
Past Perfect&#160;: <i>eu cantara</i> , complex form: <i>eu tinha cantado</i> ("ter"+past participle)"<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the spoken BP usually uses the verb <i>ter</i> ("have", sense of possession) and never <i>haver</i> ("have" or "there to be") , esp. as an auxiliary (as it can be seen above) and as a verb of existence.<br />
<br />
Written: <i>ele havia/tinha cantado</i><br />

<p>In many ways, compared to <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Portuguese_2388.html" title="European Portuguese">European Portuguese</a> (EP), Brazilian Portuguese (BP) is conservative in its phonology.

<p>Brazilian speakers generally pronounce all vowels more clearly and distinctly than the European speakers. In the syllables that follow the stressed one, BP generally pronounces <i>o</i> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[u]</span>, <i>a</i> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span>, and <i>e</i> as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[i]</span>. Some dialects of BP follow these rules also for vowels before the stressed syllable. In contrast, EP <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elision.html" title="Elision">elides</a> some unstressed vowels, or reduces them to a very short, near central unrounded vowel <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɨ]</span>, a sound that does not exist in BP. Thus, for example, the word <i>setembro</i> is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[seˈtẽbɾu]</span> in BP but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s(ɨ)ˈtẽbɾu]</span> in EP.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable tendencies of BP is the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatalization.html" title="Palatalization">palatalization</a> of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/t/</span> in some regions, which are pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[d<sup>ʒ</sup>]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[t<sup>ʃ</sup>]</span>, respectively, before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span>. The word <i>presidente</i> "president", for example, is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[pɾeziˈdẽt<sup>ʃ</sup>i]</span> in these regions of Brazil, but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[pɾɨziˈdẽt(ɨ)]</span> in Portugal. This pronunciation began in Rio de Janeiro and is often still associated with this city, but is now standard in other major cities such as Belo Horizonte and Salvador, and has spread more recently to some regions of São Paulo (due to the migrants from other regions), where it is common in most speakers under 40 or so. It has always been standard among Brazil's <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese</a> community, since this is also a feature of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese language</a>.</p>
<p>BP tends to break up clusters where the first sound is not <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span>, or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/s/</span> by the insertion of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span> (although clusters ending in <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span> are allowed, as are <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ks/</span> and sometimes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kt/</span>), and similarly to eliminate words ending with consonants other than <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span>, or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/s/</span> by the addition of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/i/</span>. Syllable-final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/l/</span> is vocalized to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[w]</span>, and syllable-final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span> is weakened in most regions to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[χ]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[h]</span>, or dropped entirely (especially at the ends of words). Mute of syllable-final [r], or <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents.html" title="Rhotic and non-rhotic accents">non-rhoticity</a>, is not only affected by accent features of Native American and African languages, but also by accent features of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> when descendants of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese-Brazilian_5082.html" title="Japanese-Brazilian">Japanese-Brazilian</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German-Brazilian_8480.html" title="German-Brazilian">German-Brazilian</a> settlers speak Portuguese. This sometimes results in rather striking transformations of common words. The brand name "MacDonald's", for example, is rendered <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[makiˈdõnawd<sup>ʒ</sup>i]</span>, and the word "rock" is rendered as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ˈhɔki]</span>. (Initial <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span> and doubled 'rr' are pronounced in BP as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[h]</span>, as with syllable-final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/r/</span>.) Combined with the fact that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/n/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/m/</span> are already disallowed at the end of syllables in Portuguese (being replaced with nasalization on the previous vowel), this makes BP have a phonology that strongly favors open syllables, as in Japanese.</p>
<p>Nasalization is much stronger in BP than EP. This is especially noticeable in vowels before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/n/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/m/</span> followed by a vowel, which are pronounced in BP with nasalization as strong as in phonemically nasalized vowels, while in EP they are nearly without nasalization. For the same reason, open vowels (which are disallowed under nasalization in Portuguese in general) cannot occur before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/n/</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/m/</span> in BP, but can in EP. This sometimes affects the spelling of words. For example, EP, <i>harmónico</i> "harmonic" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐɾˈmɔniku]</span> is BP <i>harmônico</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aɦˈmõniku]</span>. It also can affect verbal paradigms—for example, EP distinguishes <i>falamos</i> "we speak" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fɐˈlɐmuʃ]</span> from 'falámos' <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[fɐˈlamuʃ]</span> "we spoke", but BP has <i>falamos</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[faˈlɐ̃mus]</span> for both.</p>
<p>Related to this is the difference in pronunciation of the consonant written <i>nh</i>. This is <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɲ]</span> in EP but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[̃j̃]</span> in BP, a nasalized <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/j/</span>, which nasalizes the preceding vowel<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>BP did not participate in many sound changes that later affected EP, particularly in the realm of consonants. In BP, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/b/</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/d/</span>, and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/g/</span> are stops in all positions, while they are weakened to fricatives <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[β]</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ð]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɣ]</span> in EP, as in Spanish. Many dialects of BP maintain syllable-final <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[s]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[z]</span> as such, while EP consistently converts them to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʒ]</span>. (Whether such a change happens in BP is highly dialect-specific. Rio de Janeiro is particularly known for such a pronunciation; São Paulo is particular known for <i>not</i> having it. Elsewhere, such as in the Northeast, it is more likely to happen before a consonant than word-finally, and varies from region to region or even from speaker to speaker.</p>
<p>Another change in EP that does not occur in BP is the lowering of /e/ to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span> before palatal sounds (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʃ]</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʒ]</span>, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɲ]</span> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʎ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[j]</span>) and in the diphthong <i>em</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ẽĩ/</span>, which merges with the diphthong <i>ãe</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ɐ̃ĩ/</span> in EP but not BP.</p>
<p>An interesting change that is in the process of spreading in BP, probably originating in the Northeast, is the insertion of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[j]</span> after stressed vowels before <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/s/</span> at the end of a syllable. This began in the context of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/a/</span>—for example, <i>mas</i> "but" is now pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[majs]</span> in most of Brazil, making it <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophonous.html" title="Homophonous">homophonous</a> with <i>mais</i> "more". The change is spreading to other vowels, however, and at least in the Northeast the normal pronunciations of <i>voz</i> "voice" and <i>Jesus</i> are <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[vojs]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʒeˈzujs]</span>. Similarly, <i>três</i> "three" becomes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tɾejs]</span>, making it rhyme with <i>seis</i> "six" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[sejs]</span>; this may explain the common Brazilian replacement of <i>seis</i> with <i>meia</i> (literally "half", as in "half a dozen") when spelling out phone numbers.</p>

<p>There are various differences between <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Portuguese_2388.html" title="European Portuguese">European Portuguese</a> and Brazilian Portuguese, such as the dropping of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_person.html" title="Grammatical person">second person</a> in everyday usage and the use of subject pronouns (ele, ela, eles, elas) as direct objects. Portuguese people can understand Brazilian Portuguese well. However, some Brazilians find <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Portuguese_2388.html" title="European Portuguese">European Portuguese</a> difficult to understand at first. This is mainly due to the fact European Portuguese tends to compress words to a greater extent than in Brazil -- for example, tending to drop unstressed /e/ -- and to introduce greater allophonic modifications of various sounds. For similar reasons, Portuguese speakers in general usually find it easier to understand Spanish than the reverse.</p>

<p>Spoken Brazilian usage differs considerably from European usage in many aspects. Between Brazilian Portuguese, particularly in its most informal varieties, and European Portuguese, there can be considerable differences in grammar, as well. The most prominent ones concern the placement of clitic pronouns, and the use of subject pronouns as objects in the third person. Non-standard inflections are also common in colloquial Brazilian Portuguese.</p>

<p><small><sup>1</sup>Although the word <i>moças</i> is not often used in modern European Portuguese, the intent here is to compare the morphology.</small></p>
<p>The examples in the table are in increasing degree of informality. The word order in the first Brazilian example is actually frequent in European Portuguese, too, for example in subordinate clauses like <i>Sabes <b>que eu te amo</b></i> (You know <i>that I love you</i>), but not in simple sentences like "I love you." But in Portugal an object pronoun would never be placed at the start of a sentence, like in the second example. The example in the bottom row of the table, with its deletion of "redundant" inflections, would be considered ungrammatical by most educated urban middle-class speakers of BP, but it is nonetheless widely heard in Brazil, especially in certain regional dialects like <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caipira.html" title="Caipira">caipira</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mineiro.html" title="Mineiro">mineiro</a>.</p>

<p>In spoken informal registers of BP, the third-person object pronouns 'o', 'a', 'os' and 'as', common in EP, are virtually nonexistent -- they are simply left out, or (when necessary, and usually only when referring to people) replaced by stressed subject pronouns (e.g., <i>ele</i> "he" or <i>isso</i> "that"); for example, <i>Eu vi ele</i> "I saw him" rather than <i>Eu o vi</i>.</p>

<p>In most dialects of BP, 'você' (formal "you" in EP) replaces <i>tu</i> (informal "you" in EP). (Thus, there is no formal/informal distinction such as exists in most European languages.) The object pronoun, however, is still <i>te</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[tʃi]</span>, and other forms such as <i>teu</i> (possessive), <i>ti</i> (post-prepositional) and <i>contigo</i> ("with you") may still remain in some regions of Brazil, especially when <i>tu</i> is still used. Hence, the combination of object <i>te</i> with subject <i>você,</i> for example, <i>eu te disse para você ir</i> "I told you that you should go". The imperative forms, however, look like the EP second-person forms, although it is argued by some that it is the third-person singular indicative which doubles as the imperative.</p>
<p>The forms <i>ti/tu</i> and <i>contigo</i> are replaced with <i>você</i> and <i>com você.</i> Either <i>você</i> (following the verb) or <i>te</i> (preceding the verb) can be used as object pronoun: Hence a speaker may end up saying "I love you" in two ways: <i>Eu amo você</i> and/or <i>eu te amo.</i></p>
<p>In the South (<a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_Grande_do_Sul_778a.html" title="Rio Grande do Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Catarina_%28state%29_0425.html" title="Santa Catarina (state)">Santa Catarina</a>, parts of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paran%C3%A1_%28state%29.html" title="Paraná (state)">Paraná</a>) and the cities of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santos_%28S%C3%A3o_Paulo%29_868d.html" title="Santos (São Paulo)">Santos</a> (in <a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_%28state%29_7787.html" title="São Paulo (state)">São Paulo</a>) and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recife.html" title="Recife">Recife</a> (in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pernambuco.html" title="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>), the distinction between semi-formal <i>você</i> and familiar <i>tu</i> is still maintained; object and possessive pronouns pattern likewise. In Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, for instance, <i>você</i> is almost never used in spoken language - <i>o senhor/a senhora</i> is employed whenever <i>tu</i> may sound too informal<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. In <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, parts of the Northeast (interior of some northeastern states and some speakers from the coast) and the North, both <i>tu</i> and <i>você</i> (and associated object and possessive pronouns) are used, with no difference. Most Brazilians who use <i>tu,</i> use it with the 3rd person verb: <i>tu vai ao banco</i>). <i>Tu</i> accompanied by the second-person verb can still be found in Maranhão, Piauí and Santa Catarina, for instance, and in a few cities in Rio Grande do Sul near the border with Uruguay, with a slightly different pronunciation in some conjugations (<i>tu vieste</i> pronounced <i>tu viesse</i>), which also is present in Santa Catarina and Pernambuco.</p>

<p>Standard BP tends to use the third-person possessive 'seu' to mean "your", and uses 'dele,' 'dela', 'deles', and 'delas' (literally "of him/her/them", and placed after the noun) as third-person possessive forms. In situations however where no ambiguity arises (especially in narrative texts), 'seu' may be used as well to mean 'his' or 'her' (e.g. <i>O candidato apresentou ontem o seu plano de governo para os próximos quatro anos</i>).</p>
<p>It must be noted, though, that both forms ('seu' or 'dele(s) /dela(s)') are considered grammatically correct both in EP as well as in BP.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: The imperative">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The imperative</span></h4>
<p>Classical Portuguese inflected the imperative according to the grammatical person of the subject (the being who is ordered to do the action). Thus one should use different inflections when that subject is treated as <i>tu</i> ("you", grammatical 2nd person) or <i>você</i> ("you", grammatical 3rd person):</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>tu és burro, cal<b>a</b> a boca!</i></dd>
<dd><i>você é burro, cal<b>e</b> a boca!</i></dd>
<dd>"you are stupid, shut up!"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Currently, many dialects of BP have largely lost the 2nd person subjects, but the same dialects might still use the 2rd person imperative, even with <i>você</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>BP: <i>você é burro, cal<b>e</b> a boca!</i> OR</dd>
<dd>BP: <i>você é burro, cal<b>a</b> a boca!</i> (in this case, sometimes people join "cala" + "a" + "boca", resulting on <i>você é burro, <b>calaboca</b></i> on Brazilian Portuguese Informal Speech.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Moreover, BP speakers rarely use the subjunctive for the Negative Imperative; instead they will employ the Imperative inflexion. This never occurs in EP, except for some jocular contexts or when scolding or giving incisive orders to a child. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><i>Não faz nada, eu te ajudo!</i> (Do not do anything, I'll help you [occurs mainly in spoken BP]).</p>
<p><i>Não faças nada, eu ajudo-te!</i> (same meaning [occurs mainly in EP. Compare also the placement of the pronoun ''te'']).</p>
<p>Note that 3rd person subjunctive verb forms are nevertheless frequently used in Brazil, both as Negative and Positive Imperatives, in written signs and public announcements (e.g. <i>Não jogue papel na grama</i>; <i>Não fume</i>, <i>Dê a descarga após usar a privada</i>), or in (printed, Internet, TV, or radio) advertising (e.g. <i>Pague um e leve três</i>, <i>Emagreça dez quilos dormindo</i>). The subjunctive form of the verb "ser" (<i>seja</i>) is also always used to form the Imperative, even in informal spoken language (e.g. <i>Seja um bom menino</i>; <i>não seja bobo, garoto!</i>).</p>

<p>According to some contemporary <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> linguists (Bortoni, Kato, Mattos e Silva, Perini and most recently, with great impact, Bagno), Brazilian Portuguese may be a highly <a href="../../../d/i/g/Diglossia.html" title="Diglossia">diglossic language</a>. This theory claims that there is an L-variant (termed "Brazilian Vernacular"), which would be the mother tongue of all Brazilians, and an H-variant (standard Brazilian Portuguese) acquired through schooling. L-variant represents a simplified form of the language (in terms of grammar, but not of phonetics) that could have evolved from <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> Portuguese, influenced by <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerindian.html" title="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> (mostly <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupi_Antigo_b6e9.html" title="Tupi Antigo">Tupi</a>) and <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_languages.html" title="African languages">African languages</a>, while H-variant would be based on <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> European Portuguese (and very similar to Standard European Portuguese, with only minor differences in <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthography.html" title="Orthography">spelling</a> and grammar usage). Mário A. Perini, a Brazilian linguist, even compares the depth of the differences between L- and H- variants of Brazilian Portuguese with those between Standard Spanish and Standard Portuguese. However, his proposal is not widely accepted by neither grammarians nor academics,</p>
<p><a name="Usage" id="Usage"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Portuguese_475d.html" title="Edit section: Usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Usage</span></h3>
<p>From this point of view, the L-variant is the spoken form of Brazilian Portuguese, which should be avoided only in very formal speech (court interrogation, political debate) while the H-variant is the written form of Brazilian Portuguese, avoided only in informal writing (such as songs lyrics, love letters, intimate friends correspondence). Even language professors many times use the L-variant while explaining students the structure and usage of the H-variant; in essays, nevertheless, all students are expected to use H-variant.</p>
<p>While the L-variant may used in songs, movies, soap operas, sitcoms and other television shows, although, at times, the H-variant is used in historic films or soap operas to make the language used sound more ‘elegant’ and/or ‘archaic’. There is a claim that the H-variant used to be preferred when dubbing foreign films and series into Brazilian Portuguese<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, but nowadays the L-variant is preferred, although this seems to lack evidence. Movie subtitles normally use a mixture of L- and H-variants, but remain closer to the H-variant.</p>
<p>Most literary works are written in the H-variant. There would have been attempts at writing in the L-variant (such as the masterpiece <i>Macunaíma</i>, written by Brazilian modernist <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/r/M%C3%A1rio_de_Andrade_c08d.html" title="Mário de Andrade">Mário de Andrade</a> and <i>Grande Sertão: Veredas</i>, by João <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guimar%C3%A3es_Rosa_8372.html" title="Guimarães Rosa">Guimarães Rosa</a>), but, presently, the L-variant is claimed to be used only in dialogue. Still, many contemporary writers like using the H-variant even in informal dialogue. This is also true of translated books, which never use the L-variant, only the H one. Childrens books seem to be more L-friendly, but, again, if they are translated from another language (<i>The Little Prince</i>, for instance) they will use the H-variant only.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>This theory also posits that the matter of diglossia in Brazil is further complicated by forces of political and cultural bias, though those are not clearly named. Language has been made, apparently, into a tool of social exclusion or social choice.</p>
<p>Mário A. Perini, a famous Brazilian linguist, has said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"There are two languages in Brazil. The one we write (and which is called "Portuguese"), and another one that we speak (which is so despised that there is not a name to call it). The latter is the mother tongue of Brazilians, the former has to be learned in school, and a majority of population does not manage to master it appropriately.... Personally, I do not object to us writing Portuguese, but I think it is important to make clear that Portuguese is (at least in Brazil) only a written language. Our mother tongue is not Portuguese, but Brazilian Vernacular. This is not a slogan, nor a political statement, it is simply recognition of a fact.... There are linguistic teams working hard in order to give the full description of the structure of the Vernacular. So, there are hopes, that within some years, we will have appropriate grammars of our mother tongue, the language that has been ignored, denied and despised for such a long time."</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to Milton M. Azevedo (Brazilian linguist):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The relationship between Vernacular Brazilian Portuguese and the formal prescriptive variety fulfills the basic conditions of Ferguson's definition [of diglossia]...[...] Considering the difficulty encountered by vernacular speakers to acquire the standard, an understanding of those relationships appears to have broad educational significance. The teaching of Portuguese has traditionally meant imparting a prescriptive formal standard based on a literary register (Cunha 1985: 24) that is often at variance with the language with which students are familiar. As in a diglossic situation, vernacular speakers must learn to read and write in a dialect they neither speak nor fully understand, a circumstance that may have a bearing on the high dropout rate in elementary schools..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to Bagno (1999) the two variants coexist and intermingle quite seamlessly, but their status is not clear-cut. Brazilian Vernacular is still frowned upon by most grammarians and language teachers, with only remarkably few linguists championing its cause. Some of this minority, of which Bagno is an example, appeal to their readers by their ideas that grammarians would be detractors of the termed Brazilian Vernacular, by naming it a "corrupt" form of the "pure" standard, an attitude which they classify as "linguistic prejudice". Their arguments include the postulate that the Vernacular form simplifies some of the intricacies of standard Portuguese (verbal conjugation, pronoun handling, plural forms, etc.).</p>
<p>Bagno accuses the prejudice against the vernacular in what he terms the "8 Myths":</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a striking uniformity in Brazilian Portuguese</li>
<li>Nearly all Brazilians speak very poor Portuguese while in Portugal people speak it very well</li>
<li>Portuguese is extremely difficult</li>
<li>People that have had poor education can't speak anything correctly</li>
<li>In the state of Maranhão people speak a better Portuguese than elsewhere in Brazil</li>
<li>We should speak as closely as possible to the written language</li>
<li>The knowledge of Grammar is essential to the correct and proper use of a language</li>
<li>To master Standard Portuguese is path to social promotion</li>
</ol>
<p>In opposition to the "myths", Bagno counters that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The uniformity of Brazilian Portuguese is just about what linguistics predicts for such a large country whose population has not generally been literate for centuries and which has experienced considerable foreign influence, that is, this uniformity is more apparent than real.</li>
<li>Brazilians speak Standard Portuguese poorly because, in fact, they speak a language that is sufficiently different from SP so that the latter sounds almost "foreign" to them. In terms of comparison, it is easier for many Brazilians to understand someone from a Spanish-speaking South American country than someone from Portugal because the spoken varieties of Portuguese on either side of the Atlantic have diverged to point of nearly being mutually unintelligible.</li>
<li>No language is difficult for those who speak it. Difficulty appears when two conditions are met: the standard language diverges from the vernacular and a speaker of the vernacular tries to learn the standard version. This divergence is the precise reason why spelling and grammar reforms happen every now and then.</li>
<li>People with less education can speak the vernacular or often several varieties of the vernacular, and they speak it well. They might, however, have trouble in speaking SP, but this is due to lack of experience rather than to any inherent deficiency in their linguistic mastery.</li>
<li>The people of Maranhão are not generally better than fellow Brazilians from other states in speaking SP, especially because that state is one of the poorest and has one of the lowest literacy rates.</li>
<li>It is the written language that must reflect the spoken and not vice versa: it is not the tail that wags the dog.</li>
<li>The knowledge of grammar is intuitive for those who speak their native languages. Problems arise when they begin to study the grammar of a foreign language.</li>
<li>Rich and influential people themselves often do not follow the grammatical rules of SP. SP is mostly a jewel for powerless middle-class careers (journalists, teachers, writers, actors, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether Bagno's points are valid or not is still open to debate (especially the solutions he recommends for the problems he identifies). Whereas some agree that he has captured the feelings of the Brazilians towards their own linguistic situation well, his book (<i>Linguistic Prejudice: What it Is, How To Do</i>) has been heavily criticized by some linguists and grammarians, due to his daring and unorthodox claims, sometimes even regarded as based on biased or unproven claims.</p>
