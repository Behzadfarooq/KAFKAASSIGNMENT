<p>Rickey was born outside of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth%2C_Ohio_1165.html" title="Portsmouth, Ohio">Portsmouth, Ohio</a>, the son of Frank W. and Emily Brown Rickey. He was a catcher on the baseball team at <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_7b0f.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan">Ohio Wesleyan</a> and, in 1903, signed a professional contract with <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terre_Haute%2C_Indiana_349e.html" title="Terre Haute, Indiana">Terre Haute, Indiana</a> of the Class B Central League, making his professional debut on June 20, 1903. However, Rickey was not ready for the rigors of the tough Central League and was assigned to LeMars, Iowa of the Class D Iowa-South Dakota League. Later, he spent two seasons in the major leagues, debuting as a <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Browns_f5db.html" title="St. Louis Browns">St. Louis Brown</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905_in_sports.html" title="1905 in sports">1905</a>. He hit fairly well in 1906, hitting two home runs in the same game on August 6, but fielded poorly, a fatal flaw for a catcher. Sold to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Highlanders_06c8.html" title="New York Highlanders">New York Highlanders</a> in 1907, Rickey could neither hit nor field while with the club, and his <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a> dropped below .200. One opposing team stole 13 bases while Rickey was behind the plate, setting a record which still stands a century later. Rickey also injured his throwing arm and retired as a player after just one year. (During this period, Rickey also spent two seasons--1904 and 1905--coaching baseball and football and teaching at <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_College_67b7.html" title="Allegheny College">Allegheny College</a> in Pennsylvania.)</p>

<p>Rickey then spent several years at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a> as a coach and also earned a <a href="../../../l/l/2E/LL.B._4b57.html" title="LL.B.">LL.B.</a>. For his undergraduate degree, he attended <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware%2C_Ohio_93b3.html" title="Delaware, Ohio">Delaware, Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>He returned to the big leagues in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913_in_sports.html" title="1913 in sports">1913</a>, as a front office executive with the Browns. He was responsible for signing young <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Sisler_a69a.html" title="George Sisler">George Sisler</a>. Rickey became the team's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager_%28baseball%29.html" title="Manager (baseball)">manager</a> for the final 12 games of the season, and managed the team for 2 more full seasons. But the Browns finished under .500 both years and no one was surprised when Rickey was fired in 1916 when new ownership took over the club.</p>
<p>Rickey served in the military for a few years, then returned to St. Louis in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919_in_sports.html" title="1919 in sports">1919</a>, this time with the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">Cardinals</a>, to become team president and manager. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920_in_baseball.html" title="1920 in baseball">1920</a>, Rickey gave up the team presidency to the Cards' new majority owner, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Breadon_b0aa.html" title="Sam Breadon">Sam Breadon</a>. He then led the Cardinals on the field for another five seasons, before his firing early in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925_in_sports.html" title="1925 in sports">1925</a> season.</p>
<p>His 6+ years as a manager were relatively mediocre, although the team posted winning records from 1921-23 and Rickey wisely invested in several minor league baseball clubs, using them to develop future talent for the Cardinals major league roster. He was 43 years old, had been a player, manager and executive in the Major Leagues and had shown no indication whatsoever that he would ever deserve to belong in the Baseball Hall of Fame. But even though he was not the first <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_manager.html" title="General manager"><i>general manager</i></a> in Major League Baseball history — his title was <i>business manager</i> — Rickey (as inventor of the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm_system.html" title="Farm system">farm system</a>) would come to embody the position of the baseball operations executive who mastered scouting, player acquisition and development and business affairs — the definition of the modern GM.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogers_Hornsby_8f7a.html" title="Rogers Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a> replaced Rickey to become a player-manager, and in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926_in_sports.html" title="1926 in sports">1926</a>, his first full year as manager, he led the Cardinals to their first <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> championship.

<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930_in_sports.html" title="1930 in sports">1930</a>, Rickey's Cardinals, known as the "<a href="../../../g/a/s/Gashouse_Gang_1e11.html" title="Gashouse Gang">Gashouse Gang</a>", were the class of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a>. They won 101 games in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931_in_sports.html" title="1931 in sports">1931</a> and won the World Series in seven games. The star of the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931_World_Series_1813.html" title="1931 World Series">Series</a> that year was rookie <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepper_Martin_12c4.html" title="Pepper Martin">Pepper Martin</a>, one of the first Cardinal stars that came from Branch's minor league system. Soon, other minor league graduates joined the team, among them future hall of famers <a href="../../../d/i/z/Dizzy_Dean_d3cf.html" title="Dizzy Dean">Dizzy Dean</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Medwick_f4fa.html" title="Joe Medwick">Joe Medwick</a>, and Dean's brother <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Dean_%28baseball%29_45f7.html" title="Paul Dean (baseball)">Paul</a>. The Deans and Medwick were integral parts of the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934_in_sports.html" title="1934 in sports">1934</a> Cardinals, who won the franchise's third World Series title.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis_737d.html" title="Kenesaw Mountain Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> was concerned that Rickey's minor league system was going to ruin the game of baseball by destroying most existing minor league teams, and he twice released over 70 Cardinal minor leaguers in attempts to stop what he perceived to be a <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover-up.html" title="Cover-up">cover-up</a>. Despite Judge Landis' best efforts, however, Rickey's minor league system stayed in existence, and similar systems were adopted by every major league team within a few years. Arguably, the farm system <i>saved</i> the minor leagues, by keeping them <i>necessary</i> after the television age began and minor league attendance figures declined.</p>
<p>Rickey continued to develop the Cardinals up until the early 1940s. In his final year at St. Louis, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942_in_sports.html" title="1942 in sports">1942</a>, the Cardinals had their best season in franchise history, winning 106 games and the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942_World_Series_ff89.html" title="1942 World Series">World Series</a> title. The team was led by a new crop of players developed by the Cardinals, two of whom, <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enos_Slaughter_3187.html" title="Enos Slaughter">Enos Slaughter</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Musial_59e8.html" title="Stan Musial">Stan Musial</a>, became <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Hall of Famers</a>; and several others, among them future <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_award_227d.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player award">MVP</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Marion_141e.html" title="Marty Marion">Marty Marion</a>, who were among the best at their position during their eras. Even their manager <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Southworth_71e8.html" title="Billy Southworth">Billy Southworth</a> was a product of their farm system.</p>
<p>Rickey was a good friend of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Manager_%28baseball%29_4a5f.html" title="General Manager (baseball)">general manager</a> <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_MacPhail_4c14.html" title="Larry MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a>, himself a sound baseball man. MacPhail was drafted into the army to serve in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> after the 1942 season, and the Dodgers hired Branch Rickey to replace him as President and GM, ending a tenure of over two decades with the Cardinals.</p>
<p>Branch continued being an innovator in his time with Brooklyn. He was responsible for the first full time <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_training.html" title="Spring training">spring training</a> facility, in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vero_Beach%2C_Florida_2fdb.html" title="Vero Beach, Florida">Vero Beach, Florida</a>, and encouraged the use of now-commonplace tools such as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_cage.html" title="Batting cage">batting cage</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitching_machine.html" title="Pitching machine">pitching machines</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_helmets.html" title="Batting helmets">batting helmets</a>. While with the Dodgers, his son, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Rickey_Jr._6b02.html" title="Branch Rickey Jr.">Branch Jr.</a>, was the team's farm director.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Rickey_9adb.html" title="Edit section: Breaking the color barrier">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Breaking the color barrier</span></h2>
<p>Rickey's most memorable act with the Dodgers, however, involved breaking <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_color_line.html" title="Baseball color line">baseball's color barrier</a>, which had been in place since the mid-1880s, not as a written rule, but merely a policy. This policy had continued under a succession of baseball leaders, including Landis, who was openly opposed to integrating Major League Baseball for what he regarded as legitimate reasons. Landis died in 1944, and that fact along with changing public attitudes presented an opportunity. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_sports.html" title="1945 in sports">1945</a>, Rickey signed <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Robinson_5b0c.html" title="Jackie Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> to a minor league contract. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">October 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_sports.html" title="1945 in sports">1945</a>, it was announced that Robinson would play with the Dodgers' <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_League_5797.html" title="International League">International League</a> affiliate in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Royals_813f.html" title="Montreal Royals">Royals</a>, for the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_in_sports.html" title="1946 in sports">1946</a> season. He would end up as the league's batting champion, and led the Royals to a dominant league championship.</p>

<p>People noted that Rickey's determination to desegregate Major League Baseball was born out of a combination of idealism and astute business sense. The idealism was at least partially rooted in an incident involving a team for which Rickey worked early on. An <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> player was extremely upset at being refused accommodation at the hotel where the team stayed because of his race. The business element was based on the fact that the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_Leagues_54ee.html" title="Negro Leagues">Negro Leagues</a> had numerous star athletes, and logically, the first Major League team to hire them would get first pick of the players at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Five days before the start of the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947_in_sports.html" title="1947 in sports">1947</a> season, Rickey purchased Jackie Robinson's contract from the minor leagues. Amid much fanfare, Jackie debuted for the Dodgers on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, becoming the first African-American to play in modern major league baseball. Rickey's "Great Experiment", as it was termed, turned out to be a fantastic success. Robinson was baseball's first <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Rookie_of_the_Year_award_8153.html" title="MLB Rookie of the Year award">rookie of the year</a>, and while he was often jeered by opposing baseball players, managers, and fans, he became extremely popular with the American public. His success became the crowning achievement of Rickey's illustrious career. His Dodgers would make the Series that year, losing in 7 games to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. But Rickey's vision and action had set the stage for the previously mediocre Dodgers to be contenders for decades to come. And it opened the door for other innovative leaders like <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veeck_6016.html" title="Bill Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> of the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, who integrated the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Rickey continued to run the Dodgers until he resigned in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950_in_sports.html" title="1950 in sports">1950</a>, with owner <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_O%27Malley_e42c.html" title="Walter O'Malley">Walter O'Malley</a>, in some ways, forcing him out. He was not out of a job long, however, as he signed with the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> to become their general manager. Unlike his years with St. Louis and with Brooklyn, his tenure with the Pirates was fairly uneventful. The Pirates were a struggling organization that lost 100 games in 3 consecutive years during his tenure, and he stepped down from the team in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955_in_sports.html" title="1955 in sports">1955</a>, but not before drafting and signing Roberto Clemente. It would only be after he left that the Pirates would become contenders again. During his tenure, Rickey, along with three Pittsburgh-area businessmen, funded the incorporation of <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fellowship_of_Christian_Athletes_39d6.html" title="Fellowship of Christian Athletes">Fellowship of Christian Athletes</a>, which is now the largest interdenominational school-based Christian sports organization in the United States.</p>
<p>Rickey returned to baseball in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_sports.html" title="1959 in sports">1959</a>, this time as president of a proposed third major league, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_League_cc75.html" title="Continental League">Continental League</a>. Major League Baseball was forced to intervene, and made an agreement with Rickey to disband the league in exchange for expansion of the existing leagues.</p>
