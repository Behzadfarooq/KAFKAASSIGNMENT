A young Bradley Nowell performs with his band.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Music was an integral part of Nowell's upbringing. Nowell's mother, Nancy Nowell-Watilo, was a musician who had <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_pitch.html" title="Perfect pitch">perfect pitch</a>, and Nowell's father, James Nowell, was fond of <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a> and often played guitar during family gatherings. On holidays, Bradley Nowell would often play guitar and sing with his father and uncles for hours. Brad was often able to play a song on the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> after hearing the song only once.</p>
<p>When Nowell was ten years old his parents divorced. After the divorce, Nowell lived with his mother in <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_County%2C_California_19f9.html" title="Orange County, California">Orange County</a> for four years. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, he took up residence in <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Beach%2C_California_8760.html" title="Long Beach, California">Long Beach, California</a> with his father. In contrast to the wealthier and largely white suburb of Orange County, Long Beach had an ethnically diverse population that included whites, <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African Americans</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanics</a>, and <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_American_1915.html" title="Asian American">Southeast Asians</a>. Because Long Beach offered lower rent than nearby <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, by the 1980s the city had cultivated a thriving underground art community, including a music scene that nurtured punk, surf, and hip-hop music — three genres Nowell would later incorporate into his musical <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repertoire.html" title="Repertoire">repertoire</a>.</p>
<p>Though Bradley was by many accounts an intelligent person, he did not enjoy school. It has been reported that Nowell often convinced his sister, Kellie, to do the homework that didn't interest him. "He was probably twice as intelligent as I am", Kellie was quoted as saying, "but he just wasn't real school-minded". Eventually, Nowell was diagnosed with <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder.html" title="Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder">ADD</a> and was prescribed <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritalin.html" title="Ritalin">Ritalin</a>.</p>
<p>When Nowell was eleven years old he accompanied his father on a trip to the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Islands_9199.html" title="Virgin Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. This trip was significant in the life and career of Nowell because it was his introduction to reggae music, which would remain a lifelong favorite of his and would be incorporated into the music for which Nowell would later become famous. Shortly after returning from the Virgin Islands, Nowell was given his first guitar. Nowell is said to have taught himself the reggae style on his guitar and to have practiced that style every day.</p>
<p>Shortly after becoming interested in reggae music, Nowell also became interested in <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop music</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a> music, which he would later combine with reggae music to create his signature sound. At the age of thirteen, Nowell founded his first band, which he named "Hogan's Heroes". It dissolved shortly after its formation, however.</p>
<p>Despite his initial dislike of compulsory education, by 1986 Nowell had become an honor-roll student at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. After graduation from Wilson High School, Nowell enrolled at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Santa_Cruz_b9d8.html" title="University of California, Santa Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, then at <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_University%2C_Long_Beach_67aa.html" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a> where he pursued a degree in finance. One semester short of obtaining his <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">Bachelor's degree</a>, Nowell decided to leave college in pursuit of a professional music career.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, Nowell founded Sublime with bassist <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Wilson_%28bassist%29_5443.html" title="Eric Wilson (bassist)">Eric Wilson</a> and drummer <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Gaugh_fe30.html" title="Bud Gaugh">Bud Gaugh</a>, whom he had met while attending <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Santa_Cruz_b9d8.html" title="University of California, Santa Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>. Sublime eventually became one of the most popular bands in Southern <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. Specifically, they were the most popular band on the campus of <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_University%2C_Long_Beach_67aa.html" title="California State University, Long Beach">Cal State Long Beach</a>, where they often played at parties and bars in exchange for alcohol.</p>
<p>Around <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Nowell and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Happoldt_e082.html" title="Michael Happoldt">Michael "Miguel" Happoldt</a> created <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skunk_Records_7ad5.html" title="Skunk Records">Skunk Records</a>, the label for which Sublime's early recordings were produced and distributed. Skunk Records was named for Sublime's combination Ska and Punk genre, and the names of the two were fused into "Skunk". (Skunk is believed to be a reference to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>.) The band's demo tapes were later sold at shows and local record stores. A few years later, Sublime produced its first studio recording, which resulted in the popular cassette tape called <i><a href="../../../j/a/h/Jah_Won%27t_Pay_the_Bills_0ef1.html" title="Jah Won't Pay the Bills">Jah Won't Pay the Bills</a></i> and released it in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.</p>
<p>As Nowell prepared to tour with the new material, he found that Gaugh was battling a drug problem. Gaugh soon decided to check himself into a drug rehabilitation center. Rather than tour without Gaugh, the trio decided to focus on recording their music in the studio.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, <i><a href="../../../4/0/_/40_Oz._to_Freedom_307e.html" title="40 Oz. to Freedom">40 Oz. to Freedom</a></i> was released. Drummers Marshall Goodman and Kelly Vargas temporarily covered for Gaugh. Sixty-thousand copies were distributed and sold from the trunk of Nowell's car. Despite growing popularity in Southern California, Sublime still had not landed a record deal with a major label. (Around this same timeframe, Nowell teamed up with longtime friend <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Stefani_f1e7.html" title="Gwen Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>, of fellow Southern California ska band <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Doubt_c58c.html" title="No Doubt">No Doubt</a>, to record the single "Saw Red". The single was eventually released on Sublime's <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbin%27_the_Hood_579e.html" title="Robbin' the Hood">Robbin' the Hood</a> album.)</p>
<p>Frustrated by rejection of the major <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_company.html" title="Record company">record companies</a>, Nowell descended into a two-year <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> "experiment". Nowell claimed that his heroin use was justified, claiming it aided with his artistic creativity, thereby increasing the likelihood that his material would attract the attention of a major label.</p>
<p>About a year later, <a href="../../../t/a/z/Tazy_Phillipz_0381.html" title="Tazy Phillipz">Tazy Phillipz</a> took a copy of <i>40 Oz to Freedom</i> to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_station.html" title="Radio station">radio station</a> <a href="../../../k/r/o/KROQ_28b1.html" title="KROQ">KROQ</a>, requesting that Sublime's "Date Rape" be added to the playlist. Soon after, MCA records picked up <i>40 Oz. to Freedom</i> for nationwide distribution. The album soon entered the Billboard charts.</p>
<p>Attention from a major label did not curb Nowell's drug use. His use of heroin increased. Nowell's struggles with addiction were occasionally reflected in his artistic work. The song Pool Shark is one of the most obvious examples of Nowell's drug dependency being referred to in his music: "Take it away but I want more and more/One day I'm gunna lose the war".</p>
<p>In February of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Sublime returned to the studio to record the bulk of their self-titled major label debut album. Production was done by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Leary_115b.html" title="Paul Leary">Paul Leary</a> (producer of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcy_Playground_a929.html" title="Marcy Playground">Marcy Playground</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_Puppets_2e33.html" title="Meat Puppets">Meat Puppets</a>) of the <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butthole_Surfers_244e.html" title="Butthole Surfers">Butthole Surfers</a> at <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Nelson_7599.html" title="Willie Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>'s Pedernales Studio in Austin, Texas. At this time, Nowell's addiction was about as bad as it had ever been. He spent about four thousand dollars on heroin that month while recording the tracks. Leary often feared that by putting out this record he would be exploiting a junkie. Nowell was flown home early from the sessions due to the extent of his drug use.</p>

Bradley Nowell's headstone.</div>

</div>
<p>Three days after Nowell's marriage to Troy Dendekker, Sublime embarked on a five-day tour through California cities in preparation for a summer tour of Europe. The European tour was intended as a means of promotion of their upcoming major label debut album. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, before checking out of San Francisco's Ocean View Motel, Sublime's drummer Gaugh, who was sharing a room with him at the time, found Nowell's body lying on the bed with his feet still on the floor. Nowell had died of a fatal heroin overdose. Nowell's last performance took place at the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Theater_722f.html" title="Phoenix Theater">Phoenix Theater</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petaluma%2C_California_c1b4.html" title="Petaluma, California">Petaluma, California</a>. This performance became known as the "Play Nice In the Pit" show.</p>
<p>Nowell was <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cremation.html" title="Cremation">cremated</a> and his ashes were distributed over the water of his favorite <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfing.html" title="Surfing">surf</a> spot, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfside%2C_Seal_Beach%2C_California_001c.html" title="Surfside, Seal Beach, California">Surfside</a>. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster%2C_California_f0a9.html" title="Westminster, California">Westminster, California</a> in his memory. At the <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorial_service.html" title="Memorial service">memorial service</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Bradley Nowell's father, Jim Nowell, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Brad will always live for me in his son, Jake, and we can all seek relief from our grief by loving and nurturing the son he gave to us. Brad touched many people with his caring personality and musical genius and we are all lucky to have had him in our lives. Men who have lived longer have achieved less and I am content that he is now at peace".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Troy Nowell, Bradley's widow, has said that she believes he achieved all he hoped to achieve in his life. She said that Bradley Nowell had wanted to be a father, reconnect with his family, to have a band that achieved "glory", and record a wonderful album <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Agaric40/info/lifeafterdeath.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.tripod.com/~Agaric40/info/lifeafterdeath.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. According to Troy, Bradley Nowell did indeed achieve all of these things in his 28 years.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Nowell's death, fellow Southern California band <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Doubt_c58c.html" title="No Doubt">No Doubt</a> headlined a "cautionary" <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_concert.html" title="Benefit concert">benefit concert</a> in tribute to Nowell. Nowell's widow and the various bands who performed wanted to make it clear that they were not glamorizing the way that Nowell died, but that they wanted to celebrate his life as well as establish a college fund for his year-old son, Jakob.</p>

The cover of Sublime's major label debut album.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In light of Nowell's death, record executives considered not releasing Sublime's major label debut album. After some debate, the album was eventually released, though the album's original title, "Killin' It", was substituted for an eponymous title. Sublime's major label debut album <i><a href="../../../s/u/b/Sublime_%28album%29.html" title="Sublime (album)">Sublime</a></i> was released on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>.</p>
<p>By 1997, the album entered Billboard's Top 20, and its first single, the largely acoustic <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a>-influenced "<a href="../../../w/h/a/What_I_Got_8369.html" title="What I Got">What I Got</a>", soon became the number one song on the Modern Rock chart. Throughout <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, the album produced three more radio hits: the reggae-tinged ballad "<a href="../../../s/a/n/Santeria_%28song%29.html" title="Santeria (song)">Santeria</a>", the anti-prostitution anthem song called "<a href="../../../w/r/o/Wrong_Way_5c35.html" title="Wrong Way">Wrong Way</a>" and the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Gershwin_e01d.html" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>-inspired dance song "<a href="../../../d/o/i/Doin%27_Time_f759.html" title="Doin' Time">Doin' Time</a>". The accompanying <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_videos.html" title="Music videos">music videos</a> from <i>40 Oz. To Freedom</i> for radio hits including Santeria, What I Got, Wrong Way, and Badfish received heavy rotation on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>, with previously filmed footage of Nowell performing live interspersed into the video.</p>
<p>To the surprise of many, Sublime became arguably the most successful American rock act of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. The album <i>Sublime</i> has since sold over 5 million copies.</p>

<p>While on tour in the mid-1990s, Nowell met Troy Dendekker. Dendekker grew up in Southern California, in a home with a drug addicted mother and a father who was also a drug user and a member of a motorcycle gang. In an interview, Dendekker, who has considered a career as a drug and alcohol counselor, stated that she loves addicts because they are ultimately kind people. Dendekker also said that she does not have anger towards her parents regarding the way she was brought up because, as she phrased it, her parents were "real".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> magazine, Dendekker said that Nowell was very happy and pleasant to be around when he was under the influence of substances, but that when he wasn't under the influence Nowell could be very difficult. The goal, Dendekker said, was to try to have Nowell be as happy sober as he was when he was high. To that end, Nowell attempted <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detoxification.html" title="Detoxification">detoxification</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_rehabilitation.html" title="Drug rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation</a> several times, but such treatments usually had short-lived success which usually disappointed Nowell's family and friends. Bandmate Bud Gaugh tried to be supportive of Nowell in his recovery, and occasionally in his usage. Gaugh has said he tried to be Nowell's "conscience", and in some cases Gaugh tried to be Nowell's "drug buddy."</p>
<p>In September of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Nowell and Dendekker conceived a child. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, Dendekker gave birth to their son, Jakob James Nowell. In an attempt to better fulfill his compounding responsibilities as both husband and father, Nowell attempted yet again to overcome his drug dependency. As history would bear out, Nowell, once again, was not successful.</p>

<p>Louie, or "Lou Dog" as he was often called, was Bradley Nowell's pet <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmatian_%28dog%29.html" title="Dalmatian (dog)">Dalmatian</a> who became something of a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mascot.html" title="Mascot">mascot</a> for the band Sublime. Lou dog was often allowed to wander the stage during live Sublime concert performances. Louie was also often featured on the cover of Sublime albums, and was often referred to in the lyrics of Sublime songs. The first lyrics Nowell sings on Sublime's major label debut album are, "We took this trip to Garden Grove/It smelled like Lou Dog inside the van". And in Sublime's most successful radio track, <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_I_Got_8369.html" title="What I Got">What I Got</a>, Nowell sings, "Livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane." Lou Dog was named in tribute to Bradley's grandfather, Louie Nowell. He also mentions his dalmatian in <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_I_Got_8369.html" title="What I Got">What I Got</a> other times, like in the lyric "I Got a Dalmatian, and I can still get high" as well as "I don't cry when my dog runs away." The song <a href="../../../d/o/i/Doin%27_Time_f759.html" title="Doin' Time">Doin' Time</a> also refers to Lou Dog in the line "Me and Louie run to the party."</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Lou Dog disappeared for a week. In the video <i>Sublime — Stories, Tales, Lies, &amp; Exaggerations</i>, Troy Nowell (Bradley Nowell's widow) says that for the week during which Lou Dog was lost, Nowell spent a great deal of time lying on the couch crying in response to the loss of his dog. Lou Dog was eventually returned to Nowell, who, in response to the situation, later covered the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camper_Van_Beethoven_0066.html" title="Camper Van Beethoven">Camper Van Beethoven</a> song "The Day That Lassie Went To The Moon" and changed it to "Lou Dog Went to the Moon"&#160;; this song is available on the Nowell <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">bootleg</a> "Firecracker Lounge" <a href="http://www.rhenning.com/firecracker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rhenning.com/firecracker.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/limpdonut/Firecracker.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/limpdonut/Firecracker.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. While Lou was missing Nowell also recorded this song to his home <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answering_machine.html" title="Answering machine">answering machine</a> as a sort of audio lost dog poster.</p>
<p>Following Nowell's 1996 death, Lou Dog was cared for by Skunk Records co-founder Michael "Miguel" Happoldt. Lou Dog died on September 17, 2001.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that he died before his band Sublime became famous, Nowell has become a pop culture icon arguably in the tradition of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Cobain_5fa1.html" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, to whom Nowell is occasionally compared. <a href="http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~rmoyer62/425/img/home1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~rmoyer62/425/img/home1.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. In the August 12, 1996, <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Magazine_89f3.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i> article "When the Music's Over," Christopher John Farley wrote, "Nowell might have been to <a href="../../../s/k/a/Ska.html" title="Ska">ska</a> what Kurt Cobain was to <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge.html" title="Grunge">grunge</a> a big, blazing talent who introduces the mainstream to a new musical world. Nowell, however, played the Cobain role a bit too well, and Sublime, like <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>, will be best remembered as a band with history-making potential that perished before its full potential or, in Sublime's case, before most Americans had even heard of it."</p>
<p>The comparison of Nowell to Cobain might be more substantial than it would at first appear. Nowell had stated that Kurt Cobain was an inspiration whom he aspired to emulate. Nowell occasionally justified his heroin use by reminding family and friends that Kurt Cobain achieved critical acclaim and commercial success despite his drug use. Further, Nowell is said to have believed heroin use was a key ingredient in Cobain's creativity and success. As justification for his own heroin use, Nowell occasionally indicated that he believed drug use would aid him in his musical creativity as well.</p>
<p>Troy Nowell, Bradley Nowell's widow, would later blame Bradley Nowell's childhood <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritalin.html" title="Ritalin">Ritalin</a> use for predisposing Bradley Nowell to heroin dependency in his adulthood. Years previous, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtney_Love_84e7.html" title="Courtney Love">Courtney Love</a>, widow of Kurt Cobain, made the same comment with regard to the addiction of her own husband. As a child Kurt Cobain was placed on Ritalin for the same reason as Bradley Nowell. As children both men were diagnosed as suffering from <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder.html" title="Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder">ADD</a>, for which Ritalin was deemed suitable treatment. <a href="http://www.cchr.org/index.cfm/5319" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cchr.org/index.cfm/5319" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://kaollasbananas.tripod.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://kaollasbananas.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Both Nowell's and Cobain's parents divorced during Nowell's and Cobain's respective childhoods. Both Nowell and Cobain seem to have been greatly impacted by the breakdown of their parents' marriages. There has been speculation that both men suffered a lifelong guilt about the divorce of their parents.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../v/h/1/Vh1.html" title="Vh1">Vh1</a>'s <i><a href="../../../b/e/h/Behind_The_Music_8171.html" title="Behind The Music">Behind the Music: Sublime</a></i> music journalist Heidi Siegmund Cuda, author of <i>Bradley Nowell: Crazy Fool</i>, predicted future critical praise for Bradley Nowell, stating, "People <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_critic.html" title="Music critic">critically</a> don't think of Brad in terms of the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrisons</a> and the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Cobain_5fa1.html" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobains</a>, but they will."</p>
