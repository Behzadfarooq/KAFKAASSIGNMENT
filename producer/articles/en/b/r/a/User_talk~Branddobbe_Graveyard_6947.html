<dd>Sniff. Did you read my beautiful examples of how to use the verbs lay and lie? Such artistry! So you don't think that the new introduction is better? All it really claims is that if you write any of the "incorrect" phrases in an essay you'll get it marked as wrong (which I believe is true). It clearly points out that language evolves. I thought the introduction was fair and balanced. But I wont nag you any further.

<p>Hello, why do you put in two versions of your images. The syntax [[image:bla.jpg|thumb|Text]] allows you to automatically generate a smaller image version (width:180px) and [[image:bla.jpg|thumb|300px|Text]] allows you to generate one with a width of 300px.

<p>Ack ack! Another disruption!</p>
<p>Anyway, I quite like the table you've set up on the individual Star Trek episode pages. My question on the talk page was just one of curiosity. People have created simple messages that can be cut and pasted onto "collective" pages like episode lists. For example, the bottom of the <a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_067d.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> article features a table created by the simple code <b>{{msg:spaceodyssey}}</b>. Some of these messages are listed at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediaWiki_custom_elements_d239.html" title="Wikipedia:MediaWiki custom elements">Wikipedia:MediaWiki_custom_elements</a>. I'm not quite sure how this is done, but I think it might be useful for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_TNG_episodes_1414.html" title="List of Star Trek TNG episodes">List of Star Trek TNG episodes</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, I noticed your page in [www.wikisexsite.com wiki sex site], and thought to greet you. At the moment we are in three working there. Not much, but better than nothing. Oh we also have two stories on the way!</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;I just came by your user page on the Norwegian wiki. Thought I should just drop a couple of comments.<br />
&#160;&#160;In your picture text, you have written "Jeg" which translates to "I". It would be more appropriate to write "Meg" (in english: "me") or "Dette er et bilde av meg." (in English: "This is a picture of me").<br />
&#160;&#160;Another comment is on the word "unnskyld", which quite correctly means "I'm sorry". But used like that, it would be more appropriate to use the word "Beklager". Whereas "unnskyld" is more like "I'm sorry I did that to you", "beklager" is better to use when trying to say "I'm sorry I can't help you out".</p>

<p>I'm sorry if I was too snippy with my edits to change "Disneyland Park" to Disneyland. You're right that there are a couple of places on the Disney web site itself which refers to the place as "Disneyland Park"; but there are many more places which don't have the "Park" in the name, so I'm inclined to believe the true name of the park is simply "Disneyland" but that even WDC is confused as to the proper name to use.

<p>where you noted <b>copy edit one section; still needs more work</b>. Thank you SO much for your work to date and yes, it certainly does!</p>
<p>It was started <i>(by me I think)</i> because she was referenced in some other articles I was working on. I took pieces of info from various places, her CV, history of bisexual movement, things googled, etc. intending to distill what was already too much data down to to the essential facts. But never had time to work on it.</p>
<p>Then another person came along and said that s/he would take over as a first major project and did make a start . . . by adding <b>even more</b> data that s/he found <i>(much which was redundant, but that was intended to be combined and pruned into shape)</i>. But s/he too was unable to find the time to work on it.</p>
<p>So consequentially, it's in a terrible state of disrepair. It's much, much to long, has repeated and extraneous stuff, etc., etc. I would be SO happy if you wanted to continue and get the thing into shape.</p>

She is in her late 40's the single <i>(divorced? don't know if she was officially married)</i> mother of one son who just graduated from college. She is a a Social Worker and Councilor by training, <i>(don't know where her degree is from or precisely what in but could try to find out if important)</i> so she is properly credentialed for the work she does around those issuers (report for City of NY Delivery of Health Services to Bisexual Community, working with <a href="../../../g/l/a/GLAAD_9625.html" title="GLAAD">GLAAD</a> to make Information Packets, et. at.)<a href="http://www.bialogue.org/Pages/InfoPackets/MentalHealth.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bialogue.org/Pages/InfoPackets/MentalHealth.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lambert's claims to notability are that she is one of the people who after about twelve (12) years of dogged work <a href="http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> got the major NYC <i>"Gay"</i> institutions (<i>Pride Parade/Festival, Community Center &amp; Film Festival)</i> to acknowledge the existence/validity of and to change their names to include the entire LGBT community, <i>(which was pretty ridiculous, particularly in the case of the Parade/Festival since it were created by a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenda_Howard_1651.html" title="Brenda Howard">bisexual person</a>, who as it changed from a rag-tag, militant, street activism type thing to the relatively slick Corporate &amp; NYC Tourism Board production it is today <a href="http://www.hopinc.org/home/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hopinc.org/home/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> found herself and her community "erased" from the entire event)</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to being important in and of itself to the people who lived in NYC, this work Lambert participated in is quite significant because many other in the region <i>(possibly beyond?)</i> looked to the NYC Gay institutions to set the tone of acceptance in their own communities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also some people who were members of/leaders of these same <i>"Gay"</i> groups have since gone on to work in/head some of the big national LGBT rights groups, etc. So they then took with them these lessons of tolerance and inclusion that were so laboriously and painfully learned <i>(or in the case of some people forcibly taught . . . dare I say 'rammed down their throats?')</i> in NYC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In recent years Lambert has gone on to expand her activism to a National (as a senior organizer with <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bialogue.html" title="Bialogue">Bialogue</a> which now frequently partners with <a href="../../../b/i/n/BiNet_USA_4c87.html" title="BiNet USA">BiNet USA</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/c/BRC_d80f.html" title="BRC">BRC</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/a/GLAAD_9625.html" title="GLAAD">GLAAD</a>, Gay and Lesbian Task Force, <a href="../../../h/r/c/HRC_7127.html" title="HRC">HRC</a>, et. al) and international <i>(she started Bi Writers Association <a href="http://www.biwriters.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biwriters.org/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which now has an international membership)</i> and one of the first US LGBT Groups to this year endorse <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Day_Against_Homophobia_a46a.html" title="International Day Against Homophobia">International Day Against Homophobia</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An addition al minor point <i>(or maybe not so minor if you are a media person)</i> is that she was the first openly <i>"Out &amp; Proud"</i> Bisexual person to work on NYC's <i>"Gay"</i> TV programs and also produced what as far as is known, the first ever TV show for the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual_community.html" title="Bisexual community">Bisexual community</a> itself. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECyntWorkStuff_cd2b.html" title="User:CyntWorkStuff">CyntWorkStuff</a> 16:14, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ello there, Eric.. I'd rather like for you to give your input on the future of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_programs_1ac4.html" title="List of Sci Fi Channel (United States) programs">List of Sci Fi Channel (United States) programs</a> since it may invariably suffer the same fate as <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_Other_films_aired_on_The_SciFi_Channel_2865.html" title="User:DoctorWho42/Other films aired on The SciFi Channel">Other films aired on The SciFi Channel</a>, so please do so if time permits. It's a rather pertinant piece of information concerning the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_da7f.html" title="Sci Fi Channel (United States)">Sci Fi Channel</a>, so its demise will prolly compromise the article quite alot. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_7447.html" title="User:DoctorWho42">DrWho42</a> 22:16, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
