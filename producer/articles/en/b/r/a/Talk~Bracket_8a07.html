<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBracket_8a07.html" title="Edit section: Terminology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>Dear <a href="../../../l/c/_/User%7ELC_0e98.html" title="User:LC">LC</a>, This article is mainly about <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punctuation.html" title="Punctuation">punctuation</a> in English text.</p>
<p>Outside the programming context, "curly braces", or even "braces", is much more common than "curly brackets", but I do think the distinction is useful in programming contexts. I have attempted to deal with the diffrerences in usage in the associated article. I was concerned that readers accustomed to calling them "braces" would be confused by "brackets".</p>
<p>"Brackets" is basically a little-used synonym for "braces", and is given as such deep in the definitions in both the <i>Webster's Unabridged</i> and the <i>Webster's Collegiate</i>. The <i>Random House Unabridged</i> gives "brace" as a synonym for "bracket" only in the architectural sense. The <i>OED</i> does not give "bracket" as a synonym for "brace", nor do three college English handbooks I have lying around. My ancient <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i> includes both in a category called <i>Vinculum</i>, but since "hyphen" and "ox-yoke" are also in there, that isn't really data. The more modern <i>Random House Word Menu</i> carefully distinguishes "brackets" from "braces". Of course, none of these sources is particularly sophisticated about computer usage.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the "class of brackets" includes braces, as both this article and the punctuation article clearly state, but the class also includes parentheses, and even though I turned up a reference in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> to "curved brackets", again, hardly anyone actually calls parentheses "curved brackets".</p>
<p>See the Talk page under <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punctuation.html" title="Punctuation">Punctuation</a> for the sharply contrasted etymologies of "braces" and "bracket".<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></p>
<p>I'm likely wrong on this, but it's been my understanding that "brackets" in reference to the family of symbols is British English, and that in the US there's a distinction made between "parentheses" () "brackets" [] and "braces" {}. As far as I know, most Americans would never refer to parentheses as "brackets." 161.11.130.249 17:30, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a>, I saw your etymology, and thought it was great.&#160;:-) My intent wasn't to emphasize one term over another. I just wanted to fix two mistakes.</p>
<p>One mistake was that the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punctuation.html" title="Punctuation">Punctuation</a> page claimed the symbols were given <i>with their Unicode preferred names, where appropriate</i>, but then it didn't give the Unicode preferred name. So I fixed the name to match the claim. It would have been just as good to fix the claim instead. I was just trying to fix the contradiction.</p>
<p>The other mistake is the use of the redundant phrase <i>curly brace</i>. The standard terms are <i>curly bracket</i> (to distinguish from other types of brackets) and <i>brace</i> (of which there is only one type, so no need to distinguish). According to the dictionary used by the Associated Press, there is a <i>brace</i> but not a <i>curly brace</i>. The same is true in the Random House Websters Dictionary. And the same in the Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. And the same in the American Heritage Dictionary. And the same in the Unicode standard index (the one that lists multiple names for each symbol). I see from Google th at some people use the redundant term <i>curly brace</i>, but since it isn't in the standard references to which I have access, it appears to be slang rather than a standard term. I could have replaced the redundant <i>curly brace</i> with either <i>curly bracket</i> or <i>brace</i>, but I used both so I wouldn't offend anyone. Apparently unsuccessfully. &#160;:-) --<a href="../../../l/c/_/User%7ELC_0e98.html" title="User:LC">LC</a></p>
<p>I'm not offended. I've called them curly braces for 40 years, but what the heck? Braces is definitely more elegant. Funny that I gathered all that information without noticing my own term was out of line with the dictionaries! I think I'll stick with curly braces in my own life, but what you've done for the 'pedia is fine. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></p>
<hr />
<p>If <i>brace</i> and <i>bracket</i> don't actually share an etymology, the article really shouldn't say this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Presumably due to the similarity of the words brace and bracket (they share an etymology), many people casually treat brace as a synonym for bracket.</dd>

<p>I didn't want to change this without verifying that <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> was right. I found a variety of references that support the contrasting etymologies (e.g., <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bracket" class="external free" title="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bracket" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bracket</a> and <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=brace" class="external free" title="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=brace" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=brace</a>), and none that disagree. (If these words are related at all, it's via an as-yet-unattested PIE word for both arms and legs.) So, I changed this to be correct (s/they share an etymology/although they do not share an etymology/). <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcotron_30b7.html" title="User:Falcotron">Falcotron</a> 22:16, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>0x2329 and 0x232A are "LEFT-" and "RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET". 0x3008-300B are "LEFT" and "RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET", and the corresponding thing with double, in the "CJK Symbols and Punctuation" Unicode block. There's also the "presentation form for vertical" versions (which include the other kinds of brackets, among other things), which are in the "CJK Compatibility Forms" Unicode block.</p>
<p>They are, I think, used to enclose names of things in Chinese (but I'd have no idea, since I can't actually read Chinese). I'm not sure what the "lenticular brackets" are for, either. They're also unsuitable for normal brackets, since they're very wide.</p>
<p>I'm just surprised that I don't have a font with angle brackets (OS X has many unicode symbols, anyway). --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElektron_fd80.html" title="User:Elektron">Elektron</a> 05:29, 2004 Jun 14 (UTC)</p>

<dd>U+3008–U+300B, according to the Unicode standard, are unambiguously wide. So, they're probably just "fullwidth form" variants of the more familiar angle brackets, for use in text consisting mostly of ideographs. The standard doesn't mention the lenticular brackets at all, outside of the code charts. They, and the wide angle brackets, are probably included in Unicode for compatibility with earlier asian character sets. - <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">G↭a⇅a</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 05:07, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Ancient Chinese, I'm told, didn't have&#160;: or&#160;! or , or&#160;? (that was borrowed). Lenticular brackets are used in (Hong Kong) Chinese newspapers, when I checked a couple days ago, so it definitely has nothing to do with earlier character sets. There's probably some CJK reference somewhere that says what it means. --<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElektron_fd80.html" title="User:Elektron">Elektron</a> 07:36, 2004 Jun 18 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd like to know why the Unicode Angle Brakets appear in grey color in the article.</p>

<p>I'm removing vinculum from the main part of the article, because, well, it is a single object that does not bracket text. It does not require the sort of pairing that brackets do. It just happens to "bracket" expressions or groups of symbols in mathematical usage.

<p>The discussion on use of brackets in computer languages would be highly misleading to someone who didn't already know about the subject. It should be either (a) more complete, or (b) more obviously nothing more than a random survey of examples. Wording like "... are used to..." makes it sound like these are universal, and especially common, uses of brackets.</p>
<p>In the case of function arguments, this is true. But using parens to bound lists is pretty much restricted to the Lisp family, while many other languages use brackets for the same purpose (and braces for associative arrays). Square brackets are no more ubiquitous in regexps than parens or braces (and similarly for shell patterns). Brackets may not be as common as braces for blocks (the Smalltalk family vs. the C family), but they're not negligible.</p>
<p>And the most common use of parentheses in computer languages is completely ignored--grouping subexpressions: "(2 + 3) * 4", "ASSERT((foo&lt;bar, baz&gt;(qux)))", "(1, 2), 3", the parens around test expressions in C control statements, etc.</p>
<p>Also, some languages use other symbols essentially as brackets, with the same character serving as "left" and "right" (see "| i |" in Smalltalk, similar to "|2|" in math).</p>
<p>And it's a little strange to not even mention how braces are used in CSS, and then use CSS braces as an example a few lines later.</p>
<p>Finally, it's strange that a handful of these uses appear in the general discussion above. For example, under "Types of brackets": "In computer programming, curly brackets sometimes denote the beginning and ending of a sequence of statements or define a scope." <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcotron_30b7.html" title="User:Falcotron">Falcotron</a> 07:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the internet age, brackets [ ] and { } are used in nicknames by <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadomasochism.html" title="Sadomasochism">SM</a> people to show so-called "ownership". I am tempted to add something about it at the end of the article, but SM is always a controversial thing (and surprising in an article of this kind, I suppose), and I am no expert on this, so I am still hesitant to mention it. Would it be appropriate to mention this use of brackets in the article, along with their use in mathematics, sport and law? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Elf_fe05.html" title="User:Blue Elf">Blue Elf</a> 23:08, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it's actually a widespread practice (and the different kinds of brackets have different well-understood meanings), I don't think it is <i>inappropriate</i> as such. However, as with internet culture in general, I would be wary of "canonicalizing" a convention that may only be in use in a few BDSM forums/chatrooms and not in others, however much the particpants that use it may consider it standard. I therefore think we should insist on explicit sourcing for such information. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 14:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I speculate that in the United States, the unqualified word "brackets" normally refers to [] and "parentheses" refers t (), but in other countries, "brackets" means (). This article talks nothing about this. Anything to add?? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgia_guy_82ac.html" title="User:Georgia guy">Georgia guy</a> 00:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article does talk about this. Look at the anonymous addition to the Parentheses section on 14 July.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This seems to be a strange place to put it, which may be why you missed it. If this is going to be useful, it should be rewritten and moved. Possibly it belongs up top, maybe in a second paragraph before the table of contents, saying that in addition to referring to the class of all these various kinds of brackets, the word "bracket" can also mean specifically parentheses (for Americans) or square brackets (for Brits). Readers probably won't find it buried in the parentheses section, and I can't think of anywhere else it makes sense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I'm not sure this belongs in the article in the first place. If you read through the talk page, there's already been some discussion about American vs. British usage (and Canadian?), and I suspect that the reason nobody added anything to the article (until the anonymous edit a few days ago) is that nobody could agree on what actually is typical British usage. Also, this is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, and I'm not sure usage information for the word "bracket" is of central importance to an article on the class of brackets. Maybe it belongs on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bracket_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bracket (disambiguation)">bracket (disambiguation)</a> page? <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcotron_30b7.html" title="User:Falcotron">Falcotron</a> 05:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I made both of the changes I suggested. Again, I'm not sure whether we need this information in either the disambiguation page or the main page.

<p>I could find no written rule that applies to whether one should use a space before the opening parenthesis in this case. For example, "If you fail to comply with this requirement, this policy shall apply in the same manner it would have applied had such <b>policy(ies)</b> been so maintained in force." It is my understanding that a space is not used. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elements_of_Style_1107.html" title="The Elements of Style">The Elements of Style</a> does not address this usage however; in the index there are several possibly plural terms listed omitting the space.

<dd>"A bracket" or "a parenthesis". (It is "parenthes<b>e</b>s" in plural). A "parenthesis" may also refer to the entire parenthesized expression, including bracket glyps and the content between them, or to the content alone. There seems to be no universally understood short way of overcoming this ambiguity in English, except for disambiguating explicitly (e.g. "opening parenthesis character") where one fears misunderstanding. –<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 19:26, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
