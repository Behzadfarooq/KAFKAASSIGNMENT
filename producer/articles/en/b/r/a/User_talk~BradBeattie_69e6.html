<p>Why did you delete it? That comic is certainly relevant since J. Rowland is so responsible for the whole "snakes on a plane" internet phenomenon. -Tom Gray</p>
<dl>
<dd>It appears he deleted it because it did not fit the necessary criteria to remain as an article, despite its tens of thousands (possibly more) of fans. See the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Overcompensating_ddd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Overcompensating">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Overcompensating</a> article for the very brief discussion (and grand total of three people voting) as to why it should be deleted. All this means is it is gone for now as the fans will surely recreate it at some point, regardless of the rules. --<a href="../../../i/h/m/User%7EIhmhi_696a.html" title="User:Ihmhi">Ihmhi</a> 05:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep yep. Just as Fang said, I'm more than willing to have a civil discussion about it. Unfortunately, a fair number of these fans have been fairly... undiplomatic.

<dd>(This is the IP) First, a quick apology. My words came off rather harsh because I was, well, angry. Now that I am more level-headed, here is my argument.</dd>
<dd>These articles were deleted based on notability. So I will attempt to show that what you kept is actually, for the most part, less notable than the two comics I don't think you should have deleted. I'm going to use Technorati as a metric. If you disagree with Technorati (i.e. counting back-links) then you can disregard my argument, but here goes. The two that I care for, Overcompensating and White Ninja Comics, get a rank of 9,539 (939 links from 340 blogs) and 3,480 (1,076 links from 656 blogs), respectively. Of the seven you kept, Cuentos De La Frontera (in which I had to use the main page, Modern Tales, to get a rank) had a rank of 35,009 (685 links from 109 blogs), Help Desk a rank of 62,395 (135 links from 64 blogs), Jerk City a rank of 71,024 (136 links from 57 blogs), Sosiaalisesti rajoittuneet had no rank (only 42 links though), The Noob a rank of 26,246 (225 links from 143 blogs), The Whiteboard had no rank (only 287 links), and Wondermark had a rank of 6,916 (825 links from 434 blogs). Of those, only one of them ranked remotely close to the two that I do not think you should have deleted.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure why you think they're unpopular, but seriously, just because you don't think it's a popular comic does not make it so. Perhaps number of back links have no bearing on notability, I'm not a wiki-expert. However, back-links seem pretty good for Google (PageRank is based on # of backlinks), and I believe it to be a decent (if not perfect) metric of popularity.</dd>
<dd>Your steadfast support of what I (and some others, evidently) consider a bad decision is unfortunate, especially when you gave such short notice to update. I would reconsider.</dd>
<dd>Also, sorry about the lack of username. I've never bothered to get registered. --I have no idea how to write signatures. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_137.22.1.27_8b9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/137.22.1.27">137.22.1.27</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/7/User_talk%7E137.22.1.27.html" title="User talk:137.22.1.27">talk</a>) 21:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Hey there. The question that we need to address here is whether or not the comics in question satisfy any of the requirements of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you believe they do, you can petition the deletion at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. If you believe they don't, but that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> isn't a good gauge of notability, then you can try and reach consensus to change the guideline on it's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">talk page</a>.</dd>

<dd>I recognize that those outside of the Wikipedia community aren't well versed in the policies here, so if you need a hand doing either I'm more than willing to help. Just let me know which direction you want to take this (<a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) and I'll make sure that the people in the right place hear your arguments. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 00:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm personally unsure as to why we need the bureaucracy... but okay. Within a few minutes I found one reason to keep White Ninja Comics.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with TradeBit is that it isn't non-trivial publishing. I double-checked my intuition by asking over on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s talk page, but it seems that method of publishing doesn't satisfy clause 3 of the guideline. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 15:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, you're back, my oft-opponent! Kind of good to see you. Since you edit in the field a lot, let me bring you up to speed on the recent webcomics WikiDrama that, as it happens, started a short while after you left.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.ubersoft.net/d/20070207.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ubersoft.net/d/20070207.html" rel="nofollow">off</a>-<a href="http://www.joeandmonkey.com/index.php?comic=701" class="external text" title="http://www.joeandmonkey.com/index.php?comic=701" rel="nofollow">site</a> <a href="http://ryanestrada.com/wcca07/ceremony/artist.htm" class="external text" title="http://ryanestrada.com/wcca07/ceremony/artist.htm" rel="nofollow">awareness</a> of the events here seems to be increasing as the webcomic community as a whole catches on to the fact that, to my rough estimate, between a third and a fourth of our entire significant webcomic coverage has been eradicated within the last year. (You I don't blame - much - you seem committed to hunting out the tiny ones.) This can be expected to continue while we keep clinging to *RANT OMITTED*.</p>
<p>Second and the least important, the <a href="../../../w/c/c/WCCA_971f.html" title="WCCA">WCCA</a> article was placed in DRV, where the decision to delete was found to have been made on a "I AM the law!" basis, and the article survived a procedural second AfD. During the time it was down, its loss was used as proof of the awards' insignificance on-wiki, and as evidence that we have it in for webcomics in off-wiki bursts of flak (of which there has been many).</p>
<p>Third, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristofer_Straub_f1de.html" title="Kristofer Straub">Kristofer Straub</a> <a href="http://www.halfpixel.com/2007/02/15/delete-wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://www.halfpixel.com/2007/02/15/delete-wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">committed an interesting experiment</a> by nominating his own webcomic for deletion with a total of ten sockpuppets making massive factual errors and arguing with one another. The article was deleted and apparently nobody bothered to run a checkuser on anon "delete" voters. This probably means something. After the story broke, the article was restored, then re-AfD'd and re-deleted.</p>
<p>Fourth, we had an unprecedented flurry of deletion nominations, arguments, windmill-tilting and other such fun. Honestly, I don't know how you administrators take it. <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> was AfD'd, prompting its author to send over a horde of enraged fans to the discussion, where they acted much like howler monkeys. (The article was kept after these were carefully discounted.) This prompted several other nominations and the sudden spike in deletion attempts drew the <a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/wikiwatch.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/wikiwatch.gif" rel="nofollow">attention</a> of prominent people in the field as the mess fed and was fed by the three previous points. To the best of my understanding, one Wikipedia reader concluded from the Ugly Hill AfD that we're in a state of mob rule, registered and set off to destroy the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled gardens</a> of webcomic articles while having admitted that he knows nothing about webcomics. (This means that claims of anti-webcomic activists created one. The irony is delicious.) When the dust of that settled, he invoked the right to vanish. I think I quoted your statement that Keenspot membership is sufficient notability on two occasions. My apologies if that was too intrusive or something, but I was still slightly giddy over the fact that you had actually written that.</p>
<p>At the moment, things are quiet and have returned to something approaching normal. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 16:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered that maybe the fact that makes Wikipedia so great is that you can search it for anything you can imagine and there's a good chance that you'll get an article? Every time I search for a subject in Google, follow a link to Wikipedia and see a "There's no article here, go away" page, I feel like I'm being personally insulted. It's like Wikipedia is telling me "Well, we had some stuff here you might have been interested in, otherwise you wouldn't be searching for it, but we're going to deny you the right to obtain this information because we're pricks. We could have just given you what you asked us, it's not like we'd lose anything considering it is still stored here, but we're not." For several times now, I've had to use Google cache to read an article that interested me, yet someone else decided it wasn't important.</p>
<p>Wikipedia isn't, and never will be, a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> replacement. Wikipedia is essentially quantity over quality. Sure, the most important articles *must* be of excellent quality, but what's so wrong with letting so called "non-notable" articles alone? Don't get me wrong, vanity articles and articles about your High School should be killed on sight or WP will become a dump, but deleting articles that could be relevant to many people just because it's "non-notable to me" and "it's <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interwebs.html" title="Interwebs">interwebs</a> stuff and should be killed with fire" is just making Wikipedia suck more.</p>
<p>Deleting them won't even save space, all history is kept on the databases, including the history of deleted articles. So what's the fucking point? Is one supposed to get a sysop account for the sole purpose of reading articles that were deemed "non-notable" by "experts"?</p>

<dd>Instead of trolling someone's userpage, how about you actually go do something useful? If you really want to disseminate information, go and find one of the many free webhosts available, and set up a page.

<dd>Yes, because every article in Wikipedia <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_media_4df4.html" title="List of Neon Genesis Evangelion media">is so encyclopedic</a>. Would that article be included in any general encyclopedia other than a Wiki? No. Is it irrelevant, devoid of information and useless to any human being? Not a chance. Have you ever wondered that what makes something encyclopedic is its inclusion in a encyclopedia? Or are most wikipedians so brainwashed by all the pages that start with WP: that can't even see obvious <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_logic.html" title="Circular logic">circular logic</a>? It's not about disseminating information. It's about denying people the right to obtain knowledge on a subject someone else tried to enrich Wikipedia with but was merciless taken away by an army of people who assume "anything I haven't heard of == non-notable == doesn't have a place on a online encyclopedia". Isn't this what Wikipedia is all about? A free encyclopedia that anyone can edit with the sum of all the knowledge in the world? How can we ever reach that goal if some people <b>insist</b> on removing knowledge? But you are correct, this isn't the best place to discuss this.

<p>Hi. I'm curious about what prompted the nominations for deletion of various webcomics articles. I think a lot of those items that got deleted were valid articles. I'm interested to hear your side, and I'm not going to attack you. If you want I can give you my email address so we can correspond off the Wikipedia pages. I think it might already be on my userpage, come to think of it. As you can see, I am a longtime Wikipedia contributor. Best, <a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlasperlenspiel_943e.html" title="User:Glasperlenspiel">glasperlenspiel</a> 20:06, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the civility Glasper; it's much appreciated. However, I think I have to address everyone who's bound to come asking though, if the above is any indication of people's concerns.</dd>
<dd>Instead of answering each individual question and accusation, let me try and address the fundamental problem we have here by stepping back to some common ground and working up from there. I think we'd all agree that Wikipedia is trying to be an encyclopedia. While it might not have the limitations standard paper distributions have regarding size, there are certain subjects that would be clearly inappropriate. I doubt anyone would protest if an article on my 5th eyelash was deleted. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>.</dd>
<dd>That being said, we need to establish some kind of guidelines as to what constitutes sufficient notability for inclusion. Yeah, this is going to be hairy, but it's necessary. Wikipedia has it's inclusionists and deletionists, but I think both camps <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">are working in the best interest</a> of what we're trying to do here: build something of quality. We just disagree as to how to do it.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the guideline that we have for web-content notability and it's been taking a lot of flak in these last few months. Be that as it may, what else do we have to go on? If there's a problem with the guideline, let's discuss it <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civilly</a> and maybe we can find a better way of quantifying what's notable and what isn't.</dd>
<dd>As for what spurned the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">deletion nomination</a> spree, it came up in the discussions on the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> boards that many web comics, regardless of size/readership/media coverage/notability/whatever you want to call it, had articles. So I took it upon myself to spend a couple weeks going through the category and nominating those that seemed to fail the guideline for deletion. Note that I didn't delete any myself there. Each was nominated and discussed. There were bound to be some grey spots, but I think we (the AFD participants) did our best to be as fair as we could.</dd>
<dd>Anywho, I ramble. Hopefully that addresses the questions and concerns. No doubt there'll be more, but I figured I'd try to be accountable for an action that I initiated. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 00:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It might just be me, but the fact that some of these comics that you have essentially led the charge to axe having tens of thousands of readers might make them encyclopedia worthy. I read over the notability criteria for them and a few of your deletes can definitely be disputed; Overcompensating comes to mind (especially with the Snakes On A Plane popularity that came from it). I know in time these pages are going to come back in one form or another, even though you deleted them now. I would wager that a few of these articles meet the criteria if someone put the effort into finding the links necessary for resources. I also have noticed that it seems you went straight for a delete instead of making any sort of concerted effort to make the pages better or find links (if you have; you have not really documented it very well). Lastly, congratulations; you have managed to piss off tens of thousands of fans of some of these comics. The rational ones will just rebuild the pages and do whatever it takes to get them to fit the criteria necessary to keep them from deletion; the irrational ones are going to look to the person who went on a webcomic deletin' crusade and vandalize the shit out of anything his name is on.

<p>Hi, Brad. This isn't specifically directed at you - but let's face it, much of the anger towards the recent streak of webcomics (and general) deletionism has eventually found its way back to your user page. So, this is me, saying something to you, and all the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionism">deletionists</a>, and all the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="m:Inclusionism">inclusionists</a>.</p>
<p><b>First, to the deletionists:</b> Wikipedia is many things, but a true encyclopedia - and I mean encyclopedia like Britannica, as in, a modest amount of information on most major subjects in the world - a true encyclopedia it is not. It is, if anything, the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_4f2f.html" title="Hitchhiker's Guide">Hitchhiker's Guide</a> - a universally accessible resource of all the information on Earth. Clearly, not <b>all</b> of it - but the knowledge, the intellectual information that a fair number of people might want to know about.</p>
<p>You must surely be aware of the enourmous double standard here. There is an article for almost every suburb in Sydney's Northern Beaches - and for every station on the CityRail system, including <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wondabyne_railway_station%2C_New_South_Wales_e378.html" title="Wondabyne railway station, New South Wales">Wondabyne</a>, a station only notable for its exceptional smallness. (Wondabyne, incidentally, serves a community of about twelve homes.) Now, take White Ninja Comics - one of the more notable articles on your crusade. There are over five thousand registered forum members, and I would guess at least double that in readership. I would say that's a conservative estimate. (I'm not one of them, incidentally. I don't get it most of the time.) So, ten thousand readers. And, apparently, syndication (there are hints of this in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_White_Ninja_Comics_%28second_nomination%29_1e43.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/White Ninja Comics (second nomination)">AFD page</a> - although, because the article was deleted, I'll never know). This isn't <i>notable</i>? This is less notable than a railway station that doesn't even have a connecting road?</p>
<p><b>Secondly, to the inclusionists:</b> actually, the deletionists should read this as well. I was going to say "These articles are marked as up for deletion, and the reasons why are stated - much of the time it's because they're not properly cited, or they need cleanup, so do something about it! You can stop it from happening!" - which is still valid. You can stop it from happening. But I had a closer look at the dates and discovered that between nomination and deletion there is a mere <b>five days</b>. That's not enough time to ensure that anyone will do anything about making the article better. So, please, if you mark an article for deletion - give it some time. Put it 'on notice', as Stephen Colbert would say.</p>
<p>Secondly, and this is directly aimed at inclusionists - if you are an author of a webcomic, or a close friend of an author, or if you know them at all, then you can't posit an unbiased opinion on that article. Wikipedia is built on a solid foundation of a Neutral Point Of View. <b>This is not your ad space</b>. If you've created a webcomic, don't create a Wikipedia article for it. Just don't. If you know someone who has created a webcomic, don't. Et cetera.</p>
<p>And last, but not least, if your readership is less than a thousand, then sorry, you're nothing special. The number of visitors to your article will be so small that there's no point fighting over it. <b>This doesn't mean delete it on the grounds of notability</b>. This means, if someone creates an article for your webcomic, and it's good (not FA good, but B+ good), and they haven't created some ridiculous disambiguation page where 99% of traffic will be directed away from your article - then it should be kept. If it's interfering with people who want information on a different subject of the same name - if it's poorly written - if it's not NPOV - if it's any of the other reasons for deletion apart from notability - get rid of it. Wikipedia may be the Hitchhiker's Guide, but at least the Guide was well-written.</p>

<dd>Hey there Gorman. So if I get what you're saying here, you're suggesting that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> have a fourth clause for inclusion: readership. We could agree that if every web user read some web content then chances are it's notable. If some website is read only by it's author, then that readership alone isn't sufficient for notability.</dd>
<dd>Question is, where in there is the magic number that we want to settle on? 1000 readers or more? 10,000? And if we settle on an exact number, how do we accurately measure a website's unique visitor base? I'm not saying that readership shouldn't be included in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, just that there are some serious hurdles to overcome if it's going to be part of the list. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 14:32, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess that's the overall gist of it, although the more general stuff - like marking pages for deletion significantly in advance of actually deleting them - extends far beyond WP:WEB. However, I appreciate the difficulty of the situation. What's the definable scope of Wikipedia? Maybe someone should ask Jimbo Wales. <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorman_70f1.html" title="User:Gorman">Gorman</a> 10:38, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The list was just from skimming through the webcomics category and finding the pages that didn't seem to meet the content guidelines. Had I done it with band, it would have been the same.

<p>You are probably getting flak because you have what appears like <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_To_Do_5a3b.html" title="User:BradBeattie/To Do">a hit list against webcomics</a> with a lot more red then green.

<p>Another thing that is probably getting you some flak is that the Cleaning Category:Webcomics section on your "To Do" page looks more like a collection of hunting trophies as opposed to articles you actually intend to work on.

<dd>Gar, the difficulty I found was that even after an article was found non-notable and deleted, fans of said comics would come back and recreate the article. That list is (A) a record of what I've been working on as to hold me more accountable and (B) a quick way to notice if someone's recreating articles they likely shouldn't be. I recognize that some people are interpreting it as a "hit list", but if that were the case, why would there be a "keep" section? They're just articles I thought at first glance should be discussed for possible deletion, not "OMG MUST DELETE!!!!11eleven". --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><strong class="selflink">(talk)</strong></small> 18:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
