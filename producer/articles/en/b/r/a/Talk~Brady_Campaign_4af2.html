<p>There is already a separate section on the Brady Act. I think that it is redundant to have all that information in here, unless it is here for propaganda value. This article should only talk about the Brady Campaign itself, and nothing more. Maybe a link to the brady act, but that should be it. -- <a href="../../../d/u/l/User%7EDullfig_a732.html" title="User:Dullfig">Dullfig</a> 04:56, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, we should excise the middle 4 paragraphs, pretty much. Yaf, you're killing me with that 8,000 number&#160;:-). To suggest that the Brady Law permanently stopped only 8,000 people from buying a gun is laughable. Even if some of the over 1,000,000 refusals were eventually overturned (due to the very dubious claim of mistaken identy - come on!)the number is still probably much close to the 1 million mark. At least come up with a some verifiable data or source instead of just specualtion. Cramz32 15:14, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have found a number in a GAO report for 199,720 denials over a 35 month period. Added this, along with the break-outs of why, and we now have verifiable numbers. Looks like the number of initial denials is somewhere around 65,000 to 67,000 per year. Approximately 22% are overturned on appeal, but it appears that most who are denied don't bother to appeal. Wading through the appeal paperwork is not likely to be a popular thing to do. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 17:03, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yaf, I'm glad you linked the GAO report, but I guess you misread the data about reasons for denial. I have repaired the info on the article. About 64% of the denials were for felony convictions, which you lumped into "other reasons like paperwork errors." In any case, I fixed that portion. Now, how do you come up with the 22% overturn rate? Nothing along those lines exists in the GAO report you cited.Cramz32 20:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, I think it might be a semantics issue here, 22% overturn rate refers only to those that have been appealed. In fact, the GAO report I cited put that rate even higher perhaps because it includes state and FBI denials and appeals. But you have to admit that the vast majority, indeed almost 95% of denials are not overturned, right? Whether it be the fear of the paperwork, failed appeals, or simply the realization the appeal would fail, most denials hold up.Cramz32 21:54, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, yes. The later reference is more germane, I think, because the higher number in the later reference is likely more indicative of the current state of affairs. Of course, I personally suspect that the reason for the 95% number is that most denied individuals simply opt for a private sale purchase instead of messing with the paperwork, despite having approximately a 1 in 3 chance of getting a denial overturned on appeal. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 21:59, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I found the denial data from the GAO and added it to the article. Seems that of the 916,000 denials between 1999 and 2004, 48,000 were reversed on appeal. That's just over 5.2%. So, in that time almost 95% or 868,000 of the denials held up. I appreciate the fact that the appeals process might be difficult for some, but facts are facts. Cramz32 21:26, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Brady Campaign was founded as The National Council to Control Handguns in 1974. No matter how much you wish it were founded with the word "ban" in it's title, it's simply not true. If you insist on making up a history for an organization you clearly know nothing about, at least provide some historical proof of your spurious claim.</p>

<dd>My friend, I'm afraid you did not link me to a Congressional Record site as you had hoped but instead to a a site called www.guncite.com, a virulently pro-gun website. In any case, you're just confused. There was a group called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. They are now known as the Coalition To Stop Gun Violence. The Brady Campaign is a completely different organization. Similar names though, so I can see how you slipped up. In any case, I hope this will clear up the confusion.

<p>I know their are out there people that wish they had never so blatantly let the cat out of the bag, and acutally put the purpose of the organization in the name itself; but you cannot re-write history by trying to change the name in an encyclopedia.

<p>Sorry to be nitpicky here but the way that the panel is phrased is rather loaded. I'm sure it would initiate the same reaction if the panel were split into Gun Control vs. Anti-Gun Control.

<p>Puttypapyrus was right, and whoever later made the "Anti-gun rights" Category should also reconsider for the same reason. There is no "Anti-gun control," nor "Pro-gun rights" Category, if you really need the seperate categories why not make them sub-cats of "Gun politics advocacy groups in the United States."</p>
<p>That brings me to my other point, Yaf, your edit says clarification, but I say redundancy, "...political advocacy organization that does take positions on many political issues." Well, what does "political advocacy" mean? I thought I had it covered. Later -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 20:14, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Political advocacy</i> could mean either nonpartisan advocacy of the political (i.e., voting) process itself (the LWV's original position, incidentally), taking no sides, <b>or</b> the advocacy of particular political positions in the races themselves, such as on referendums. The impreciseness of the English language is such that we should reserve ambiguity for when it is really needed, or else clarify the point in cases such as this when clarification is needed to avoid misleading a reader. <a href="../../../y/a/f/User%7EYaf_9ae4.html" title="User:Yaf">Yaf</a> 21:11, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

Again, find an NPOV source for whatever happened. If it is more accurate to state that he is a victim of aggravated assault and battery, then that is what the article should read.

<p>I took out the info below as it has to do with the Brady act itself and not the group that the article is about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 1994, the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports that the Brady Act has stopped more than 1,000,000 people from purchasing modern handguns on the grounds of a criminal record or other prohibited status.<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/bcft03pr.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/bcft03pr.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> In general, half of the denials were made by state and local agencies and half by the FBI. From 1999 through 2003, BJS reports that "58 percent of the denials by state and local agencies were for the applicant's felony conviction or indictment, 13 percent for a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction or restraining order, and the remainder for other reasons."</li>

<p>According to the Government Accounting Office, "as of July 1995 a total of seven persons (nationally) had been successfully prosecuted for making false statements on the Brady handgun purchase form." For comparison, the same report reveals that in 30 randomly-selected jurisdictions over March 1994 through January 1995, a total of 441,545 applications were processed, of which 15,506 were initially denied, for a 3.5% denial rate. <a href="http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96022.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96022.pdf" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Newer data show that an estimated 8,000 persons were arrested from 1999 to 2003 for an outstanding warrant or submission of false information on an application, according to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Alcohol%2C_Tobacco%2C_Firearms%2C_and_Explosives_07d0.html" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives</a> (BATFE, formerly BATF).<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/bcft03.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/bcft03.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>The immediate question is what changed this arrest/conviction rate, from an insignificant total of 7 over 17 months to over 8,000 individuals over four years, in just four years, from 1995 to 1999? Gun rights activists contend that the key factor that changed was the <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act_5c60.html" title="Firearm Owners Protection Act">Lautenberg Amendment</a>, passed September 30, 1996, that added those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to the list of prohibited purchasers. The amendment also bars from handgun ownership those subject to a current restraining order "from harassing, stalking or threatening an intimate partner or child of such partner". For example, if a soldier who slaps her husband, even if 10 years prior to the passage of the Lautenberg Amendment, was ever convicted, she can no longer legally own or handle guns, even as a soldier, nor can she legally buy a handgun. Similarly, by this same amendment, if she simply fills out a Brady form <a href="http://www.atf.gov/forms/4473/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atf.gov/forms/4473/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>to buy a handgun, and simply forgets about or intentionally lies about her prior misdemeanor conviction, she has automatically committed a felony. Some contend that it was this factor alone which changed the number of arrests and convictions over the span of just a few years. (See <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act_5c60.html" title="Firearm Owners Protection Act">Firearm Owners Protection Act</a></i> for details on the Lautenberg Amendment being declared unconstitutional in 1999, in one Federal court.<a href="https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/JAGCNETINTERNET/HOMEPAGES/AC/ARMYLAWYER.NSF/0/e7a8f3b0373ca09985256e5b0054d9d3/$FILE/Article%202.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/JAGCNETINTERNET/HOMEPAGES/AC/ARMYLAWYER.NSF/0/e7a8f3b0373ca09985256e5b0054d9d3/$FILE/Article%202.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> This one case was reversed; see U.S. v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001)). <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=5th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=9910331cr0" class="external autonumber" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=5th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=9910331cr0" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>Gun-control advocates believe the Brady Law has lowered crime and saved lives by denying over 1,000,000 handgun purchases. However the number of permanently denied handgun purchases under the Brady Law is much smaller. Data from the Government Accounting Office indicate that over a 35 month period from November 30, 1998 through October 7, 2001, a total of 199,720 denials occurred, of which 63.6% were for Felony Convictions, 13.9% were for Domestic Violence Misdemeanors, 9.1% were for other criminal history, 5.0% were for drug abuse, 3.8% were for Domestic Restraining Orders, 2.8% were for Fugitive Warrants, 0.4% were for Mental Defective reasons, and the remaining 1.4% of the denials were for other reasons, such as state protection orders or illegal alien citizenship status.<a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02720.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d02720.pdf" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The Government Accounting Office reports that from 1999 to 2004, "of the 916,000 denials by the FBI and State and local agencies in the first 6 years of the permanent Brady period (i.e. 1999-2004), 138,000 (15%) were appealed. Of the appealed denials, 49,000 (36%) were reversed." In other words, between 1999 and 2004, of the 916,000 denials, almost 95% or 868,000, stood up on appeal or were not appealed by the person attempting to purchase the gun. Of course, it is not possible to extrapolate the percentage of the 85% who, once denied, and who never bothered to appeal the denial, would likewise have had their denials reversed had they simply appealed. According to the GAO, "the vast majority of disputed denials are resolved at the administrative level." <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/bcft04.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/bcft04.pdf" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
