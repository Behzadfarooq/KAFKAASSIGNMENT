<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Edit section: Terminology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terminology</span></h2>
<p>The term <i>brainwashing</i> is a relatively new term in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>. Author <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Marks_af72.html" title="John Marks">John Marks</a> writes that the term was coined in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> by a journalist who was later revealed to have been working undercover for the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Earlier forms of <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_persuasion.html" title="Coercive persuasion">coercive persuasion</a> occurred during the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>, the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_trial.html" title="Show trial">show trials</a> against "<a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_of_the_state.html" title="Enemy of the state">enemies of the state</a>" in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, etc.; but no specific term emerged until the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodology.html" title="Methodology">methodologies</a> of these earlier movements were <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systematic.html" title="Systematic">systematized</a> during the early decades of the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> for use in their struggles against internal <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_of_the_people.html" title="Enemy of the people">class enemies</a> and foreign invaders. Until that time, descriptions were limited to concrete descriptions of specific techniques.</p>
<p>The term <i>xǐ năo</i> (洗腦, the Chinese term literally translated as "to wash the brain") was first applied to methodologies of coercive persuasion used in the "reconstruction" (改造 <i>gǎi zào</i>) of the so-called feudal (封建 <i>fēng jiàn</i>) thought-patterns of Chinese citizens raised under pre-revolutionary régimes. The term first came into use in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950s</a> during the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>, to describe those same methods as applied by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_China_8300.html" title="Communist Party of China">Chinese communists</a> to attempt deep and permanent behavioral changes in foreign prisoners, and especially during the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> to disrupt the ability of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners_of_war.html" title="Prisoners of war">captured</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> troops to effectively <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_organizing.html" title="Community organizing">organize</a> and resist their imprisonment.</p>
<p>The word <i>brainwashing</i> consequently came into use in the United States to explain why, compared to earlier wars, a relatively high percentage of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../g/i/_/GI_%28military%29_e662.html" title="GI (military)">GIs</a> defected to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communists</a> after becoming prisoners of war. Later analysis determined that some of the primary methodologies employed on them during their imprisonment included <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_deprivation.html" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> and other intense psychological manipulations designed to break down the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autonomy" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:autonomy">autonomy</a> of individuals. American alarm at the new phenomenon of substantial numbers of U.S. troops switching their allegiances to the enemy was ameliorated after prisoners were repatriated and it was learned that few of them retained allegiance to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> and "anti-American" <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrines</a> that had been inculcated during their incarcerations. The key finding was that when rigid control of information was terminated and the former prisoners' natural methods of reality testing could resume functioning, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superimposition.html" title="Superimposition">superimposed</a> values and judgments were rapidly attenuated.</p>
<p>Although the use of brainwashing on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> prisoners during the Korean War produced some <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> benefits to the forces opposing the United Nations, its main utility to the Chinese lay in the fact that it significantly increased the maximum number of prisoners that one guard could control, thus freeing other Chinese soldiers to go to the battlefield.</p>
<p>In later times the term "brainwashing" came to apply to other methods of <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_persuasion.html" title="Coercive persuasion">coercive persuasion</a> and even to the effective use of ordinary <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indoctrination.html" title="Indoctrination">indoctrination</a>. Formal discourses of the Chinese Communist Party came to prefer the more clinical-sounding term <i>sī xǐang gǎi zào 思想改造</i> ("thought reform").</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwashing.html" title="Edit section: Present-day use of the term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Present-day use of the term</span></h2>
<p>Many people have come to use the terms "brainwashing" or "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>" to explain the otherwise intuitively puzzling success of some methodologies for the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html" title="Religious conversion">religious conversion</a> of inductees to groups known variously as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">new religious movements</a> or as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cults</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">Psychology</a> and other sciences do not make wide use of the term "brainwashing", recognizing its vagueness and its history of use in propaganda, not to mention its association with sometimes hysterical fears (such as those of people being taken over by "foreign" ideologies). It is often more helpful to analyze "brainwashing" as a combination of manipulations to promote <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persuasion_and_attitude_change.html" title="Persuasion and attitude change">persuasion and attitude change</a> such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercion.html" title="Coercion">coercion</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capture-bonding.html" title="Capture-bonding">capture-bonding</a>, and restriction of access to neutral sources of information. Note that many of these techniques are more subtly used (usually unconsciously) by advertisers, governments, schools, parents and peers, so the aura of exoticism around "brainwashing" is undeserved. At the same time, nuanced forms of indoctrination and propaganda in religious, political and commercial venues may occasion wider and deeper impacts than do outright coercive tactics. Mirroring George Orwell's doublespeak, strategists of indoctrination and propaganda frequently disguise themselves as promoters of freedom and liberation.</p>
<p><b>Thought reform</b> consists of the alteration of a person's basic attitudes and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">beliefs</a> by outside <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manipulation.html" title="Manipulation">manipulation</a>. The term usually relates closely to brainwashing and mind control.</p>
<p>One of the first published uses of the term <i>thought reform</i> occurred in the title of the book by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jay_Lifton_3349.html" title="Robert Jay Lifton">Robert Jay Lifton</a> (a professor of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">psychiatry</a> at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jay_College_3597.html" title="John Jay College">John Jay College</a> and at the Graduate Center of the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_University_of_New_York_91a7.html" title="City University of New York">City University of New York</a>): <i>Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of 'Brainwashing' in China</i> (1961). (Lifton also testified at the 1976 trial of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patty_Hearst_15a1.html" title="Patty Hearst">Patty Hearst</a>.) In that book he used the term thought reform as a synonym for brainwashing, though he preferred the first term. The elements of thought reform as published in that book are sometimes used as a basis for <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_checklist.html" title="Cult checklist">cult checklists</a> and read as follows:<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Zablocki_9830.html" title="Benjamin Zablocki">Benjamin Zablocki</a> sees brainwashing as a "term for a concept that stands for a form of influence manifested in a deliberately and systematically applied traumatizing and obedience-producing process of ideological resocializations" and states this same concept had historically also been called <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_reform.html" title="Thought reform">thought reform</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coercive_persuasion.html" title="Coercive persuasion">coercive persuasion</a>.</p>
<p>Popular speech <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2007.html" title="As of 2007">continues</a> to use the word <i>brainwashed</i> informally and pejoratively to describe persons subjected to intensive influence resulting in the rejection of old beliefs and in the acceptance of new ones; or to account for someone who holds strong ideas considered implausible and which seem resistant to <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence.html" title="Evidence">evidence</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonsense.html" title="Commonsense">commonsense</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experience.html" title="Experience">experience</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">logic</a>. Such popular usage often implies a belief that the ideas of the allegedly brainwashed person developed under some external influence such as books, television programs, television commercials (as producing <i>brainwashed consumers</i>), video games, religious groups, political groups, or other people. <i>Mind control</i> expresses a conception only mildly less dramatic than <i>brainwashing</i>, with <i>thought control</i> slightly milder again. With <i>thought reform</i> and <i>coercion</i> we start to move into acceptably neutral academic jargon and into the areas of <i>propaganda</i>, <i>influence</i> and <i>persuasion</i>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_China_8300.html" title="Communist Party of China">Communist Party of China</a> used the phrase <i>"xǐ nǎo"</i> ("brain rinse") to describe its methods of persuasion to ensure that members who did not conform to the Party message were brought into orthodoxy. The phrase was a play on <b>"xǐ xīn",</b> (洗心"wash heart") a monition found in many <a href="../../../d/a/o/Daoist.html" title="Daoist">Daoist</a> temples exhorting the faithful to cleanse their hearts of impure desires before entering.</p>
<p>In September 1950, the <i>Miami Daily News</i> published an article by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hunter_6293.html" title="Edward Hunter">Edward Hunter</a> (1902-1978) titled "'Brain-Washing' Tactics Force Chinese into Ranks of Communist Party." It contained the first printed use of the English-language term "brainwashing," which quickly became a stock phrase in Cold War headlines. Hunter, a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Intelligence_Agency_295c.html" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> propaganda operator <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks8.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks8.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> who worked under-cover as a journalist, turned out a steady stream of books and articles on the subject. An additional article by Hunter on the same subject appeared in <i>New Leader</i> magazine in 1951. In 1953 <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Welsh_Dulles_e97d.html" title="Allen Welsh Dulles">Allen Welsh Dulles</a>, the CIA director at that time, explained that "the brain under [Communist influence] becomes a phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control."</p>
<p>In his 1956 book "Brain-Washing: The Story of the Men Who Defied It", Edward Hunter described "a system of befogging the brain so a person can be seduced into acceptance of what otherwise would be abhorrent to him". According to Hunter, the process became so destructive of physical and mental health that many of his interviewees had not fully recovered after several years of freedom from Chinese captivity.</p>
<p>Later, two studies of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> defections by Robert Lifton and <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Schein_fcba.html" title="Edgar Schein">Edgar Schein</a> concluded that brainwashing had a transient effect when used on prisoners of war. Lifton and Schein found that the Chinese did not engage in any systematic re-education of prisoners, but generally used their techniques of coercive persuasion to disrupt the ability of the prisoners to organize to maintain their morale and to try to escape. The Chinese did, however, succeed in getting some of the prisoners to make <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">anti-American</a> statements by placing the prisoners under harsh conditions of physical and social <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deprivation.html" title="Deprivation">deprivation</a> and disruption, and then by offering them more comfortable situations such as better sleeping quarters, quality food, warmer clothes or blankets. Nevertheless, the psychiatrists noted that even these measures of coercion proved quite ineffective at changing basic attitudes for most people. In essence, the prisoners did not actually adopt Communist beliefs. Rather, many of them behaved as though they did in order to avoid the plausible threat of extreme physical abuse. Moreover, the few prisoners influenced by Communist indoctrination apparently succumbed as a result of the confluence of the coercive persuasion, and of the motives and personality characteristics of the prisoners that already existed before imprisonment. In particular, individuals with very rigid systems of belief tended to snap and realign, whereas individuals with more flexible systems of belief tended to bend under pressure and then restore themselves when the external pressures were removed.</p>
<p>Two researchers working individually, Lifton and Schein, discussed coercive persuasion in their analysis of the treatment of Korean War POWs. They defined coercive persuasion as a mixture of social, psychological and physical pressures applied to produce changes in an individual's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Lifton and Schein both concluded that such coercive persuasion can succeed in the presence of a physical element of confinement, "forcing the individual into a situation in which he must, in order to survive physically and psychologically, expose himself to persuasive attempts". They also concluded that such coercive persuasion succeeded only on a minority of POWs, and that the end result of such coercion remained very unstable, as most of the individuals reverted to their previous condition soon after they left the coercive environment.</p>

<p>Following the armistice that interrupted hostilities in the Korean War, a large group of intelligence-officers, psychiatrists, and psychologists received assignments to debrief United Nations soldiers being repatriated. The government of the United States wanted to understand the unprecedented level of collaboration, the breakdown of trust among prisoners, and other such indications that the Chinese were doing something new and effective in their handling of prisoners of war. Formal studies in academic journals began to appear in the mid-1950s, as well as some first-person reports from former prisoners. In 1961, two books were published by specialists in the field who synthesized these studies for the non-specialists concerned with issues of national security and social policy. Edgar H. Schein wrote on <i>Coercive Persuasion,</i> and Robert J. Lifton wrote on <i>Thought Control and the Psychology of Totalism.</i> Both books were primarily concerned with the techniques called "xǐ nǎo" or, more formally "sī xiǎng gǎi zào" (reconstructing or remodeling thought). The following discussion is based in large part on their studies.</p>
<p>Although American attention came to bear on thought reconstruction or brainwashing as one result of the Korean War (190 - 1953), the techniques had operated on ordinary Chinese citizens after the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949. The PRC had refined and extended techniques earlier used in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to prepare prisoners for <a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_trials.html" title="Show trials">show trials</a>, and they in turn had learned much from the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>. In the Chinese context, these techniques had multiple goals that went far beyond the simple control of subjects in the prison camps of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>. They aimed to produce <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">confessions</a>, to convince the accused that they had indeed perpetrated anti-social acts, to make them feel guilty of these crimes against the state, to make them desirous of a fundamental change in outlook toward the institutions of the new communist society, and, finally, to actually accomplish these desired changes in the recipients of the brainwashing/thought-reform. To that end, brainwashers desired techniques that would break down the psychic integrity of the individual with regard to information processing, with regard to information retained in the mind, and with regard to values. Chosen techniques included: dehumanizing of individuals by keeping them in filth, <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_deprivation.html" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a>, partial <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensory_deprivation.html" title="Sensory deprivation">sensory deprivation</a>, psychological harassment, inculcation of <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt.html" title="Guilt">guilt</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_pressure.html" title="Peer pressure">group social pressure</a>, etc. The ultimate goal that drove these extreme efforts consisted of the transformation of an individual with a "feudal" or capitalist mindset into a "right thinking" member of the new social system, or, in other words, to transform what the state regarded as a criminal mind into what the state could regard as a non-criminal mind.</p>
<p>The methods of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_control.html" title="Thought control">thought-control</a> proved extremely useful when employed for gaining the compliance of prisoners of war. Key elements in their success included tight control of the information available to the individual and tight control over the behavior of the individual. When, after repatriation, close control of information ceased and reality testing could resume, former prisoners fairly quickly regained a close approximation of their original picture of the world and of the societies from which they had come. Furthermore, prisoners subject to thought control often had simply behaved in ways that pleased their captors, without changing their fundamental beliefs. So the fear of brainwashed sleeper agents, such as that dramatized in the novel and the films <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Manchurian_Candidate_%281962_film%29_8adb.html" title="The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)">The Manchurian Candidate</a></i>, never materialized.</p>
<p>Terrible though the process frequently seemed to individuals imprisoned by the Chinese Communist Party, these attempts at extreme coercive persuasion ended with a reassuring result: they showed that the human mind has enormous ability to adapt to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress_%28medicine%29.html" title="Stress (medicine)">stress</a> (not a recognized term in common use with reference to psychology in the early 1950s) and also a powerful <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeostasis.html" title="Homeostasis">homeostatic</a> capacity. John Clifford, <a href="../../../s/2E/j/S.J._706d.html" title="S.J.">S.J.</a> gives an account of one man's adamant resistance to brainwashing in <i>In the Presence of My Enemies</i> that substantiates the picture drawn from studies of large groups that were reported by Lifton and Schein. Allyn and Adele Rickett <a href="http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/ma/radio/rickett.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/ma/radio/rickett.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> wrote a more penitent account of their imprisonment (Allyn Rickett had by his own admission broken PRC laws against espionage) in "Prisoners of the Liberation," but it too details techniques such as the “struggle groups” described in other accounts. Between these opposite reactions to attempts by the state to reform them, experience showed that most people would change under pressure and would change back when the pressure was removed. The other interesting result was that some individuals derived benefit from these coercive procedures due to the fact that the interactions, perhaps as an unintended side effect, actually promoted insight into dysfunctional behaviors that were then abandoned.</p>

<p>According to research and forensic psychologist Dick Anthony, the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> invented the concept of "brainwashing" as a propaganda strategy to undercut communist claims that American POWs in Korean communist camps had voluntarily expressed sympathy for communism and that definitive research demonstrated that collaboration by western POWs had been caused by fear and duress, and not by brainwashing. He argues that the CIA brainwashing theory was pushed to the general public through the books of Edward Hunter, who was a secret CIA "psychological warfare specialist" passing as a journalist. He further asserts that for twenty years starting in the early 1950s, the CIA and the Defense Department conducted secret research (notably including <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_MKULTRA_fa9a.html" title="Project MKULTRA">Project MKULTRA</a>) in an attempt to develop practical brainwashing techniques (possibly to counteract the brainwashing efforts of the Chinese), and that their attempt was a failure.</p>

<p>Frequent disputes regarding brainwashing take place in discussion of cults and NRMs. The controversy about the existence of cultic brainwashing is one of the most polarizing issues among cult followers, academic researchers of cults, and cult critics. There is no agreement about the existence of a social process attempting coercive influence and neither about the existence of the social outcome that people are influenced against their will.</p>
<p>The issue gets even more complicated through the existence of several definitions of the term "brainwashing" (some of them almost strawman caricatures) and through the introduction of the similarly controversial concept of "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>" in the 1990s, which is at times interchangeably used for brainwashing and at other times differentiated from brainwashing. Additionally, some authors refer to brainwashing as recruitment method (Barker) while others refer to brainwashing as a method of retaining existing members (Kent 1997, Zablocki 2001).</p>
<p>Theories on brainwashing have also become the subject of discussions in legal courts, where experts have had to pronounce their views before juries in simpler terms than those used in academic publications and where the issue had to be presented rather black and white to make a point in the case. Such cases including their black and white colorings have been taken up by the media.</p>
<p>In 1984 British sociologist <a href="../../../e/i/l/Eileen_Barker_49c8.html" title="Eileen Barker">Eileen Barker</a> wrote in her book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Making_of_a_Moonie_8603.html" title="The Making of a Moonie">The Making of a Moonie</a>: Choice or Brainwashing</i>, which was based on her first hand studies of British <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a> members, that she had found no extraordinary persuasion techniques being used to recruit or retain members.</p>
<p>Charlotte Allen reported that "[i]n his article in <i>Nova Religio</i>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Zablocki_9830.html" title="Benjamin Zablocki">Zablocki</a> was worried less about those academics who may stretch the brainwashing concept than about those, like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bromley_163d.html" title="David Bromley">Bromley</a>, who reject it altogether. And in advancing his case, he took a hard look at such scholars’ intentions and tactics. (His title is deliberately provocative: 'The Blacklisting of a Concept: The Strange History of the Brainwashing Conjecture in the Sociology of Religion.')"<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> In his book <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatting_Cult_Mind_Control_3177.html" title="Combatting Cult Mind Control">Combatting Cult Mind Control</a></i> American psychologist <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Hassan_d776.html" title="Steven Hassan">Steven Hassan</a> describes the extraordinary persuasion technique that in his opinion were used to accomplish his own recruitment and retention by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Zimbardo_5dca.html" title="Philip Zimbardo">Philip Zimbardo</a> writes that "[m]ind control is the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition and/or behavioral outcomes.

<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> some U.S. mental health professionals became controversial figures due to their involvement as <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expert_witness.html" title="Expert witness">expert witnesses</a> in court cases involving new religious movements.

The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychological_Association_357c.html" title="American Psychological Association">American Psychological Association</a> (APA) in 1983 asked <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Singer_e382.html" title="Margaret Singer">Margaret Singer</a>, one of the leading proponents of coercive persuasion theories, to chair a taskforce called the <a href="../../../a/p/a/APA_taskforce_on_Deceptive_and_Indirect_Techniques_of_Persuasion_and_Control_da88.html" title="APA taskforce on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control">APA taskforce on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control</a> (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or "coercive persuasion" did indeed play a role in recruitment by such movements. Before the taskforce had submitted its final report, however, the APA submitted on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> an <i><a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_curi%C3%A6.html" title="Amicus curiæ">amicus curiæ</a></i> brief in an ongoing case. The brief stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[t]he methodology of Drs.

</blockquote>
<p>The brief characterized the theory of brainwashing as not scientifically proven and suggested the hypothesis that cult recruitment techniques might prove coercive for certain sub-groups, while not affecting others coercively. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>, APA filed a motion to withdraw its signature from this brief, as it considered the conclusion premature, in view of the ongoing work of the DIMPAC taskforce.<a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/apologist/apologist25.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/apologist/apologist25.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<p>With the rejection memo came two letters from external advisers to the APA who reviewed the report. One of the letters, from Professor <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Beit-Hallahmi_97f1.html" title="Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi">Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi</a> of the University of Haifa, stated amongst other comments that "lacking psychological theory, the report resorts to sensationalism in the style of certain tabloids" and that "the term 'brainwashing' is not a recognized theoretical concept, and is just a sensationalist 'explanation' more suitable to 'cultists' and revival preachers. It should not be used by psychologists, since it does not explain anything", and asked that the report should not be made public. The second letter, from Professor of Psychology Jeffrey D. Fisher, Ph.D., said that the report "[...] seems to be unscientific in tone, and biased in nature. It draws conclusions, which in many cases do not mesh well with the evidence presented. At times, the reasoning seems flawed to the point of being almost ridiculous. In fact, the report sometimes seems to be characterized by the use of deceptive, indirect techniques of persuasion and control - the very thing it is investigating".<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the APA's BSERP rejected her findings, Singer sued the APA in 1992 for "defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy" and lost in 1994.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several scholars in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">NRM</a> sympathizers' camp have since interpreted this in the way that APA had then rejected the brainwashing theories and that there was no scientific support for them (e.g. Introvigne, 1998, Bromley and Hadden In their 1993 <i>Handbook of Cults and Sects in America</i>.)</p>
<p>Zablocki (1997) and Amitrani (2001) cite APA boards and scholars on the subject and conclude that the APA has made no unanimous decision regarding this issue. They also write that Margaret Singer, despite the rejection of the DIMPAC report, continued her work and was respected in the psychological community, which they corroborate by mentioning that in the 1987 edition of the peer-reviewed Merck's Manual, Margaret Singer was the author of the article "Group Psychodynamics and Cults" (Singer, 1987).</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Zablocki_9830.html" title="Benjamin Zablocki">Benjamin Zablocki</a>, professor of sociology and one of the reviewers of the rejected DIMPAC report, wrote in 1997:</p>

<p>F.A.C.T.net states that "Forced deprogramming was sometimes successful and sometimes unsuccessful, but is not considered an acceptable, legal, or ethical method of rescuing a person from a cult."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) published a statement in 1977 related to brainwashing and mind control. In this statement the ACLU opposed certain methods "depriving people of the free exercise of religion". The ACLU also rejected (under certain conditions) the idea that claims of the use of "brainwashing" or of "mind control" should overcome the free exercise of religion. (See <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brainwashing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brainwashing" rel="nofollow">quote</a>)</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, after coming into contact with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">new religious movements</a> (NRMs, a subset of which have gained the popular designation of "<a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cults</a>"), some young people suddenly adopted <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faiths</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief.html" title="Belief">beliefs</a>, and behavior that differed markedly from their previous lifestyles and seemed at variance with their upbringings. In some cases, these people neglected or even broke contact with their families. All of these changes appeared very strange and upsetting to their families. To explain these phenomena, the theory was postulated that these young people had been brainwashed by these new religious movements by isolating them from their family and friends (inviting them to an end of term camp after university for example), arranging a sleep deprivation program (3 a.m. prayer meetings) and exposing them to loud and repetitive chanting. Another alleged technique of religious brainwashing involved <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_bombing.html" title="Love bombing">love bombing</a> rather than <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">torture</a>.</p>
<p>James Richardson, a Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Nevada_93ae.html" title="University of Nevada">University of Nevada</a>, states that if the NRMs had access to powerful brainwashing techniques, one would expect that NRMs would have high growth-rates, while in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment, most adherents participate for only a short time, and that the success in retaining members has been limited. Langone has rejected this claim, comparing the figures of various movements, some of which do (by common consent) not use brainwashing and others of which some authors report as using brainwashing. (Langone, 1993)</p>
<p>In their <i>Handbook of Cults and Sects in America</i>, Bromley and Hadden present one possible ideological foundation of brainwashing theories that they state demonstrates the lack of scientific support: they argue that a simplistic perspective they see as inherent in the brainwashing metaphor appeals to those attempting to locate an effective social weapon to use against disfavored groups, and that any relative success of such efforts at social control should not detract from any lack of scientific basis for such opinions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Zimbardo_5dca.html" title="Philip Zimbardo">Philip Zimbardo</a>, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, writes "Whatever any member of a cult has done, you and I could be recruited or seduced into doing -- under the right or wrong conditions. The majority of `normal, average, intelligent' individuals can be led to engage in immoral, illegal, irrational, aggressive and self destructive actions that are contrary to their values or personality -- when manipulated situational conditions exert their power over individual dispositions."(Zimbardo, 1997)</p>
<p>Some religious groups, especially those of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> origin, openly state that they seek to improve what they call the "natural" human mind by spiritual exercises. Intense spiritual exercises have an effect on the mind, for example by leading to an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altered_state_of_consciousness.html" title="Altered state of consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a>. These groups also state that they do not [condone the] use [of] coercive techniques to acquire or to retain converts.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, several scholars in sociology and psychology have in <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2007.html" title="As of 2007">recent</a> years stated that many scholars of NRMs express a bias to deny any possibility of brainwashing and to disregard actual evidence. (Zablocki 1997, Amitrani 1998, Kent 1998, Beit-Hallahmi 2001)</p>

Many scholars in the field of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">new religious movements</a> do not accept Hassan's <a href="http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/articles/BITE.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/articles/BITE.htm" rel="nofollow">BITE model</a> for understanding <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cults</a>.</p>
