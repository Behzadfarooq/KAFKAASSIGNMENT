<p>I just edited the Passion For Fashion Diamonds movie section. Someone was a bit enthusiastic about the movie and made it a little confusing. I'm not sure if I got it right though, since I've never seen the movie. Could someone check this section up?

<p>I think each character should just have their own page for description, seeing as the main article is getting cluttered with descriptions that aren't even always accurate (most characters have different eye colours in different lines, as well as some having hair variances.)</p>
<p>Also: Please stop putting ethnic backgrounds when none have been officially specified. Kumi can be assumed to be Japanese since she has a Japanese name and debuted in a Japan line; Jade cannot, seeing as she doesn't even have a Japanese name and has never had an official heritage announced.</p>
<p>Sasha being labeled as "African American" is debatable. She does ship in "AA shipments", but so do most dolls of dark complexions. Many people of Indian heritage have a similar skin tone - Genie Magic Sasha in particular looks like an Indian girl. Even if African heritage was established, she would be African Chinese - the Bratz are made in China.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcy_d279.html" title="User:Alcy">Alcy</a> 08:30, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Wouldn't it just be better if there was a separate page for all the character descriptions? There are probably too many characters for them each to have their own page. --24.166.11.85 14:17, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are some characters where there isn't that much information in regards to, but others (particularly the first four) are significant enough to merit larger articles - look at the ones for Sasha and Jade for good examples. It wouldn't be consistent to make articles for only the most significant and have the others described elsewhere...<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcy_d279.html" title="User:Alcy">Alcy</a> 08:13, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well there are some main characters who have thier own page.</p>

<p>Can somebody tell me what it's about?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
- It criticises the emphasis on body that many believe Bratz places on children from a young age (as detailed in the criticism section). The plot revolves around the introduction of a new girl into the Bratz class who has what is considered a facial deformity known as a "nose" (a play on the Bratz dolls distinctive barely pronounced nose). The Bratz take pity on her and treat her to a makeover at the mall, which culminates in a visit to Nurse Barbie's cosmetic surgery where the new girl's nose is violently removed. It also contains reference to the sexualisation and racial sterotyping issues that are mentioned in this Wiki article.</p>
<p>Saw it.. funny but the ending was CREEPY... *shudders*</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>- Someone's got rid of the link to Girlz. Any reason for this? Seems a valid link in realtion to the controversy section.</p>
<p><b>Girlz</b>, which was uploaded to <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> nine months ago, is an amateur video parody of the Bratz by a guy named William Compton-Howlett and it was never announced in public and wasn't shown on TV, this is the reason why should not be there on the article. This video is absolutely not funny for me, the end made me very offensive, when I saw this video and there are some racial content to African American girl, <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sasha_%28Bratz_character%29_dc35.html" title="Sasha (Bratz character)">Sasha</a>, who is one of the main character of the doll line. I couldn't believe that there was Barbie in the story, the "main rival of the Bratz"! I think the humor was very far from being funny. Thanks for this video for discovering YouTube by the way. 86.101.211.226 11:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, the "criticism" and "controversy" over the dolls has absolutely no bearing (I will leave it be on the article, however). This is because people have often accused <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> of the exact same things. (sigh) It's scary the way some people take things out of context...</p>
<p>How is a controversy directly concerning this line of dolls out of context? (sigh)</p>

Some people (i.e., parents, etc) think that the toyline promotes consumerism and materialism; something I figured the parents, etc, thought <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> was doing. However, it's not about that at all. Even if fashion isn't YOUR passion, if you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything. The idea here is that Bratz girls believe in their "passion for fashion", and are able to accomplish many different things such as <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratz_Rock_Angelz_b0a7.html" title="Bratz Rock Angelz">starting a band</a>, etc. In other words, just like Mattel's Barbie, the whole point is to encourage the "target audience" that if they believe in themselves, and the things they really like to do, they can accomplish anything, even if you're not interested in the fashion industry, or things related to it. However, the parents, etc, don't seem to see that. Now MGA has screated the "Bratz Kidz" (if at least in part) in order to remind everyone of the difference between fantasy and reality; the "Kidz" line being reality and the main line being fantasy. I hope this clears up what I meant.</p>

<p>Are the diamonds real? From what I have seen (and I work at a department store where we DO sell these dolls) they look to be like rhinestones or something and the "Certificate" looks fake from the advert. (Guest58.160.202.9 08:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

The Bratz Babyz section doesn't mention any controversy, it's just a description of what they are. Also, the "loose morals and focus on image" section is very poorly written and needs a NPOV. 01:24, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the "passion for fashion" slogan proves most of what you've said to be untrue. The Bratz dolls in my opinion appear to be over sexualised considering they are meant to portray young girls. What our individual "opinions" about the show and dolls message are irrelevent. This is an encyclopedia. The controversy exists, so we should document it. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostsocks_4aad.html" title="User:Lostsocks">Lostsocks</a> 23:55, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Where is the NPOV, people?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also think that these "Dolls" are promoting the sexualization of young girls. I find the blurring of lines between call girl and 8-year old disturbing. But the bigger issue is that this is an encyclopedia. Just because that's how you feel doesn't mean you enter it into Wikipedia. Even if you think others agree with you. Your job is to gauge the support for your point of view and represent it accurately. If it turns out that you and joe schmoe running a website agree, that's not enough to constitute a controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do some research and find some documentable sources to show that there is a real controversy. Your opinion doesn't count as controversy. (and by the way, I do personally believe that I'm not the only one out there who thinks of them as Wh**z and Sl**z, I just haven't bothered coming up with the evidence)</dd>

<dd>I think it's kind of stupid how people think of the Bratz as whores just because of the way they dress... "sexiness" isn't even mentioned in the Bratz universe. Also, they aren't supposed to be 8-year olds they are supposed to be teenagers, and they reflect the way modern teenagers dress, which is why they are so popular. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 07:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, here comes the pain!

It reveals to be a large nonsense, Bratz don't interest in fighting boys for example. The Bratz movie is based on fashion dolls, NOT action figures. When the upcoming movie is announced, the press release about it said that MGA Entertainment teams up with Crystal Sky Pictures and Avi Arad Production to make a live-action feature movie. So please don't re-edit the article with the wrestling film nonsense, or else this will need some protection.86.101.211.226 21:27, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have heard numerous reports recently on my local news about new 'karaoke' bratz dolls that have been stiring up controversy. Apparently, the dolls say 'how cute' which sounds exactly like 'fuck you.' I can't find any respectible written reports for sources, so does anybody else know information about this? 69.149.226.40 17:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I found the <a href="http://www.mgae.com/Bratz_karaoke_response.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mgae.com/Bratz_karaoke_response.html" rel="nofollow">response about it on MGA's website</a>. Reading at the lyrics, the profanity thing can be a technical glitch or something. Or maybe when girls tried to sing the theme of the Bratz Babyz, somebody went wrong, and swore because of that, and put that recording by mistake. OR, it can be happening that a Chinese worker hacked the chip so, that it will appear profanity, when he or she worked 94 hours a week, with earning only 17 cents an hour. And by the way, the dolls say "so cute". 86.101.211.226 11:26, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Other media reports can be found as well, but all of them I've watched don't have the guts to actually <i>play</i> the allegedly offending lyrics; merely bleeping them out.

<p>I don't really think so. It's just the "nightmare" of parents, who have daughters, who want Bratz dolls and the "dirty fantasy" of the teenagers. I think the oversize head caused to have big eyes and lips. Imagine if their would be as big as normally would be, the lips and eyes would shrink as well (the ears and the nose not changing). I think it's just a kind of "phobia" by parents, because children will encouraged to anything like the dolls. The media is much worse, believe me. I saw fourth grade girls in my former elementary school, who do their make up, and have a bit revealing clothes (I think), and I don't think they know a word about Bratz. I'm Hungarian by the way, if you're wondering and the Bratz isn't popular there. 86.101.211.226 09:06, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. The preppies at my old school who pose for imaginary camramen, they look just like the Bratz and you can just tell that they used to/still play with the dolls. It's disgusting. 24.9.121.137 02:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, I'm not a prude or anything, but I see these things in the stores and I swear they're the collective polyamorous harem of Chucky! They're skanky weird little alien-type creatures with sly expressions that make the ladies of the evening walking down the strip in Vegas look downright wholesome. And they're supposed to be children's toys. Who dreamt this creepiness up, Michael Jackson?</p>
