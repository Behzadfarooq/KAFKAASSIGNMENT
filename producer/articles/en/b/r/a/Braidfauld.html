<p>"Braid" is Old Scots for the top of a slope. A "fauld" was the poorer part of the village fields left fallow until manured by grazing sheep or cattle. "<i>Braidfauld</i>" was the "<i>fallow land at the top of the slope</i>". Similarly, "<i>Maukinfauld</i>" was the "<i>fallow land pestered by hares</i>" ("<i>maulken</i>s" in Scots). Braidfauld Street ran to a farm of that name, as Maukinfauld Road, in the middle of the district, ran to the farm after which it is named.</p>

<p>As seen above. most of the buildings in Braidfauld are residential and they pretty much reflect the development working class housing in Glasgow during the last two centuries.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braidfauld.html" title="Edit section: 18th century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">18th century</span></h4>
<p>None of the 18th Century country mansions build along the Clyde by Glasgow merchants - <i><b>Easterhill House, Dalbeth House, Westthorn House</b></i> and <i><b>Belvidere House</b></i> - has survived, though each was photographed in the late 19th century. The buildings at the entrance to 1920 London Road may be the remains of the lodge for Dalbeth House.</p>
<p>The <i><b>Farm Shop</b></i> in Cuthelton Street may originally have been part of the 18th century farm in that area.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braidfauld.html" title="Edit section: 19th Century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">19th Century</span></h4>
<p>The <i><b>administration building</b></i> for St Peter’s Cemetery, Dalbeth was certainly part of the 19th Century Convent of the Good Shepherd and may incorporate part of the original <i><b>Dalbeth House</b></i>.</p>
<p>Eastwards of the entrance to the driveway is a much remodelled <i><b>19th century cottage</b></i>, set back from the road at the entrance to the <i><b>Nun’s Cemetery</b></i>.</p>
<p>Half-a mile westwards on London Road, opposite the entrance to the former Belvidere Hospital, is a much <i><b>re-modelled two storey family house,</b></i> possibly related to the original farm. It is of locally quarried sandstone and so is probably of about the middle of the century.</p>
<p>Overlooking Tollcross Road, and set in its original grounds, is the magnificent <i><b>Tollcross House</b></i>, built in 1848.</p>

Tollcross House 1848</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was built (of gray ashlar) for one of the partners of Clyde Ironworks, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dunlop_f8aa.html" title="James Dunlop">James Dunlop</a>. The architect was <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bryce_c04e.html" title="David Bryce">David Bryce</a> who also designed <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fettes_College_16e1.html" title="Fettes College">Fettes College</a> in Edinburgh and Balfour Castle in <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney.html" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> which shares with Tollross House the Scots Baronial style of crowstepped gables, circular towers with conical caps, massed chimneys and mullioned windows. The family gave up living there as tenements invaded the surrounding area. The grounds became Tollcross Park in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1897.html" title="1897">1897</a> and the buildings became a Children’s Museum, housing the locally famous <i>“Who killed Cock Robin?”</i> display of stuffed birds, small mammals and incects. It also had the last deer shot in the park -"Bobbie" - stuffed and on display. The building was turned into flats in 1998 (and the display moved to the Forge shopping mall a mile away).</p>
<p>Two lines of back-to-back ‘grey sandstone’ cottages was build (of) about the same time between Maukinfauld Road and Clydeford Drive. (A row of similar cottages at <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auchenshuggle.html" title="Auchenshuggle">Auchenshuggle</a> was demolished in the 1960s).</p>
<p>All that remains of the ruins of <i><b>Belvidere Hospital</b></i> is the imposing, if forbidding, <i><b>Administration Building</b></i>, in classical style and of the same ‘grey’ sandstone. This is soon to be transformed into flats.</p>
<p>With the coming of railways, sandstone could be easily transported over long distances and buildings began to be built of an attractive red sandstone, usually quarried at Lockerbie.</p>

Red sandstone flats in Tollcross Road</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A two storey family house in the middle of the drive to St Peter’s Cemetery at 1920 London Road is of red brick, rather than sandstone. More imposing is the stately line of four- storey <i><b>red sandstone tenement flats</b></i>, known as the <i><b>Deer Park</b></i> flats, built at the turn of the century along Tollcross Road, beside the park and running towards Parkhead Cross. These continue further along Tollcross Road, following a stately parallel line towards Parkhead Cross. (At the juncture with Makinfauld Road, shops and a pub formed the ground floor. There is also a small shop built into the middle of the tenements opposite the main park gates.) <a name="20th_Century"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braidfauld.html" title="Edit section: 20th Century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">20th Century</span></h4>
<p>The finest red sandstone flats were some quaintly <i><b>Art Nouveau tenements</b></i> built in 1902 in Helenvale Street by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hamilton_9be0.html" title="John Hamilton">John Hamilton</a> (an architect who also did <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawlands.html" title="Shawlands">Shawlands</a> Cross Parish Church Halls and Sir John Stirling Maxwell Primary in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollokshaws.html" title="Pollokshaws">Pollokshaws</a>).</p>

Art Nouveau effects in Parkhead</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are continued into Whitby Street, close to where Parkhead Stadium Station used to be.</p>
<p>No more traditional tenements were to be built after these, though they together with the Deer Park tenements mentioned above still highly sought-after places to live. The <i><b>flats above the Tavern Pub</b></i> in Tollcross Road are pre-First World War.</p>
<p>Increasing use of railways for transporting materials meant that traditional sandstone in building was replaced by brick (often rendered) and slates replaced by tiles. Traditional designs were also often given up in favour of designs from pattern books, especially where there was pressure on costs.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century domestic building was exclusively carried on by the City Council, ( <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Corporation_6bce.html" title="Glasgow Corporation">Glasgow Corporation</a> ),or later Housing Associations, and it was not until the 1980s that private housing began to make a comeback.</p>
<p>The 1919 (Addison) and 1924 Housing (Wheatley) Acts gave local councils a duty to build houses for working class citizens for which central government provided a subsidy. The aim was to provide “homes fit for heroes” - the heroes being the soldiers returning from the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> .The Minister responsible for the 1924 Act was a local man named <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wheatley_56f9.html" title="John Wheatley">John Wheatley</a>. The Glasgow council (<a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Corporation_6bce.html" title="Glasgow Corporation">Glasgow Corporation</a> ) eventually envisaged three grades of housing schemes. “<i>Ordinary</i>” schemes were to be built to a high specification in estate layout, building and fitments, and so were to be let at a relatively high rent. They were mostly four-in-a-block flats, each flat with its own front door, with some semi-detached and short terraces here and there. They were made of brick and roofed with tiles. Churches, shopping parades and community centres were to be incorporated. These ‘garden suburb’ houses - an idea imported from the south - were let to teachers and semi-professional council employees. Examples in Glasgow were built at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carntyne.html" title="Carntyne">Carntyne</a> , <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossend.html" title="Mossend">Mossend</a> and <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knightswood.html" title="Knightswood">Knightswood</a>. The logic of these developments (in terms of supporting the ‘working classes’) was that those who moved to these areas would release relatively high quality tenements for incoming working class tenants. These schemes, like red sandstone tenements, remain highly desirable places to stay. None was built in Braidfauld.</p>
<p>A second grade of council housing were ‘<i>Intermediate</i>’ schemes, aimed at skilled and semi-skilled workers who could afford the rent, still exists today in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbank.html" title="Newbank">Newbank</a> , built opposite (and possibly for the staff of) Belvidere Hospital. This 1920s ‘Intermediate’ housing scheme took on many of the aspects of the ‘Ordinary’ schemes - four-in-a-block cottage style flats with gardens and some area landscaping and is still attractive today.</p>
<p>At the lower end of the spectrum were “<i>Rehousing</i>” estates built to receive those cleared from slum areas of Glasgow.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><a href="../../../r/e/h/Image%7ERehousing_tenements_c1935.jpg_befe.html" class="internal" title="Rehousing tenements c1935"><img src="../../../upload/thumb/0/0b/Rehousing_tenements_c1935.jpg/180px-Rehousing_tenements_c1935.jpg" alt="Rehousing tenements c1935" width="180" height="112" longdesc="../../../r/e/h/Image%7ERehousing_tenements_c1935.jpg_befe.html" class="thumbimage" /></a>

Rehousing tenements c1935</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These were built under the 1930 (Greenwood) and 1935 Housing Acts, when the pressure to house many thousands was greater and the central government subsidy smaller. The specification was much lower than “<i>Ordinary</i>” schemes. (Each block cost about £250 to build in contrast to the £1000 it took to build an ‘Ordinary’ block.) A reversion was made to the tenement model, though in ‘modern’ guise, the estate was not well laid out and no provision was made for shops or community buildings. The tenants, who were mostly unskilled, would be charged a low rent.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbank.html" title="Newbank">Newbank</a> and the whole of <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilybank.html" title="Lilybank">Lilybank</a> was given over to "Rehousing" grade houses during the 1930s. Most were demolished in the 1990s, though you can still see examples a mile further east in Dunira Street.</p>
<p>The <i><b>1930s houses</b></i> in these areas were what were to become standard 3-storey tile-roofed tenements of grey reconstituted stone, with back-courts for drying greens. The flats - normally six, all accessed from a doorless close - were mostly of 2, 3 or 4 bedroom, built to accommodate tenants cleared from the 19th century "slums" of <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garngad.html" title="Garngad">Garngad</a> ,<a href="../../../c/a/l/Calton%2C_Glasgow_da87.html" title="Calton, Glasgow">Calton</a> and Camlachie. By contrast with the houses they had left, the new ones had some amenity - a toilet and bathroom, a kitchen with an oven back-to-back with the fireplace in the adjoining main room, a gas boiler, two sinks linked by wringer, a pulley and a coal bunker. The main living room had an open coal fire and there was a "meat press" (a cupboard ventilated from the outside) in the corner. Other rooms were heated by gas fires and each room had an electric light and socket. (Electricity and gas were at that time generated by the council itself).</p>
<p>There was an attempt to give the resuscitated tenement model a ‘modernist’ air by using reconstituted concrete, but this did not weather well. There were however, no schools, churches, public houses, or other communal facilities, so tenants had to make use of amenities in Tollcross and Parkhead.</p>
<p>Between Maukinfauld Road and Braidfauld Street is a <i><b>post- World War II development</b></i> of low-rise houses, many semi-detached or short terraces.</p>
<p>A range of low-rise "maisonette"-type houses, some in closes, some short terraces, were build in Glenisla Street in the <i><b>1960s'</b></i>. They are brick built and roof-tiled</p>
<p>Three high-rise blocks of flats, in part over the disused railway and station, were erected between Helenvale Street and Springfield Road in <i><b>1967 - 69</b></i>. They were built by George Wimpey, a locally well-known builder. Improvements in public housing continued with a new, modern <i><b><a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilybank.html" title="Lilybank">Lilybank</a> Housing Estate</b></i> being opened in <i><b>2000</b></i> by the Scottish Minister for Housing, <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_MacDonald_279b.html" title="Lewis MacDonald">Lewis MacDonald</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the council began releasing land for private development (something it had previously declined to do). Eastwards along the railway, new houses were erected in the <i><b>1990s</b></i> as was a development known as <i>The Potteries</i> (on the site of the old <i><b>Govancroft Pottery</b></i>).

<p>There only major industrial or commercial buildings are the late 19th century <i><b>Parkhead Bus Depot</b></i> (formerly a tram depot) on Tollcross Road, the <i><b>United Biscuits factory</b></i> in Clydeford Drive and a range of <i><b>hangar-type developments</b></i> along the London Road in the old Westthorn estate, mostly concerned with bottling or storing whiskey (Allied Distillers and John Dewar &amp; Sons Ltd).</p>
<p><i><b>Braidfauld’s pubs</b></i> are all in Tollcross Road, - <i><b>The Tavern</b></i>, (built especially to be near Parkhead depot), <i><b>The Bells</b></i>, opposite Tollcross Park, and midway between them <i><b>The Grapes</b></i> (both part of 19th century tenements which also include small shops).

<p>There are no public buildings in Braidfauld except the <i><b>Fire Station</b></i> in Cutheton Street and <i><b>Calton-Parkead Church</b></i> in Helenvale Street (perched originally above the railway). The fire station was built of red brick in the <i><b>late 1940s.</b></i> The church was built as <i><b><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbank.html" title="Newbank">Newbank</a> Church</b></i> by the Church of Scotland in 1934-35 to replace a mission hut nearby (the ‘<i>Tin Church’</i>). As its name suggests, its original congregation had been cleared from the slums of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calton%2C_Glasgow_da87.html" title="Calton, Glasgow">Calton</a> and Camlachie and it was built of brick to a vaguely early Christian (though decidedly modern) style. The interior has arcades of round arches on circular stone piers with scallop capitals and a big semi-circular arch to the raised chancel. The architects were <i>Hutton and Taylor</i> who also designed <i>King’s Park Parish Church</i>, which too was part of a significant church building programme by the Church of Scotland at that time. The stained glass windows are by Gordon Webster and are more recent - the <i>Crucifixion</i> in the chancel (1970) and <i>St Luke</i> in the aisle (1971).</p>
<p>There used to be a <i>Roman Catholic parish church of the Good Shepherd</i>, built by the one of the <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Pugin_4d2f.html" title="Augustus Pugin">Peter Paul Pugin</a>, but this was demolished in the 1970s.</p>

Trams at Auchenshuggle terminus in June 1962</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Braidfauld Street was the terminus of the famous Number 9 <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auchenshuggle.html" title="Auchenshuggle">Auchenshuggle</a> tram, opposite the Auchenshuggle woods, where there is reputed to be a rare "Auchenshuggle Orchid". <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auchenshuggle.html" title="Auchenshuggle">Auchenshuggle</a> was a hamlet slightly to the north east, and was part of the <i><b>Easterhill Estate</b></i>, which ran down to the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Clyde_ffa3.html" title="River Clyde">River Clyde</a>. <i>Easterhill House</i>, erected as a country retreat by Glasgow merchants in the 19th century has disappeared. Other farms underlying modern Braidfauld were <i><b>Braidfauld, Maukinfauld, Newbank farms</b></i> (mentioned on an 1865 map) and (perhaps) <i><b>Lilybank farm</b></i>.</p>
<p><a name="Dalbeth" id="Dalbeth"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braidfauld.html" title="Edit section: Dalbeth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dalbeth</span></h3>
<p>Beyond the woods is the site of the <i><b>Dalbeth Estate</b></i>. The estate was primarily a country retreat, but the owners worked the freestone and coal underneath. It is even said some local gold was found while, in the shallows of the Clyde large mussel-like bi-valves often provided serviceable pearls. Here Thomas Hobkirk established the prize collection of rare plants which became the basis of the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Botanic_Gardens_f08d.html" title="Glasgow Botanic Gardens">Glasgow Botanic Gardens</a> in the West-end.</p>
<p>Later, in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a>, Dalbeth returned (after 300 years) to the possession of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> . The Sisters of Our Lady of the Good Shepherd established a Magdelen Asylum , where unmarried mothers could work out their penitence. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a> , they established a Girls' Reformatory. A Boy's Reformatory was established later, slightly further west, in Westthorn Mills. A Church designed by Peter Paul Pugin ( <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> ) , (brother of <a href="../../../e/2E/w/E.W._Pugin_cae7.html" title="E.W. Pugin">E.W. Pugin</a> ) in typical ornate style, with three naves, was opened in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a> . It became the Parish Church in 1948 and the Reformatory buildings became the Good Shepherd R.C. Primary School. The Church and school were closed in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> and later demolished, along with the Primary School/ Reformatory Buildings. The land is now being used as an extension to Dalbeth Cemetery .</p>
<p>Like the other great houses erected by Glasgow merchants, <i>Dalbeth House</i> has disappeared as has the 19th century Convent, though the administration building of the Cemetery may incorporate parts of both. The sisters' cemetery is still there, slightly to the side of the much larger St Peter's Cemetery, Dalbeth, which included a Jews' Cemetery in the 19th century. There are distinctive Polish and Italian parts of the cemetery, and many locally famous Catholics (including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wheatley_56f9.html" title="John Wheatley">John Wheatley</a>) are buried there.</p>

<p>Across London Road, at the corner of Potter Street, was the substantial <i>Govancroft Pottery</i>. At one point this had (according to the <i>Pottery Society</i>), " <i>a monopoly of (ceramic) jam jars</i>" which it exported throughout the world. Latterly, it produced distinctive thistle shaped ware. A quick search on the website indicates that there is still a substantial trade among collectors for them. The pottery was closed in 1976. A pleasant set of modern houses has taken their place, appropriately called "<i>The Potteries</i>".</p>

<p>Further west again (close by the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Celtic_9c59.html" title="Glasgow Celtic">Glasgow Celtic</a> supporters' club) is what remains of Westthorn Park (the allotments only, the cycle track and football fields having been removed).

Westthorn was the site of riots in the early 19th century. '''<i><b>Thomas Harvie'''</b></i> became the new owner of Westthorn House and estate. He tried to cut off a right of way (from <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalmarnock.html" title="Dalmarnock">Dalmarnock</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmyle.html" title="Carmyle">Carmyle</a> ) in 1819.The riots were put down by the military (the <a href="../../../e/n/n/Enniskillen.html" title="Enniskillen">Enniskillen</a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragoons.html" title="Dragoons">Dragoons</a>) under the direction of the Sheriff. However,the locals, supported by a fund raised by Glasgow democrats, took Harvie to court - all the way to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> - and eventually won their case. Mr Harvie owned a distillery in Port Dundas. Nowadays the site of Westthorn House is occupied by a bottling plant for <i>John Dewar and Sons</i>.</p>

"<i>If no single club could claim total dominance over the period (ie the first half of the 20th century) Parkhead at least merit an honourable mention with three league titles (one shared); four Glasgow Cups; two Junior cups and three other appearances in the final</i>".

<p>Further west from Westthorn Park lies the site of the former Belvidere Estate. This used to be called Wester Dalbeth, but was renamed in the late 18th Century in response to the beauty of the site. However, a brickfield site was established there in the mid-19th century. In 1870 there was a smallpox epidemic in Glasgow which threatened to overpower the cities charity hospitals. The Council bought the Belvidere estate and established, in that country area, the "City Hospitals" there for infectious diseases. The original wooden isolation pavilions were replaced by 19 smallpox pavilions by 1887. It became the Belvidere Hospital for infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis, with airy wards, including beds on balconies overlooking Westthorn Park. Finally, it became a geriatric hospital before closing in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. Except for the imposing Administration building, the buildings have been demolished. There are plans (2006) to incorporate the Administration building in set of new flats.</p>

Parkhead Stadium Station</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Glasgow Central Railway ran through Bridgeton Station and under London Road, emerging from a tunnel at Dalriada Street. In Whitby Street, a few minutes to the north west of Belvidere, there used to be Parkhead Stadium Station, famously visited once by George V and Queen Mary on their way to Beardmore's Steelworks in Parkhead, which was the major employer in the area. This has completely disappeared, as have most of the ancillary engineering and boiler-making small firms. (There was a spur from the railway to <i><b>John Thomson (Wilson's Boilers)</b></i> along the back courts of Dunning Street). Parkhead Tram Dept, on Tollcross Road lives on as a bus garage, but the only major employer is United Biscuits (in Clyedford Drive) though there are distribution warehouses along the London Road. <a name="Helenvale_Street_Recreation_Ground" id="Helenvale_Street_Recreation_Ground"></a></p>

<p>Helenvale Street is also the home of the large recreation ground, created originally for employees of Glasgow City Transport. It contained a Bowling Green and a football ground. This was opened on the 2nd of September <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> when the then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a> (later <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_IV_8f6e.html" title="King George IV">King George IV</a>) kicked off a match between <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Rangers_1321.html" title="Glasgow Rangers">Glasgow Rangers</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partick_Thistle_5475.html" title="Partick Thistle">Partick Thistle</a>. <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_Rangers_1321.html" title="Glasgow Rangers">Rangers</a> won.
