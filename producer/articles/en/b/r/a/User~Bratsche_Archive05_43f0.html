<p>A viola player is returning from a gig, and feeling tired, decides to stop at a roadside cafe for a rest and a cup of coffee. Halfway through the cup he remembers he's left his viola on the passenger's seat of the car. He rushes outside, but it's too late. Someone has broken the window and put two more violas on the rear seat.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What does a viola player do so as not to look ridiculous? He puts his viola into a violin case.
<dl>
<dd>Why are viola jokes so short? So violinists can understand them.

<dd>"Haven't I seen your face before?" a judge demands, looking down at the defendant. "You have, Your Honour," the man answers hopefully. "I gave your son viola lessons last winter." "Ah yes." recalls the judge. "Twenty Years!"

<p>Hi, Bratsche. Many thanks for your kind comments on my talk page. Yes, I'm interested in being nominated when I have 2,000 edits, which will probably be in the next two weeks. And by the way, I have Private Butcher's page on my watchlist, so I've noticed (and appreciated) your kindness to him! Regards, Ann Heneghan <sup>(talk)</sup> 02:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since it was you that welcomed me when I first started editing you get the question. I've expanded a stub <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Tomiki_aa66.html" title="Kenji Tomiki">Kenji Tomiki</a> and fixed up a page that was marked as poorly written <a href="../../../i/w/a/Iwama.html" title="Iwama">Iwama</a>. How do I get the designations changed or reviewed - is it done automatically. The help section wasn't clear. Finally I think someone has messed with one of your links - there is some vandalism in your message to me - but I can't remove it. Cheers. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 10:12, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>You might want to take a look at <a href="../../../c/%C3%B4/t/Talk%7EC%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire_b400.html" title="Talk:Côte d'Ivoire">Talk:Côte d'Ivoire</a>. International usage on all major English speaking medias, as well as WP Manual of Style and NCs, suggest that that page should be at <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory_Coast_4413.html" title="Ivory Coast">Ivory Coast</a>. I proposed that it be moved. A lot of people insist that whatever the evidence most English speakers use Côte d'Ivoire and oppose a move tooth and nail.

<p>Can I ask you a question? Well I just recently logged on to my account here on Wikipedia and I saw my user page looked very strange. Things were all out of place and everything. I just wanna ask you, does it look that way for me or does everyone see it like that? (What I see is &lt;center&gt; signs and everything all over my page. I also checked the edit history to see if someone was messing with my page and it came up that I was the only one who has been editing on it.

<p>Hi, Bratsche. Just want to say a big thank you for nominating me and also for the kind things you wrote about me. I was amazed at how much support I got from people with whom I disagree! I saw from your page recently that you weren't going to be around much, so I was very glad to see your congratulations on my page this morning, because I particularly wanted to thank you. Hope you'll be around a little more than you have indicated, and that I'll be able to help you some time. Thanks again.

<p>Hello. Round four of Wikipedia Mind Benders will open on Thursday, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>. This round will be drastically different from round three; part one will consist of a creative project, and part two will be developed from there.

Time and speed should not be major factors in this round; thus, there is no exact opening time for the round as speed will not factor into the scoring.

<p>Hi, Bratsche. It's always good to hear from you, even when the subject of your message is one that I don't feel particularly comfortable about&#160;:-( and I'm glad to see that you seem to be contributing regularly again.</p>
<p>I did not know Essjay particularly well, but was unhappy with his Wikipedia:Catholic Church of Wikipedia (now moved to User:Sam Korn/Catholic Church of Wikipedia), and I sent him a polite note a few months ago, pointing that out. He made it clear that he would be happy to userfy it, and that if it came to a vote, he expected that the members would vote to keep it, those who opposed would vote to delete it, and others would vote according to their conscience.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Korn/Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=22300936&amp;oldid=22277378" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Korn/Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=22300936&amp;oldid=22277378" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>When you kindly nominated me for adminship, Essjay voted to support. (I don't know whether or not he had forgotten my name as one who had complained about his "church".) When my RfA was successful, I began to thank people, but got quite busy with assignments, and had to interrupt my thank yous. I still logged on occasionally, and during that period, Essjay's church <i>did</i> <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ECatholic_Church_of_Wikipedia_ee55.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Catholic Church of Wikipedia">come to a vote</a>. I voted to delete it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=29468275&amp;oldid=29467420" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=29468275&amp;oldid=29467420" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and he put a message on his user page (later deleted) saying something like "If it goes, I go. Permanently." I felt a bit embarrassed, knowing that he was one of the people I still had to thank, and that one of my first actions as an administrator had been to offend him, but I did not in any way regret having voted to delete that church. Then, although the vote had not closed and was very much looking like a "keep" consensus, he did a heavy edit on his userpage (now deleted), changing examples of "I am" to "Before I was martyred, I was". He also put Image:Wikistress3D 4 v3.jpg on his page, quoting underneath, as the caption, the words of Jesus from the Cross: "It is finished". He wrote on the church page: The Wikipope has been martyred.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Korn/Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=29605913&amp;oldid=29550423" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Korn/Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=29605913&amp;oldid=29550423" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Support messages came flooding in, with remarks from his supporters about the people who hadn't been nice to him (presumably meaning those who had voted to delete his church). The wub posted to the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7ECatholic_Church_of_Wikipedia_ee55.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Catholic Church of Wikipedia">vote for deletion page</a> linking to that massive userpage edit (now a broken link because of the deletion) with "<b>Congratulations!!</b> Look what you did." A few people made snide remarks about his departure. I had no part in those remarks. The church was moved to Sam Korn's user space, and Sam edited with a remark about people "not being nice to one another" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sam_Korn/Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=29709579&amp;oldid=29669337" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Sam_Korn/Catholic_Church_of_Wikipedia&amp;diff=29709579&amp;oldid=29669337" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>When my college pressure died down a little, I resumed my thank yous. Having seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29601271" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29601271" rel="nofollow">this</a>, I decided not to thank Essjay. I did, however, thank Redwolf24 (who had been, as far as I know, a good friend of Essjay, and who had clearly supported that church), trying to explain the reason for my vote.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redwolf24&amp;diff=30708492&amp;oldid=30671295" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redwolf24&amp;diff=30708492&amp;oldid=30671295" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> I have not received a reply.</p>
<p>The next step in this saga was that Essjay came back, saw that R. fiend had edited an article and had then reverted three times, and mistakenly counted his edit as a revert, and blocked for making four reverts. I was sure (and am still sure) that there were not four reverts. I asked for advice <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html#User:R._fiend" title="WP:AN/3RR">here</a>, and was told it would be appropriate to unblock. I did so, almost simultaneously with Sam Korn. Essjay came back and saw what we had done, reinstated the block, extended by twelve hours because R. fiend had reverted non-vandalism with the rollback button, left an indignant message <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31692370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31692370" rel="nofollow">on my talk page</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Korn&amp;diff=31692767&amp;oldid=31653167" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sam_Korn&amp;diff=31692767&amp;oldid=31653167" rel="nofollow">another at Sam's</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R._fiend&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31692132" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:R._fiend&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=31692132" rel="nofollow">another at R. fiend's</a>. I saw this when I got up in the morning, but was rushing into work, and just left another message at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, hoping that someone else would deal with it. It was getting more and more embarrassing for me. I unexpectedly had a free period at work, logged on from a staff computer, saw that nobody else had handled it, so unblocked again. Another admin, Extreme Unction, left a message saying that it was clearly not a 3RR violation, and that he was going to unblock if nobody else had done so.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AR._fiend&amp;diff=31727025&amp;oldid=31719265" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AR._fiend&amp;diff=31727025&amp;oldid=31719265" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> When I got home, I left a message for Essjay, which I have now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=31946821&amp;oldid=31899569" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Musical_Linguist&amp;diff=31946821&amp;oldid=31899569" rel="nofollow">copied to my own talk page</a>, in case he deletes <i>his</i>. Sam also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=31840278&amp;oldid=31759565" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&amp;diff=31840278&amp;oldid=31759565" rel="nofollow">left a message for him</a>. When Essjay saw the new messages, he deleted his own user page with the block log summary "Taking the hint".</p>
<p>I'm frankly stunned at the amount of ill feeling that this has caused, and certainly don't want to make matters worse by making lengthy comments on his reaction. Since he is getting so much support from his friends, I assume that he has done a lot of good here, and I did notice his kindness (and yours, by the way!) to Private Butcher. I will say, though, that I think his reaction has been unfair on me, as it seems to imply that I should have refrained from voting (politely) to delete something which I and many other Catholics found offensive, simply because my vote might make someone feel unappreciated, and that I should have left an incorrect block in place for the same reason. (I would not have unblocked if I had felt that a block was over harsh; but this one was based on a miscalculation of the number of reverts.) I did not intend the unblocking to be seen as criticism, and am quite shocked by what he wrote on his user page afterwards (no diff, as it's been deleted):</p>

<dd><i>My Wikipedia career came to an end in November 2005 after a number of stressors were capped off by a vitriolic and hateful attack against my work. Additional controversy arose on December 16 when a minor admin action (taken after reading a story on Yahoo! News about attacks on Wikipedia) received heavy criticism. As I obviously am unable to take even the slightest action without being attacked (by one of those who wanted me gone in the first place), I won't make the mistake of contributing again.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>(I did not heavily criticize him; I did not attack him; and I did not want him gone in the first place.)</p>
<p>I note that the heading of your message to me was "request", but you didn't actually make a request. Did you want me to leave a message for him? I think the wisest thing for me is to stay well away from his talk page. I have already explained to him why I didn't originally leave a message to discuss the block. I could not in sincerity express regret for having voted to delete his church, or for having unblocked R. fiend, and I think that a message saying that I don't regret what I did but that I regret that he's upset would offend him even more. If there is anything that you'd like me to do, please don't hesitate to suggest it, though.</p>
<p>Apologies if this very long message is cluttering up your page. In a way, I'm using you to get all this off my chest! It has been very unpleasant.

<p>Hi Cmd. Bratsche of the Barnstarium Army,</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for supporting me in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Deathphoenix_1b17.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Deathphoenix">my RfA</a> and for your offer of congratulations afterward. To tell you the truth, I was surprised by all the support I've gotten. I never saw myself as more than an occasional Wiki-hobbyist.</p>
<p>My wife sends her curses, as Wikipedia will likely suck up more of my time. She jokingly (I think) said she was tempted to log on to Wikipedia just to vote Oppose and let everyone know that she didn't want her husband to be an admin.</p>

<p>Hi there Bratsche. I noticed a few mistakes on the Esperanza members list and since you edited it earlier, can I point them out to you? Only two mistakes made.

<p><font color="#54C571">I disagree, at least to an extent. While it would be nice not to be a "lobbying group", acting as a cohesive unit towards making Wikipedia a nicer place, and I don't know about you, but I think if we could reduce on personal attacks, that would greatly assist in making the project a nicer place to be. However, we're going to have to realize our potential as a political force on Wikipedia before we can effectively reform <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> to the point where it is enforceable, because right now it definately is not. However, I hope we can figure out a solution to present to the general community internally first, and perhaps eventually create a new consensus gaining procedure that can be adopted by the general community, which would be just as valuable as reforming NPA itself, as evidenced from the rancor today at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Kelly_Martin_c312.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin</a>... which occured largely because policies and guideline are vague to the point where they are either not enforced, are too slow to react to our dynamic project or can be easily manipulated to serve personal goals. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 05:43, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</font></p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="#54C571">I didn't state my intent clearly it seems. For one, no, Kelly Martin's rfc is largely about disrespect of policy in regard to her actions, which I believe is largely due to the vagueness and unresponsiveness or policies and guidelines in general, particularly NPA, which is almost never enforced except by the arbcom.</font></dd>
<dd><font color="#54C571">This happens because it's not clear. Let's take your example. What if Joe was a registered member of the Nazi Party? Is it still a personal attack calling him a Nazi? What if he edits Nazi related articles with a pro-Nazi POV? Is it a personal attack then? What if a user acted with beliefs of a socially conservative, nationalistic, economically socialist slant? What if he had a userbox on his talk page saying he's a Nazi?</font></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><font color="#54C571">To me, an NPA is in the intent, not the words. However, for others it's different. And ultimately, that's the problem. Even though it says a few word saying general things roughly related to this, not only does it not hit upon any of these things precisely, but many users are at the point due to things like Kelly's recent actions(she's at the highest level of Wikipedia, and she acts that way, how are the rank and file people supposed to act?) where any meaning of policies and guidelines written on the page aren't trusted since they can easily be ignored or changed without any real reason other than an individual's intent to get their way.</font></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><font color="#54C571">I completely disagree with you in Esperanza's role in this. We can still be an oasis in the desert from all of this, but I'd much rather prefer getting rid of the desert altogether, and we can only do that as a group. I've made something of an experimental template <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_NPA_Reform_47fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza/NPA Reform">here</a> in regards to this. Please feel free to dismiss the entire idea if you'd like, I hope at the very least that this method can be used for gathering a clearer consensus in regards to policies or guidelines overall whether users on Esperanza agree with you or with me. I'd also like to thank you for your opinion in this matter, and I hope we can spread out the mutual respect we no doubt have for each other in these conversations to other users outside of Esperanza in one way or another. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 06:20, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>
