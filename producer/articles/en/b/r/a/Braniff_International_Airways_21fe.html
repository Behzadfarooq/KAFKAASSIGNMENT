<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> an insurance salesman and financier named Thomas E. Braniff financed an aviation company with his brother <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Revere_Braniff_1dcb.html" title="Paul Revere Braniff">Paul Revere Braniff</a>, named Paul R. Braniff, Inc. The airline was named Tulsa-Oklahoma City Airways and offered passenger service between most of the major cities in Oklahoma. The original Braniff brothers would remain a part of the company, even as the ownership was transferred repeatedly. Eventually Braniff would be purchased by what was to become today's American Airlines, however after briefly operating the Braniff division, the holding company shut the operation down.</p>

<p>The Braniff brothers restarted another airline in 1930 as Braniff Airways, Inc. During the 1930s, Braniff Airways expanded its service throughout the Midwest. Braniffâ€™s long-term survival was assured when Paul Braniff, then General Manager, flew to Washington, D.C., to petition for the Chicago-Dallas airmail route. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Post_Office_9706.html" title="United States Post Office">United States Post Office</a> granted Braniff its first airmail route, in the wake of the 1934 <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Mail_Scandal_78f4.html" title="Air Mail Scandal">Air Mail Scandal</a>. In 1935, Braniff became the first airline to fly from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.-Mexico_border_5188.html" title="U.S.-Mexico border">U.S.-Mexico border</a>. Paul Braniff left the airline in 1935 to pursue other interests but Tom Braniff retained control of the carrier and hired Charles "Chuck" Beard to run the airline's day-to-day operations. Beard would become President and CEO of Braniff in 1954.</p>
<p>Over the years, Braniff acquired a number of other airlines, as well as new <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-2_8ec9.html" title="Douglas DC-2">Douglas DC-2</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-3_fa22.html" title="Douglas DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a> aircraft to fuel its expansion. Most of its operational network remained focused on the midwestern north-south portion of the United States. During WWII, the airline leased a portion of its fleet to the United States military, and facilities at Dallas <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Field_937c.html" title="Love Field">Love Field</a> and throughout the country became training sites for pilots and mechanics. During the 1940s, Braniff was allowed by the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Aeronautics_Board_e136.html" title="Civil Aeronautics Board">Civil Aeronautics Board</a> to serve the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. These routes were served by the new and improved <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-6_7144.html" title="Douglas DC-6">Douglas DC-6</a> aircraft.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> the airline expanded nationwide. The acquisition of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-Continent_Airlines_d321.html" title="Mid-Continent Airlines">Mid-Continent Airlines</a> in 1952 allowed Braniff to add several more domestic cities to its already established north-south route system. On January 10, 1954, Thomas E. Braniff died in one of his personal planes, which crashed lakeside, on the shore of Lake Wallace, 15 miles outside of Shreveport, Caddo Parish, Louisiana.</p>
<p>According to information from Captain George A. Stevens: <i>Mr Braniff was on a hunting expedition with a group of important citizens of Louisiana, (including Milton Weiss - brother to Seymour Weiss, of Huey Long Fame). They were departing from a small duck hunting lake out of Shreveport in a new aircraft with no deicing system. The wings iced up and they attempted to land. One of the wings hit cypress stumps and the plane crashed against the shore. It caught fire and all 12 lives aboard were lost (including a number of Shreverport's most important civic leaders).</i></p>
<p>Paul R. Braniff died later that year of cancer. Charles "Chuck" Beard became the first non-Braniff President of the carrier after Tom's death. He would lead Braniff into the jet-age, and would be instrumental in turning Braniff into a 95% jet carrier by 1964.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, Braniff entered the jet age with the introduction of the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707-227.html" title="Boeing 707-227">Boeing 707-227</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braniff_International_Airways_21fe.html" title="Edit section: The End of the Plain Plane">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The End of the Plain Plane</span></h2>
<p>In 1964, Troy Post â€” then the chairman of Greatamerica Corporation, an insurance <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holding_company.html" title="Holding company">holding company</a> based in Dallas, Texas â€” purchased Braniff as part of an expansion of holdings which also included <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Car_Rental_af4d.html" title="National Car Rental">National Car Rental</a>. Both Braniff and National were chosen after Greatamerica <a href="../../../c/f/o/CFO_b598.html" title="CFO">CFO</a> C. Edward Acker identified them as particularly poorly managed companies. As part of the acquisition, Acker became Executive Vice President and CFO of Braniff as well.</p>
<p>In 1965, Post hired Harding L. Lawrence, the Executive Vice President of Continential Airlines, to become the new president of Braniff International. Harding viewed Braniff as a "backwater" airline â€” despite the facts that the airline had routes from North Dakota to Argentina, and was already the 11th-largest airline in the worldâ€”and sought to re-image Braniff. Over the next 15 years, Lawrence's aggressive expansion into new markets and ideas unorthodox for the airline industry would lead Braniff to record industry performance, expanding earnings tenfold (despite <a href="../../../l/o/a/Load_factor.html" title="Load factor">load factors</a> which hovered around 50%) and making the airline the sixth-largest airline in the world (although Braniff fell to the 14th largest airline from the late 60's until deregulation). Unfortunately, the same ideas which would catapult Braniff to the front of the American consciousness would eventually doom it to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>To overhaul the Braniff image, Lawrence hired Jack Tinker Associates, who assigned advertising executive <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Wells_Lawrence_3eaf.html" title="Mary Wells Lawrence">Mary Wells</a> as account leader. First on the agenda was to overhaul Braniff's public imageâ€”including the red, white, and blue <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livery.html" title="Livery">livery</a>â€”as they perceived that image as "staid". Two internationally famous trendsetters, New Mexico architect <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Girard_8f7a.html" title="Alexander Girard">Alexander Girard</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian</a> fashion designer <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emilio_Pucci_7aa7.html" title="Emilio Pucci">Emilio Pucci</a>, were called in, and with this new creative talent, Braniff began the "End of the Plain Plane" campaign.</p>
<p>At Girard's recommendation, the old livery was dropped in favor of a wide palette of bright colors. Girard wanted the planes painted from tail to nose in colors like "Chocolate Brown" and "Metallic Purple." He also favored a small "BI" logo and small titles. Braniff engineering, and Braniff's advertising department modified Girards colors, increased the "BI" logo, and added white wings and tails. The new "jelly bean" fleet consisted of such bold colors as beige, ochre, orange, turquoise, baby blue, medium blue, lemon yellow, and lavender. (Lavender was dropped after one month, as lavender and black were considered bad luck in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>.) Girard also outfitted the interiors with 57 different variations of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Miller_%28office_equipment%29_a139.html" title="Herman Miller (office equipment)">Herman Miller</a> fabrics. There were 15 colors used by Braniff for plane exteriors during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> (Harper &amp; George modified Girard's original seven colors in 1968). Many of the color schemes were applied to aircraft interiors, gate lounges, ticket offices, and even the corporate headquarters. Art to complement the color schemes was flown in from <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>.</p>
<p>Pucci used a series of nautical themes in overhauling the crew's uniforms. For the stewardesses, Pucci used "space age" themes, including plastic bubbles (resembling <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Video_f721.html" title="Captain Video">Captain Video</a> helmets) which the stewardesses could wear between the terminal and the plane to prevent any hairstyles from being disturbed. However, the "space bubble" was dropped after about a month, for multiple reasons: the helmets cracked easily, there was no place to store them onboard the aircraft, and <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetway.html" title="Jetway">jetways</a> at many airports made them unnecessary. The stewardess uniforms were also designed with interchangeable parts, which could be removed and added as needed.</p>
<p>In 1968, Braniff expanded an advertising campaign that showed the likenesses of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Liston_f234.html" title="Sonny Liston">Sonny Liston</a>, or a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Bunny_0560.html" title="Playboy Bunny">Playboy Bunny</a>, and other socialites of the time, all embellishing their experiences flying Braniff. It became one of the most celebrated marketing efforts Madison Avenue had ever produced, blending effectively a message of style and arrogance; one advertising slogan was "if you've got itâ€”flaunt it!" Though management considered the campaign a success, Braniff's core customers were outraged by the grandiose behavior and perceived "bragging", causing many corporate accounts to leave Braniff.</p>
<p>Operationally, Braniff entered the jet-age in 1959 with the 707-227. Braniff took delivery of four of these (another crashing before delivery) and was the only airline to order the -200 series from Boeing. (Braniff later sold the -227s to BWIA in 1971.) Boeing 720s would be added shortly after. In 1961, Braniff became the launch U.S. customer for the British-built <a href="../../../b/a/c/BAC-111_41cd.html" title="BAC-111">BAC-111</a> twin jet. By 1965, Braniff had a 95% jet fleet. With Lawrence's arrival in late spring 1965, the brash executive cancelled most of its remaining BAC-111 orders (placed under Charles Beard, Braniff President 1954-1965) in favor of the larger <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727.html" title="Boeing 727">Boeing 727</a>. Braniff eventually ordered several variants of the new Boeing type including the new "quick change" cargo/passenger variant, the stretched -200, and later the -200 Advanced. By 1969, the turboprop planes were all retired, making Braniff an "all jet" airline. By the mid-1970s, Braniff operated the largest fleet of <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727.html" title="Boeing 727">Boeing 727s</a> in the world, and pioneered the concept of fleet standardization and the efficiencies that a single type of aircraft could produce. Also during this period (1967), Braniff acquired <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American-Grace_Airways_3f57.html" title="Pan American-Grace Airways">Pan American-Grace Airways</a>, which increased its already strong presence in South America.</p>

<p>In-flight cuisine was a particular concern of Harding Lawrence's management team. Starting in 1965, an international board of chefs was assigned to "outdo" all the other airlines in food service. In 1971, Braniff chefs revamped the traditional sandwich into a "BRANwich", which was a hit with passengers. These were made by wrapping puff pastry around various fillings, rather like <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef_Wellington_79ec.html" title="Beef Wellington">beef Wellington</a>. So popular did the BRANwich become that recipes were published in major U.S. magazines.</p>

His contribution was a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_DC-8_3c95.html" title="Douglas DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a> known simply as "Flying Colors." In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, it was showcased at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Air_Show_fdff.html" title="Paris Air Show">Paris Air Show</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_France_1fae.html" title="Paris, France">Paris, France</a>. Its designs reflected the bright colors and simple designs of South America and Latin America, and was used mainly on South American flights. Later in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, he debuted "Flying Colors of the United States" to commemorate the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Bicentennial_f401.html" title="United States Bicentennial">Bicentennial of the United States</a>. This time, the aircraft was a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727-200.html" title="Boeing 727-200">Boeing 727-200</a>.

Calder died in 1976 as he was finalizing a third livery, termed "Flying Colors of Mexico"; this livery was not used on any plane.</p>
<p>In 1977, Braniff dropped <a href="../../../p/u/c/Pucci.html" title="Pucci">Pucci</a> as its designer of uniforms. American fashion and couture designer <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halston.html" title="Halston">Halston</a> was then brought on to bring a more <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> look back to Braniff. His all-leather looksâ€”dubbed the "Ultra" lookâ€”were applied to uniforms and the fleet, including Braniff's new <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727-200.html" title="Boeing 727-200">Boeing 727-200s</a> (and the "Flying Colors" planes as well). His uniforms and simplistic design were praised by critics and passengers.</p>
<p>In 1970, Braniff accepted delivery of the 100th <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a> builtâ€”a 747-127 model, N601BNâ€”and began "jumbo jet" service to <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> on January 15, 1971.

However, financial problems at the airline would soon make this question irrelevant.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braniff_International_Airways_21fe.html" title="Edit section: Deregulation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Deregulation</span></h2>
<p>Up to 1978, Braniff remained one of the fastest-growing and most-profitable airlines in the United States. But deregulation of the airline industry was to be introduced in 1978, and Braniff under Lawrence would misjudge this change.</p>
<p>Lawrence believed that the answer to deregulation was to expand Braniff's route system dramatically; consequently, the domestic system became 50% larger, with flights to 16 new cities. International hubs were created in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to handle expected increases in travel outside North America. This would have included flights to <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, as well as an "oil run" between Dallas, Houston, and <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubai.html" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>; these routes never entered service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, little of the expected new business materialized; 747 service from the new Boston hub proceeded particularly poorly, with the huge planes flying nearly empty. As a consequence of the new equipment and the new hubs, Braniff's debt expanded tremendously; more debt was generated in shifting Braniff's main base of flight operations from <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Field_937c.html" title="Love Field">Love Field</a> in Dallas to <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas-Fort_Worth_International_Airport_4911.html" title="Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport">Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport</a>, complete with a sprawling new headquarters just outside the new airport. Braniff's sub-par load factors, which were especially intolerable on the expensive-to-run 747s, and the large debts combined to produce massive financial shortfalls. The rising debts in addition to allegations of accounting fraud led to the removal of Harding Lawrence in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braniff_International_Airways_21fe.html" title="Edit section: Concorde">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Concorde</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a>, the world's second <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersonic.html" title="Supersonic">supersonic</a> airliner (the first being the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupolev_Tu-144_59df.html" title="Tupolev Tu-144">Tupolev Tu-144</a>) was the culmination of an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo.html" title="Anglo">Anglo</a>-French investment between <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>'s <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Aerospace_0993.html" title="British Aerospace">BAe</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>'s <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerospatiale.html" title="Aerospatiale">Aerospatiale</a>. The airline started service with Concorde in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> between <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas-Fort_Worth_International_Airport_4911.html" title="Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport">Dallas/Fort Worth</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> on interchange flights with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_27d0.html" title="Air France">Air France</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_c23d.html" title="British Airways">British Airways</a>. Flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Dulles_2369.html" title="Washington Dulles">Washington Dulles</a> airports were commanded by Braniff cockpit and cabin crews (including Braniff captains Manton Fain, Glenn Shoop, and Dean Smith) while <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> or French crews would take over for the remaining segment to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Over U.S. soil, the Concorde was limited to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach_number.html" title="Mach number">Mach</a> 0.95, though crews often flew just above Mach 1; the planes flew at Mach 2 over open water.</p>
<p>The Concorde service proved a fiscal disaster for Braniff. Though Braniff charged only a 10% premium over standard first-class fare to fly Concorde - and later removed the surcharge altogether - the 100-seat plane often flew with no more than 15 passengers. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727.html" title="Boeing 727">Boeing 727s</a> flying the same route were filled routinely. Consequently, Concorde service ended little more than a year after it began.</p>
<p>Although many postcards show a Braniff <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a>, the Braniff livery was never applied to both sides of a Concorde, and the aircraft remained in the ownership of British Airways throughout the operation.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 1981, Braniff dedicated a Boeing 727-227 with the colors of the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> team that chartered the aircraft for road games. The aircraft featured a Cowboys helmet on its tail section. The Cowboys had been a customer of Braniff throughout the 1970s.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The remains of the original Braniff are retained by a company named "Asworth" in Dallas. Asworth was formed out of the old "Dalfort" corporation (which was Braniff's holding company in the 1980s). Asworth is responsible for paying pilot pensions according to the Braniff Retired Pilots Group, B.I.S.E.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Many Braniff groups are active today, including:
<ul>
<li>The Retired Pilots, "The Braniff International Silver Eagles"</li>
<li>The Retired Hostess Organization, "The Clipped-B's"</li>
<li>The Braniff Retirement Club (Based in Dallas)</li>
<li>The Braniff Family Annual North Texas Reunion Organization</li>
<li>Braniff/Mid-Continent Reunion Club (who have met every year in Minnesota since 1978)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A portion of an old Braniff advertisement with a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727.html" title="Boeing 727">Boeing 727</a> appears after the end credits (where production company logos normally go) of every episode of <i><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a></i>. However, in 2001, the New York Trust that still owns the Braniff Trademarks informed South Park Studios not to use Braniff in any other formats. The 12-note riff played on top of this ad during earlier <i>South Park</i> episodes is from a song, "Shpadoinkle Day" from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trey_Parker_5b43.html" title="Trey Parker">Trey Parker</a>'s collegiate film project, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/Alferd_Packer%7E_The_Musical_90f7.html" title="Alferd Packer: The Musical">Alferd Packer: The Musical</a>" (later filmed as <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal%21_The_Musical_53ab.html" title="Cannibal! The Musical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></i>). The lyrics associated with those notes are "The sky is blue/and all the leaves are green."</li>

<li>Braniff International items with the now-famous "BI" logo on them such as playing cards, posters, air schedules, aircraft models, pins and serving ware have become collectibles.</li>
