She starred in a couple of television shows in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, including the popular <i><a href="../../../m/o/e/Moesha.html" title="Moesha">Moesha</a></i> in which she played the lead character, a rambunctious young teen. Later, she starred in <i><a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodger_And_Hammerstein_db70.html" title="Rodger And Hammerstein">Rodger And Hammerstein</a></i>’s television version of <i><a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a></i> (see <a href="http://www.foreverbrandy.com" class="external text" title="http://www.foreverbrandy.com" rel="nofollow">fan site</a>).</p>
<p>Although she is a successful actress, Brandy is better known for her singing career. She released her debut album in early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. It had the popular singles, "Best Friend," "Brokenhearted," "Baby," and "I Wanna Be Down" and made her an <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> star. Towards the end of that year, she contributed a song to the <i><a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiting_To_Exhale_f067.html" title="Waiting To Exhale">Waiting To Exhale</a></i> soundtrack, called "Sittin' Up In My Room". It became a huge hit in early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, fueled by a popular <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">rap</a> <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remix.html" title="Remix">remix</a> that featured <a href="../../../l/l/_/LL_Cool_J_76c7.html" title="LL Cool J">LL Cool J</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, Brandy teamed up with <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamia.html" title="Tamia">Tamia</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaka_Khan_bcef.html" title="Chaka Khan">Chaka Khan</a>, and <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_Knight_a348.html" title="Gladys Knight">Gladys Knight</a>, for the single "Missing You," off of the ... soundtrack. Even with the superstar lineup, it was Brandy's least successful single yet, but was still a moderate hit.</p>
<p>In late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> Brandy released her second album, <i><a href="../../../n/e/v/Never_Say_Never_%28album%29_0456.html" title="Never Say Never (album)">Never Say Never</a></i>, shortly after its first single, a duet with media "rival" <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_%28singer%29.html" title="Monica (singer)">Monica</a> called "The Boy Is Mine," spent eleven weeks on top of the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_100.html" title="Hot 100">Hot 100</a> chart that summer. The album was also a number one smash on the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_magazine.html" title="Billboard magazine">Billboard</a> 200 Albums chart, eventually becoming multi-platinum. The album's other singles "Top Of The World," a duet with <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapper.html" title="Rapper">rapper</a> Mase; "Almost Doesn't Count;" and "U Don't Know Me (Like U Used To)," which had a <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remix.html" title="Remix">remix</a> version which was used for the video and featured rappers <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Brat_8258.html" title="Da Brat">Da Brat</a> and Shaunta; were more minor hits in late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and through <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>. The album's third single, "Have You Ever," was a big number one <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> and <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a> hit in early 1999.</p>
<p>Brandy's third album, <i><a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Moon_%28album%29_fe80.html" title="Full Moon (album)">Full Moon</a></i> was released in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> and spawned the hits "What About Us" and "Full Moon," whose video featured a five-month-pregnant Brandy and whose lyrics explain how Brandy felt when she first saw her husband.</p>
<p>She is currently married to Robert Smith and has a daughter, Sy'rai, who was born in the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a> of 2003.</p>
<p><br />
(I'm the person who began the article on Brandy with the above information. I'll add it back into the "Brandy Norwood" article, since it adds details about her musical career that aren't already present in the "Brandy Norwood" article.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;The second single from Never Say Never was "Top Of The World", featuring rapper Ma$e. The video, directed by Paul Hunter, featured Brandy incurring various supernatural phenomena. She spontaneously floated in the air, flipping and somersaulting above random objects; telephone poles and vehicles, as people stopped to stare. These strange phenomena also included balancing herself vertically and horizontally alongside skyscrapers and buildings.&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>The close description of the video seems to be incredibly pointless. I vote to remove.</p>

<p>Brandy has not had that many #1 hits. In the US or UK. Someone please edit this with the right chart states.</p>
<p>UK&#160;: www.everyhit.com US: allmusic.com or billboard.com 216.220.208.124 18:57, 21 May 2006 (UTC) Someone put false sales saying she sold 90 million copies and tons of number ones.</p>

<p>I seriously think that the album sales are false I mean she doesnt have certifications in Australia, Canada or Europe or most markets except US. So where do all these worlwide sales come from.</p>

<p>Does anybody know anything about the new track "Follow Me" that is posted on multiple websites? I have never heard this one before. A new single perhaps? A preview cut off the new album? This should be included in the current events portion of the article.</p>
<p>I heard that, and "The Jonses" and "Deepest Thoughts" are new too, but I dontknow if any of these will be on her new album.I dont think its really worth mentioning but if u want to 24.69.67.173 18:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
