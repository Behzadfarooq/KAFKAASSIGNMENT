<ul>
<li>The film was originally called <i>Brazil</i> because the bug that leads to the typo (central to the plot) was originally seen in Brazil in an opening sequence (the rainforest is being cut down and the bug travels to the industrialised world along with its fallen home) — this was later cut. "Brazil"is also the name of the piece of music used as a basis for the film's score: "Aquarela do Brasil" by <a href="../../../a/r/y/Ary_Barroso_2940.html" title="Ary Barroso">Ary Barroso</a>. Conceptually, "Brazil" represents <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escapism.html" title="Escapism">escapism</a>.</li>
<li>An alternative ending to the "love conquers all" version was proposed by the studio, finishing when the Ministry of Information is blown up; Gilliam referred to this with some acerbity as "the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambo.html" title="Rambo">Rambo</a> ending".</li>
<li>Jack's <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triplets.html" title="Triplets">triplets</a> are played by Gilliam's daughter Holly. In one scene, Jack calls her by another triplet's name, to which she replies: "My name's <i>Holly</i>."</li>
<li>The shadowy smoking figure that stalks Sam at various points in the film is played by an uncredited Terry Gilliam.</li>
<li>Sam's boss, Mr. Kurtzman, is named after <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Kurtzman_a671.html" title="Harvey Kurtzman">Harvey Kurtzman</a>, the <i><a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Magazine_2675.html" title="Mad Magazine">Mad Magazine</a></i> creator, cartoonist and magazine editor who gave Gilliam his start in publishing by publishing his work in the magazine <a href="../../../h/e/l/Help%21_%28magazine%29.html" title="Help! (magazine)"><i>Help!</i></a> and serving as Gilliam's mentor.</li>
<li>Vehicles:

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>--<a href="../../../r/u/b/User%7ERubiksphere_3647.html" title="User:Rubiksphere">Rubiksphere</a> 09:21, 17 August 2006 (UTC)** Sam's "personal transporter" is a <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messerschmitt_KR175_1083.html" title="Messerschmitt KR175">Messerschmitt KR175</a> with a <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> attached to the back.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>(goof) When Sam forgets to exit the public transport vehicle at "Level 41" and gets trapped in the doors, the one-legged woman standing in the vehicle begins to fall over but is propped up by the other actors in the vehicle.</li>
<li>The technician at the beginning of the film (whose bug-killing actions cause the death of Mr. Buttle) is played by <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Cooper_ed8e.html" title="Ray Cooper">Ray Cooper</a>, a musician who has worked in six Gilliam films as either a musician or as an actor. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Baron_Munchausen_18e1.html" title="The Adventures of Baron Munchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></i> he plays Jonathan Pryce's assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>A number of scenes contain action that occurs in the background at the same time as the foreground story is being watched. This occurs notably during the party scene at Sam's mother's apartment, where we watch an argument between Jack Lint and his wife, Ida being chased by a "suitor" and the professional actions of Dr. Jaffee as he appraises people for plastic surgery.</li>
<li>The Samurai Warrior in Sam's dream sequences is played by Winston Dennis. Dennis had already played the Minotaur that battled <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Connery_c5ee.html" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Bandits_b548.html" title="Time Bandits">Time Bandits</a></i> and would later have a major speaking role as Albrecht in <i>Munchausen</i>.</li>
<li>The <i>Ministry of Information</i> logo is "MOI" printed inside a black rectangle. This logo is seen all over Kurtzman's desk, indicating that the MOI has "official" items that its employees can use. These include tea cups, lamp shades and even Kurtzmann's goldfish bowl.</li>
<li>Prisoners who are about to be interrogated at Informational Retrieval are called "customers".</li>
<li>Background propaganda signs are similar to those that were posted around the UK during the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, but with a subtle twist. These signs include:
<ul>
<li><i>Suspicion breeds confidence</i></li>
<li><i>Help the Ministry of Information help you</i></li>
<li><i>Information: The Key to Prosperity</i></li>
<li><i>-topia Airways</i> (behind Sam and Harry as MOI is blowing up, note the implied ambiguity.)</li>
<li><i>Don't suspect a Friend: Report Him</i></li>
<li><i>Trust in Haste — Regret at Leisure</i> (with a picture of a man behind bars)</li>
<li><i>Who can you Trust?</i> (with a picture of MOI officials underneath. Seen as Sam says "Trust me Jack")</li>
<li><i>Mind that parcel. Eagle eyes can save a life</i> (regarding terrorist bombs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the refinery where Sam and Jill stop the truck, a safety sign in the background indicates "__3 Consecutive Hours without a Time-Loss Accident". Another sign at the refinery says "Merry Xmas to all our Staff".</li>
<li>The motto for the Ministry of Information is "The truth shall make you free", which can be seen on the statue in the lobby. This is a quote from one of the Gospels: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=8&amp;verse=31&amp;end_verse=33&amp;version=31&amp;context=context" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&amp;chapter=8&amp;verse=31&amp;end_verse=33&amp;version=31&amp;context=context" rel="nofollow">John 8:32</a> and is the slogan that greets visitors to the real-life <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>. In the context of the film, the MOI's job is to gather information — truth — from society, and by doing this sets society "free".</li>
<li>A <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>–style marching band is playing in the shopping district. The banner at the front reads "Consumers for Christ", with a picture of a Dollar sign stamped on a Christian cross. The message seems to be getting across: a little girl sits on Santa's knee and asks, for Christmas, for a credit card.</li>
<li>A poster at Shangri-la towers is an advertisement for "Mellowfields", a holiday destination that appears to be a large and odd-looking ocean liner with a massive swimming pool fed by an artificial waterfall. Around the liner are a number of seaplanes. The words on the poster say "Top Security Holiday Camps. Luxury Without Fear. Fun Without Suspicion. Relax in a panic-free atmosphere."</li>
<li>At the beginning of the film, the technician who eventually swats the bug is seen attempting to rub a spot off his desk, only to then cover it up with a stapler. Some see this simple gesture as a symbolic microcosm of the entire film that follows.</li>
<li>The bizarre executive toy that is exchanged several times in the film (it actually appears to be the only gift anyone is giving anyone else) was designed specifically for the film, and was, at one point, considered as a possible piece of merchandise.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elsa_Schiaparelli_1cb4.html" title="Elsa Schiaparelli">Elsa Schiaparelli</a> "shoe hat" worn by Sam's mother is based on a 1937 design by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is an intertextual link between Monty Python's "the Meaning of Life" and Brazil. The last vignette of "the Meaning of Life" is set in Heaven, where every day is Christmas day. In Brazil, yuletide iconography pervades almost every scene, and as no specific dates are mentioned, it can be inferred that here also the same is true - Heaven on Earth indeed! <a href="../../../j/u/g/User%7EJugurtha3_c950.html" title="User:Jugurtha3">Jugurtha3</a> 02:51, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Does anybody know why the movie is called "Brazil"? I'm Brazilian and don't have a clue about why using the name of my country in this film. Felipe Ventura, at 0:47 (Brasilia time) Feb 12 2004 e-mail: felipe-ventura@ig.com.br</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason is, I think, now correctly listed in the trivia at the top of this page. Namely, the beetle that causes all the Buttle/Tuttle confusion was originally depicted as flying in from Brazil in an early version of the film. --Quaternion 21:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The simplest explanation is that it's named after the title song. But another reason may be the original meaning of the word 'Brazil' before it was given to the country. In medieval legend, 'the island of Brazil' was a mythical place of legend far across the ocean. Gilliam may have chosen the name to be suitable to a film set in a mythical society that never really existed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Singing_Badger_db89.html" title="User:The Singing Badger">The Singing Badger</a> 17:01, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Or, the mythical place of legend could be the fantasy world in Sam's head. In any event, the title doesn't refer (at least not <i>directly</i>) to the modern country. —<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_McIrvin_3426.html" title="User:Matt McIrvin">Matt McIrvin</a> 12:00, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Or, the name could actually be a reference to the real country of Brazil which, at the time Gilliam was making this film, was ruled by an extraordinarily powerful military junta which was notorious throughout the entire world for its heavy-handed tactics for taking and keeping power, which including torturing or "disappearing" its opposition.</dd>

<dd>By 1985, when Gilliam's film finally came out, the irony of a song glamourising Brazil as a paradise for lovers----when the reality was that Brazil was a hellhole of political intrigue, class inequality, and repression----would not have been lost on the educated, freedom-of-expression-loving, Che-Guevara-loving, military-junta-hating, Monte-Python-fan audience that the film attracted. Sam Lowry's society was the Brazilian junta transplanted by Gilliam to a British-based culture: where Machismo was replaced by British sports metaphors; where religious symbols were replaced by executive toys; and where colorful, tasty food was replaced by scoopfuls of monochromatic mush (sorry, not a fan of English meals!).</dd>

<dd>My mother turned to me after we watched the movie together (her first time), and suggested that it was called Brazil because Brazil's constitution contains a provision disallowing extradition of Brazilian citizens. She said this right after the final scene, which cuts from Sam sitting in the torture chair, clearly in another world (insane/lobotomized), to the clouds as the song "Brazil" plays. Has he escaped to another land, never to be extradited? Probably a little far-fetched, but I thought it was a neat idea. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_Grey_Anderson_1c3c.html" title="User:Patrick Grey Anderson">Patrick Grey Anderson</a> 05:54, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have come to think the title reflects the modernisation project that took place in Brazil during the 20th century, in effect creating an 'artificial' capital and subsequently populating it. Brazil as a title could represent the concept of a mechanised, dehumanised modernity being carried to the extreme level, exhageration being a conceptual recourse often used by the ex-pythons, particularly Gilliam, to make a statement. user: Deva 11 november</p>

<dd>I have heard a quote from Gilliam detailing his moment of insperation for the film, seeing a man sitting on a volcanic (black) sand beach, while the song was playing on a radio in the background, and this was the initial inspeation for the Sam character, though doubtless this connection was fleshed out into many things as the story and script was put together.<a href="../../../f/i/t/User%7EFitandhappy_7261.html" title="User:Fitandhappy">user:fitandhappy</a></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBrazil_%28film%29_402b.html" title="Edit section: Jill's mysterious reappearance and change of heart">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jill's mysterious reappearance and change of heart</span></h2>
<p>I think Jill's mysterious reappearance and change of heart occurred because she had been turned into an informant by the M.O.I. instead of being tortured and killed after she and Sam were picked up at the department store bombing. That's not to say Jill understood the consequences of turning informant -- both she and Sam were naive about the raw power and cruelty actually practiced by the M.O.I. (many incidents in the movie illustrate this).</p>
<p>Sam was the son of the former director of M.O.I and could make a lot of trouble through his society maven mother, so M.O.I couldn't kill or "disappear" Jill without first eliminating or discrediting Sam. To that end, M.O.I. sent Jill, without a scratch on her body (indicating that she had not yet been interrogated by Information Retrieval) to seduce Sam so that M.O.I. could catch him with a "suspected terrorist," thus giving Information Retrieval grounds to arrest him. Jill, who we know recoils at violence, probably was told by M.O.I. that she would go free and Sam would get a slap on the wrist because he was a government employee. Hence her apparentt hate-to-love switch.</p>
<p>That would also explain why Jill looked relatively calm when the stormtroopers first burst in; she expected them! Note that she didn't scream until one of the troopers grabbed Sam. At that point, she realized that Sam, despite his employment with Information Retrieval and family connection to M.O.I., was being treated as Mr. Buttle had been. She screamed in horror at the implications, and was summarily executed.</p>
<p>I think it's likely that Mr. Helpmann was directly involved in turning Jill to get rid of Sam. The evidence is that, just before the troopers burst into the room, Jill wrapped herself up in a huge ribbon as a Christmas present. Then later, when Sam was in a padded cell, Helpmann visited him dressed as Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Helpmann's motive for destroying Sam may have been more personal than patriotic. He traveled in the same social circles as Mrs. Lowry, who was herself very highly connected--perhaps more than himself. He could easily have exhonerated Sam (and Jill) with a nod of his head, but instead he chose to destroy Sam.</p>
<p>Remember, Helpmann's title remained *Deputy* Minister even after he assumed the dead Jeremiah's responsibilities. It appeared as though higher-ups had reservations about appointing Helpmann to head the ministry, and that Helpmann was just keeping the seat warm for the someone else.</p>
<p>Helpmann kept Ida Lowry's portrait on his desk, which indicated some sort of weird connection; perhaps Ida had a great deal of influence, as Jeremiah's widow, in the selection process for the next Minister. (After all, we heard her offer a ministry position to her plastic surgeon, through her social connections.) Also, we know that Ida was ambitious for her son; maybe Helpmann saw Sam as his rival for her political sponsorship. Maybe, if Sam Lowry began to show a little ambition, the powers-that-be would consider the well-connected, blue-blooded Sam to be a more suitable heir to M.O.I.'s throne than Helpmann.</p>
<p>At the end of Sam's torture session, we watch Jack and Helpmann, now codependent partners in crime, move towards us and away from Sam, kind of like the end of Casablanca (a famous anti-fascist political film which figured prominently in the Kurtzmann scenes) when Rick and Renault walked out of the hangar together, but with a bad twist---Sam, playing mirror image hero and villain, had escaped to an imaginary "Brazil," not to the very real non-fascist city of Lisbon, Portugal. (By the way, the Brazilian national language is Portugese, a result of Iberian colonialism. It is incredible how the structure and logic of this film is so tight...)</p>
<p>In one fell swoop, Helpmann destroyed a well-connected potential political rival and Jack destroyed the one person who could derail his career by linking him to Buttle's wrongful death. All they both would have to do to from now on is keep insisting that Sam Lowry was a terrorist.</p>
<p>Just a note: M.O.I. spells "moi" in French, meaning "me." M.O.I. is me, or a societal reflection of me and what I do and the things I support and uphold, kind of like an image in a mirror. Certainly, images in mirrors and lenses is one of the film's leitmotifs.</p>
<p>M.O.I. mirrors society and reflects back it's image -- but if the mirror or lens is imperfect, the image is not accurate, it is distorted like Sam's face in Kurtmann's computer magnifier. Sam looked very different to us from the computer's point of view.</p>
<p>Plus, we all know that a mirror reverses right and left, or, to play more on the French/English translation, adroit vs. gauche. Tuttle the adroit vs. Spoor the gauche?</p>
<p>The M.O.I.= "moi" = "me" relationship is also consistent with one of the central themes of the movie: that we are supporting the very institutions that are destroying us at the same time they claim to help us --- just as Alma Terrain supported the "acid man" who claimed to be helping her but in the end scorched her to death. She was complicit in her own destruction.</p>
<p>["Alma Terrain" = fostering earth (like "alma mater" means fostering mother). Alma's destruction was akin to the destruction of the landscape that we see in the movie behind the endless billboards.]</p>
<p>The complicity of victim and perpetrator is why the (Sam-or-I) warrior's face mirrored Sam's face, and why we wonder whether the constant explosions are due to the incompetence of Central Services, rather than some shadowy terrorist underground. Also, take a look at a closeup of the very "graphic" graphic design of M.O.I.'s logo to see how that organization views it's mandate to the general population---one of the very rare cases where obscenity is used to bolster a larger work of art, rather than just to get attention.</p>
<p>Gilliam did not show us even one sociopathic, dangerous person who was detained by M.O.I. In fact, the only vicious sociopaths we saw were employed by either M.O.I. or Central Services: the maniacal bureaucrat at the beginning of the movie who would not rest until he killed the innocent bug, Spoor and his buddy, Jack Lint, and perhaps Mr. Helpmann.</p>
<p>And Mr. Kurtzmann was no angel either. In order to distance himself from the Buttle incident, he faked hand pain to get Sam to sign Kurtzmann's name on all documents related to Buttle's reimbursement check. It is very common for a boss to ask a trusted assistant to sign his/her name on a routine document. But because this supposed "criminal forgery" was one of M.O.I.'s charges against Sam, we can infer that Kurtzmann turned around and falsly accused Sam of perpetrating an inside job to discredit the Ministry, of which Kurtzmann claimed no prior knowledge. Here's lookin' at you, you little, little man...</p>
<p>Buttle was an innocent worker-bee-family-man destroyed by a mechanical error caused by a maniacal bureaucrat who risked life and limb to kill a harmless bug that innocently flew into his office--- and might just as innocently flown out if it weren't for the bureaucrat's furious, obsessive-compulsive drive to kill it. Note that a human being was completely responsible for the bug's fall into the printer that caused Buttle's misfortune.</p>
<p>Jill was simply seeking justice and the "rights of working men and women," a "working class heroine," oblivious that justice was too much to ask from a decaying system that had all it could do to cover up it's own incompetence and rot.</p>
<p>Sam was a naive, self-absorbed, unambitious dreamer born to wealthy aristocratic (or at least socially prominent) parents; a spoiled man-child who thought nothing of plowing headlong into a group of nuns blocking his bee-line path to work. And, as he tried to "bee-line" his way into Jill's heart, he plowed headlong into the very system that spawned and nurtured him, and that could crush him just as singlemindedly and mercilessly as the maniacal bureaucrat crushed the pesky bug at the beginning of the movie.</p>
<p>I love this film.</p>

<dd>That is an interesting idea, though I feel i should mention, in the Europian cut you do hear the shots that execute Jill, so there is no ambiguity about her death in that version. Its was removed from the other two cuts, the "love conquers all" so that it fitted with the new ending plot, and the other because it was one of the elements that the studio saw as being too dark, and would put off the audiance. - <a href="../../../f/i/t/User%7EFitandhappy_7261.html" title="User:Fitandhappy">user: fitandhappy</a>4th december</dd>

<dd>Many know of the "tactical campaign" of the IRA in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, but the IRA also conducted a strategic campaign of attacks on London, Manchester, and elsewhere in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Great Britain</a>. Such attacks have a direct effect in terms of terror upon the civilian population, but they also have an indirect effect in terms of reaction to those attacks and the way that reaction affects not only <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_liberties.html" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a> but the overall civility of the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The name "Brazil" is also the name of a <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_American_music_e7c3.html" title="Latin American music">Latin-rhythm</a> popular song, called Aquarela do Brasil by Brazilian composer Ari Barroso, not only the theme music of the movie but which also initiates the fantasy sequences of the main <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">character</a>. The movie plainly is about England and not a <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South American</a> country, but it is suggested that England had been going down the path of the English and U.S. stereotype of a South American country: people have become adapted to the attacks of terrorists (even though this is more like the Spanish-speaking countries of South America rather than Brazil), where the attacks have become so institutionalized that the grievances of the terrorists and perhaps even their identities have become forgotten, and while the authorities fight back against the terrorists, the counter-terrorist program has become institutionalized to the point where it is not clear that it has any effect on the terrorists or even if the original terrorists exist any longer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The term "information retrieval" is used throughout the film, and one is quite a long way into the film before one figures out that information retrieval is a <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a> for torture. It is quite chilling that such an innocuous and bureaucratic term would be used for something so brutal, and the torture methods depicted in the movie are brutal. Also, the movie begins with a society that is crazy enough to be a fantasy, but the fantasies become so outrageous that at some point the action is taking place inside the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mind</a> of the main character. The main character is being tortured, so perhaps the fantasies begin at the start of the movie, but in a way, it doesn't matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the failure of the film at the box office, "Brazil" can be contrasted with "<a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Strangelove_67b2.html" title="Dr. Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>", directed by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Kubrick_762f.html" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>.

"Dr. Strangelove" was a mixture of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> and camp, but the context of that film was more accessible to the movie audience.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For what it's worth, when the film came out, Gilliam gave a "Guardian Lecture" (actually an interview) at the NFT in London, where he stated that the film was about the United States (telling a story that related the decline of Mrs Terrain with something less drastic that happened to his father). I don't know if this is online anywhere, though.Grangousier 23:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is inefficiency that causes the explosions and an out of control beuracractic government that fails to recognize them as this and thus goes torturing for answers that don't exsist, perpetuating the broken cycle.</li>

<dd>...in analogy to Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four novel, which Orwell himself described as a criticism of communism.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a long-standing debate among Orwell critics (though moreso among opportunistic political commentators with little understanding of Orwell, who simply want to see their own ideology in him), some of whom have interpreted in Nineteen Eighty-Four a critique of contemporary socialism, some of English war-time policy and others a combination of the two. Not only is this sentence taking a very contentious position on a hotly debated topic, but it's taking an utterly simplistic position, which virtually no one presently endorses (that 1984 was simply about communism, rather than Stalinism, fascism and war-time policy all combined). Unless the individual who originally posted this can come up with a meaningful reference for Orwell's having held at some to the idea that Nineteen Eighty-Four was just about communism, on the basis of his statements regarding Nineteen Eighty-Four in his letters, I'm going to just remove the text asserting Orwell's position entirely, given that, as it stands, it is incorrect. --<a href="../../../y/s/t/User%7EYst_e353.html" title="User:Yst">Yst</a> 21:22, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Indeed, its just dishonest to further propogate the myth of 1984 as merely "anti-communist". Orwell himself was a socialist and his novel is much more than simply an anti-marxist screed. Atleast, it is a criticism of Stalinism... in addition to a number of other things. --<a href="../../../b/2E/_/User%7EB._Phillips_496b.html" title="User:B. Phillips">B.

<dd>I probably should watch <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_%28film%29.html" title="1984 (film)">1984 (film)</a> before commenting but I believe if it wasn't mentioned that might be because it's not really a remake or even Gilliam was ever reall aware of the first movie. I can tell for sure I'm not aware of every move released today, even the hits... Don't even mention 40 years ago. I do think it's easier to be a coincidence. Subjects such as the ones threated in Brazil are repeated all over many different films in many different ways. --<a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacumer_9a2f.html" title="User:Cacumer">Cacumer</a> 04:51, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't think you need to read Orwell's book to know its themes and significance. Phrases such as <i>Big Brother</i> and <i>Room 101</i> have entered the language, and the concept of a <i>1984 society</i> is pretty well-known - even to people (including me!) who haven't read it. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterwiki_56fb.html" title="User:Peterwiki">Peterwiki</a> 02:25, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A little introduction to put my opinion in perspective. I love Monty Python and all Gilliam's works I've seem so far, which is limited to 3, the third beeing 12 monkeys. I do not share Gilliam's view of the world as a hopeless and never ending vicious cicle where nobody can do nothing to change it. By the way, I'm brazilian.</p>
<p>I've seem the movie in which I believe is the third ending. It shows love conquering it all, but still he dies in the end, as well as his beloved one, all because he forgot to watch his own back and cleaned the trails only of her, "killing" her on the papers.</p>
<p>The movie is a critic to burocracy, of course. But everything is a background to the plot, which is a dreamming person fightning in a real chaotic world (of Brazil) and trying, by himself, just get away of all that to get together with his dream's loving woman. It is a love story, but, from Terry's point of view, he could never have got anything out of such a hardened world fightning alone, and that's why he should die even before getting close to his dream.</p>
<p>Brazil, in reality, is about the same thing as the movie. It is a place ruled by burocracy nearly dictatorial. People who join the politics get corrupted because every human has a dark side, and it's so easy to let it grow. A single person could never fight against such a big machine. Unlike Matrix, where there was a savior, Brazil has none, since all of them just die trying. I think that's what Terry thinks, even while he doesn't let it clear why the movie is called Brazil, the suggestion he makes is that it's just a coincidence because he named it after the song. I believe in him.</p>
<p>So, the movie basically tells me few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>watch ourselves even before our loved one, or we will die and drag her (or him) with us, sooner or later.</li>
<li>that will happen because the world is that bad today, and it will only get worst.</li>
<li>the good friends will watch for us even when we least expect.</li>
<li>bad and good feelings are all in our mind, and that's the hardest and only thing we can control.</li>
</ul>

<p>The synopsis of the film suggests that 'Brazil' is set in a post-apocalyptic world. I disagree entirely. There's no indication that any apocalypse has taken place. A coherent, organised society exists. I'm removing this line from the article.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of watching Brazil for the first time since 9/11 and I'm quite surprised at how many post-9/11 technologies and attitudes are displayed in Brazil, from racial profiling and the implied use of facial recognition technology to everyone having to pass through security terminals to enter their places of work to the more explicit terrorist fears. There's even a bit that touches on the "what counts as torture" argument that has arisen of late. Putting any of this into the article without sources would be an NPOV violation -- so has anyone heard or seen any reviews of the film that make reference to this sort of thing? Yes, I know Brazil has a lot of 1984-isms as well, but some of the ones I mention above aren't all Orwellian. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:09, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
