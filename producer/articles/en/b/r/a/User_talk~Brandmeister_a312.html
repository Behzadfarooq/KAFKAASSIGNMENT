<p>Hello there. Thank you for your comments on the FA candidacy of the article <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_history_of_the_Roman_military_e065.html" title="Campaign history of the Roman military">Campaign history of the Roman military‎</a> at the FA page <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Campaign_history_of_the_Roman_military_ab27.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Campaign history of the Roman military">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Campaign history of the Roman military</a>. I have responded to the points you raised and wonder if you would be able to re-visit the FA page (and the article) and see if I have resolved the problems to your satisfaction such that you are willing to remove your oppose vote, or make further response to my responses if not. Many thanks - <span style="color:#ccf;background:#ccf;border-style: single"><a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPocklingtonDan_89be.html" title="User:PocklingtonDan">PocklingtonDan</a></span> 16:43, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Babek.jpg</b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful.

<p>This is because the old PD-USSR category has been deprecated and all images formerly believed to be PD must now be justified as fair use.

<p>Hello! If you are receiving this message, that means that your user page is in a specific year category. Per a recent user-category per deletion, all specific year categories are to be deleted. If you wish to continue using year categories, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an age group category, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_their_30s_2bf8.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in their 30s">Category:Wikipedians in their 30s</a></li>
<li>Using a decade category, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_born_in_the_1970s_3955.html" title="Category:Wikipedians born in the 1970s">Category:Wikipedians born in the 1970s</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish, you may do both. Hopefully, this change in categorization will be quick and painless. Happy editing! --An automated message from <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedRobot_c4d1.html" title="User:MessedRobot">MessedRobot</a> 13:23, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear.
