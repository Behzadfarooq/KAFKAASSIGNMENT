<ul>
<li>Genres are not capatalized. Also pop punk does not need a dash between the words. Use the articles already on wikipedia to describe music. If you think there is a notable difference between "<a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_punk.html" title="Pop punk">pop punk</a>" and "pop-punk" you might want to establish the "pop-punk" article, which currently redirects to "pop punk." In our discussions on the "pop punk" article we have decided that there is no notable difference and that "pop punk" is the most notable of the two. Again, just to reinforce it, don't capitalized words inapproriately. <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 17:26, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>For the records, I haven't touched the genre in literally about 12 months and refuse to change it and let other people bicker.

<p>I keep having the rollback the page... Please try and make contributions that are better than:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling Brand New "an awesome band". I love them as much as the next person, but <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> please.</li>
<li>Changing the genre. Look, I don't have an issue with this, but it's pointless and silly. Might as well leave it alone for all the hassle is causes, no? Contribute to the page instead.</li>
<li>Adding unreferences information to the article about the new demos. If you want to add information, please add a footnote and a link to where it comes from. I'm a Brand New geek, and as such what's there is probably all that's known. I don't accept unreferenced things as the truth.</li>
<li>Vandelism. This is stupid, adding the word "cocks" or adding fake band members is pathetic.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't revert anything that I believe adds anything to the article but the genuine contributions are increasingly few and far between. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 13:27, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really don't think so. I don't hear people call <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smiths_5dab.html" title="The Smiths">The Smiths</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cure_83a6.html" title="The Cure">The Cure</a> emo, and I think that Brand New is closely related to both of those bands musically.</p>
<p>what the fuck is with the constant genre changing... get over it. if you don't want them to be emo then don't call them that... indie is independent.. they print their own music. Brand New does not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>hey, i think its more insulting to be called 'pop punk' (which they really are not... thats more like yellowcard or NFG) than emo (which their introspective/relationship lyrics, layered tube guitar sounds, and acoustic songs strongly suggest) so yeah i always thought it was crazy to call them pop punk- just call them emo its more accurate and less offensive</dd>

<dd>Trying to be a genre purist will just get you trumped by some more elitist purist who knows of a more obscure band. Besides, North Korea isn't going to fire off nuclear weapons in response to possible mis-labeling.</dd>

<dd>They're post-hardcore. They aren't pop punk (like All American Rejects or Relient K), and they certainly aren't emo (which by the way is very offensive because it assumes the band to be a bunch of babies). They're post hardcore. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.193.245.120_9d0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.193.245.120">128.193.245.120</a> (talk) 05:45, 26 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Removed the Band Feud section. Basically, there are no sources, most of it is rumour based, it's already covered in the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Lacey_d8ca.html" title="Jesse Lacey">Jesse Lacey</a> page and it ruins the flow of the article - something that sound be one, maybe two lines at best, has three stupidly long paragraphs about something that isn't even referenced.</p>
<p>On top of that, I'm not at all sure that the often repeated rumours are accurately represented here at all... Nolan and Lacey are very good friends, and Lazarra's fued with Nolan is something not related to the BN page at all, and the way some of it is written seems very biased. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 19:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Repeated below:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many Brand New songs were written by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Lacey_d8ca.html" title="Jesse Lacey">Jesse Lacey</a> as a result of a band feud that existed between <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Nolan_c0dc.html" title="John Nolan">John Nolan</a> (formally songwriter &amp; guitarist for <a href="../../../t/a/k/Taking_Back_Sunday_066d.html" title="Taking Back Sunday">Taking Back Sunday</a>), <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Lazzara_353f.html" title="Adam Lazzara">Adam Lazzara</a> (current <a href="../../../t/a/k/Taking_Back_Sunday_066d.html" title="Taking Back Sunday">Taking Back Sunday</a> vocalist) and himself. The story goes that Nolan went to a party and slept with Lacey's girlfriend. This resulted in the song 'Seventy Times Seven' which included the lyrics <i>'have another drink and drive yourself home/ I hope there's ice on all the roads/ and you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt/ and again when your head goes through the windshield'</i>. As a reply, John Nolan wrote 'There's No 'I' In Team' for Taking Back Sunday (TBS), which used some of the lyrics from the Brand New song, and included lines such as <i>'I can't regret/can't you just forget it'</i> whilst mocking Lacey's overkill hurt feelings <i>'wearing your black eye like a badge of honour/ soaking in sympathy'</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the feud between Lacey and Nolan was quickly put to one side when Adam Lazzara began to date Nolan's sister and supposedly cheated on her. Nolan confided in Lacey about his thoughts of leaving TBS to start <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straylight_Run_d8f5.html" title="Straylight Run">Straylight Run</a>, and Lacey convinced him to do so, which made Lazzara angry. Whilst Nolan and Lacey became friends again, and Lacey began to badmouth Lazzara and TBS at shows. It's now speculation as to which songs are part of the feud, as both bands refuse to talk about it anymore. However, if you look at the lyrics of Mix Tape (BN), Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't (BN) and 'Bonus Mosh Pt. 2' (TBS), 'The Union' (TBS), 'Slowdance On The Inside' (TBS), and many of the songs on the new Taking Back Sunday album, you can decide for yourself whether you think they are replies to each other or not. Many of the lines used in one song will be used in the next, but it's all speculation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most obvious proof for the feud is the BrandNew t-shirt which makes the statement "Mics are for singing, not swinging" which is a criticism of Adam Lazzara and his tendency to pretend to garotte himself whilst hanging from the rafters durings shows singing 'I'd never lie to you, <i>unless i had</i> to' from the song 'You're So Last Summer'.</dd>

<p>Jesse Lacey is <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Nolan_c0dc.html" title="John Nolan">John Nolan</a>'s (formerly of Taking Back Sunday) best friend, though a fight once broke up their friendship for some time. You can live this battle vicariously through the song "Seventy Times 7" by Brand New, and the response song "There's no 'I' In Team" by Taking Back Sunday. Although some people claim Taking Back Sunday released the song first, and Brand New "stole" their lyrics, Your Favorite Weapon by Brand New was released before Tell All Your Friends by Taking Back Sunday. Similar lyrics such as "Is that what you call tact? You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back, so let's end this call, and let's end this conversation" can be heard in both songs, but the words were supposedly originally spoken by Lacey during a phone call to Nolan, regarding an incident of Lacey's girlfriend cheating with Nolan. In the end, the lyrics were basically shared, not stolen, and John and Jesse have since made up and are presumably good friends today. They were also originally in a band together in New York.</p>

<p>Accardi has NEVER gone by "Vinnie." Always "Vin". Check any Brand New liner notes for verification. Should he be listed here are Vincent "Vin" Accardi, instead?</p>
<ul>
<li>that is not entirely true. At shows, Jessee refers to Vin as "Vinnie" (he did at the 8/28/06 NYC show). Also, during a 9/18/05 radio interview on the Domestic Disturbance show (NY KROCK 2) he refers to him as Vinnie.</li>

<p>In June 2005, Brand New launched a new official website which they promised to update more often (which has not been the case) and announced they had been recording, and additionally confirmed rumours that Lacey has been "sick," "had surgery," and that there "were multiple things wrong with [him]" but stated that "most of [his problems] have been fixed." In early 2005, Lacey was admitted to the hospital where upon it was learned that he had appendicitis and had surgery to remove his appendix before any further trouble could occur.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the band is working on their highly anticipated third album in Oxford, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. The album, which was originally rumored to be called <i>"Fight Off Your Demons"</i> based on the band's new website URL, has, according to fans who attended a concert in Chicago, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, been announced by front man, Jesse Lacey to be titled <i>"The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Of Me"</i>. The "Devil" title may infact be the name for the demo track known as 'Mamas'/Untitled 6., and NOT the new album title, as many fans were unclear of what exactly Jesse said during the Chicago show. The "Demons" title was a result of all the medical problems that members of the band has been going through, e.g. Jesse's surgery. The band has teamed up with producer <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Herring_6229.html" title="Dennis Herring">Dennis Herring</a> who has worked with such artists as <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Costello_678e.html" title="Elvis Costello">Elvis Costello</a>. His studio, Sweet Tea, is a house/recording studio filled with vintage instruments and recording equipment. The album is finished and expected to be released sometime in October, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p><br />
On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">January 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> nine demos from this album were leaked onto the internet, each without titles and of unknown origin, only with a comment they were "<i>Demos that probably won't be on Fight Off Your Demons</i>" following weeks of speculation over the existence of these songs. Among many internet communities, the fifth track, "Untitled 05" was said to be a song called "Cleanser" simply because it matched a description Jesse gave in an interview to Krock2's Domestic Disturbance of being "7 minutes long". In early April, MenWomenandChildren stated in an interview that this song was not entitled Cleanser, and that it wouldn't make the album. Also during the recent tour, "Untitled 08" has been played and referred to as having the title "Yeah", The live version is slightly different to the Demo version, in that the whole band play and the lyrics have changed slightly. Another new song, titled "Take Apart your Head", with lyrics referenced in the new Brand New website, is being played on their tour. It is, however, NOT one of the 9 leaked demos. They have alsoplayed untitled 06 ("Mamas") and 07 ("Fork and Knife") in drasticly improved forms, though at this time only untitled 06 is confirmed for the album. Untitled 6 (Mamas) is now rumored to be titled The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me, after a statement made by Jesse during the Chicago show in July.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">June 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> Brand New announced on their website that they will be starting the mixing process on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> with record producer, engineer, and mixer Rich Costey. They indicated that they will be mixing 13-16 tracks and 12-16 of those tracks should make it onto the record. They also announced they will be trying some of the new tracks out on their current tour. They expressed gratitude in the fans response and also commented that the reason they have taken so long in the recording process is so they could perfect the record, which they said should be out sometime this year, most likely late September/early October.</p>
<p>During a show at the NorVa in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk%2C_VA_380f.html" title="Norfolk, VA">Norfolk</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> on June 23, 2006, Jesse announced that the "new album was finished four days ago", making the completion date June 19, 2006.

<p>On July 1st at the Ridglea Theater in Fort Worth, TX, Jesse told fans backstage that the album would release in October pending no major problems. Late October appears to be the most likely candidate. Also, the band is hoping to tour once more to promote the new album. It has since been said that Dashboard Confessional and Brand New will be going on tour together.</p>
<p>On July 28th, this message was posted on the Brand New Street Team webstite: "Hi. Gossip police here. The album does not have a title yet. The album does not have a confirmed release date yet. Street team interview coming soon and hopefully it will answer many of your questions."</p>

One of the songs featured will be called "James Devlin's Gay" " part. This is pure speculation, lacks any sort of citation, and come on, "several days ago"?

<p>Does anyone else think there should be a miscellaneous info or trivia section on this page? A lot of the information for the individual albums could be bulleted here. For example, the song title Seventy Times 7 and its underlying meanings with Taken Back Sunday. While we're at it, it might be interested to note there that the song Okay I Believe You But My Tommy Gun Don't comes from the movie Home Alone, when Kevin McCallister is watching a movie called Angels with Filthy Souls... actually a parody of the 1938 film Angels with Dirty Faces.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<dd>A long time ago, around six months ago, there was a trivia section - I removed this during a heavy rewrite as it's bad form on Wikipedia and put the appropriate information under the relevent album section.

<ul>
<li>They say he's the new member on the interview on the Street Team page, although only lists him by "Derek". He's definitely there playing many of the songs at gigs, having seem him get myself.

<p>(posted by xXaLLiOo but I don't remember my login pass... on Oct. 24, 2006) I don't currently have any of the info but I think it would make a great addition to the article if we included some information about the tours they've done or the major shows they've participated in: warped tour, bamboozle, east coast tours, west coast tours, mention that their current tour is the first European (outside of the UK) tour, and also include what bands they've toured with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I quite disagree - it would take over the page. Major performances I could understand (the Warped Tour is already mentioned), but bands such as this do that many tours that they aren't individually notable unless there is something special about them.

I'm the one who wrote half this damn thing and tried to make it into a decent, well-written resource about the band. You're trying to ruin something that, IMHO, is quite a good resource.</li>

<dd>If you have something worthy to contribute about the band, add it and I will put it in the article, otherwise it will get removed. Anything about the forum /is not relevant/. I'm not "a whole society", I'm one guy who is trying to keep the page as accurate as possible, and surely this is the best thing for everybody. You lot are pathetic immature idiots - one of the key reasons I don't contribute to the forum despite being an obsessive fan. This "community" honestly makes me embarassed to like the band. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 15:13, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yay, the page got semi-protected. Yep, just what I was going to say Halo. There not point in vandalising the page since it will be removed very quickly - it's just a waste of your time and effort. I too am a Brand New fan. But instead of writing nonsense and vandalising the page, I try to improve the article and make it better.

<p>First thing done was the removal of Degausser as a single. This is pure speculation, not grounded in fact at all and doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. I moved it to an album track info format.</p>
<p>I also editted and added many covers (My own personal scans) to the entire singles. Redid the demos, which I felt were woefully inaccurate given my knowledge of the band. Added the cover to this as well.</p>
<p>I also removed from the "Personel" section of most records Vin as Backing Vocals. Jesse does all vocals through the wonders of multi-tracking. The only place I see this maybe being an exception is the original demos and maybe (Only becuase no one has heard it) the new record. He only does vocals live of course.</p>
<p><b>IF POSSIBLE CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EDIT THE COVERS ON THE MAIN BRAND NEW PAGE TO THE MORE PROFESSIONAL ONES?</b></p>
<p>And FYI, Brand New did not "Sign" to Interscope or Universal Music Group. They signed to Dreamworks Records which then capitulated into UMG a day later. Brand New was assigned to Interscope by UMG.</p>

<li>Done, I've updated the covers, although the 'Sic Transit Gloria' one doesn't look too great. Maybe you could rescan it or someone could edit it to bring the brightness down.

<li>I've replaced the version of Jude Law with the old version. Basically, the one from Amazon's perspective is totally broken and the contrast has been ramped up and doesn't represent what is actually looks like in real life. I'm completely for someone scanning in the single cover (preferably the 7" if someone has a non-marked copy) - I would myself but my copy is a few hundred miles away at the mo. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 15:16, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>been changed quite a few times in the past couple weeks. so what do we think is best, rock, alternative rock, "alternative rock emo" or do we have another idea?---Kmccusker2 23:17, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I say we should mention Emo as well as Alternative Rock. Without doubt Brand New have significantly changed style etc. However they were considered part of the 'emo' scene by many upto 2006 and this should be accknowledged. Fullerov 22:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Emo" implies hardcore influences - something Brand New don't have. The "emo" term is lame, mainly because it's a meaningless way to draw a connection between band's styles which have little to no connection. Wouldn't it just be easiest just to swerve around the whole damn thing and leave it as "rock" or similar, because there's no doubt /whatsoever/ about that? I see one pop-punk album, one alt/indie-rock album and one alt. rock album. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 01:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have always called them emo, punk, or even alternative, but like we have seen, there are so many sub genres of genres and subgenres of subgenres etc... that i agree, Rock. that's all that needs to be put.Kmccusker2 07:23, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
