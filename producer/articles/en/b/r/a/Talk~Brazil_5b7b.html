<p>I'd like to suggest that we adopted UK spelling in the main article. This standard is used throughout most of the English speaking world, with the lone exception of the US. It is also used by internationl organisations, including the UN.--200.103.134.164 14:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's biased. Even if you look at most country articles American spelling is used, your not going to force every single country article that doesn't have english as a language to use UK spellings, are you?

<p>It seems that some users do not agree with the addition of the picture of Rocinha Favela. In my opinion this is a must, as this is an article about Brazil that ought to be exposing the poverty in the country as well, as it is definetly not a land full of Itaim Bibi's and wealthy districts. Readers of this article should see some of our poverty, in order to really know what is really going on in this country. That is just something that we cannot hide, we cannot close our eyes to reality.</p>
<p>I would like to remember that economically, Rocinha may be poor; it's additions to our culture however were always very important. As a Brazilian I am not ashamed of this picture and I really don't think that it depreciate our country. In honour to poor Brazilians, I shall be adding this picture everytime it gets deleted.

<p>Hello, I was doing some research on the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese people</a>. In the section "Japanese Living Abroad" on that page, it states "The number of Japanese citizens living abroad is estimated to be over 1 million persons, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. By country, the highest number, were living in the United States, followed by People's Republic of China. The number of person who reside in Brazil was the third largest and that of United Kingdom came fourth." When I came upon this page and looked in the section Demographics, it stated " ...and Japanese-Brazilians are the largest Japanese population outside of Japan (1.5 million)." Which is the true fact? Thanks. --PinkCrayon 21:47, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brazil's Article Introduction</p>
<p>In the introduction of the Brazil’s article there is the following phrase: “Brazil is home to both extensive agricultural lands and rain forests. Exploring vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is South America's leading economic power and a regional leader”</p>
<p>Although it’s true that Brazil has an extensive agricultural lands and rain forests, it may lead the reader to the usual, but fake, view of the country. Brazil does not only have the biggest economy in South America. Considering the entire Latin America, Brazil has the economy almost as the size as Mexico (the 2nd) and Argentina (the 3rd) together. In the world, Brazil has the 9th or 10th economy. Please, see the link below.</p>
<p>It’s not likely that one country has such a big economy based only on natural and agricultural resources. The fact of the matter is that Brazil’s GDP has the following composition: agriculture: 8.4%; industry: 40%; services: 51,6% (according to CIA World Factbook).</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes I do quite agree with you, the Brasilian economy is based mainly on the country's industries and services. However the main difference between Brasil and other South American countries is the vast land area available for development and plenty of natural resources. I do not really think that, considering the Brasilian population, the country would be so economically successful in Chilean lands, for instance. Therefore, I think that this statement is quite relevant. Let's see what do the others think.

<dd>The problem is that "brazil" really is spelled wrong. I'm pretty sure that Brasil would sound just the same as brazil, but the anglophone countries don't care wether they are snubing our culture and preferences or not, together with a handful of anglophilic brazilians, to whom many times other civilization's cultures worth a lot more than our own. brazil is a romantism and it should be banned, simply because it never existed. Someday, perhaps, when the US dominate the Amazon, there may be such a thing as Brazil. While we still have our country in our hands, we should be doing everything we can in order to prevent cultural dependency which has already started to become a reality. We could be a candidate for 51st state, and this would be a funny and ironic thing because 51 is a very popular number in Brasil.</dd>

<dd>Our people enjoy Hollywood better than Brasilian cinema. Many youngsters do not know how true samba and Brasilian music sound anymore. Brasilian literature is being replaced by subliterature like Harry Potter and Dan Brown. And, to cap it all, the majority of intelectual people agree that brazil is right and Brasil is wrong, despite of the fact that "o Brasil não conhece o brazil".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The brazilians don't agree with me and think that "ufanism" is ridiculous, but it's a matter of time to see who is right. A country with strong cultural identity cannot be pushed around by anyone. Nevertheless, judging by how things are going, when it comes the time that Brasil represent a peril to the allies (and it sure will, as we have plenty of the fuel of life itself), there will be no need for a war on terror, as people will find it marvelous to be bullied.</dd>

<dd>Like stated before, my group and I will not be changing brazil to Brasil anymore, that's a promise as we respect the wikicommunity.

<p>&lt;---- No problem with Բրազիլիա or w/e. These languages with ideograms may sometimes lack a symbol or leter that correspond to some names, like in Japanese, the don't have the sound "lee" and so on. So if they call us Basil in chinese, it can be justified. Considering the English language though, Deustchland sounds way different from Germany, as well as Nippon or Italia. The point is that Brasil sounds just like brazil, the Z is a unnecessary romantism, and proving that is your own statement that many people don't know wether it is Brasil or brazil.</p>
<p>However, you as foreigner may spell the name brazil the way you want, it will not make much difference, people even think that we are country in Africa called Argentina! I'm already glad enough that you came here and got to know a bit more about our country. Culturally speaking, now you know that Brasil is more correct although it really is written wrong. It's your call anyway.</p>
<p>Our problem, once again, is with brazilians who consider Brasil a sin in English language. It may sound a bit paranoic, but a brazilian who agrees with brazil so much might as well consider our very own culture garbage comparing to others or at least subconciously prefer other identities. The name brazil is the flag of the depredation of our culture and I'm very sad to see that some of my fellow Brasilians will fight for it until the end. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.78.10.89 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.78.10.89_38cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.78.10.89">contribs</a>) 14:22, 10 September 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>It's interesting to see this discussion here because I always used Brasil instead of Brazil, intentionally, by the same reasons pointed by this person. Of course, while editing wiki articles, or whenever such unnapropiate writing is unacceptable, I use the Z, even considering it wrong.</dd>
<dd>I have to say that I quite agree with this anonymous user, despite of so much fuss about a single letter. Wether we like it or not, some things he said are actually true, and like suggested before, are worth at least a discussion about mentioning them in this article. The Brazilian culture indeed was once more valuable to Brazilians. Then, with the modernization of the telecommunications, I consider that we were overexposed to other standards and naturally some people fell in love with them.</dd>

<dd>Thank you very much for your suggestion, but in Portuguese, Brasil is plain Brasil, there's no way we can make a point there. Moreover, the majority of "brazilians" are english speakers, you see. Making them furious about "Brasil" is making them think about our present conditions.</dd>

<dd>I shall not discuss this matter with you anymore because I already understood that you chose brazil. We have got no problem with that, that is our own fault as many brazilians agree with that as well. That's why I envy the Iranians, because now they are making themselves known as what they always were, Iranians, and not "arabs". They may have awkward politics and foreign policies, but they sure have the strong cultural identity that we lack.</dd>

<p>&lt;---- Please note that this article is protected not due to your single edit, but due to a serie of vandalism edits. Please see the page history to understand what I mean.</p>
<p>You proved me that <i>Brasil</i> is indeed a typo for <i>Brazil</i>. Nevertheless, it's still original research. <i>Spelling controversy</i> is a conclusion you took when reading those articles. Reading <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>: <i>All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</i>. Thus, even if you are/were right, it's not something that had been published and submitted to discussion in the proper scientific society. Wikipedia is not a proper place for discussing new theories.</p>
<p>Therefore, all this stuff is only valid in the article <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_political_spelling.html" title="Alternative political spelling">Alternative political spelling</a>. Please note that the typo "Brasil" is already there.</p>
<p>Anyway, our country is much bigger than a single damned letter. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 22:44, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear José San Martin, thank you for your kind answer, and for clarifying such wikirules. We did not know that there existed such an article and indeed places like these are more apropriate for this discussion.</dd>

<dd>Honestly, do you think that this is worth an article (at least in Portuguese perhaps), about the depreciation of Brasilian culture in contemporary times? In an encyclopedia where there are articles like Tubcat or even <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smurfs_and_communism_0932.html" title="The Smurfs and communism">The Smurfs and communism</a>, I guess that it would not make much difference anyway.

<dd>Since many people interested in this debate are foreigners and thus don't have in-depth knowledge of Brazilian History, I want to add Brazil used to be officially called "Imperio do Brazil". To check this information, see the 1824 Brazilian Constitution in <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.br/legislacao/constituicao/" class="external free" title="http://www.presidencia.gov.br/legislacao/constituicao/" rel="nofollow">http://www.presidencia.gov.br/legislacao/constituicao/</a> where it’s published with the original grammar.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>After the Republic was established, the country officially adopted "Republica dos Estados Unidos do Brazil" as its name. Yes, that's right. Brazil with a "Z". It surely gives us a very good explanation to why Brazil is spelt with a "z" in English - it's the way it was originally spelt in Brazilian Portuguese too. Later, of course, "Brasil" was incorporated by grammar reforms and "Brazil" was scrapped, though in other languages (like English) the original spelling was maintained.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ironically, turns out spelling Brazil with a “z” actually supports the original Brazilian Portuguese roots and therefore in no way diminishes Brazilian culture.</dd>

<p>&lt;---- They didn't keep, they never wrote Brazil. The letter Z has a different value Spanish language. In the European accent, s is pronouced as <i>s</i>, and z is pronouced like <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>. It would be quite strange pronouce it like <i>Brathil</i>. Moreover, Spanish language preffers to write c instead of z, when the following vowel is e, i. Thus, they had to choose between Bracil (pron. Brathil) and Brasil and they obviously chose the latter. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 14:24, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>French <i>Bré<b>s</b>il</i>, Italian <i>Bra<b>s</b>ile</i>, Spanish <i>Bra<b>s</b>il</i>, German <i>Bra<b>s</b>ilien</i>... I think there's plenty of evidence that the original spelling was with an <b>S</b>. However, it is <b>also true</b> that the word was <b>also</b> spelled sometimes with a Z <b>in Portuguese itself</b> for many centuries. Later, it was recognized that the spelling with an S was the etymologically correct one, and that's why it is the one used in modern Portuguese.

<dd>All this fuss because Brazil should be written with S and not Z? So far in english Brazil is written with Z and this article is from the English wikipedia - So be it. Brasil redirects to Brazil, and the article clearly explains the official name of our country in Portuguese. If you are willing to pick up a fight because of our country's name in other languages, then you guys should be ready for a big headache. Brazil in Mandarin is pronounced Bazhía, and in many eastern European languages (i.e.: Russian) Brazil is called Brasilia (thus conficting with the name of our capital).</dd>

<dd>Many languages, English especially, stand out for having orthography which is strongly influenced by tradition and/or etymology. That is even clearer with place names, like Gloucester, for example. In a nutshell, English usually ignores phonetics and the practical use of a word and sticks with the traditional spelling. The ones who aren't familiarized with such concept, see the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Vowel_Shift_debe.html" title="Great Vowel Shift">Great Vowel Shift</a> article, for an example. So I think that sticking to the spelling Brazil is consistent and coherent with the English language tradition of keeping the orthography that was first spread and then officialized. And, in my opinion, this issue of Z representing some kind of dependency is overrated and paranoia. When writing in Polish, for example, should I not write the name of my country as Brazylia fearing that I will be nurturing some kind of Polish imperialism? And I think that there is some ufanism in the way some Brazilians protect our so-called "culture" (most times the examples given are only folklore). I think that Brazilian culture is not just frevo and samba. I think orkut and its deliciously nonsensical smart communities are a much better example of true Brazilian culture. And of that culture I am proud of, if you ask me. Not that only, of course. 201.24.97.43 06:16, 23 October 2006 (UTC)Radek Piskorski</dd>

<p>This article has a few references, but i'm afraid not enough to make an article of this scope count as "well-referenced".

Also, nobody seems to of even reviewed this article in the first place, so that looks suspicious as well.

<p>However beautiful the southern Brazilian girls on this article, i think they give a very poor representation of the population of Brazil. There are only two pictures of Brazilian population: one of Olodum players and the other one of the girls. Besides the fact that even in the south such blonde people are not predominant, they're dressed with typical European costumes. Those people are immigrants that kept their culture, and are very small minority of the population. That is similar to choosing two pictures from the American population, one representing a Wasp, the other an Amish community. Furthermore, there is also a picture of a German style house. The influence of non-Portuguese Europe is surely present in Brazil, but is not that important. --<a href="../../../e/z/a/User%7EEzadarque_c905.html" title="User:Ezadarque">Ezadarque</a> 22:45, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that everyone agree with the prestige that the German influence related pictures have in this article, so I think that we should also change the official language to German as well, as it looks as if we were colonized by Germans. What about pictures of Quilombos? Pictures of streets of favelas? Oh, right, they show a third-world country and therefore foreign people will not visit Brazil, and moreover, the people who would be related to these pictures are less Brazilian than those german ladies¿</p>
<p>Reading this article, one may also think, judging by posh office buildings shown, that Brazil is like Dubai. No contrast is being shown, right in the article of a country with perhaps the most serious social inequalty issues in the world.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the pictures of beaches also endorses the jargon of Brazil being a land solely of "Playas belas". Not that they are unnecessary - Brazil has plenty of playas belas - but we should add pictures of universities, Embraer workshops, Alcantara Space Launcher, or anything that could depict how advanced is Brazilian technology instead of filling it up with tropical scenarios.</p>
<p>Reality <b>is</b> harsh, you cannot deny it pretending that here it's all about parties, Olodum and beaches. <b>People may think that I am making a fuss about nothing, but the pictures are what draw most of any user's atention while visiting an article - many reading only the sections with the most interesting illustrations.</b></p>
<p>But there is no need for worries. I shall not be replacing the current photos again. I also send my congratulations to user João Felipe C.S, for showing the world the real Brazil that I was unaware of. He is so right, that he added all these pictures without any discussion here first, and I guess that plenty of Brazilians agree with him having not protested at all. I give up then, but I am very happy though, because my country is so rich and I did not even know it!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<dd>Dont give up. It seems to me that not everyone thinks those pictures should be there, I know I do not. This article will give the first impression of Brazil to thousands of people, we should really try to make it the most accurate possible. Let's try not to stereotype the population: I think the three pictures, the olodum players, the southern girls, and the indians give an idea of distinct ethnicities that is opposite to the reality of Brazil. Brazil is probably the country with more racial mixture, that is what should be pictured.</dd>
<dd>As Brazilian culture is concerned, I don't think that we should picture any museums. Brazilian culture is not famous for its museums, but for its music. I put a picture of a Carnival parade, which, in my opinion, would be the most representative, but I think that a capoeira picture is also pretty good. Ipiranga and MAC, however, are not well-known even within Brazil.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I don't think that Blumenau or Curitiba should be pictured. I really don't see the informational value for a foreigner that wants to know about Brazil.</dd>
<dd>Let's not forget that this article (as almost every article in wikipedia) is probably the most influential piece of information on the country. We should put regional vanities and nationalism aside and try to make a good text.--<a href="../../../e/z/a/User%7EEzadarque_c905.html" title="User:Ezadarque">Ezadarque</a> 01:04, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tosh. This is the problem with Brazilians. Anything from the North and the Northeast is proudly exhibited as an icon of Brazil, no matter how non-representative, whereas people from Southern Brazil are never considered "Brazilian" enough. If THAT isn't racism, I don't know what is. What is the problem of including a few pictures from typical places in Southern Brazil? There's Olodum already (quite "African", uh?) and Indians. Now Blumenau is too much "European" for your taste? Well, I'm sorry, but it's in Brazil too. And many places in that forgotten corner of Southern Brazil are just like that, like it or not. Don't try to erase history and simply ignore the importance of Southern Brazil. 201.21.200.15 14:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you misunderstand my point. I am alson in favor of removing the olodum players, and the indians. That's not how most of our population looks like. I repeat, we are probably the most mixed people in the world, and an article should show what is particular of a country, not what is equal. There would be no point in showing that in Brazil the red light means "stop" in traffic, because that's the same all over the world. Similarly, even though those girls and the Blumenau house are in Brazil, they don't picture anything particularly Brazilian. Capoeira does. Carnival does. The contemporary art museum in Niterói does not. This article is not to show everything that is in Brazil, only the most remarkable about it.</dd>
<dd>If instead of the girls, a gaucho was pictured, it would be a lot more representative. So the problem is not that those pictures are from the south, only that they add a lot less to the understanding of Brazil than other pictures could.--<a href="../../../e/z/a/User%7EEzadarque_c905.html" title="User:Ezadarque">Ezadarque</a> 20:23, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not complaining about the German related pictures, and I do not think that they should be removed. I am against the prestige that they have in this article. There is more German culture depicted than African, and that is really unfair since there is more people and things related to Africa than to Germany in Brazil.

<dd>Yes you are right, this article is very surreal. Hipocrisy at its best is seen here. Contributors neglect the poverty in this country, supporting the use of pictures that show only the rich Brazil!</dd>
<dd>Look at the size of the favela picture, and thus the importance of it in this article. The vast majority of Brazilians do not even know the wealthy districts of São Paulo or Ipanema beach, and what they do really know is how their neighbourhoods are lacking infrastructure. Instead of these rare Brazilian landscapes, the favelas, the Sertão, the outrageous criminality or the disgraceful health conditions of Brazilians should be put in evidence.</dd>
<dd>As long as Brazilians do not acknowledge how poor their country is, as well as how much they can do about this instead of pretending to be in Europe or North America, the Tupiniquim lands will remain in disgrace. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.58.247.26 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.58.247.26_d535.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.58.247.26">contribs</a>) 23:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>You're probably a white rich/middle class Brazilian that doesn't know the poverty in which many Brazilians live, Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, and you people only wanna show the "nice" part of your country. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESupaman89_88ba.html" title="User talk:Supaman89">Supaman89</a></p>
<p>That, sir, was a very racist thing to say. I can't disagree, Brazil is indeed one of the most unequal countries in the world, especially the northeast region. But there is many incorrect data on this article. I suggest some scientific reading, instead of "guessing statements", suchs as the one regarding the amazon rainforest and erradication of species. There is a lot of misinformation about Brazil, and the main text certainly does not help. Any brazilian knows about the reality of his people. It's presumptuos to consider that you know best. <small>—The preceding comment is by Rodrigomello (<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodrigomello_3784.html" title="User talk:Rodrigomello">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rodrigomello_ed3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rodrigomello">contribs</a>)&#160;: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Please sign your posts!</a></i></small></p>

<p>From the main page: "In order to avoid a civil war between Army and Navy, Pedro II renounced the throne on 15 November 1889".

<p>"Portuguese as spoken in Brazil has developed independently of the European mother tongue, and it has undergone fewer phonetic changes than the language spoken in Portugal". Ok, now this definitely needs a quote. ptknight 18:04, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A couple of points: first of all, it has nothing to do with “spelling standard”, as we are basically talking about sound change, which, in the case of Portuguese since the 16th century, has only marginally been captured by spelling reforms. Now, the sentence may indeed need a reference (or even a slight touch-up), although I should remind you that this information is pretty much common ground among linguists, so it wouldn’t be a big deal if there were no quotes at all anyway. Unchallenged verities hardly need quotes.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiorgioz_27b5.html" title="User:Giorgioz">Giorgioz</a> 19:22, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, I changed the topic to "Phonetic Changes".</dd>
<dd>My point it that you don't hear the same sound in other latins languages as you do in Brazilian Portuguese. In Portuguese, Spanish, French and Italian, the "l" in the end of a word sounds the same, but in Brazilian Portuguese sounds like an "u". "Emanuel" -&gt; "Emanueu". If a word ends with "te", it's replaced by the sound "tchi", "contente" (happy) -&gt; "contentchi" - another thing the other latin languages don't have. And there are a lot more examples. I find it hard to believe that Portuguese diverted from these so called original sounds, when they never existed in the first place in the other latin variations, where Portuguese got the biggest influences from. That's why I requested a quote. "[...] this information is pretty much common ground among linguists [...]", so I guess finding a quote wont be that hard. I myself have never heard or read this.</dd>
<dd>I did find an interesting book from a Portuguese phonetician, "Exposição da Pronúncia Normal Portuguesa" (Lisboa, 1892), "Exposition of the Normal Portuguese Pronunciation", that states quite the opposite (§§ 58 to 70). He says that the Brazilian pronunciation does not reflect the archaic Portuguese spoken in the XV century, but that there sure are some interesting facts regarding the lexicon, where in Brazil words kept their original meaning.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I always thought that the different sounds came from the African languages spoken by the slaves (mainly from Angola, Sierra Leone, Guine, and so on)</dd>
<dd>FWIW, I'm Portuguese but I actually prefer the Brazilian accent - much more melodic - and I have no problems accepting this statement as long as it is the truth. If it is the truth, then I'm sure a lot of people won't know about this, which makes the reference even more important. Pedro Vaz 11:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)Pedro Vaz</dd>

<p>I don't think Portuguese from Brazil and Portuguese from Portugal are more different than Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Mexico, or Spanish from Cuba and Spanish from Peru, and yet we don't care listening to music in a Colombian accent, so I don't know why you make such a big deal about it, and try to show the world that you speak your own language, you can understand each other don’t you?

<p>I do not think it is not necessary, or encyclopedic to say in the poverty section "Despite being a large country with extensive resources and a huge economy,".

<p>These IBGE numbers are biased, people in Brazil have a great tendency give answers closer to the white end of the spectrum, for example, black people tend to answer they are mulattos, and mulattos tend to say they are white. I am not saying every person will answer that way, but some do; and the questioner has to write as they say, even if a black person answer they're white. Anyone who knows Brazil knows these number are way of mark, and I think the article should reflect that, I am going to change it again and I hope it is not regarded as vandalism again. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChicocvenancio_c2cc.html" title="User:Chicocvenancio">Chico</a> 03:07, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that the race numbers are biased. Two issues arise: 1. Race doesn't exist scientifically, so it is culturally based anyway 2. Brazilians have one of the most interesting and complicated racial systems. It is somewht based on skin color, but also based on class and other things. So any attempt to place people in categories will be flawed. That being said, the IBGE numbers state that many more people are white than would be considered white in a country like the United States, which still mostly adheres to the one drop rule in my opinion. This means that anyone that is somewhat dark is excluded from being white (i.e. Obama is black). In Brazil from my experience anyone that is not completely black is mulatto, and anyone that is at least 1/4 European is white. But like any racial categories it is highly subjective. I think finding some other numbers would yield a more complete picture of Brazil's racial composition. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneWorld22_56bf.html" title="User:OneWorld22">OneWorld22</a> 22:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ethnicity and race section is poor. If you people really knew anyone from Brasile you would know that they consider themselves Brasilian or Portuguese. Don't try to make a great country into the USA with its racist views. How can you place people who are mixed with Porturguese, African, and South American Native Indians into individual groups of race??? They are all mixed!! I don't like how the word ethnic group is used. Portuguese, African, etc, are now ethnic group? By all means, if one belongs to a group for 1000 years or more, it means for not. All is outranked by a foolish color, race is now a color.

<dd>I actually do know people from Brazil, and none consider themselves Portuguese. They consider themselves white, moreno, mulaton preto, etc. I agree that the whole conception of race is flawed, especially placing people in boxes when it is a spectrum. However this is not an article on race as a concept, it is an article on Brazil. Race matters in Brazil, so there should be a section on it. It is not someone trying to make "Brazil into the US with its racist views." (By the way, Native Indians means a person from India living in India, native Brazilians is a better term). <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneWorld22_56bf.html" title="User:OneWorld22">OneWorld22</a> 01:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The original post was rude and unclear, but the replies didn't help a thing. It makes no sense to try to compare Brazil and Italy in absolute terms, beause one is much bigger, so the logic of the argument is flawed (I'm assuming you chose Italy as the seat of Catholicism, or the most Catholic country in the world, presumably). Its like arguing you can take more juice out of a late melon than a small orange; of course you can, it's that much bigger, but the orange is that much juicier.

<p>The IBGE has no data as on what kind of "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritism.html" title="Spiritism">spiritism</a>" is practised, the census merely takes note of the denomination the "recensee" gives out, and in those numbers are certainly included other traditions other than the Kardequian.</p>
<p>As Wikipedia points out in <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritism.html" title="Spiritism">spiritism</a>:</p>
<p><i>The term was coined by Kardec as the specific name of the doctrine but -- given the fact that the word was created from roots taken from the common language -- it was soon incorporated into normal use <b>and used for other doctrines as well, though the original Spiritists protest this usage.</b></i></p>
<p>Thus, it is inappropriate to point out in [Brazil#Religion] that <i>1.3% are followers of Spiritism, <b>based on the Allan Kardec's doctrine (about 2.2 million).</b></i> since there are an unknown number of other religious practices bundled within 'spiritism', about which IBGE's census has no data.</p>
<p>Someone fix that please.--200.163.203.53 17:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We must rely on verifiable sources for wikipedia and, while I agree that there are other forms and doctrines of Spiritism, there are no good source about it that I am aware of, if you have any, please point out. Also we must remember that the Brazilian Census is based on the declared position of someone and it avoid practices like people that follow two or more religions, a common practice in Brazil. So the data on Spiritism should remain as stated until we have another source of information with a different approach to the question. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 12:50, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I mean, it is merely speculation, that a majority (an unknown proportion) of spiritist would practice the Kardequian doctrine. Seccondly, this information is attributed to the census, which is notoriously erroneous. The statement should be corrected to <b>1.3% are followers of Spiritism (about 2.2 million)</b> lest the article should be in the fault of inserting notoriously erroneous information to the census data.--200.193.155.177 04:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This information is not attributed to the census, it IS the information from the census, i put a link to it. I did not speculated anything because here we do not speculate, we transcribe, compile and organize data and knowledge and so i did from a reliable source of information. So you find a reliable source of information saying that the census is erroneous and that the correct data is something else and we change it, better than speculating on this subject. If not we should stick to the official data. PS: we should not use "official" data provided by the religious institutions because i am pretty sure that it will make the Brazilian population double in size. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 11:05, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The official website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormon Church) states that over 930,000 members of that religion reside in Brazil. Within the next couple of years, that number is expected to rise to over 1 million members. This article states that only 200,000 Mormons live in Brazil. This is an inaccuracy and should be changed.

<dd>Working for years as a service volunteer in Brazil, I had the opportunity to assist those of many religions, including many from the Mormon church. The idea that there are anything less than half a million members of that church in Brazil is laughable. There are well over 200,000 members in Sao Paulo state alone. The IBGE statistics are grossly inaccurate, and though I blame no one for basing encyclopedic figures from a government source, such blatant inaccuracies continue to undermine the validity of Wikipedia.

<p>I live in Brazil for much more years than you lived here (I was born here and never left) and I was amazed to know that there are almost 200,000 mormons (I am not sure that it is corect to call them this way but since you used this term I will assume that it is ok). Personally I doubt that there were more than a few thousands. See, I never met a single mormon in my entire life. I asked on my colegues here and neither of them have ever met a mormo too. My wife never met a mormon, nobody that I know, know of someone that have ever met a mormon. On the other hand I have at least 3 friends that are Jews, and they are less than 100,000 in Brazil. I could put on the article that i think that there are about 5,000 mormons in Brazil, but I can't because we are not expressing our view here. We must rely on verifiable and reliable sources only and there are no more reliable source than an official census. You might think otherwise, I might think otherwise and it is ok if you want to discuss it here, but the article will not be published under personal points of view.</p>

<dd>About this Human traffic question, the subject is controversial and while we have a source that might state it in Brazil, there are others (some as biased as the first) that states otherwise.

<p>"According to the Brazilian constitution of 1988, racism is an unbailable crime and must be met with imprisonment."</p>
<p>This should be expanded upon if it bears any relation to the truth. The term "racism", as I understand it, refers to beliefs rather than actions, and you cannot criminalise beliefs unless you have the technology to read people's minds.</p>
<p>Let's suppose that I believe white people are inferior to black (or vice versa), therefore I am a racist. At what point do I commit an imprisonable crime? Is it at the moment I start thinking about it (obviously impossible)? Is it at the moment I start telling people about it, or writing books about it? Or is it at the moment that I start acting on those beliefs and begin physically attacking people of a different race? 217.155.20.163 00:03, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The crime of racism assumes many forms. It can be the publishing of racist books, barring entrance in any place because of someone's color, offending someone because of their race. If somebody does anything that would make common sense identify that person as a racist, they could probably be persecuted.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The Constitution of Federative Republic of Brasil states that the practice (and practice only) of racism is umbailable and imprescriptible, this is regulated in the Penal Code and later a ordinary law ([<a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l7716.htm" class="external text" title="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l7716.htm" rel="nofollow">Law 7716 of 5 of January of 1989</a>]).</dd>
<dd>A crime is defined as an action or neglection. Thoughts are not subject of the criminal law so you are free to be racist if you want to.</dd>
<dd>Racism is a sequence of acts that violate constitutional rights against specific groups (not only race of skin color) and give sentences varying from one year to five years.</dd>
<dd>Racial prejudice (practice or inciting against a race, not individuals of an specific race) is a crime with a sentence of 1 to 3 years of jail regulated by the same law (Art. 20), later included in the law.</dd>
<dd>If you physically attack someone, for whatever reason you have (except for lawful defense), then you will be charged for aggression, not racism, with a sentence of 3 months to one year reaching up to 8 years of reclusion if aggravated and 12 years if the victim dies.</dd>
<dd>If you offend someone based on his race if a crime against the honor only (<i>injuria qualificada</i>) with smaller sentences, capable of apology and void if the offender was provoked.</dd>
<dd>Writing a book defending racism or any form of prejudice or defending a ethnic group against others could be defined as racial prejudice but is also defended as a constitutional right, that way this is subject to discussion (probably within the Brazilian Supreme Court).</dd>
<dd>Such elucidation however goes beyond the limits of this article and should be avoided but we could include the "practice of racism" instead of racism as a crime. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 14:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel very sorry if you know so little of the technological production on Brazil. Look for the advancement in ethanol, oceanic oil extraction, agro technology, small airplanes production, uranium refinement, biotechnology, AI research, space program, etc. If you want to look only to the bad side of Brazil, look for poverty, lack of public health and education and specially government corruption but saying that we are not an advanced country is a lack of view. Sure we can't be compared with Japan or US but even against those countries we have an advanced in certain fields of expertise (specially on fuel technology and agro technology). You also seems to know very little about software industry. Brazil have a software industry compared to India and China but with one exception, we consume much of the software that we produce. One other small difference, while India focus in low tech software, Brazil have a software research in the fields of AI and Biotechnology. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 15:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DearMr Ludolf:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First, you need to improve the usage of English language. I agree with Mr. Malancini and I think that you are overestimating the Brazilian role in the world. I have a MSc and DSc degrees by Brazilian universities and I know what is going on in Brazil. We are strong in Mathematics, mining, production of small airplanes and agriculture. However, our publication record is small if compared with Japan and the US. Do not claim that our software industry is much better than the Indian and Chinese ones. Where is the proof? Roberto ludendorff Roberto Ludendorff, PhD</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dear Dr. Ludendorff, I didn’t saw your friend providing any proof either but ok, lets see if i can help you on this. First you need to improve the usage of your general reading. "Brazil have a software industry compared to India and China" doesn’t mean "much better", means similar. Now... to your proof. I will assume that your Portuguese is better than my English.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bndes.gov.br/conhecimento/seminario/EugenioStaub.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.bndes.gov.br/conhecimento/seminario/EugenioStaub.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bndes.gov.br/conhecimento/seminario/EugenioStaub.pdf</a> - Look for a subject called "A Indústria de Software no Brasil, China e Índia (2001)", they have some nice chart with numbers that I assume you will be able to understand.</p>
<p>I would love to search for other sources but this one will give you the data that you... require, feel free to browse for more on internet, I am pretty sure that you will improve the view you have from Brazil.</p>
<p>I also think that it is unfair to compare Brazilian publications with Japan or US, since they are completely different countries (read “developed countries”) but is this really so bad?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iea.usp.br/iea/observatorios/educacao/superior/pesquisaposgraduacao/sabarretofutorodapos.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.iea.usp.br/iea/observatorios/educacao/superior/pesquisaposgraduacao/sabarretofutorodapos.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iea.usp.br/iea/observatorios/educacao/superior/pesquisaposgraduacao/sabarretofutorodapos.pdf</a> - Look for "Produtividade e Comparação com Outros Países". One more time, charts. Not that hard to read.</p>
<p>Ok, we have much bigger population but remember that i said that education in Brazil was a problem? And still we have a good intellectual publications compared with India and China if you take the size population in account.</p>
<p>See, the picture is not that dark on those fields for Brazil. I hope to bring some light to your MSc and DSc of yours. I also think that you should avoid trying to disqualify someone opinion with his proficiency on English language or because you have a bigger resume than him (and by the way, you don’t have, but i am not looking for a job here so who cares about my education level here?). This is specially unpleasant coming from someone with so many degrees.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvaroludolf_6389.html" title="User:Alvaroludolf">Alvaroludolf</a> 13:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC) I do not know who is Roberto Ludendorff. But his number of publications criterium is a good indicator in science, as is the number of citations. In any case, we do not have native electronic industry and we do not make electronic chips. Most of our thesis are in the library and not in industrial labs. There is some initiative by FAPESP to change this picture, but there is still much work to be done. Thanks to Collor and FHC and wrong policies such as "Reserva de informatica", our native electronic industry is gone ("perdemos o bonde da historia"). With respect to your report, it clearly shows a dependence on international technology in electronics and, to be honest with you, we have progress in software but we are not a major exporter of software (where competition is fierce). I can claim that I have a time machine at home but it is for private use. Moreover, remember that I have never said that we do not make anything in terms of software, I have only stated that we are not a major player yet, ALTHOUGH we have an enormous POTENTIAL.

   It is not because we have the same name that we should be friends. In the article, it is written that "Brazilian information technology is considered one of the most advanced in the world". So why don't we compete internationally? That is my only point. Many other countries have internet banking system, access to government facilities by internet, etc. And so what? I am not saying that we do not make software, I am only saying that besides our big potential in software technology, it is ARGUABLE to claim that we have one of the most advanced information technology in the world. Besides that, anyone who has studied information technology, knows that this term is not applied only to software development.Roberto ludendorffLudendorff

<p>We do not make computers! US and Japan do make CPUS, electronic chips, etc. We do not, although a few small companies assemble computers. In science and technology, we are strong in agriculture and biology (Thanks to Embrapa, Butantan Institute, etc), manufacturing of small/medium airplanes (Embraer), Mathematics (IMPA). All the rest can be described as pure ufanism and wish to be thoughts. RobertomalanciniRoberto</p>

<p>201.82.45.151 02:24, 30 March 2007 (UTC)Correction suggestion: In the following phrase: "In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Brazil attracted over 5 million European, Arab and Japanese immigrants. During this time Brazil became industrialized, further colonized, and its interior further explored and developed." - instead of saying that Brazil was "further colonized", I believe it'd be better if it could be changed to something like "occupied". "Colonized" is more related with political appropriation..</p>
