<p><i>Paraskara Grhya-Sutram</i> (commentary by Pandit Harihar) makes mention of an ancient Acharya Laugakshi Grhya-Sutram in connection with "Chudakaran Samskara" among the ancient Vedic People. A romanized form is reproduced below:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dakshinatah Kambojaanaam Vasisthaanaam,</dd>
<dd>ubhayato Atri Kashyapaanaam mundah Bhriguh,</dd>
<dd>panchachuda Angris. Bajasneyaanaameka manglarth shikhinoanyai ||</dd>
<dd>(<i>Chudakarma Samskaara, Paraskara Grhya-Sutram 2.1.23, Commentary: Pt Harihar</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Translation</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Kambojas and the Vasishtha Brahmins to wear one choti (lock of hair) on right side of their head.</li>
<li>The Atris and Kashyapas to keep chotis on both sides of their heads.</li>
<li>The Bhrgus to shave off their heads.</li>
<li>Angris gotra Brahmins to keep five chotis.</li>
<li>Bajaneys Gotra Brahmins to keep only one choti.</li>
<li>Rest of the Brahmins to keep chotis according to their respective traditions and religious customs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This reference in Paraskar Grihyam-Sutram lists the Hinduised Kambojas <i>at par</i> with the Vasishthas and it further shows that the Kambojas and Vasishthas supported one sikha or choti on the right side of their head.</p>
<p>This ancient reference sufficiently demonstrates that the social and religious customs of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmana.html" title="Brahmana">Brahmanised</a> Kambojas and the <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasishtha.html" title="Vasishtha">Vasishthas</a> were identical, but differed from other scholarly clans of ancient India. This ancient Vedic ceremony clearly seems to attest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Kambojas were socially and culturally related to the Vasishtha family.</li>
<li>The Kambojas must have been very distinguished scholars of the Vedas so as to be ranked and listed <i>at par</i> with the Vasishthas, who are considered the cultural heroes of Vedic India.</li>
<li>This ancient Vedic custom indisputably demonstrates that the Kambojas referenced in this ancient Laugakshi were, in fact, the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> Kambojas (i.e scholarly section of Kamboja tribe) as distinguished from the "Kshatriya Kambojas" (i.e. the Warrior section of Kambojas). Thus we learn that the <i>ancient Kambojas were classified both as warriors as well as a scholarly clan</i>. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>The 33rd <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">Hymn</a> of the seventh Mandala of <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigveda.html" title="Rigveda">Rigveda</a> which is connected with the <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasishtha.html" title="Vasishtha">Vasishtha</a> family verifies that the Vasishthas wore white robes and also supported a choti on the right side of their head <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. Obviously, the same dress-mode also applied to the Hindused section of the Kambojas who had pursued <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmana.html" title="Brahmana">Brahamnical</a> profession.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmanism_of_the_ancient_Kambojas_60ec.html" title="Edit section: Vedic Evidence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vedic Evidence</span></h2>
<p>There is a reference to <b><a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja_Aupamanyava_78d8.html" title="Kamboja Aupamanyava">Kamboja Aupamanyava</a></b> in the list of ancient Vedic teachers given in the Vamsa Brahmana (1.18-19) of the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sama_Veda_da8e.html" title="Sama Veda">Sama Veda</a> <a href="http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/ind/aind/ved/sv/vb/vb.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/ind/aind/ved/sv/vb/vb.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wise_Old_Man_f0d1.html" title="Wise Old Man">sage</a> was born in the Kamboja family, hence was called Kamboja. He was called Aupamanyava since he was the son of <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upamanyu.html" title="Upamanyu">Upamanyu</a>. <i>Vamsa Brahmana</i> further informs us that sage Anandaja had received his Vedic learning from sage Samba, the son of Sarkaraksa, as well as from the Kamboja, the son of Upamanyu. But it is not clear under what circumstances sage Anandaja had received the Vedic lore from two teachers as one teacher was the usual rule. One can only be certain that they both must have been very special. From the order in which the names are given, Samba appears to have been the first teacher and later the Kamboja teacher had been approached, perhaps because the latter was marked by some special pre-eminence in Vedic learning <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is further notable that both the teachers of sage Anadaja i.e. sage Samba Sarkarksa and Kamboja Aupamanyava, had received their own education in Vedic lore from one and the same teacher i.e sage Madragara Sangayani who belonged to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madra.html" title="Madra">Madra</a> people. This connection between the Madras and the Kambojas is but natural as they were close neighbors in the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinal_directions.html" title="Ordinal directions">northwest</a>. These Madras have been referred to as <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttara_Madras_407a.html" title="Uttara Madras">Uttara Madras</a> in <a href="../../../a/i/t/Aitareya_Brahmana_a4f0.html" title="Aitareya Brahmana">Aitareya Brahmana</a> and are stated to lie across the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himalaya</a> i.e <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindukush.html" title="Hindukush">Hindukush</a> range <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>. Prof Przylusky has shown that Bahlika (<a href="../../../b/a/c/Bactria.html" title="Bactria">Bactria</a>) was an <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian</a> settlement of the Madras who were known as Bahlika-Uttaramadras.</p>
<p>Scholars have identified sage <b><a href="../../../u/p/a/Upamanyu.html" title="Upamanyu">Upamanyu</a></b> mentioned in the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rig_Veda_498b.html" title="Rig Veda">Rig Veda</a><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> as the father or ancestor of <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja_Aupamanyava_78d8.html" title="Kamboja Aupamanyava">Aupamanyava Kamboja</a> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The outstanding feature of the above discussion is that the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hinduised</a> Kambojas were marked by pre-eminence in Vedic learning and their seers and teachers had found important place in the list of the great ancient teachers by whom the Vedic lore was kept up and handed on to the future generations<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneaology.html" title="Geneaology">genealogical</a> tree presented by Pt Purshotam Lal Bhargava in his book <i>"India in The Vedic Age"</i> <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>, sage Upamanyu was son of sage Vasu who was son of Indra-Pramati who, in turn, was son of sage Vasishtha. Sage Agasti and sage Vasishtha were brothers and were sons of Mitra-Varuna. Sage <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kaundinya.html" title="Kaundinya">Kaundinya</a> was son of Vasishtha and nephew of Agasti. Thus we see that if sage Aupamanyava Kamboja was indeed the son or descendant of the Rig Vedic sage Upamanyu, as several noted scholars now agree (see above), then one can see a direct lineal connection between the Vasishtha clan and the ancient Kambojas. This lineal connection may be true or not, but an intimate cultural and religious connection between the Vasishthas and the Kambojas is indisputable. This may verify the Kamboja connections with the Kaundinyas (who were also Vasishthas), the supposed founders of <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funan.html" title="Funan">Funan</a> colony in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-China_7da8.html" title="Indo-China">Indo-China</a>. It is possible that the Kaundinya of the Cambodian legends may have been a Kamboja Kshatriya from south-western India i.e.<a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/u/Saurashtra.html" title="Saurashtra">Saurashtra</a> whom the Kaundinya brahmins would have acted as purohits. In other words, <i>Kaundinya may have been the gotra of the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja.html" title="Kamboja">Kamboja</a> family which had founded the ancient kingdom of Funan</i>. It is noteworthy that the gotra of a <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> is taken to be same as the gotra of his <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purohit.html" title="Purohit">purohit</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>.</p>
<p>And lastly, sage <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swayambhuva_Kambu_6ecb.html" title="Swayambhuva Kambu">Swayambhuva Kambu</a>, the legendary founder of <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambuja.html" title="Kambuja">Kambuja</a> colony in Indo-China north of Funan, to all probability, was a Brahminised Kamboja i.e a learned Kshatriya chieftain of the Kamboja clan if the legend of Kambu-Mera is at all to be believed..</p>
<p>According to scholars, sage Vasishtha and his clan belonged to Iran <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>. And the Kambojas were also predominantly an Iranian clan (See: <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_and_ethnicity_of_Kambojas_86f1.html" title="Language and ethnicity of Kambojas">Language and ethnicity of Kambojas</a>).</p>
<p>The ancient Puranic traditions like <i>Bahu-Sagara</i> vs <i>Haihaya-Taljunga</i> wars in Kosala <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> also corroborate very close connections of the Kambojas with the Vasishthas. How closely the Vasishthas were connected with the Kambojas is also apparent from the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valmiki.html" title="Valmiki">Valmiki</a> <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramayana.html" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> which talks of the creation of the Kambojas etc by sage Vasishatha through the divine powers of his Kamdhenu. The creation story specifically refers to the Kambojas as <i>ravi.sannibha</i> i.e the Kambojas illustrious like the Sun. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> From ancient Sanskrit texts we learn that the Kambojas and some other allied <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribes</a> come again and again to the aid of the Vasishtha clan. It therefore, appears probable that Vasishthas may have acted as Purohits/religious teachers to the Kambojas and the latter may have regarded them as their spiritual guides or <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru.html" title="Guru">gurus</a> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>. It also appears certain that the Vasishthas were chiefly responsible for the learning and scholarship among the ancient Kambojas.</p>

<p><a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasaka.html" title="Yasaka">Yasaka</a> in his <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirukta.html" title="Nirukta">Nirukta</a> (2/2) observes: "....primary forms of vedic nouns alone are employed (in speech) among some people; secondary forms among others. The verb shavati, meaning "to go", is used by the Kambojas only......Its modified form shava is used by the Aryans" <b>See</b> <a href="http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/sarasvati/dictionary/9niruktam.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/sarasvati/dictionary/9niruktam.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the above Nirukta of Yasaka, distinguished Prof Roth as well as another <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> philosopher Dr J. Muir suggest that this Nirukta (2/2) also proves the fact that the ancient Kambojas were <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammarian.html" title="Grammarian">Grammarians</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguist.html" title="Linguist">Linguists</a> i.e. Language Specialists <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> (<b>See pp 161,369-369, 381</b> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04390555&amp;id=bZkIAOOaeEYC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=Kambojas&amp;num=100" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04390555&amp;id=bZkIAOOaeEYC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=Kambojas&amp;num=100" rel="nofollow">link</a>). Sage Aupamanyava referred to in the Vamsha Brahmana of the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sama_Veda_da8e.html" title="Sama Veda">Sama Veda</a> was himself a great Linguist and Grammarian. Yaska Acharya has quoted his views with respect more than a dozen times in his Nirukta. Sage Aupamanyava is also stated to have authored one Nighantu--a collection of Vedic words.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup>. According to Pt Bhagva Datta, Dr G. Opart has referred to one Nirukta whose authorship he attributes to one Upamanyu. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup>. But according to scholars like Bishnupda Bhattacharya and Dr J. L. Kamboj etc, this Nairukat Upamanyu of Dr G. Opart is probably same as Aupamanyava of Yasaka's Nirukta<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup>. The above discussion obviously proves that besides being <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedic.html" title="Vedic">Vedic</a> teachers, the ancient Kambojas had also distinguished themselves as pre-eminent Grammarians and Linguists in ancient India <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> and sage Aupamanyava Kamboja was indeed a distinhuished Nairukata of Sanskrit.</p>

<p>The Southern Indian recensions of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramayana.html" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> make a reference to a Kamboja sage known by his <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribal</a> name <b><a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambhoja.html" title="Kambhoja">Kambhoja</a></b><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup>.

<p><i>"Those other car-warriors with golden standards, O king, whom you see, and who, like the wild elephants are difficult of being resisted, they are called the Kambojas.

<p><b>B</b>. The epic Mahabharata unequivocally attests that the ancient Kambojas were very prominent <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicanism.html" title="Republicanism">republican</a> people.

P. Jayswal, Dr J. L. Kamboj).</p>
<p>Now let us return to the following verse from the Shantiparava of Mahabharata:</p>

<p>Great ancient <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> poet (Mahan Kavi) Bhaasa, who lived in third c AD is now believed to have belonged to Uttarapatha (Northern division of ancient India has).</p>
<p>In his writings, poet Bhaasa has used very respectable expressions and epithets such as <i>Maanniya</i> (Reverential, Respectable etc ) or <i>Shrimatsu</i> (Shrimaan, Sir) etc for the Kambojas.</p>
<p>Some illustrative examples include: <i>Shrimatsu Kambojakulesu jaata</i> <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup>, <i>Maanniya Kamboja jatam</i> <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> etc.</p>

<p>These emotive expressions and venerative sentiments used by the great Sanskrit poet for the Kambojas can not be said to be without reason. This is especially so since around this period (post-<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> era), the literature of India otherwise breathes a spirit of revolt against the Kamboja people and brands them variously as <i>Vrishalas, Mlechhas, Dasyus, Asuras and degraded people</i>.</p>

<li>The celebrated poet Bhaasa was a Kamboja himself,</li>

<p>Though placed in third category here, the evidence of Jabala undoubtedly verifies the Brahmanism and Scholarship of the ancient Kambojas. According to scholars like Dr P. C. Bagchi and Dr R. C. Majumdar etc, the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambojas.html" title="Kambojas">Kambojas</a> referred to here are not the Kambojas of the <i>Yona-Kamboja-Gandhara</i> group but are the eastern Kambojas located in <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> or <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a>. These are believed to be a branch of the <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamir.html" title="Pamir">Pamiran</a> Kambojas who had moved east in the wake of the <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushana.html" title="Kushana">Kushana</a> or <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huna.html" title="Huna">Huna</a> invasion of India in post Christian times. The Brahama Purana composed around 5th century AD makes clear reference to this section of the Kambojas as neighbors to <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pragjyotisha.html" title="Pragjyotisha">Pragjyotisha</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assam.html" title="Assam">Assam</a>) and Tamaralipti <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, <i>"dialect of the Udichyas or northeners including the Kambojas, Gandharas and Madras etc was noted for its purity hence Brahmanas flocked to the north for purpose of study.

<li><i>The earliest mention of Kambojas occurs in Vamsa Brahamana of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaveda.html" title="Samaveda">Samaveda</a> where a teacher <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja_Aupamanyava_78d8.html" title="Kamboja Aupamanyava">Kamboja Aupamanyava</a> is referred to.

From the fact that Kamboja Aupamanyava is stated to a pupil of Madragara, Zimmer concludes that Kambojas and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madra.html" title="Madra">Madras</a> were close neighbors in north-west. The speech of Kambojas is referred to by <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasaka.html" title="Yasaka">Yasaka</a> as differing from that of other <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryans</a> and Grierson sees in this reference the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian</a> affinities of the Kambojas, but the fact that the Kambojas teachers were reputed for their Vedic learning shows them to have been Vedic Aryans, so that the Kamboja was an Aryan settlement...</i>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup>.</li>
<li><i>Kambojas were not only famous for their furs and woolen blankets embroidered with threads of gold, their wonderful horses and their beautiful women, but by epic period, they had become especially renowned as Vedic teachers and their homeland as a seat of Brahmanical learning</i> <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup></li>
<li><i>The Kambojas may have been a home of Vedic learning in the later Vedic period.

<p>It is surprising that, on the one hand, the ancient literature glorifies the Kambojas as very respectable warriors and a scholarly class while on the other they are also branded as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbaric.html" title="Barbaric">barbaric</a> and mlechcha tribe. The resolution of this problem lies in the fact that there are different layers in the ancient Sanskrit texts which represent different phases of history. The region of ancient <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_region.html" title="Punjab region">Punjab</a> (<i>or Greater Punjab</i>) which, in the Vedic period, was known as <i>Sapta-Sindhu</i> had comprised territories as far as <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamuna.html" title="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> on the east and <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabol.html" title="Kabol">Kabol</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindukush.html" title="Hindukush">Hindukush</a> on the west. During early Vedic times, this region was the center of proto-Indo-Iranian civilization. With time however, a section of this population had outspread to the east into <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/h/Bihar.html" title="Bihar">Bihar</a>. Over time, the western branch which continued to stay in Sapta-Sindhu had evolved a liberal and latitudinarian attitude to life due to its constant exposures to nomadic people of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>, while the eastern section had become somewhat conservative and traditional which they believed was the standard Aryan way. This had obviously shifted the center of Aryan (i.e.<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryans_3ed8.html" title="Indo-Aryans">Indo-Aryan</a>) civilization from Sapta-Sindhu to <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges.html" title="Ganges">Gangetic</a> valley. Nestling themselves into a small region variously called Madhyadesha, Aryavarta or Brahmavarta, the puritans shunned all contacts with the liberals of the greater Punjab whose way of life they regarded with disapproval. The <i>varana-asharama-dharama</i> had become a standard way of life for the Indo-Aryans in the east while this social system did not take roots among the frontier people. <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> texts like <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majjhima_Nikaya_3a37.html" title="Majjhima Nikaya">Majjhima Nikaya</a> clearly attest that <i>in the lands of the <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yona.html" title="Yona">Yonas</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambojas.html" title="Kambojas">Kambojas</a>, and some other frontier countries, there were only two social classes i.e the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dasa.html" title="Dasa">Dasa</a>, and that the change from one into the other was not frowned upon</i>. <sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[42]</a></sup> The exigencies of life on the frontiers had nacessitated its people to primarily follow soldier’s life. Further, the ruling class had also started performing the religious ceremonies and sacrifices themselves. This annoyed the priestly class whose own interests were jeopardised in this new scenario. The frontier people had also parted company with the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchic</a> system and switched to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republican</a> constitutions where the role of priestly class was completely eliminated. <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabharata.html" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> calls the people of greater Punjab as <i>Rajyayaka</i> while <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashtadhyayi.html" title="Ashtadhyayi">Ashtadhyayi</a> of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panini.html" title="Panini">Panini</a> addresses them as <i>Kshatriyayaka</i>. Accordingly, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmana.html" title="Brahmana">Brahmanical</a> clergy deplored that the offerings made by these people (of Punjab) to gods go in vain(<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> and that these people knew no Vedas, Vedis and Yajnas <sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup>. Hence in the eyes of orthodox people from <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryavarta.html" title="Aryavarta">Aryavarta</a>, the frontier clans of north-west had become impure, immoral and irreligious, and the contacts with them were considered a heinous offence and an inexplicable sacrilege. Since the frontiers tribes ceased to avail the professional services of the priestly class which they had started performing themselves, the irate priestly class (from Madhyadesa) started bad-mouthing Punjabis and hurling all kind of malicious words such as Mlechchas, Dasyus or Shudras etc at them. <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup>. This may explain as to why the Kambojas in some layers of ancient literature are regarded noble Kshatriyas and learned people while in others are referred to as Barbaric and Mlechcha tribes of north-west <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The modern <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboj.html" title="Kamboj">Kamboj</a> are divided into two divisions of 52 and 84 clans names (the actual number is however somewhat higher than these figures). Dr J. L. Kamboj observes that more than 15 of them overlap with that of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> and over 80 overlap with other <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a> clans of northern India. But according to S Kirpal Singh, the respective figures are over 25 overlapping with Brahmins and over 100 overlapping with other Kshatriyas. <sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> In his well known book <i>Glossary of Tribes and Castes of Punjab and North-west Frontier Province</i> <sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup>, British ethnographer and ethnologist, H. A. Rose, had also observed in early 20th century that there is seen an overlap of the Kamboj clan names with that of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> and other <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriyas.html" title="Kshatriyas">Kshatriyas</a>. But Rose also admitted that the reason of this overlap was not clear to him <sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup>. But, today with all the information provided in the articles in Wikipedia about the Kambojas, it would seem clear as to why there is such an overlap.</p>
<p>Dr Buddha Parkash observes: "Among the 84 clans of the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboj.html" title="Kamboj">Kamboj</a>, the names of which are said to have been derived from names of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, figure a people <i>Maga</i>, reminding us of the Iranian <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a> and the <i>Kamari</i> or <i>Khamari</i> providing us with a probable explanation of the people of the Kamboja-desa <i>par excellence</i>"<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup>. It is notable that the Magis were a priestly class of ancient Iraninas. Therefore, it is thought by some that the Magis were a priestly section of the Iranian Kambojas.</p>

<p>From the above references, we notice that there seems to have been a very close connection between the Kambojas and the Vashisthas in ancient times. We also have a reference to sage <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambhoja.html" title="Kambhoja">Kambhoja</a> and sage Agasti who were both living near Panchvati in south-west India during <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramayana.html" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> period. Sage Kundin was son of sage <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasishtha.html" title="Vasishtha">Vasishtha</a> and nephew of sage Agasti. The descendants of sage Kundin were called Kaundinyas. Like the descendants of sage Agasti, the Kaundinyas were originally from Vasishtha <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lineage.html" title="Lineage">lineage</a>. Scholars believe that while the Vasishthas were actively involved in <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryanising</a> the north-west and north India, sage Agasti, sage Kundin and their descendants moved to south to Aryanise southern India. According to Dr K. A. Neel Kanth Sastri, there are numerous references to Kaundinyas in the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> literature as well as in the Indian Inscriptions. Kaundinya is a famous clan of the Indian Brahminas (Vasisishtha lineage). Scholars believe that once the Kaundinyas had finished Aryanisation of southern India, they had transplanted themselves to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-China_7da8.html" title="Indo-China">Indo-China</a> and set-up colonies there <sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup>. It is probable that sensing the exigencies of war, Kaundinyas had also taken a band of soldiers from amongst the Kambojas and Sakas with them. There are references both to the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamboja.html" title="Kamboja">Kamboja</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/k/Saka.html" title="Saka">Saka</a> names in the Indo-Chinese Inscriptions. The references to Saka <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a> are found in the inscriptions of Prasat-Khna in the province MLU Peri in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> (dated 1041 AD) which confirms the presence of<a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythians</a> in Indo-China. Another important word connected with this region is <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambuja.html" title="Kambuja">Kambuja</a> which relates to the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kambojas.html" title="Kambojas">Kambojas</a> of north-west (G. Coedes, Dr B. R. Chatterjee, Dr Buddha Parkash). Later traditions however connect this name with sage <i>Swayambhuva Kambu</i> and <i>Apsra Mera</i> which tradition seems to have been the handiwork of the patronised Brahmins (the royal courtiers) of the ruling family of Kambuja to trace or connect the lineage of the <i>ruling family</i> of Kambuja (Cambodia) to ancient sages<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup>. This legend may have been necessitated by the fact that around this period, the Kambojas of north-west had come to be viewed with derision by the Indian <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmanical</a> class and generally regarded as belonging to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbaric.html" title="Barbaric">barbaric</a> and mlechcha stock.</p>
<p>The Magi connection of the Kambojas as pointed out above by Dr Buddha Parkash and others seems to make quite a sense in the above context.</p>

<li id="_note-45"><b><a href="#_ref-45" title="">^</a></b> The name Mlechcha or Vrishala normally applied to the Kambojas, Sakas, Yavanas, Pahlavas and some other tribes from <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttarapatha.html" title="Uttarapatha">Uttarapatha</a> or north-west in the ancient Brahmanical texts was the result of several reasons such as (1) their connections with horses and horse trade, (2) their connections with wool and wool-trade (3) their consumption of wine and liquor (4) the evolution of Ayuddhajivin Sanghas/Republics among the north-westerners (5) their seamanship or their overseas traveling etc. All these professions/occupations have been severely condemned in the Baudhayana Dharamasutra (e.g. <i>Athotratah urnavikrayah shidhupaanmubhayaoddbhirvyvharah ayuddhyankam samudarsayanbhiti</i>—see: Baudhayana Dharamasutra verse 1/1/2/4). The sixth (6) reason responsible for earning the wrath and malice of the priestly class by the people north-west, though not listed in the Baudhayana Dharamasutra, was the fact that the Sakas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Gandharas, Bahlikas and numerous other clans of greater Punjab had switched en-masse to <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. The Brahmanical class of Aryavarta did not like this idea for obvious reasons. The seventh (7) reason for labelling the north-westerners, including the Kambojas as Mlechchas was the non-puritan outlook of the north-westeners as compared to the orthodox outlook of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryans_3ed8.html" title="Indo-Aryans">Indo-Aryans</a> located in <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_River_7af6.html" title="Ganges River">Gangetic</a> valleys. The <i>varanashramadharama</i> was the standard mode of life pursued by Indo-Aryans of Madhyadesha whereas two-class social pattern prevailed among the societies of the north-westerners including the Kambojas, Yavanas (see: Majjhima Nikaya, 2/149). The two class social system was considered anathema in the Madhyadesha society. Moreover, the social, cultural and linguistic admixture of the Kambojas, Sakas, Yavanas, Pahlavas in north-west was also very much despised by conservative Madhyadesha society. All these factors contributed to the downgrading of north-western societies in the conservative eyes of the Vedic orthodoxy of Madhyadesa.</li>
<li id="_note-46"><b><a href="#_ref-46" title="">^</a></b> Cf: Punjab (greater Punjab) became a meeting place of various peoples and a melting point of diverse cultures in ancient times. Hence its society became heterogeneous and hetrodox and detracted from the standards of the conservative people. The puritans nestled themselves in the Gangetic valley and branded the Punjabis as impure and impious and shunned contacts with them. The literature of this region breathers a spirit of revolt against the people the Punjab (see: Political and Social Movements in Ancient Punjab, p 252).</li>
<li id="_note-47"><b><a href="#_ref-47" title="">^</a></b> Cf: The ultimate opinion entertained by the people of Madhyadesha against the Punjab peoples is expressed in the vulgar tirade against the Madras put into Karana's mouth, in which the Madras, Gandharas, Sindhus and Sauviras, and indeed all the Punjab races are unsparingly reprobated. When the Punjab was so regarded, these five other nations i.e. the Shakas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Pahlavas, and Paradas could not have fared better and such is stated (Dr P. E. Pargiter, Sagara and the Haihayas, Vasishthas and Auravas, J.R.A.S., 1919, p 360)</li>
<li id="_note-48"><b><a href="#_ref-48" title="">^</a></b> "It was the result of Achaemenid conquest that a new industry of blanket making devolped in the Indian borderland....The account of the Kambojas reminds us of <i>urnavikraya</i> mentioned in the Baudhayana-dharamasutra. But why does Baudhayana condemn the custom? Evidently because it was a practice in the barbarous country" (The Achaemenids and India, p 57, Dr S. Chattopadhyava)</li>
<li id="_note-49"><b><a href="#_ref-49" title="">^</a></b> "...As is more likely, the republics were parting company with Vedic orthodoxy; this trend is apparent from at least one brahman source which describes certain republican tribes as degenerate Kshatriyas and even Sudras because they have ceased to honour the brahmanas and to observe Vedic rituals "(A History of India, Vol I, p 51, Dr Romila Thapar)</li>
