<p>While 14 years old Prophet met local promoter, <b>James "Judas" Raffordy</b> at a local gas station, and was given a flyer to local wrestling promotion, <b>Insane Wrestling Alliance</b>. Prophet initially tried out to be the official option 3 news reporter for the Insane Wrestling hotline. Upon leaving what would be his first update he was called back by Raffordy who asked Prophet to appear at lives shows under the gimmick of <b>John Benoit</b>. The gimmick intended to be a comedy gimmick garnared a huge reaction from the local fans in several local promotions and was played off of Prophet obviously lying about being related to <b>WWE</b> wrestler <b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Benoit_0875.html" title="Chris Benoit">Chris Benoit</a></b>.</p>
<p>Within a couple of weeks of the start of his training he was put under a hood and was wrestling for various promotions in the Indiana area as <b>El ChupaCabra</b>. This was done to conceal the fact that he was obviously a younger teen. Upon his debut he specialized in the lucha style of wrestling popularized in Mexico, and was catigorized as a "flippy" wrestler, in sharp contrast to the style that popularized him.</p>
<p>Upon leaving Insane Wrestling, Prophet later reamerged as John Benoit on several of the Indiana indys where he adopted the name's <b>"Preacher" Brandon Young</b> or <b>Brandon Prophet</b> and begain to focus on his ability to mat wrestle, and the futhering of this high flying style and later becoming a deathmatch wrestler.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Prophet_61ee.html" title="Edit section: Insane Wrestling Alliance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insane Wrestling Alliance</span></h2>
<p>Prophet was originally used as a crowd plant, used to antagonize local wrestler <b>Dallas James</b>. The gimmick was hugely over as it was highly kayfabed, and even had spill over effects in many other local promotions. During this time Prophet was reffered to as the <b>Universal Wrestling Coalition, Universal Heavyweight Champion</b>, though the promotion did not in reality run shows. Prophet left the organization before the culminization of the angle, and continued to do random spot shows as El ChupaCabra and occasionally as John Benoit.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Prophet_61ee.html" title="Edit section: Circle City Wrestling/ Chaos Championship Wrestling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Circle City Wrestling/ Chaos Championship Wrestling</span></h2>
<p>Sometime in 1999 to early 2000 Brandon Prophet was brought into the revived version of Circle City Wrestling. He randomly showed up in the crowd with the UWC Universal Championship and berated local wrestlers <b>Violent Ed</b>, <b>Rick Ravage</b>, <b>Simply Spectacular</b>, and <b>Bullet</b>; collectively known as <b>DOPE</b>. Bullet left the group and the angle continued without him. Eventually under the constant verbal bashing DOPE had challenged Prophet to a Barbedwire Baseball Bat match with all three members of DOPE against him, and he accepted.</p>
<p>The culmination saw Violent Ed and Ravage turn on Simply Spectacular and join up with a very bloody Brandon Prophet and begin what was a very successful run for the team under Prophet's guide. At this time the threesome also debuted in local wrestling promotion <b>Anarchy Wrestling Federation</b>, and later <b>Interstate championship Wrestling</b>.</p>
<p>Prophet would eventually no longer appear with DOPE in CCW, taking the UWC Universal Championship, by this time refered to as the <b>CCW Hardcore Championship</b> with him to fueding local promotion AWF.</p>
<p><a name="Anarchy_Wrestling_Federation" id="Anarchy_Wrestling_Federation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Prophet_61ee.html" title="Edit section: Anarchy Wrestling Federation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anarchy Wrestling Federation</span></h2>
<p>By late 2000 Prophet had made the jump to AWF and had taken the CCW Hardcore Championship with him, which at this point was renamed the <b>AWF Hardcore Championship</b>. AWF had run several shows in Indiana, and was set to debut in Indianapolis. The show saw a scathying promo from Prophet on local promotions and his desire to no longer be held back by "fat old me who never could work for shit". He then aligned himself with Hillbilly Jed and they set forth to take the AWF Championship that night. The match was a four way which saw Prophet turn mid match and align himself with <b>"Spyder" <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nate_Webb_17ad.html" title="Nate Webb">Nate Webb</a></b> who would then join Prophet's Gen3X stable.</p>
<p>The show is most noted for Prophet being pulled in on an interview by booker <b>The Man They Call James</b> who claimed on live TV to have trained Prophet in response Prophet responded "Sure if you were a fat black man named Judas then I guess so" and proceeded to leave the arena.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Prophet_61ee.html" title="Edit section: Interstate Championship Wrestling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interstate Championship Wrestling</span></h2>
<p>After the arrest of James, AWF promoter <b>Larry Wayne</b> decided to start a new promotion free of the stigma of Jame's issues. Prophet was brought in as the booker, and the AWF Hardcore title became the <b>ICW Universal Hardcore Championship</b>. Prophet was repackaged with DOPE, and several new wrestlers were brought in. During his stint as booker the Hardcore title was abandoned, and <b><a href="../../../22/w/i/_Wildcat__Chris_Harris_7c0c.html" title="&quot;Wildcat&quot; Chris Harris">"Wildcat" Chris Harris</a></b> became the heavyweight champion, and Prophet, under the name <b>"Preacher" Brandon Young</b> became paired with <b><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Justice_b0bb.html" title="Prince Justice">Prince Justice</a></b>, <b>NWA-<a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_3338.html" title="Total Nonstop Action">Total Nonstop Action</a>'s</b> <b>Abyss</b>. Slowly Prophet phased out of the managerial scene in ICW. Prophet was scheduled to capture the vacated ICW title after many of the current wrestlers quit taking bookings for ICW after a dispute with the promoter, but instead jumped ship to rival promotion <b>Insanity Pro Wrestling</b> who were having a show the same night in the same city. ICW Promoter Larry Wayne and Prophet were engaged in quite sometime in a lengthy battle of words, which would clumniate later in Prophet's career.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon_Prophet_61ee.html" title="Edit section: Insanity Pro Wrestling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insanity Pro Wrestling</span></h2>
<p>Prophet made his IPW debut on the same night as he was scheduled to win rival promotion ICW's Heavyweight Title in the same city on the same night. He managed <b>Dayton Suave <i>and</i></b> <i>Anarchy'</i> against the team of <b>Vortekz</b> and <b>Cliffton Crunk</b>. Prophet missed the next couple of IPW shows while he was wrestling at shows in Texas. He returned to IPW to team with <b>Diehard</b> to do battle with <b>Corp Robinson</b> and <b>Diamond Dawg</b>. Prophet would later go on to have legendary feuds with Robinson, <b><a href="../../../n/e/c/Necro_Butcher_bce3.html" title="Necro Butcher">Necro Butcher</a></b>, Diehard and <b>Toby Klein</b> while in IPW.</p>
<p>In November of 2003 Prophet faced Necro in a legendary Last Man Standing match, seeing Prophet break his arm and then use the arm as a weapon against Necro. The injury would prove to be so severe that Prophet would be forced to retire. Prophet would be voted 2003 Hardcore Wrestler of the year by IPW fans, and also recieve Specialty match of the year by the same fan vote.</p>
<p>Prophet would return to competition in IPW, where he would have an altercation with <b>EZ Cruz</b> mid match which would cause Cruz to bail out of the match. Prophet would also go on to become the first IPW Insane Icon Champion. Prohpet left the promotion in June of 2006 opting to take a booking for <b>IWA MS</b> and would be terminated from the promotion while still the champion, later selling the belt on <a href="../../../e/b/a/Ebay.html" title="Ebay">Ebay</a>.</p>

<p>Prophet appeared on the one and only <b>ESE</b> show before merging with <b>FXW</b>. During this show he defeated Diehard in a now legendary, in the Indianapolis area, deathmatch to become the first and only ESE <b>Xxxtreme Champion</b>. This title would later be unified with the ESE <b>Heavyweight Championship</b> when Prophet was pinned by EZ Cruz at the first ESE/FXW combined show. The following show would see Prophet win the <b>FXW King of Xtreme</b> Title. He would later drop the title at a combined show for ICW and <b>Wrestle Arts</b>. Prophet would later become the booker of FXW leading FXW to it's most successful run. The shows would see several ICW (where Prophet was a major talent at the time) and IPW wrestlers combine. Prophet's last show as booker saw a fan riot after the promoter of the company started pulling weapons advertised from the match and in frustration and crowd chaos Prophet, Diehard and Crunk all entered the ring and Crunk layed down and let Prophet pin him for the King of Xtreme title. On the way to the locker room all three wrestlers visibly angered walked to the locker room together and Prophet (who had by this time jumped ship from ICM to IPW) threw the belt in the trash can directly in front of the promoter before leaving the show.</p>

<p>After years of fan acclaim in the midwest Brandon Prophet and IWA MS finally came to an agreement that would have him compete in the 2005 IWA Mid-South <b>King of the Deathmatch Tournament</b>. In a repeat of their 2003 IPW Hardcore Match of the year, Brandon Prophet vs Corp Robinson vs Necro Butcher was slated for the first round. While unsuccessful, Prophet was hearaleded by fans for taking an incredible amount of stiff offense and hard bumps, while having suffered a fractured neck less than two weeks previous to the bout. Prophet would go on to compete the next night vs <b>Danny Havoc</b> and <b>Hellaware Assassin</b> in a three way before the finals of the tournament. Prophet was largely hearleded as the "favorite newcomer" to the King of the Deathmatches by fans on various message boards.</p>
<p>Prophet would go on to face Bull Pain and later Corp Robinson again in the first ever US Razor Board Deathmatch. After sustaining a head injury in the opening spot of the match Prophet conintued and finshed by falling nearly 10 ft to concrete and razor blades. Prophet would then not appear again in IWA MS until the 2006 King of the Deathmatches, where he would again lose to <b>Ian Rotten</b>, but would be advanced to night 2 where he would be defeated by 2005 King of the Deathmatches Toby Klein. Prophet would make sparatic appearances for IWA MS until his eventual retirement due to mounting injuries.</p>
