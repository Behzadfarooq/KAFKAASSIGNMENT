<p>How much does it really hurt to get a Brazilian Wax? And can an esthetician outline the steps that a customer should take prior to coming and what it will be like?</p>
<p>An asprin might help. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 14:54, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>well yes it does hurt quite a lot, but dont you know that saying, 'no pain , no gain' so yes for a clean clear feeling you do have to face a lot of pain and discomfort. I remember how distasteful the pain was when i got my bikini line waxing for the first time. but you know this article [www.geoamaan.com/entry/4/46/ Bikini Line Waxing]has helped me a lot. It discusses all about bikini line waxing.</p>
<p>While I've no practical experience in this, asprin wouldn't be a good idea - it promotes bleeding. A non-asprin pain reliever would be smarter. --<a href="../../../l/e/p/User%7ELepeu1999_5202.html" title="User:Lepeu1999">Lepeu1999</a> 14:47, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It does hurt ALOT at first but it truly only lasts a few seconds/minutes. The waxer does go over the steps prior to making an appointment for you and she does go over it AGAIN when you come in to make sure that this is absolutely what you want. Just be aware, you will be in pain and it will only last a few minutes. The aftercare instructions are VERY important to ease any discomfort you may have afterwards. Plus, it's also important to keep up with your appointments. I cannot emphasize anymore than that.</p>
<p>As a guy who just had this done, I would say that its not nearly as bad as some would have you believe. My waxer hooked me up with some topical numbing cream which totally did the trick for me, sure it still hurts but not to the point of screaming and kicking. It was relatively easy, took about an hour and a half.</p>

<dd>I removed all the citations. They (about 8 of them) were <i>all</i> links to the same tiny article. There is a bit of info in the article, but it does <i>not</i> support the specific information the links were supposedly citing. Also, weirdly, the same link was inserted about 6 times <i>in a row</i>. It seems more like spam than actual citation. The link is still in the external links section. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 14:10, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't the american pie reference a bit useless. At no point does it mention that the area is bare because of a Brazilian wax? IF that passes as a source, then we could add the episode of Coupling where Gina Bellman's character is the same (great line - Steve: "If you think that you can get me back by stripping you must be completely" (looks down)" and totally shaven".

<p>Yeah, I think the american pie reference is useless too. Slawdogg 09:58, 22 November 2006 (UTC)Slawdogg</p>
<p>The <i>American Pie</i> reference should be removed; it is not even related to Brazilian waxing. The Jennifer Aniston reference should be stricken as well, or at least moved to a "cultural references" section. --Kiyoshi67 22:29, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Weird that the pic was outlined w/a suggestion to discuss it, but no discussion was started.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't have any problem with a pic of a brazilian wax, but that particular pic isn't a good example, IMO. There are some good pics on the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labia.html" title="Labia">labia</a> page. Maybe we could use one of those. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 06:04, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is an entirely appropriate picture.--87.65.175.96 20:55, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How can you say it's an appropriate picture? It doesn't <i>show</i> a Brazilian wax. The model's mons are almost entirely in shadow, and her perenium isn't showing at all. A Brazilian includes not just the mons, but the area around the vagina and anus. We need to show that in order to actually <i>demonstrate</i> a Brazilian, otherwise it's just a nudie pic. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 02:23, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a page about brazilian waxing. If we do not show genitals, we simply cannot have a picture to illustrate the article.--<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGruk_f502.html" title="User:Gruk">Gruk</a> 20:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMO these photos are totally unnecessary and are just an excuse to load the encyclopaedia up with gratuitous nudity - they're not encyclopaedic in any shape or form. Call me a prude if you like. One is more than enough and there's no need for tits as well, so I've replaced it with a cropped version. But frankly I'd prefer none. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 02:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO, the pic is a good example of a brazilian wax. It is tasteful and there is no way to illustrate a wax with out nudity. Slawdogg 10:02, 22 November 2006 (UTC)Slawdogg
<dl>
<dd>It isn't, tho. First, it isn't close up enough to show whether it's a wax job or just a shave, and second, just missing hair on the mons doesn't equal a Brazilian, even if it is a wax job. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 10:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am removing the bottem image because:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) It is not focusing on the type of wax job but instead looks just like nudity.</dd>
<dd>2) It is obvious that it is not a wax, but instead is a shave job. (the image title is even "All Shaved")</dd>

<p>I am Brazilian, and I got very surprised the first time I've heard this "Brazilian Waxing" for the first time, a couple of years ago. The reason was because I don't recall that waxing all the pubic hair and leaving a small line of hair above the vulva was ever popular in Brazil. The Brazilian girls do wax and shave, but not leaving a line above the vulva.</p>
<p>Also, the thong shown in the picuture, which back is just a line, was never, never, never considered "fashion" in Brazil, neither as underware or to use on the beach. I have seen this type of thong in many different countries I've visited, but not in Brazil. A thong like that in Brazil would even look tacky. I've seen many differnt types of thongs and bikinis and panties in Brazil, including the small ones, but never like that one. Brazilian bikinis are typically smaller than the regular bikinis in US or Europe, but bigger than what is usually called "thong" out of Brazil.</p>
<p>"Brazilian Waxing" sounds to me like something that was invented somewhere else and someone decided to call "Brazilian" for some reason.</p>
<p>I can be wrong, but this is what I know from my personal experience. I would even like to hear other Brazilians opinion in this discussion. Any other Brazilian around?</p>
