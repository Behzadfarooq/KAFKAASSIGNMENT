<p><small>Hi, Bravada, I'm aware of this problem, but because I'm allways short of time i use the IrfanView function. The reason is, that the IrfanView file handling is much better than that of GIMP, thats all. As you allreday mentioned i did a lot of uploads, so proper preparing the number plates is threatening me. Please feel free to update the pictures, we work together, so let me take the pictures and the upload, and, if necessary, update them.

<dd><small>Great! I but never heard of an <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talbot_Tagora_6953.html" title="Talbot Tagora">Talbot Tagora</a> before. Interesting! I took a lot of shots this Sunday, but i think i did not catch any Simcas or Talbots. They did not sell well in germany. But i took several shots of a Peugeot 402, which is very rare too. I will upload the pictures asap. -- <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStahlkocher1_7d0e.html" title="User:Stahlkocher1">Stahlkocher</a> 15:50, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>Your signature with timestamp</small></p>
<p><small>Ok, your right no I have never rated a GA before but aim to do one a week. THis was the first. I did compare a little against a few other good articles however I tried to read the article like an interested party who was in the dark. All of the references look ok, I dont feel the content is NPOV or OR and I think it is pretty well written. It does need more work for FA status but it is well on its way and much better than most articles.</small></p>
<p><small>My rating is based on the fact that the article is easy to read, makes sense and the sources look ofk (admittedly only after a brief read through). Personally my understanding of GA is for articles with very minor problems of a good standard and that are easy to learn from (remembering this is an encyclopedia after all). --<b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tmorton166_32cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tmorton166">Review me</a>)</small> 21:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>sorry yes I did use the GA criteria! But I allowed my own opinions override ot. An article does not have to meet all guidelines and be perfect to be good (IMO).

<p>I'll have a look at the article and see what I have on the pre war cars.</p>
<p>PS. I had nothing to do with an article on the Lux-Sport. I'm not even sure what it is. My latest efforts have been the Rover P3 car and Gordon England (coachbuilders). Neither of these came up in the listing of Automobile recent changes for reasons I don't understand.</p>
<p>On Ford Germany I have no objections to it moving to Ford Werke but please keep a redirect from Ford Germany as that is more likaly to be typed in by someone looking for the article. I have put in a re-direct for the name Ford France to Ford SAF on the same basis. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolma_ac3d.html" title="User:Malcolma">Malcolma</a> 17:42, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll have to look closer of course, but I was still hoping...I feel it is wrong to pick one's own noms, so I don't do it, but by picking other people's stuff you shorten the queue and give yourself a better chance...I think I'll just bend the rules and put Rancho in there in a couple of hours to make up for the mistake.

<p>Yes, I was in a hurry, which is why I placed the selections in the staging area right above the instructions you mentioned for later informing. I thought that was okay.

<p>Hi Bravada, I'm working on translating the Simca do Brasil site. I will only be able to translate a few pages per day. Hope this will suffice. I'll be posting the new versions here since you could get information before waiting for the complete translation. It's a loose translation and I als did ommit superfluous information sometimes.

<p>It was a long time ago in the year 1964 when I'got my first contact with the Simca. It was through a Jangada that my father bought in January 1964, with few months of use, since his old 1952 blue Desoto didn't inspire reliability for a long vacation trip that he wanted to do with the Belo Horizonte (a continental city) to Cabo Frio (a city by the sea, in Rio de Janeiro state).</p>
<p>I don't remember all the facts, cause with only 2 years I was switching places between the laps of my mother and our baby-sitter in the front seats - the concepts of security were others...</p>
<p>On the rear seats my other three brothers and on the litle seats by the trunk/boot my two last brothers handle themselves among the luggage. And on the car roof a lot of junk.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(The intro text goes on an on talking about the recollections of the auther and his contact with the SIMCA models).</dd>
</dl>
<p>It was in 24, June, 1983 that I´ve bought my first SIMCA which was a black Présidence, plate number AG 3100, which had been owned by the senator Camilo Nogueira da Gama.</p>
<p>In 14, June, 1984 I´ve bought a Chambord 1965.</p>
<p>In august 1985 I´ve bought a Chambord 1963.</p>
<p>In 13 of July, 1986, I´ve bought a Jangada 1966.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(There are a few important notes on the text however...)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Like the other cars produced in the first stage of the brazilian automobile industry, the Simca was a car that had already completed its cycle in its origin (France). A few million dollars more wouldn't hurt if came from a small investment in a small industry in a third-world country claiming for industrial growth.</p>
<p>They brought to Brazil vehicles not meant to be driven in our roads and streets, that weren't designed to face the adversities of our climate and topography. There were some tests on a few french Chambord that came by air-plane to Brazil, but the results weren't of the brazilian Chambord weren't the best.</p>
<p>Herbert Cohen, a São Paulo dentist, recalled that when he bought the first Chambord sold in Sando André, on its first weekend he went proud to a barbecue filling the car with his friends. They didn't make the first ramp, so all had to step out of the vehicle because the car simply wasn't able to climb the ramp.</p>
<p>From this facts came the fame of The Simca of Belo Antônio. However, a few years later, when testing the Chambord Emi-Sul the maganize Quatro Rodas (the most important automobile maganize in Brazil, still active today) defined the car as "a big deal of a car".</p>
<p>It was the hard work of Gilberto Baeta, Hélene Pasteur e many other brazilian and french that dedicated a great deal of their lives and much sweet to transform horrible vehicles into reliable, high quality automobiles, mainly because the French headquartes demanded profits without investing any more than the strictly necessary.</p>
<p>The Simca do Brasil was an excellent example that hard work, determination and perserverance when allied to valorous and competent people, can suffice for the lack of financial investiment and lead to satisfactory results.</p>

<p>It was founded on the 05 of may, 1958, in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, with branch offices in Rio de Janeiro, and São Bernardo do Campo (São Paulo). It was called the Sociedade Anônima Industrial de Motores, Caminhões e Automóveis (Industrial Motors, Trucks and Automobiles Corporation).</p>
<p>The caming of the french industry to Brazil was the direct result of the plans of the government of Juscelino Kubitschek, which sent delegations of members of the government and busisnessman overseas in search for multinational industries interessed in starting producing automobiles in Brazil.</p>

<p>Hmmm.. that's a riddle indeed. It might've been indeed Śniadeckich, if not for two facts: there was no college there and most of the campus of the University of Science and Technology was still in Polish hands on 18th (also the main building, the closest to Śniadeckich). Judging by the date, the college in question might've been located somewhere in the Old Town. Alternative location might've been Sielce and Czerniaków, however this seems unlikely as the area was seized by the Poles the preceding night and the Germans retook only a small part of it during the day. Anyway, if the earlier is correct, it might've been for instance Świętojerska, which was quite long before 1945 and was partially in German hands. However, I don't know if there were any colleges there.</p>
<p>Yet another theory comes to my mind when I think of it now: perhaps the entire riddle is easier to solve than you think. In the English edition of his Warsaw Rising, Norman Davies used an interesting method of representing all personal names and toponyms by their translation or approximation. This made them easier to remember for an English ear (hence Niedźwiadek turned into <i>Bear-Cub</i>, and so on). Perhaps the name was coined by Norman Davies? If that's the case, the first thing to check is the index in that book. Sadly, I have only Polish edition, but perhaps Piotrus might be able to help you?</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll think of it later today. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 05:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hah! I found the author of the "Snakeskin" thing - it was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ward_2549.html" title="John Ward">John Ward</a>, the Brit to work for the Polish radio during the Uprising. In his <a href="http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/dispatches1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/dispatches1.htm" rel="nofollow">dispatches</a> he mentions the Snakeskin street on August 19th, not 18th. On that day the Poles indeed abandoned the main building of the University of Science, but I could not confirm whether the burning ruin had been immediately taken by the Germans or not. In any case, Ward had been locked up in the city centre rather than the Old Town, which means that he most probably referred to some street there. Perhaps you could contact the author of the page I linked above to check whether he put the name correctly - or check the book yourself (Andrzej Pomian; The Warsaw Rising: A Selection of Documents. London, 1945). In any case, it seems that Snakeskin was yet another of Ward's inventions and not a typo, as were Marshmallows street (Marszałkowska), Jeroboams (Aleje Jerozolimskie), and so on. It hardly helps us in solving the riddle... <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 06:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as I see the article is fully referenced, and NPOVed by the same editor who put a POV tag on it. All facts are sourced. Perhaps appearance on Main Page would bring more attention to this article, and people would add more facts.

<p>Hi Bravada. That paragraph that was cut out, I should source it, came from 50th anniversary competition that outcry over IReland winning too much lead to the introduction of televoting.

<dd>I love the Irish Eurovision actually. I think they should bring back the jury so that the old style French and Irish ballads can be brought back. Long live the Johnny Logans of this world and the Brian Kennedy style. I will get the source for you, and I hope it stays, because it is a related event, like the Israeli culture minister threatening to resign over Shir Habatlanim. I forgot to mention that the source was the Kenndey O'Connor's book dubbed the "Official history". <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 23:47, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dunno either, actually, I was hoping for some admin to see the tag and help&#160;:D What I would do is move the content from the Acura articles (I guess you are referring to the Honda Legend stuff) to the Honda article (I mean copying and pasting, but also making sure it's seamless, so you would have to integrate the text on given generations with the other ones) and replacing it with redirects to the Honda page (to create the redirect, press the rightmost button in the menu above when in edit mode).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the articles are currently pretty much a mess, I believe you can give it a try. I recommend starting a sandbox page (you can create one in your own userspace, just click on your username in the top menu and add e.g. "/Honda Legend" to the web address, like "User:The Runescape/Honda Legend") and trying to dump the content from all three articles there and trying to stitch them together. While you're at it, you might want to do a bit of research to fill in the gaps, especially concerning the non-American versions - do remember to put down all sources you used!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once you are ready, you could notify an admin dealing with car articles, like <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">User:Interiot</a>, that you've got a merged version ready and ask whether he could give it a go or tell you what to do next.

<dd>When people get told "Get a life!", they point at me and say, "I've got much more life than Clair." But sheesh, there's no way anyone could possibly follow that discussion. I tried to post a comment about 15 hours ago, and I kept getting edit conflicts. I would copy my comments to a text editor, pull up the talk page, adjust the number of colon-indents, paste it in, and submit it - and again, I'd get "edit conflict". After four of those, I decided my comments just weren't all that valuable. But I managed to sneak in a really short response just now. I try to AGF, but I'm developing a Gilbert and Sullivan list of people who never would be missed. (I try to avoid directly specifying usernames and article names, because I assume some of these people have emotional problems, and I don't want them accidentally discovering my words through Google. (If they search on my username, they might find them anyway, but my username appears innocently on so many talk pages, that only the most obsessive are going to find comments about themselves.</dd>
<dd>But I made a short comment there, because I was getting annoyed, too.</dd>
<dd>Been having a problem with another user. I have Johnny Appleseed up for GA, and another user just created a page called <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Appleseed_%28film%29_9c84.html" title="Johnny Appleseed (film)">Johnny Appleseed (film)</a>, about a film which was never made and will never be made. He put a seealso at the top of the page, and I added a section to the bottom of the page, talking about people trading on JA's name, moving it there. He put another seealso at the top, and I finally figured out that he wanted a disambig notice, so I put one there, and took a look at the other article, looked at what's out there, and found out it's NN. I rewrote the JA(f) article to be about the 1948 Disney cartoon. Then he comes along, moves that page to "JA film (1948)", and hijacks the "JA (film)" page as a redirect to his "JA film (2007)" page.</dd>
<dd>Best as I can figure, this clown is trying to get a nice mention in Wikipedia because he has a financial interest in dumping the script onto some sucker. I've augmented the page he did with a ton of detail, mostly pointing out that the film project has been deader than a doornail for a couple of years, and it'll never get made. I've AFD'd it, but this clown is really annoying me. Like I said, I have a little list....</dd>
<dd>Hey, if you have five minutes to spare, take a quick look at Johnny Appleseed, and tell me if I've missed anything. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Help make Wikipedia the most authoritative source of information in the world</a> 04:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have responded and I see that the response is moderately favorable as of now. I believe there is certain amount of prejudice on both sides, and if we keep discussing issues one by one, concentrating on substantial arguments rather than general "feelings" and "ideology", we might get to constructive conclusions. The "discussion" on the GAC talk page got pretty heated, though I believe most of the people agreed with each other in principle, it was ideology and misunderstanding that stood in the way. Now that issues are tackled one by one, I see much more civility and consensus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think GA (or WikiProject Good Articles) would be a much better place to discuss most of the issues raised in GAC, it somehow got out of control. Conversely, I was wondering whether your proposal shouldn't rather be discussed at some WP 1.0 assessment talk page. Anyway, I see it's all heading in the right direction now, we just need to make sure the criteria are clear and tight (rather than open to interpretation) and that the process is tight too, which is mostly about proper information to editors, nominators and reviewers.

<p>What kind of immature posting to my talk page is that? "I have one left...." what you are doing is editing an article WITHOUT CONSENSUS. By Wiki rules, you are incorrect. So STOP your malicious edits now before you are reported. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 13:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And another thing, you are INCORRECT about the 3RR - I have only two. I take offense to your 'warning' - you have worded it such as a threat. Understand two things - one, we worked hard, AS A CONSENSUS, to agree about the competitor listings... you came along and simply tried to change it, maliciously. Second, the (EU) designation is necessary because that designation does not exist in the United States, especially for the Maxima, simply put. So next time you feel like 'warning' someone - think again. You are creating edits by spite and WITHOUT CONSENSUS. Stop your childish actions.

<dl>
<dd>To keep the article "worldwide", the (EU) designation remains (By CONSENSUS). You are only one person - the rest of us discussed this and decided it to remain. Think about this, too - the Maxima isn't offered in Europe anymore, so the article is somewhat subjective to be "US-centric". As for your so-called "edit war" - you started with editing without consensus. I did what any other times have happened is to revert it back until you have discussed the desired change. And you are the one making "foul moves". Nie dobzre - <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 13:45, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There are only two, dziecko. One at 2006-09-18T06:54:01, and the other at 2006-09-18T07:19:54. You also have two. Should you choose to commit a third, I will have you blocked. Not a threat, this is fact. You came in and tried to edit without consensus the first time, then maliciously the second time. Your call. As far as the similar field, if you do not care then DON'T EDIT and go against an already-reached consensus. Also, it is a CONSENSUS - and does not violate WP rules. Also non-worldwide views can be seen all over in articles that are relating to non-worldwide things. Such as the Maxima, it is no longer available in many countries (including all of Europe, by the way), and the "Executive" designation is only from Europe (and when you READ the "Executive Car" entry in Wiki, it is strictly a BRITISH designation). So the need for pointing out such designation helps to eliminate any confusion for other readers. Be advised, your attempts to correct my Polish are pathetic as well. My wife is from Krakow and my professor is from Zakopanie. If you'd like to continue this, I'll happily correct your English from here on out. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:27, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ah, yes. I see now. I anonymous IP edit. I believe part of what Wiki rules allow for is in the spirit. Again, there was a consensus on this. My editing/revert corrected this back to the original article because the change did not have consensus. I am not the kind of person who makes threats (like you) and involves admins, but I clearly see that it is slowly working its way that one may need to be involved here. You cannot make a change to an article when a consensus was reached on a topic. And the one mentioned does not violate Wiki rules, plain and simple (and is not based on the wrong premises, as you put). The Maxima article allows for and discusses history of the model. But the 'similar' list is for the here-and-now competition. And the (EU) designation is to allow for US readers to note the difference and avoid confusion (since the designation does not exist for the Maxima in the US). You should be happy that the "Executive car" stays - as it is more aligned to be "Sedan". <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:48, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I deem now is that you have unfairly judged me with personal bias. Unless I have misunderstood your wording, in which case you didn't try to explain otherwise. The Maxima article can probably be improved to more closely tie in to other articles for the Teana, Bluebird, and similar models. But it has somewhat of a US-scope to it for the current model because the US is one of the only countries that it is available in. Just as an article about the Polonez will be Polish-centric (or could I argue about seeing Polish cars driving around Chicago?). It is allowed for that. I've had similar discussions about consensus and centric articles with regards to the use of Australian English, American English, or the "Queen's own". I've been to 24 countries and speak three languages - I take it to heart as an offense for you to pre-judge me like you have. Please see that this article needs such (EU) designation as a reader from Europe may recognize the designation, but a reader from Canada or the US may not. In that aspect, it IS worldwide (and considerate of multiple viewpoints). As for the similar models, well, we've discussed that. It was decided to include official competition as defined for the similar models, not what a single person decides as "looking like". I don't wish to continue this with you. So I apologize for any misunderstanding. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 14:57, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you make two valid points. We can probably discuss and improve the 'similar' category to fit all viewpoints. As far as the Polonez, I wish to disagree. It is an article that must be centric to the viewpoint of where it is created (yet can be readable for all others). In attempts to be 'worldwide', we cannot lose the culture and climate of where an article is focused. Just as the article about England (or anything of that nature) should use Queen's English, so should American articles use American English (just one example). It's like with my wife - her accent in America is something to be proud of, and not try to lose so that others may 'easily understand'. And our kids will go to Polish school&#160;;)</dd>

<dd>BTW my passion with the Maxima is that I don't only own one, I own two of these cars: a 2000 GLE that I added anniversary edition parts to, and a 2003 SE/TE that has been modified to include NISMO cams, intake, catback exhaust, chip, UDP, the works - it runs the 1/4-mile in 14.5 seconds. The newer Maximas are more 'luxury' than 'sport' IMHO.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 16:05, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually you said it best when you mentioned "although an article on a British or European car might use 'bonnet' instead of 'hood' and refer to 'saloon' in lieu of 'sedan'". These are Euro- or British-centric terms that would not be understood by an American, especially in regards to automobiles. Just as if I asked you what a bulkhead, overhead, portal, hatch, head, starboard, port, aft, or stern definition would be... those terms would be proper in a nautical (or naval) article, but refer to "commonly known" things such as a wall, ceiling, window, door, bathroom, right side, left side, rear end, or front end (respectively). But the automotive terms should be used when in an article about a British (or European) car, with mid-sized added to it if the car was available in a US version (and I would argue, with the (US) designation). I wouldn't take offense to that, nor would I see it as not being worldwide. We're dealing with two separate viewpoints here. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 16:45, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Soz to bother a rather exhausted Bravada [as I gather&#160;;-)], but I thought I'd give you some basic facts figures re the Opel Speedster merge debate.</p>
<p>Vauxhall VX, launched <a href="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/motoring/roadtests/roadtest_316_1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/motoring/roadtests/roadtest_316_1.html" rel="nofollow">2000</a>. Opel Speedster, launched <a href="http://www.supercarsite.net/speedster.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.supercarsite.net/speedster.htm" rel="nofollow">2000</a>]</p>
<p>They were both available with the 2.0 engine to start with, then a few years later with the 2.0T. In 2005 Vauxhall, and only Vauxhall, made a special variant of the 2.0T VX220, called the VXR. It had a new bodykit, new name, more power, higher price and only a few were made. All were sold within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Differences: There are many. Obviously, RHD vs LHD, new grille on Opel - there may have been two choices of grilles. I believe the radio is a completely different brand, grey vs black headlight surrounds, different brakes (although haven't found anything to verify this), different floormats (.....), different price, different colours. The VX220 also had variety of 'special editions - the 'Lightning' had a colour-coded hardtop, anthracite wheels, black screen surround, cd player and a plaque to commemorate something or other. It is worth noting that any buyer of a VX in the UK also got a free advanced driver training day thrown in with the car. Also, before the VXR VX220 came out, there was a VX Sprint concept, which showcased forthcoming variants of the VX.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the Vauxhall VX Lightning concept (strange - there isn't an article on it) was and still is a Vauxhal-only design, it was floated around the world with different badges like the curent Kappa (?) roadsters are. Again, this very concept seems to have influenced GM to make the Sky/GT/G2X look similar to it aswell. GM haven't allowed Vauxhall even a LHD version of this car, which strikes me as odd considering it was a British design in the first place, Opel second....not 100% sure of that but I would be extremely surprised if that oh-so-sedate maker Opel came up with the idea. after all, they were both based on the <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotus_Elise_1545.html" title="Lotus Elise">Lotus Elise</a>, so it could well have been Vauxhall approaching Lotus to get the rightd to design something on top of the brilliant platform that underpinned the Elise.</p>

<p>Thanks for the review on Predicted effects of the FairTax. I replied to your comment there. You are correct that it is very favorable to the plan, however, it is a breakout from the main article which is very well balanced. This section, which was mainly positive effects, was a good area that could be split. I did not consider that this section was only positive effects. Most of the criticism is in the main article. I'm not sure how I can correct this as these are not really debated items - if they were, I would include such. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorphh_f32d.html" title="User:Morphh">Morphh</a> 13:21, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, my OR synthesis concerns among others makes it hard for me to consider it close to being GA now. But the article does have a couple very respected editors who I want to make sure that their points are fairly and fully considered. As a reviewer whose views I respect, I would really appreciate if you take a look.

<p>It is hard to find any online sources from 1994 that the move was also because of security concerns, take a look at the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belweder.html" title="Belweder">Belweder</a> article and the second photo.

<p>That's quite a fine mess you all have going on over at GA&#160;:-) I do on FA the same thing Agne does/did on GA - compiled list of old FAs lacking inline citations by editor and Project, and was prepared to begin notifying by Project, so am watching this debacle with some Projects/editors who feel they are exempt from citation requirements as it unfolds. Since my household has both mathmeticians and physicists, I'm not buying the arguments, which smack of elitism and a desire for preferential treatment, to avoid requirements that apply to all Wiki articles. I am not interested in pointing a finger at a bad review in the midst of this mess: I'd rather deal with the situation another way, although the article will come up for review once I've discussed it individually. I don't think we need to make an example of a new and well-meaning editor, just to advance a point about inline citations at GA. You all must know that the GA label carries very little meaning, considering the process lets through a lot of junk, and lack of citations (often leading to POV and OR) is alarming in any article, not just GAs or FAs. Anyway, my note is to ask you the meaning of this comment, which I don't understand: "I agree with Homestarmy, please do not ironize about being impolite, but do help us!" I wasn't being ironic: I don't want to point fingers at one review in the midst of another GA controversy.

Only one difference with anything you wrote: Marskell is on the right side of that issue&#160;:-) GA *does* need to improve, and Marskell is right about the disdain it is held in because of promotions to GA of very bad articles&#160;:-) I just don't want to embarass certain well-meaning reviewers at a contentious time (I will address it after the hubbub dies down), but some of the stuff GA is promoting is just awful. Your goal is to improve that: don't give up, particularly not in the face of a few editors who appear elitist and to believe that they are exempt from the rules&#160;:-) You can deposit such messages on my talk page any time you want, although I will also understand if you decide to rethink any of your comments, and want to delete them yourself.

<dd>I understand, and will bring the egregious article in question for review later. But, it is important to retain editors who are valuable in other areas, and not offend them right out of the starting gate when they are trying to make valuable contributions. Some finesse is needed in this particular situation. Reading your talk page, I see that you will be very surprised to know who the reviewer in question was&#160;:-) I have long believed there is a big difference between good editors, knowledgeable experts, and good *reviewers*. A good reviewer should know when s/he is in over his/her head, defer to or check with some experts; biochemistry is not medicine. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:34, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By the way, I have a bold idea for you, that you might reject ... to improve GA (a worthy goal), how about investing some time at FAC and FAR? It can be instructive as to which directions GA needs to go, and how frequently we find problems in recently-promoted GAs. My take on reading through the whole GA mess is that you do have good support for your goals, although perhaps disagreement about how to best implement them. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 14:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, bad news. I've spent some time following the debacle at the various GA pages, have spoken with some others, and have come (late) to the inescapable conclusion that GA is not only a hopeless mess, it's probably harmful to the encyclopedia. Your goals are worthy: I hate to see you spend your time in that wasteland, especially in the current environment. As long as anyone (which often means vandals, socks, and meat puppets) can promote an article (with POV, OR and no citations) to GA, it means nothing. I'd really like to see you invest your efforts in something more worthwhile: either peer review or FAC/FAR. All those elitist editors who are screaming about citations in GA are up against a much stronger argument in FA. FAs must be cited. Period. They've got more uncited FAs they should be dealing with, rather than arguing over GAs, which mean nothing. Sorry to be so dismal on the topic, but I think the reason you are so discouraged is that you are working in a wasteland that is an endless black hole; your efforts would be so much more productive at FA&#160;:-) And, you wouldn't be putting up with the abuse you're putting up with right now.

For example, the other day I desperately needed to know what a <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobordism.html" title="Cobordism">cobordism</a> was, and I could discover quickly and easily on Wikipedia. It's the top Google hit for a lot of these things, and a really valuable resource. I find it hard to understand that someone would honestly think that there is no place for these sorts of articles, particularly given that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. But perhaps you meant something else? –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 02:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, I'd noticed that Google seems to put Wikipedia results very high up. Does anyone know why this is?</li>
<li>I agree that an article such as <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobordism.html" title="Cobordism">cobordism</a> isn't a Good Article, and that we shouldn't turn WIAGA upside down to make it one. I don't think that was ever really the point – I think (I hope) the whole discussion was blown out of proportion because a bunch of physicists and mathematicians felt that it would be impossible to write a Good Article without providing a reference for literally every sentence. (I even saw someone in the discussion go so far as to say that if you provide an illustrative example of something, it is tantamount to original research unless the example is copied directly from a book.) I don't think this is really the case, and frankly I think about three quarters of the Good Article people and three quarters of the WikiProject Physics people are on the same page, at least if we would stop building straw men and get back to writing articles.</li>
<li>Finally, I think there is a real place on Wikipedia for technical articles that are inaccessible and likely to remain so in the future. I agree that a lot of editors claim that articles are too technical for laypeople to understand out of elitism or laziness (recently this has come up on <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifold.html" title="Manifold">manifold</a>), but there are a number of articles about technical concepts that I can't imagine laypeople ever <i>caring</i> or even hearing about, but which nonetheless have a valuable place on Wikipedia. They're not really intended for the GA process, and that's fine. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke</a> 15:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You recently edited to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Branson_37a9.html" title="Richard Branson">Richard Branson</a> article. Your edit was a good one, and was actually recently performed and then (perhaps accidentally) reverted. Thanks for fixing the mistake. I'd like to also say I've looked through your user pages, and I have much respect for your work here on WP.</p>
<p>That said, on your edit you left a comment reading:</p>
<pre>
this is not controversial, as it is a publicly known fact that he owns a railway - or have you just found out?
</pre>
<p>The use of the word "you" makes your comment personal instead of fact based, and your statement seems to carry with it superiority. It was more than enough to simply state that Branson is known to own a railway, and strengthen this by with a citation, or simply saying it is actually named <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Trains_b928.html" title="Virgin Trains">Virgin Trains</a>. There- problem solved, no need to point fingers or make someone feel bad.</p>
<p>I noted that <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">User:SCZenz</a> left a comment on this page about civility yesterday. Perhaps it's just been a bad day and you're not in the best of moods. My personal method of dealing with such cases is to assume an innocent mistake until proven otherwise, and look for alternative explanations to why they did what they did (a mistaken revert perhaps, in this case). In short, please be more mindful of others' feelings. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMJKazin_e5fe.html" title="User:MJKazin">MJKazin</a> 11:56, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, fighting and having to leave an article sucks. Though you always know that the last version you touched was good, as a point to diff from, so leaving an article for a bit and coming to spruce it up later isn't the end of the world.</dd>
<dd>I don't know... if the areas you're working on aren't that fulfilling... take a break or move on to another area? There are seemingly <a href="../../../m/a/i/Wikipedia%7EMaintenance_5144.html" title="Wikipedia:Maintenance">endless tasks</a> to be done. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 15:42, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if you'll appreciate this comment from me, but when things get hot in one area sometimes it helps a lot to work on something else. Or just take a WikiBreak—after all the debates on citations on Thursday, I forced myself not to even <i>look</i> at my watchlist Friday. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 18:27, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
