<blockquote>
<p>Guinness says the largest breasts belong to an Annie Hawkins-Turner (first saw this in 2003 edition) from Washington DC, USA. She has a bust measurements of 178 cm (70 in.), and an underbust measurement of 109 cm (43 in.). She should have a US size 48V (110V European) bra, but since they're not available, she uses size 52J (120J).<br />
<br />
Now, I find it quite likely that she and Ms. Stitz are the same person. At least both have been given similar measurements in many occasions, like in this <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_243694.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_243694.html" rel="nofollow">Ananova</a> article.</p>

<p>The word "now refers" to a baby's vest? I'd say it "came to mean" that, but right now it doesn't. I can't cite the reference but someone more familiar with French could chase this down.: a few years ago I read somwhere that as the French language had lost control of the word brassiere, which (as I read it) referred to a child's undershirt, the Acadeny came up with a new word for that and went with the flow (with the rest of the world) on the meaning of brassiere. <a href="../../../e/b/e/User%7EEbear422_f74c.html" title="User:Ebear422">;Bear</a> 16:23, 2004 Oct 15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A <i>brassière</i> is indeed French for a baby's vest ("undershirt" in Yankeespeak), although in Quebec it still has the older meaning of what we call a brassière in English.

<dd>All I can point out is common opinion: that without a bra one will sag like tribal africans one sees on national geographic. This is, of course, contradicted by tribal south americans, who have no such problem/benefit (depending on taste of course). If said south americans are any indication of people in general, there's no physical necessity. ^_^</dd>

<dd>The article points to non-conclusive evidence in research. This is certainly related to Body Mass, and Lifestyle. If the breast is heavier, it will certainly sag. It is certainly correlated also to manual labor, that requires body swing movement, like agriculture. If the subject in question is busy in embroidery, it wouldnt sag. It is a medical fact the old ladies not using bra are complaining from pain around the nipples. In this case normally the doctor advises to use a bra.--<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnection_6a10.html" title="User:Connection">Connection</a> 11:47, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This entire article ignores the link between breast cancer and constriction from bras. The incidence of breast cancer increased dramatically with the length of time a bra is worn. Compression of the lymphatic vessels within the breast tissue by the bra causes a build-up of lymph fluid in the breasts, resulting in pain and cysts formation. End the constriction from the bra, and the pain and cysts typically go away within weeks, if not days. It is simply a mechanical compression issue. And since the role of the lymphatics is to remove toxic substances from the tissue, impairment of this cleansing function of the lymphatics by bra-caused compression can lead to accumulation of these substances within the breast tissue. This is how bras lead to cancer. We live in a petrochemically polluted world, and are exposed to carcinogenic substances daily in our food, air and water. These carcinogens course throughout our bodies and are removed from the tissues by the lympatics. Compromised lymphatic function can impair this toxin removal process, leading to toxification of the tissue. Women who do not wear bras have the same incidence of breast cancer as men! I suggest readers see the book Dressed To Kill: The Link Between Breast Cancer and Bras (Avery/Penguin Putnam, 1995; ISCD Press, 2005), by medical anthropologists Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer. See also their website www.SelfStudyCenter.org.</dd>

<dd>Camouflaging breasts! They are a good way to stand out in a crowd of teenage girls. Training bras are worn to press the breasts against the chest and hide them.</dd>

<p>Ok that makes sense now. That is similar to the ace-bandage wrap technique. So training bras are more often used by people who have matured past the time they were intended to be used for! My understanding of training bras was they were intended to help girls get used to the feeling of wearing a bra before they wore one later. I think this phenomenon needs more study. I'll research it and get back to you&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelerityfm_dc3c.html" title="User:Celerityfm">Celerityfm</a> 15:46, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As the American people grow ever-larger in regards to weight.... mention should be made for the supporting of lard-laden man breasts.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Medical studies</span></h2>
<p>I've came accross these two papers: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11128295&amp;dopt=Citation" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11128295&amp;dopt=Citation" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11153784&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11153784&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>I think a mention of such studies should probably be included in the article.</p>
<p>---</p>
<pre>
If no one suggests, I'm going to some serious modification to these pages. For one, the statements about bras not sagging with age is contradicted in the  <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breasts.html" title="Breasts">Breasts</a> article. Second, sources 1 and 2 are quite flagrantly unreliable.
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>Totally agree, the sources are clearly biased towards an extreme point of view. There may not be any medical studies, i wouldn't really no where to look, but it's pretty obvious that unsupported breasts sag with age, especially if the person does vigorous exercise without a sports bra. The article should be NPOV. Also this <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11153784&amp;dopt=Abstract|article" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11153784&amp;dopt=Abstract|article" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> is unreliable. It's on about breast weight being held on the shoulders - a bra doesn't hold the breast weight on the shoulders! A well fitting bra actually take most of the weight on the band round the body. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 21:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no research to show that breasts don't sag more or less after a lifetime of bra wearing. What common sense and basic observation should indicate to all of us is that a woman's breasts sag as she matures, despite having worn bras her entire life. So do bras <i>prevent</i> sag? I daresay not. <a href="../../../b/t/p/User%7EBtphelps_2123.html" title="User:Btphelps">User:btphelps</a> 09:48 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Societal views on Bra wearing</span></h2>
<p>The article could use better coverage of societal views of woman wearing/not wearing a bra in various cultures. This could include the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Societal pressure to wear a bra regardless of physical need.</li>
<li>How woman who often or always go braless are viewed including how some people label them immodest, slutty, loose, immoral, etc.</li>
<li>Pressure by many mother or fathers on their developing daughters to start wearing a bra regardless of the daughters desire to do so.</li>
<li>The modern changes in societal attitude towards going braless at times vs. the early to mid 20th century.</li>
<li>How the sexual revolution and the feminist movement effected views on bra wearing.</li>
<li>How some public high schools have tried to discipline female students who refused to wear a bra to school.</li>
<li>How celebrities who were known for regularly appearing braless attracted special attention from the media and the public such the female stars of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie%27s_Angels_b1fe.html" title="Charlie's Angels">Charlie's Angels</a> (Original TV version) or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Dimmock_d382.html" title="Charlie Dimmock">Charlie Dimmock</a> of the BBC's <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_Force_588b.html" title="Ground Force">Ground Force</a> TV show.</li>

<dd>I think these are good suggestions, but i think it has to be NPOV. Not too much of this 'bras are bad for you, society is wrong for trying to get you to wear one.', bras are very useful things, and the majority of women who wear bras are probably happy doing so.<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 12:33, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A few comments:
<ul>
<li>The "bad for you" issue and the "pressure to wear one" issues are not unnecessarily the same. Some, while not believing bras are bad for you, hold the position that wearing a Bra should be, with possible exceptions, strictly a personal choice and pressure from peers, society, etc. to wear one is wrong. This view should be mentioned without giving greater weight then the traditional arguments in favor of bra wearing.</li>
<li>The article shouldn't assume that the majority of woman enjoy wearing bras. We can however present studies, surveys, etc. that address this issue. Also some people argue that woman's enjoyment of wearing a bra in many cases is a product of societal views of the subject and that if they had grown in say a traditional native society they might find going braless more enjoyable.</li>
<li>The views of societies regarding bra wearing can be stated in a NPOV manor without taking a stance on the arguments for or against bra wearing.</li>

<dd>Well, you removed it originally to replace it with the Leopard print bra photo (which imho is a crappier photo)... so I too can say dont act so defensive. The picture is merely 1 of 3 images in the article (and a picture is worth 1000 words). It is high resolution, public domain, and illustrative of a DEMI bra. My ex-girlfriend is not a wikipedian, or she would have uploaded it herself, as it was she told me "The photo on that wikipedia bra article sucks. I know you must have something of me that would look better" as she is a professional lingerie model (models for Fredricks of Hollywood these days I believe), I think her judgement is spot on here.

<dd>It may be just about personal taste, but I really don't like the photography in that picture. Maybe it is the shadows, maybe the lightning, maybe the angle of view, maybe the model (or how she was cropped).. I don't know. And as the image (IMHO) doesn't seem to add information to the article (as we already have a good bra photograph), I felt like removing it. The fact that the picture was (twice) added by its own creator (<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar">you</a>) didn't helped me to believe someone could like it on the article (but I will not draw into conclusions).

<dd>There is no way this is a picture of a lingerie model.

<dd>While I appreciate your response, your argument "we already have a good bra photograph" unfortuntely doesnt hold water IMO. Would you say an image of a 1915 Rolls Royce (and only 1 photo of it) is enough to illustrate the concept of an automobile in all its shapes/sizes/manufacturers/etc...? It certainly shows a car, but not the extent of which it has changed and developed over the years. The same is true for the bra, there are many types/designs of bra (we're not going to go into different prints/patterns etc...) I think each should be illustrated so as a direct visual comparison can be made. certainly the leopard print at issue doesnt illustrate a maternity bra, or a strapless bra, or a ...

<li>The one problem I have with the picture is that the fact that the face has been so deliberately cut off, combined with the bad lighting, makes it look almost misognistic. It is a picture of nothing but breasts, completely devoid even of the most minimal features of the person wearing it. Though I don't think the leopard print bra photo is that much better, at least the combination of the angle and the shoulders/side/back/hair makes it look less like a cheesecake picture and more like a good illustration of what a "bra" is. Just my two cents. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:47, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That at least is a valid concern... The image was intentionally cropped to remove the face as she didnt want her face on wikipedia.

<p>I agree that the image should show more of the woman in question. Surely there would be many women out there who would gladly contribute an image of themselves in a bra? Many women seem to like showing of their bodies at other times! Qwert11 07:45, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For example of a next to perfect bra photo go to google images. Type pregancy bra and on the bottom row of the second page 2 from the left is the perfect bra photo. Can someone find somthing like it which isnt copyright? Qwert11 08:10, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree With Qwert. Go to the tankini section of wikipedia. The image is much better and far more natural.</p>

<p>As I stated in my edits, but what my attacker here fails to admit, is that my only "advertising" was identifying myself in the photographs I added to the article. I have since removed my name. So, what's their objection now??? I'm sure they'll find something. (Moreover, as they know, I contributed more than my name; I added textual content to improve the article. They make NO mention of that. And they delete IT out of hand along with what they supposedly do--but unjustly--object to.) I put my name there for proper attribution--not advertising, as explained in my edit. To blatantly accuse me in open forum without at least summarizing MY SIDE seems unfair and cowardly. Further, to question my ethics merely because I am a new user is equally unfair; one has nothing to do with the other. And I, unlike the some who question my ethics, identify myself openly. I am NOT here to do anything WRONG; I am here to contribute to articles I know something about. Brassieres I certainly do. I have written articles on the topic myself. Finally, it should be noted that objections to my contributions are coming only from a handful of MALE users. A call for warnings against me--or they--seems childish.

<ul>
<li>I'm not "attacking" you - I'm simply reminding you that Wikipedia has certain rules and conventions, one of which is that articles are not there to give you the opportunity of publicising yourself or your website. As I pointed out to you, attribution of images is properly done on the image page, as you have now done; I don't consider it acceptable to have your name as part of the caption on the page itself. I take it that you will also be adding a tag releasing the images for use under the GPL. If you don't, a bot will be around shortly to remove them. I'm not going to argue that the photos are not an improvement - they clearly are - so I do hope you will provide the necessary tag so that they can stay.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reason I said I'd bring the situation to the attention of an admin was that you just kept reverting the article, with no apparent intention of discussing the matter or making any changes, and despite my having left two comments on your talk page. That in itself is unacceptable behaviour, and more than sufficient grounds for complaint (<a href="../../../3/r/r/Wikipedia%7E3RR_f20a.html" title="Wikipedia:3RR">Wikipedia:3RR</a>). It may seem childish to you, but that's the way it works. It wasn't something I wanted to do, but if someone won't discuss the matter, there is no real alternative. Now that you have decided to discuss it, hopefully that won't be necessary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As for putting your side, I'm not actually under any obligation to do that; I'm hardly going around saying things behind your back, and you have now had ample opportunity to put your own point of view. I would say that a little less hysterical squealing about injustice and male oppression, and a bit more quiet reasoned argument might be more effective, but that's just my personal view.

I certainly don't dispute that some bras are worn by some men, but I think it is far from a matter of course, and certainly not common enough to merit a place at the head of the article. The statement as it stood was fairly misleading (assuming there's anyone reading Wikipedia who doesn't already know what a bra is and who wears them anyway), because it implied some level of parity in the number of male and female brassiere wearers. Even if the internet article referenced is taken at face value, it only implies that 40% of males may have gynecomastia, which doesn't really tell us anything about how many might be wearing bras. Contrast this with common sense, which tells us that approximately no men wear bras. Joachim Heck 22:00, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with this. Please people, stop putting references to male bras in the first sentence. I understand some men might wear bras, but it's a major majority and the opening sentence isn't the place for these comments. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 20:57, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate the point you're trying to make here 88.108.52.34, but Wikipedia has to maintian a neutral point of view. Yes we should include all relevenat info, but it has to be balanced, and the suggestion that bras are unisex is not realistic. The link that keeps being cited <a href="http://www.007b.com/bra-men.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.007b.com/bra-men.php" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> represents a certain point of view, and we should acknowledge that. The simple facts are: most women need to wear a bra, most men don't. The vast majority of bras (probably more than 99.999% at a rough guess, are worn by women. Also i find that site a bit objectioanble in its suggestion that being gay is "weird", but that's another point. Please, be reasonable here. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 21:05, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see male bras was reinserted - I have discussed this with others - this is NOT the place to discuss men and bras - it has its own article - it is out again!<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unisex?</span></h2>
<p>Please stop putting that the bra is a unisex foundation garment. It doesn't sepcify male or female, it just says "A brassiere or bra is a foundation garment which supports the breasts.". What is unreasonable about that?</p>
<p>I understand your point that a very small number of men wear bras, but this is mentioned later in the article, and doesn't belong in the intro. The <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">Automobile</a> page doesn't say "An automobile is a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own motor, which may be used for transport or for the sexual practice of dogging". <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 08:30, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you'll find the word 'Unisex' means it can be worn by either sex, which a Bra can actually be referred to as. And that Car explanation is a completely different kettle of fish. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheradioguy_a3fb.html" title="User:Theradioguy">Theradioguy</a> 19:57, 2nd October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK , the car example wasn't that great, but maybe the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbecue.html" title="Barbecue">barbecue</a> article should say:
<dl>
<dd>"Barbecue (also barbeque, abbreviated BBQ or Bar-B-Que or diminuted chiefly in Australia to barbie) is a method and apparatus for cooking food, often meat, which may be used by men or women"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I find this unisex business rather ridiculous. A bra is the least unisex garment imaginable (unless you could suggest another?), so should we insert the word unisex everywhere? If we say bras are unisex, then what isn't? Maybe we should point out that the <a href="../../../e/i/f/Eiffel_Tower_5c34.html" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> is unisex in some way, it is visited by approximately equal numbers of men and women (whereas with bras the gender proportions are more like a few hundred thousand to one, at a guess).</dd>
<dd>By inserting a reference to men wearing bras, you're confronting popular opinion, there's not necessarily anything wrong with that at all, but the context should indicate this. Putting the word "unisex" (without any appropriate citation justifying this term at any point in the article) in the first sentence of the article suggests that (a) approximately equal numbers of makes and females wear bras, and (b) bras are designed to be worn by either sex, both of which are clearly untrue. Even the link that has been provided (<a href="http://www.007b.com/bra-men.php" class="external text" title="http://www.007b.com/bra-men.php" rel="nofollow">Article about Men's Bra's</a>) acknowledges that it's uncommon for men to even have any need to wear a bra.</dd>
<dd>Please, if there's something encyclopeadic to be said about men's bras, or men wearing bras, then write it down and expand the article in a constructive way. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 16:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, I don't think the information about the bra replacing the corset is really necessary in the first line of the article either. I'm a little tired of editing that line though, so I'm not going to do it this time. Joachim Heck 21:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

so you're saying men can't wear bra's. urrrm, I think you and many others before me who have commented on this thread before believe they actually can. i read some of your silly comments about how they are apparently 'not' unisex, when unisex actually means 'for either sex'. and to your comment above if a man needs to wear a bra for bust support then he damn well can. i (even being female) agree that men should be able to wear bras if they need the support.

<dd>Men can wear bras if they want, that's fine. Some do wear bras. But we don't need to make this point in the first section of this article. It didn't mention sex at all until you added the unecessary comment about being worn by men or women. Please read the above points, and contribute sensibly to this discussion. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 08:39, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Breasts do not need bras for support! Nature did not make women's breasts to require 20th Century lingerie for support. The real purpose of bras is to sell women a product. Women are taught in this culture to feel their breasts need a bra to be culturally acceptable. This is sales, nothing else. There is nothing necessary about a bra. It is merely a fashion accessory. The problem is that the bra changes the breast shape, which compresses the breast tissue. This causes circulation problems, including impairment of lymphatic function. You can't change body shape without altering body function. This is why breast disease is only a problem in cultures where bras are worn. No bras, and there is no breast disease. Bras, therefore, are to support a fashion industry, not to support breasts.</dd>

<dd>When i made the above comment i was actually inviting discussion from an editor who kept changing the article to the meaningless phrase "breast area", but i think you make a good point. I don't entirely agree with it, but if you feel this point of view is under-represented in the article then please contribute more. Lots of women wear bras for support, i think that is obvious. Whether they <i>need</i> them or not is a complex question, and doesn't have a black and white answer. Bras have an important effect not just in fashion but in giving confidence to women (maybe i should say "breasted people"!) and in making them more physically and psychologically more comfortable with their bodies. I think it's fair to say that "No bras, and there is no breast disease" is a massive over-simplification as well, but your points are interesting. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESpute_7ca4.html" title="User:Spute">Spute</a> 20:57, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are the sources for this? And what is this "breast disease"? If people are going to make wild claims like that they should at least be specific. And before arguing bras are unnecessary and only some conspiracy of the fashion industry then, please, whoever wrote that should try running for a bus braless with very large breasts, and tell me you don't experience a lot of discomfort.</p>

<dd>Disagree -- <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bra.html" title="Bra">Bra</a> is actually a disambiguation page, so that this article would have to take the title of "Bra (garment)" or something like that -- and what would be the point?

<p>I'm not sure how you guys feel about this, but don't you guys think that it's kind of weird to have a picture of a guy in a bra in this article? For it to be one of the three pictures in this article draws a lot of attention to a phenomenon that I didn't even know existed. I hate to suggest it because I expect reactions to be mixed, but perhaps the section alone will suffice? Just putting the idea out on the table. —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 04:54, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I would suggest that "drawing a lot of attention to a phenomenon that we didn't even know existed" was precisely the point of putting it there. It has recently become very evident to me that certain people are pursuing a particular agenda through this article. Although I'm not unsympathetic to their desire to propogate their views or draw attention to something they feel to be important, I do think that it's being done at the expense of the article. An article which claims to be encyclopedic should aim at balance, and the male-bra issue is assuming a significance within it which is grossly disproportionate to the situation as it exists in real life. Yes, there are a few men who wear bras; the phenomenon does exist, and the point has been made. That doesn't mean that the article ought to present an even-handed unbiased picture of the bra as a unisex garment which worn by both sexes, because it's simply not. Personally I am in favour of the picture being removed. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 18:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
