<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Vice_aaad.html" title="Edit section: Controversy over alleged plagiarism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy over alleged plagiarism</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after Vice's short story collection <i>The Bear Bryant Funeral Train</i> was published, a readers' adviser to the Tuscaloosa Public Library in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> noticed that one of the stories bore a similarity to a section of the classic 1934 nonfiction book, <i>Stars Fell on Alabama</i> by Carl Carmer.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Vice's 20-page short story, "Tuscaloosa Knights," used the background, setting and some <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialogue.html" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a> from Carmer's book, specifically a four-page section of the chapter "Tuscaloosa Nights," which describes a <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> rally in that city. The library adviser notified the University of Georgia Press, which had published Vice's book.</p>
<p>Vice said that he was not copying Carmer's original section but wrote the story in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homage.html" title="Homage">homage</a> to Carmer's book. He said he used sections of Carmer's description and dialogue to add "authority to my story with the visual details of Carmer's historical reckoning. I made a terrible error in judgment by omitting to acknowledge this due to my ignorance concerning the principles of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Even though <i>The Bear Bryant Funeral Train</i> failed to cite Carmer's book, Vice's doctoral dissertation (which was an earlier draft of the book) did contain an epigraph from Carmer's book at the start of the story in question.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Vice has stated that he was advised to remove this and other epigraphs before publication "to make the book look more conventional."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this apology and explanation, the University of Georgia Press revoked Vice's prize and destroyed all copies of the book.</p>
<p>While many literary commentators and editors agreed that Vice had made a mistake in failing to cite the original source of the story, there was also a feeling that the University of Georgia Press overreacted to the situation. Jake Adam York, a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">Southern United States</a> poet and editor of the Alabama literary journal <i>Thicket</i>, noted that Vice had allowed his short story and the four-page section of Carmer's original book to be published side by side in <i>Thicket</i>. To York, this action by Vice "implicitly acknowledges the relationship (and) allows the evidence to be made public." York added that doing this allowed the readers to enter the "intertextual space in which (Vice) has worked" and that what Vice was doing with his story was <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allusion.html" title="Allusion">allusion</a>, not <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>. York also stated that, according to his own analysis of Vice's story and Carmer's source material, Vice did not break copyright law.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other commentators and editors who supported Vice stated that Vice was following in a long line of authors adapting older literary works for modern times.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Examples of this include <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Randall_4b4e.html" title="Alice Randall">Alice Randall</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wind_Done_Gone_a82e.html" title="The Wind Done Gone">The Wind Done Gone</a></i> (based on <i><a href="../../../g/o/n/Gone_with_the_Wind_9512.html" title="Gone with the Wind">Gone with the Wind</a></i>), <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzan-Lori_Parks_6e0d.html" title="Suzan-Lori Parks">Suzan-Lori Parks</a>' <i>Getting Mother's Body</i> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Swift_7fbf.html" title="Graham Swift">Graham Swift</a>'s <i>Last Orders</i> (both updated versions of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Faulkner_788f.html" title="William Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>’s <i><a href="../../../a/s/_/As_I_Lay_Dying_b4ec.html" title="As I Lay Dying">As I Lay Dying</a></i>), and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Stoppard_8156.html" title="Tom Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>'s <i><a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosencrantz_%26_Guildenstern_Are_Dead_0f4f.html" title="Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead">Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead</a></i> (which plays off of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>). <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Others stated that Vice' publisher acted in "haste" and questioned why the book had to be destroyed for what was probably not a copyright violation or a case of plagiarism.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Still, there were commentators who felt that Vice was indeed guilty of plagiarism and received the punishment he deserved. These commentators tended to state that since Vice was a professor of English, he should have known what he was doing.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among those who believed Vice did wrong was writer <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Clark_Young_c34b.html" title="Robert Clark Young">Robert Clark Young</a>, who later published a journalistic article claiming to expose an additional case of plagiarism. Young said he discovered this new evidence by reading Vice's dissertation draft of <i>The Bear Bryant Funeral Train</i>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> However, others quickly stated that Young's article and his evidence for his claims had serious flaws, including the failure by Young to quote accurately from Vice's dissertation (such that this made the case for plagiarism appear stronger than it was), the failure to mention supporting evidence from the dissertation, and the failure to disclose a conflict of interest in writing the article.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> As a result of this, some commentators questioned the article's findings.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Atlantic_Monthly_522b.html" title="The Atlantic Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>'s C. Michael Curtis, who edited and published the short story which Young said proved an additional case of plagiarism, later said he,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...decided to postpone (the story's) publication until we had worked with Vice to prevent easily-avoided overlap in some particular details. The story of Bear Bryant’s first A&amp;M football team seemed to us well-known and not the property of (the author of Vice's source material) or anyone else. Further, the heart of the story we believed, then and now, to be the invention of Brad Vice, even though elements of its drama is placed in the familiar setting." <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young's article also featured a lengthy attack on the Sewanee Writers' Conference and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Hannah_7eca.html" title="Barry Hannah">Barry Hannah</a>. Vice's supporters mentioned that Young had previously had a run in with Hannah and Vice at the Sewanee Conference and suggested that his article about Vice was an attempt at revenge.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> In response to this, some of Young's supporters said that a smear campaign was being conducted against Young by Vice's advocates.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Vice's book was destroyed, remaining used copies on <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and other booksellers were selling for hundreds of dollars.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>On March 27, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, a new edition of the collection will be published by River City Publishing. According to a report in <i>The Oxford American</i>, "The revised version will more closely mirror Vice’s 2001 dissertation from the University of Cincinnati, which contained many of the stories that ended up being published as <i>The Bear Bryant Funeral Train</i>. Unlike the UGA Press edition, it will be divided into two sections, the latter of which is set entirely in Tuscaloosa. In his dissertation, Vice described the Tuscaloosa stories as an 'attempt to reconcile the seemingly incompatible movements of Southern regionalism and international postmodernism.' In that vein, it contained epigraphs by Albert Camus, Basho, Guy Davenport, Bear Bryant, and, more importantly, Carmer, all of which will reappear in the River City edition."<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The reissue will also contain essays from other writers and professors to provide context for both the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodern.html" title="Postmodern">postmodern</a> approach employed by Vice and the controversy surrounding the first edition.</p>
