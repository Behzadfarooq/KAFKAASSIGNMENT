	    <p><b>Significant Gestures</b></p>
<p>Significant gestures refer to gestures that require thought before a response is made (Ritzer 56).</p>
<p>The importance of significant gestures was studied by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Herbert_Mead_1dad.html" title="George Herbert Mead">George Herbert Mead</a>. He is considered as “perhaps the most important theorist of everyday life in the history of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociology.html" title="Sociology">sociology</a>” (Ritzer 55). He trained in and taught philosophy at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, but is most likely known best as one of the fathers of sociology (www.guweb2.gonzaga.edu). He was a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Researcher.html" title="Researcher">researcher</a>, a social and educational reformer, a policymaker, a strike-arbiter, and a fund-raiser for organizations dedicated to advancing the right of <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigrants.html" title="Immigrants">immigrants</a>, women, and laborers (Bushman 254). He published numerous papers during his lifetime and, following his death, several of his students produced four books in his name from Mead's unpublished notes and manuscripts, from students' notes, and from stenographic records of some of his courses at the University of Chicago ([www.iep.utm.edu]).</p>
<p>Significant gestures are different than nonsignificant gestures because only humans are capable of making significant gestures. Animals are only capable of nonsignificant gestures. According to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Ritzer_d3ac.html" title="George Ritzer">George Ritzer</a>, “What distinguishes people from lower animals is not only their ability to think about a response before emitting it, but to control what they do” (57). These significant gestures rest upon "an arousal in the individual himself of the response which he is calling out in the other individual, a taking of the role of the other, a tendency to act as the other person acts" (www.bolender.com). Normal gestures are movements by one party that serve as <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stimuli.html" title="Stimuli">stimuli</a> to another party (Ritzer 56). Nonsignificant gestures require no thought; they are instincts that both humans and animals share.</p>
<p>“Significant gestures, to which meanings are ascribed, elicit responses to these meanings. This grasping of meanings defines a situation, and individuals act on the basis of this definition. Only in the case of <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolic.html" title="Symbolic">symbolic</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interaction.html" title="Interaction">interaction</a> can the situation itself become an object of reflection. Only in this sense, from the actor’s point of view, do options exist. Although a nonsignificant gesture may evoke the same response in two persons, the issue of note in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> versus <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subhuman.html" title="Subhuman">subhuman</a> interaction is the fact that individuals can and do act on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to acts of others”(Miller 605). Significant gestures can have common or uncommon responses. The uncommonality of a <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gesture.html" title="Gesture">gesture</a> rests on whether each gesture evokes a different response and has a different referent (Brewster 534). Furthermore any social <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organism.html" title="Organism">organism</a> whose responses are controlled by mere gestures can never respond to the group itself, but only to some part of the group act, and this part is always the part enacted by another organism. Also a gesture is uncommon if, for any reason, it is not functionally identical for the same receptors of two or more organisms.</p>
<p>Mead went much further than any other scholar in analyzing the nature of human social interaction. He observed that such interaction may take place through a conversation of gestures or through the use of significant symbols. In the latter case the participants approach and respond to one another indirectly through an interpretive process. This interpretive process makes interaction a matter of formative adjustment instead of a mere release of already formed patterns of response. Prevailing shemes of society do not catch this interpretive character of interaction.</p>
<p>Mead also discussed the use of significant gestures in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>. Mead wrote, “Through the use of language, through the use of the significant gestures, then, the individual does take the attitude of others….If, now, the individual calls out this attitude in others by a gesture, by a word which affects himself just as it affects others, then he will call out the same attitude in himself as others would….This gives the principal method of organization which, as I have said, we can study from the standpoint of behavioristic <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>”(McPhail 427). What Mead means by this is that the, “vocal gesture has an importance which no other gesture has. We can not see ourselves when our face assumes a certain expression. If we hear ourselves speak we are more apt to pay attention. One is more apt to catch himself up and control himself in the vocal gesture than in the expression of the countenance” (Brewster 536). One criticism of this idea is made by Karen Hanson stating that, “there are certain inadequacies in mead’s account, he takes the self to be equivalent or symmetrical with others in conversation, that is, the self hears words spoken as listeners do. But this is implausible- we do not hear ourselves as others hear us; neither do we react to our words exactly as our hearers do”(Frazer 134). An example of this is if you say hurtful things to someone they do not affect you in the way they do the person you say them to. Nevertheless Mead placed much importance on language and vocal gestures. Mead said that all vocal gestures for animals are nonsignificant and even some vocal gestures for humans to, such as snoring or coughing (Ritzer 57). Besides the few nonsignificant human vocal gestures all others are considered to be significant, the most important of them involving language. “This system of significant gestures is responsible for the great advances of human society” (Ritzer 57).</p>
<p>Mead claims that the significant gesture is the key element to social thought. Significant gesture is the idea that the human being may respond to his own gesture as others in his group respond to it. This common or shared response enables human being</p>
<p>1) To develop meanings and hence to create and live in a world of objects</p>
<p>2) To anticipate the behavior of others and hence to construct acts in the light of that anticipation.</p>
<p>3) To carry in their own makeup the behavior of others</p>
<p>4) To form selves within enable the construction of action by taking account of situations.</p>
<p>David Miller contests that these “schemes of human society do not even touch on these matters, much less explain them. They fail ignominiously to explain how human beings can act jointly, even though acting jointly is the basic feature of human societies”(miller 903).</p>
