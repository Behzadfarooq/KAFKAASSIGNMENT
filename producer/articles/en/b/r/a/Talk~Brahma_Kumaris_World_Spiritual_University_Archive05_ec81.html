<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOVs for Discussion</span></h2>
<p>OK. NPOVs for Discussions. One at a time. No more personal attacks. No more crapflood. No more discussing the discussion. If you use three equal signs before and after a topic, like this "===Topic===", we can create a manageable sub-list of points to discuss. My suggestion is that we work to create the list first, have a little cooling off period, order them according to the article and then discuss them. New issues arising can be discussed in new headlines. Alternatively, we can work our way down the page paragraph by paragraph.</p>
<p>I would like to raise the the issue of membership, financial status and charitable giving, perhaps the later the UN relationship. I hope that BKs will come forward with the pre-requisite figures. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 03:45, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Financial status and charitable giving</span></h3>
<p>Both figures from all zones please, Americas, India, Australasia, Africa etc.<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 18:28, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Membership_figures" id="Membership_figures"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Membership figures</span></h3>
<p>I have in my possession a letter from the BKWSU stating that they have "no membership" and merely operate an "open door" policy. (Pressumably open door unless you are a PBK). Alternatively BK administrative head Jank Kripalani states they will have 900,000 followers this year. Across the internet figure vary widely from 450,000 to 800,000 but may of these would appear undated or out of date. Obviously, big numbers constitute good PR, "900,000 people could not be wrong" so what is the official figure.</p>
<p>A question to ask here is, what constitutes a "member"? How long does it take to become a BK? How and at what point is one recognized as a BK? And does one ex-communicate oneself by leaving as the average lifespan is said to be about 5 years? Do only a whiteclad senior BKs or centre-in-charges count? Or reliable, 7 day a week Amrit vela and Morning Class attendee. How do they calculate their laity and what status do they have?</p>
<p>The organization is not forthcoming in these figures nor how they are culculated and so I think we should remove any claims in size. Likewise, how many centers to they have? I can only see tens listed on the internet and yet they claim thousands. This discrepancy is too large to be scientific. So can BKs accurately qualify the numbers of dedicated centers and separate them from the number of "Gita Pathshalas", or family homes used as makeshift centers? Again, actual figures rather than PR <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 18:28, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">New Religious Movement or Cult?</span></h3>
<p>I'd say <i><a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a></i> is problematic, as it almost always has negative connotations. As the Cult article says, no group ever calls itself a cult, only the group's opponents. On the other hand, I'm not particularly satisfied with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Religious_Movement_5f9f.html" title="New Religious Movement">New Religious Movement</a>. Any other suggestions? –<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">RHolton</a><a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERholton_ce4f.html" title="User talk:Rholton"><b><font size="3">≡</font></b></a>– 04:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its very difficult and it throws us into the very deep end of the academic and politic thought on the matter. I would say that not only opponents use the term cult. Indeed, Dr Eileen Barker who must been seen as a leading proponent, if not initiator, of the term "New Religious Movement" also uses the term cult and admits its interusability. Cult really has a neutral meaning, devalued by sensationalistic journalism and oppositional activists and its hard consonants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We also find ourselves at odd between the camps of sociology and psychology. If psychology identifies a series of psychologically coercive practises, and a NRM uses most or all of them, at what point does it cross the line? For example, given this list; <a href="https://www.freedomofmind.com/forms/submitgroupinfo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.freedomofmind.com/forms/submitgroupinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I would say that the BKWSU uses most. <b>The compromise would be to say, "of which some/many see as a cult", or "of which uses practises some/many/psychologists identify as coercive and used by groups identified as a cult.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The BKWSU's own position is that they are not a cult; they are the one, only, true religion and the inspiration of all other religions and God comes to speak to them only. Every other religion is impure. Being Millenarianistic, believing in an immanent "Destruction" of the world, this immediately, in my opinion puts them in the cultic "stage" in their development. However, if we look at the Jehovah Witness, Seventh day Adventists, Mormons etc, we see how groups evolve from cultic stages, to NRM, to established minor religions usually with a re-writing of their credo, as the BKWSU is engaged in. As an aside perhaps it is time for academia to view cult as a stage in social and religious development development rather than an end point of definition for all such groups. See reference to average lifespan above and in cited documentation. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 18:28, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think both terms should be avoided, primarily because they evoke negativity (per the previous statement).</dd>
<dd>A broader reference term such as 'doctrine', maybe more suitable as it doesn't narrowly focus on religion (both so called new and old) and it provides an even plateau for comparison with all schools of thought. 67.79.31.88 18:24, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is we are not documenting merely the BKWSU Doctine, we are documenting the BKWSU as a whole. If there was a good argument or argeement to split the topic into doctrine from the historical social movement, then fine. NRM is a positive term.</dd>
<dd>Can we start by comparing BK lifestyle against academically accepted cult or psychologically coersive techniques given above? I would say that the doctine is operated within a cultic model, e.g. the secrecy surrounding the Murli teaching, the division between the "chosen few" Brahmins and the impure untouchables.

<dd>These are just some of the few things they control in members/followers lives via tenets/beliefs.

<dd>In fact the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University_884e.html" title="Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University">Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University</a> tries to state that they are not a religion so as to bring folks in with promises of “meditation”, “stress reduction”, “cultural understanding” and even “weight loss”. Oh, and <b>there isn’t any “University”</b>, unless the location is in the subtle region (heaven to non-BKs).

<dd>Actually, the best solution would be to find a reliable reference (not BK or former BK) that talks about BKWSU and quote them.

<dd>On the basis of the examples of cult-like behavior listed above, you can count me amongst the apologists and I would argue NRM. I do not think that they are particularly unique nor accurate either in detail or understanding. Some are merely a Western misinterpretation of cultural practises widespread in the Middle and Far East, i.e. food politics of the Indian caste system, toileting in tropical climates, monastic traditions all be they practised within domestic environments.</dd>

<dd>The third party sources are quite sound. The problem with falling back on other academic sources in that we fall back on the divides between apologists, apostates and the fads and fashions of academic funding. Religious sociology is a small field in which one man's funding application is a cult, when anothers is an NRM. Cult's political value has fallen whilst NRM's has had a minor revival and is sustaining itself. Just.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Talk page etiquette</span></h2>
<p>Please, everyone be careful when you edit this page. In very recent history, an editor inadventantly obliterated another editor's post (which was later restored by a third editor). Serious misunderstandings begin this way.</p>
<p>Also, when archiving previous content, always archive in context. Don't pull pieces of a section out of the main talk page to the archive. Do the whole thing or nothing.</p>
<p>I'd also beg people to restrain themselves from messing with other people's posts, even if you're just wikifying or fixing a spelling error. If you <i>must</i> do this sort of editing, make sure that you do not in any way alter the content of the post, and do this sort of editing separate from adding your own contents. The problem is that these kind of edits make it almost impossible for someone attempting to follow the flow of conversation in the history.</p>
<p>Finally, please retain the posting order: add your posts to the bottom of the section, and if you're creating a new section, add it to the bottom of the page. Yes, there are <i>rare</i> exceptions, but let's keep them rare.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Let us focus in the article</span></h2>
<p>Dear Souls, Om Shanti! Hope you are doing well these days… I would like to acknowledge the timely input of RHolton; his input allowed some of us to smell the roses, go to the beach, have regular meditations, etc… Things are great when you do not have to revert a long time expected and well deserved NPOV in this article. Thanks! Thus, now is about the article, “Past is Past…” Here I go...:</p>
<p>Let me start with this very important Wikipedia policy: <b>VERIFIABILITY</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>1. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources. 2. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be challenged or removed by any editor. 3. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</p>
<p><b>Please keep in mind point #3.</b></p>
<p>Now, let me dissect the article paragraph by paragraph. As we move along, besides the "verifiability" policy; I am sure other policies will come up, which I will make sure to provide.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the NPOV article in question: “Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya or the BKWSU, is a new religious movement that began in 1937 based on the experiences of Lekhraj Kripalani in Sindh (present day Pakistan).The BKWSU teaches of a form of meditation involving spirit channeling it calls Raja Yoga, in confusion with classical Patanjali's Raja Yoga, through Raja Yoga Centers worldwide."</p>
<p><b>Questions:</b></p>
<p>1) What is the source for the above mentioned statement?</p>
<p>The source may need to be academic, researched by holders of graduate degrees. Would you kindly point out your source? Please check this page out:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Finding_good_sources" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Finding_good_sources" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Finding_good_sources</a>. Please, if applicable provide the ISBN number since readers would like to double check the source.</p>
<p>2)Brahma Kumaris is being labeled as "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Religious_Movement_5f9f.html" title="New Religious Movement">New Religious Movement</a>" in the article. Sources? please.</p>
<p>3) <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> pointed out in RHolton’s talk page the following: “We are going to have problems Mr Holton because you have admin status to throw around but your opening comments are factually inaccurate. The BKWSU was not founded in 1937, the precursor Om Mandali was World Renewal Trust followed. The "University" is not real university and as such not founded, it might be misleading. Additionally, the founder was not Brahma Baba but Shiva Baba. And the citation are clearly available and non-contentious. So caution please if we are to be accurate. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 18:15, 12 October 2006 (UTC)”</p>
<p>Accordingly, why is not “ShivBaba” in this paragraph? ("the founder was not Brahma Baba but Shiva Baba.") Is 1937 the real date? Sources, please...sources.</p>
<p>4) What is the source for the "The BKWSU teaches of a form of meditation involving spirit channeling it calls Raja Yoga, in confusion with classical Patanjali's Raja Yoga, through Raja Yoga Centers worldwide."? I am really curious about the source of this excerpt.Please provide the references. As an aside, I just want to comment that I do not foresee any problems with Mr. Holton’s input, on the contrary; his impartial input is truly appreciated.</p>
<p>Note: If there are no <b>verifiable</b> references for these points, the paragraph must be deleted from Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>One of the problems in your approach Luis is that you ignore what you do not like to see or cannot win, go for the personal attack, adopt a full on and aggressive distortions to the facts without addressing the multifold citations that have already been offered to you. As you see above, we have the <b>"The Spanish Parliamentary Commission"</b> and <b>"The National Assembly of France"</b> both label the BKWSU a <b><a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a></b>. Is that not satisfactory? Are we happy therefore to label the BKWSU a cult instead of a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Religious_Movement_5f9f.html" title="New Religious Movement">New Religious Movement</a>? I am actually happy either way but NRM is more diplomatic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sources do not need to be academic, for example, an article on Christianity can perfectly well quote the Bible as source [which it does]. An article on the BKWSU can reference the Murlis or its own materials. The guidelines state "easily verifiable", so, for examples, if I state that the <b>BKWSU has been accuse of torture and kidnapping</b> and then offer the reference of the Deccan Times <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/may162005/state1933162005515.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/may162005/state1933162005515.asp" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> that is perfectly adequate. If I give an actual date of a Sakar Murli, any interested researcher can attended their local BK Raja Yoga center and request a copy of it to check or the see the increasing number published on the internet, e.g. <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/index.php?title=Category:Sakar_Murli" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/index.php?title=Category:Sakar_Murli" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>With reference to <b><a href="../../../c/h/a/Channelling_%28mediumistic%29.html" title="Channelling (mediumistic)">Spirit channelling</a></b>, the easily verifiable source is the BKWSU's own teaching manual mid to late-1990s which has been reproduced in full here, <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/index.php?title=Category:Teacher_Training_Manual" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/index.php?title=Category:Teacher_Training_Manual" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. In which it is clearly stated by the BKWSU that the method by which so-called Shiva talks through Lekhraj Kirpalani is spirit channelling. Just out of interest, what else would you call it?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>With reference to the <b>various stages and dates of founding</b> in the history of the BKWSU, I am very happy for you to provide your detailed information. The legal entities, e.g. Word Renewal Trust, might be the most easily referenced and there is going to be debate as to when the spirit Shiva established what when as many BKs will argue that it was actually done via Lekhraj Kirpalani's business partner Sevak Ram through which Shiva explained to Kirpalani what was happening. As the early gatherings were informal, I think it will be very hard to put precise dates but am surprised the dates of the initial possession were not recorded.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Otherwise, what do you want to do ... erase the entire article? But whilst you are here, please address the issues raise above re <b>Sevak Ram, finances, membership and centers</b>.

Dear .244, I am glad to see that my post is complete… Now, let me address your points: Please read the post in Spanish which TalkAbout referred to: what I read there is not the word “cult.” I read “sect” Do you see that? (In Spanish both words are different) The note posted had Eloy Rodríguez-Valdés as the author. He is a psychologist. Do you believe that a Psychologist is in fact authoritative to write about religion and spiritual movements? Please follow this wikipedia rule: “published by reputable sources.” Since you mentioned about Christianity, here is a link to the wikipedia site: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity</a> Please note the neat references. As far as “sect, “ cult” or “NRM” what should be posted in the wikipedia article is this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Cult.2C_sect" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Cult.2C_sect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Cult.2C_sect</a> Then, yes.. I agree with you…According to Wikipedia (see link) the term NRM should be used, and “sect and cult” avoided. See? That is reasonable. I am helping you with this source to support the addition of NRM in the article. Of course, that is not how Brahmins see ourselves, or some else but since we are in WIKIPEDIA, we need to follow WIKIPEDIA conventions.</p>
<p>Please take a minute to read the following: “Wikipedia articles include material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. That is, we report what other reliable sources have published, whether or not we regard the material as accurate. In order to avoid doing original research, and in order to help improve the quality of Wikipedia articles, it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data, has been published by a reputable third-party publication (that is, not self-published) that is available to readers either from a website (other than Wikipedia) or through a public library. <b>It is very important to cite sources appropriately, so that readers can find your source and can satisfy themselves that Wikipedia has used the source correctly.”</b> From: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research</a></p>
<p>When writing an article, it is very important to know what is a “primary source, ” “secondary source, “ etc. An on-line newspaper it is not a “reputable source.” <i>unless</i> it is in the same category as the “New York Times.” See this article in the same newspaper you used in your link: <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct172006/update8203720061017.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct172006/update8203720061017.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct172006/update8203720061017.asp</a> See their use of proper English, grammar, etc. This is far from “reputable.” As far as the article you linked, note that is one sided (Bias). We do not know the comments or arguments of the other side.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate: <i>Reliable publications</i>: “Reliable publications include peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house or university press, and divisions of a general publisher with a good reputation for scholarly publications.” In you example about Christianity, the sources are taken from “known academic publishing house or university press.” When you say: “Sources do not need to be academic.” That is true; however they must be reliable. Your newspaper link nor the site BKINFO fulfill this requirement. The same holds true for any publication made by a Brahma Kumaris publication. You cannot use that as “reliable” source because it does not fit the concept of “reliable publication” according to Wikipedia. Please see the link above. You cannot “just give a date of a sakar murli” you need to quote that from a reliable source. See that? With that in mind, you have not disclosed any “reliable” source for that first paragraph. In short: Please comply with this requirement. Use a scholar or a reputable source to back up your statements. Do not use a Brahma Kumaris publication because it does not comply with the concept of reliability stated by Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You wrote: “Otherwise, what do you want to do ... erase the entire article? But whilst you are here, please address the issues raise above re Sevak Ram, finances, membership and centers. “ I do not pretend to erase the whole article, but if you do not present any reliable sources, according to wikipedia we will need to consider that. As far as the other issues, if they are in the current article, they may need to be addressed at the proper time. Please do not try to modify or add any more information to the current article.</p>

<dd>Let me write the WIKIPEDIA policy one more time: <b>Reliable publications:</b> “Reliable publications include peer-reviewed journals, books published by a known academic publishing house or university press, and divisions of a general publisher with a good reputation for scholarly publications.” This is self-explanatory. BK press is not included here. See that?</dd>
<dd>Brahma Kumaris is a Spiritual University. It is not an academic university. University is derived from the Latin universitas, meaning corporation (since the first medieval European universities were often groups of scholars-for-hire). In BK we have seniors who have achieved a high degree of spiritual awareness, thus our "faculty." Even though, someone may have several academic degrees, he/she may not fit that qualification (spiritual awaraness). Please do not argue against.. just provide the reliable publications as established by WIKIPEDIA...and remember those are not my rules, those are WIKIPEDIA's.</dd>

<dd><b>"Wikipedia is real clear on that. First everything has to be "published by a reliable source" or it can't be included WP:V. This is to keep out original research, ideas posted on bulletin boards, blogs, newsgroups, rumors, and such. Without that, Wikipedia would soon be glutted with all kinds of advertisements and stuff which was not at all encyclopedic. Its got to be good, reliable, published information. Well, the Scientology data is something like 40 million words. But you are hard pressed to find good, reliable publication against it. And critical stuff is mostly not about aspects of Scientology but more like, "critical to the reputation of Scientology".

On the basis of what you have written, I submit that we really have to note the BKWSU's fraudulent representation of itself as a University, although I accept increasingly BK members are becoming "scholars-for-hire", and its cult-like nature in the article as a whole. Do you have any citations from reliable sources that have investigated the BKWSU and found it not to be a cult? What else could it be? I am not say that it does not do good, we should document that too but it is for you to provide verifiable sources. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 23:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Dear .244, I am glad you are finally using wikipedia to support your claims! Please do not start name calling and going into personal attacks. Remember this line you wrote:<i>"The real-world identity or beliefs of any of the contributors to this article are completely irrelevant."</i> You are the main editor of this article, thus you need to provide reliable support when requested. Otherwise, anyone can post whatever they want about BK. See that? Just concentrate on the article. OK? This is going to be a long one, my friend. But I needed extra time to obtain all the info you requested. I hope you will do the same for me when I request a "reliable source."</p>
<p>If you read in the same policy you quoted (verifiability) under “sources of dubious reliability” you will find the following: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Verifiability&amp;diff=81858242&amp;oldid=81856805" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Verifiability&amp;diff=81858242&amp;oldid=81856805" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Verifiability&amp;diff=81858242&amp;oldid=81856805</a> In general, sources of dubious reliability are sources with a poor reputation for fact-checking, or with no fact- checking facilities or editorial oversight. Sometimes a statement can only be found in a publication of dubious reliability, such as a tabloid newspaper. If the statement is relatively unimportant, remove it. If it is important enough to keep, attribute it to the source in question. For example: "According to the British tabloid newspaper <i>The Sun</i>..." <b>As a rule of thumb, sources of dubious reliability should only be used in articles about themselves.</b> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Self-published_and_dubious_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">below</a> However, even those articles should not – on the grounds of needing to give examples of the source's track record – <b>repeat any potentially libellous claims the source has made about third parties, unless those claims have also been published by more credible sources.</b> October 16, 2006.</p>
<p>I am showing this link from October 16 so, readers can note the changes that have happened since then (a few days ago.)</p>
<p>There are 3 problems with your (.244) citing of this policy:</p>
<p>1)The sources that you mentioned qualify under “sources of dubious reliability” since as I mentioned before, they do not belong to the category of “reliable sources” until it is quoted by a reliable publication. Therefore, these “dubious sources” can only qualify as sources for this article <b>IF they are being used in an article about “ourselves”</b> thus, the author(s) of this article are far from qualifying of being considered “ourselves.” As a matter of fact, it is an article written by a group (or individual) against “ourselves.” (The BK) Therefore, your claim does not fit this rule.</p>
<p>2)Quote:“Even those articles should not – on the grounds of needing to give examples of the source's track record – repeat any potentially libellous claims the source has made about third parties, unless those claims have also been published by more credible sources.” Claims that main editors are making in this article clearly fit under the “libellous” label (harmful and often untrue.) You cannot use those articles to do that. UNLESS you have a reliable source.. a “credible source.” (which you don’t.)</p>
<p>3) Note that out of all the bullets you pointed out to support your use of “dubious sources” the following do not apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not contentious: Clearly what the editors wrote in this article is contentious.(As explained above.)</li>
<li>It is not unduly self-serving: Far from true. It is completely the opposite, the statements in the article, the written form of it have a high tendency to discredit the BK. The use of “weasel” words to discredit the BK movement is high.</li>
<li>It does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject: This article has been referring to several other groups and how BKs are the “bad guys” when dealing with them. Your links about obscure newspapers and bias websites lacking reliability are the proof for that.</li>
<li>There is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it: Proof? How?</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, please use reliable sources. Otherwise this article lacks validity.</p>
<p>I would like to note the style in writing this paper. It is a standard on all good articles to use citations. You can use the Harvard style for instance. It is not just a matter of saying: “I used so and so” cite his work accordingly and show us where it belongs in the article. Anyone can write footnotes with different things, but they have to match, so a reader can check the accuracy of your writing. As it stands right now, we see plenty of books and websites, but the article does not show at which point they were cited. You need to do this, however; it will be a waste of your time (but a good typing practice, nevertheless)unless you produce “reliable sources.” Let me give you a link that you can use for citing sources: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CITE" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CITE" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CITE</a></p>
<p>Now, I see that you are adding references and there is a new user who is making “small, almost unnoticeable changes in the article,” “wikifying it.” Old habits are hard to break... Thank you wikipedia for the back up copies.</p>
<p>Also, let’s get the tasks straight here. It is your job to provide sources. Why? Because you are the main editor of this article. That is not my job. If you feel with the authority to write about an institution which you do not belong to and whithout a doubt feel animosity towards it, then the very least you can do is to show reliable sources for your writings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to set the example about “doing your work the right way” let me share with you this scholar source: <b>Richard Barz, Ph.D.</b> Professor Barz has visited Mt. Abu in 1967 and 1984. You can see his qualifications and expertise in the link below .244…<b><i>PLEASE: this is what you need to provide: “reliable sources.”</i></b> <a href="http://asianstudies.anu.edu.au/wiki/index.php/Dr_Richard_Barz" class="external free" title="http://asianstudies.anu.edu.au/wiki/index.php/Dr_Richard_Barz" rel="nofollow">http://asianstudies.anu.edu.au/wiki/index.php/Dr_Richard_Barz</a></p>
<p>I contacted him and below you will see his reply in relation with the “cult” word that you seem to enjoy so much and use without caution: (I had changed our email addresses, in order to avoid spamming, but I know you can get that info, right?)</p>

<p>You can read his scholar article about BK in this book. .244, to be an editor requires some work. It is not a matter to throw in whatever comes to mind.</p>
<p>Last but not least… hope you are fluent in Spanish before you pretend to make me believe that “cult” and “sect” are the same. Keep in mind that there is a strong bias in Spanish speaking countries. The religion there is Catholicism. Anything else is usually labeled as “cult”, “sect”, “nrm” etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, as it stands: The first paragraph of the article has the necessary support to name BK as either NRM (according to Wikipedia) or a “Religion” according to Professor Barz expert opinion in this subject. Anything else in that paragraph does not have any reliability as of today. If you provide the “reliable sources” then we can move on into the second paragraph. Please do not delay, I am eagerly looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Best Wishes .244,</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Professor Richard Barz and the use of Psychologist to determine Psychologically Coercive Techniques</span></h2>
<p>Luis,</p>
<p>no, I am afraid the first paragraph is not done. We still have governmental assemblies stating "Cult". Additionally, you are ignoring the BKWSU's own published literature both in terms of publicity, teaching manuals and Murlis which are both entirely supportative of the statements in the first paragraph, which the BKWSU finds credible and are fine by wikipedia standards. If your argument is to disclaim what the BKWSU states about its own activities, then you will have to produce citations that counteracts the BKWSU's and God Shiva's own claims.</p>
<p><b>If you want to go down in the history of the 5,000 Year Kalpa as the BK Brahmin that argued that BK Raja Yoga was a "Vaishnavite religion", that is your business. For the sake of our BK Brahmin audience (this wont make much sense to non-BK Brahmins), you as a BK are saying that "Gyan" is Vaishnavite [worship of Vishnu] "Bhakti" because a "Kali Yugi Shudra" said so!?!</b> (Apologies to the good Professor but please appreciate I am using BK terms to illustrate here not my own).</p>
<p>I will state that the protection of "God's Words" channelled through the medium of Lekhraj Kirpalani, called the Sakar Murlis, behind pgp encryption and password protected websites is secretive and the re-editing of the same manipulative of the truth. I am interested in Professor Richard Barz's speciality in the Vallabhacarya sect but he must not be aware of the above. I understand how, as Lekhraj Kirpalani was related to it (a fact that I was challenged on by a BK), it might be possible to misconstrue a connection, but I find it hard to see how any religion that "worships" Shiva can be called Vaishnavite. Surely, it should be Neo-Shiavite? Shiva is not an incarnation of Vishnu, and I do not need citations to back that up! This brings his understanding, or exposure, into doubt. How much access he has been allowed to the original Murlis, is he aware of the child sex abuse cover up, the violent persecution of the PBKs, the failed prediction of Destruction in 1976 and so on?</p>
<p>As regards BK Raja Yoga being Bhakti; unfortunately, Professor Barz is entirely contradict by God Shiva in the Sakar Murli and numerous BKWSU published books referenced on the topic page. So which takes precedence? As a BK, you are essentially contradicting the BKWSU own publilcations and falsifying what you know to be true.</p>
<p><b>As far as the use of psychologist to determine psychologically coercive techniques in religions - whether new, orthodox or cultic - who else would you use? A theologian cannot be expect to be expert in psychologically damaging practises. A practitioner or recruiter even less so.</b></p>
<p>BTW, personal emails of this sort are not acceptable by Wiki standards. But, by all means, if you want me to start emailing around for a second opinion, I will do so.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confusion between classical or Patanjali's Raja Yoga and BK Raja Yoga</span></h2>
<p>For those not expert in yoga, a quick look at the Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a> article will help you appreciate what Classical Raja Yoga is. A yoga form with over 2,000 years of tradition, it is clearly entirely different from BK Raja Yoga. That the two are named the same is confusing, perhaps deliberately so on behalf of the BKWSU.</p>
<p>The actual date of inception of BK Raja Yoga is not know but it must be after 1936-1937 when the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirit</a> <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entity.html" title="Entity">entity</a> named after the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiva.html" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> first <a href="../../../p/o/s/Possess.html" title="Possess">possessed</a> Lekhraj Kirpalani and started <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channelling.html" title="Channelling">channelling</a> his "Knowledge" through him. It is recorded that in the early days of the Om Mandali/BKWSU Lekhraj Kirpalani was not the medium through which the knowledge was channelled and it is also recorded in the Sakar Murlis and BKWSU publications that the "Knowledge" and practise was not delivered complete. Therefore we cannot say exactly when BK Raja Yoga was first taught but we can safely say it was only in the last 70 years at the very most and most likely much less.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the BKWSU and senior faculty members of the BKWSU, such as Brian Bacon and Mike George of Oxford Leadership Academy. are referring to BK Raja Yoga as being "ancient" or "centuries old", e.g. at the 2004 Parliament of the World's Religions the BKWSU Erik Larson, Dadi Janki, Jayanti Kripalani did talk on "The Wisdom of Listening to God: Ancient Raja Yoga of Brahma Kumaris" <a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:X3P_ouTJ65YJ:www.cpwr.org/2004Parliament/parliament/programs3.htm+ancient+raja+yoga+Mike+George&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:X3P_ouTJ65YJ:www.cpwr.org/2004Parliament/parliament/programs3.htm+ancient+raja+yoga+Mike+George&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> or "Oxford Leadership Development Programme Learn the art of reflective inquiry, a deep reflection process based on the centuries old practice of Raja Yoga Meditation." Now, this I submit is both clearly untrue and that it does not require an expert academic opinion to point out the difference. Indeed, if a specialist opinion is required then it ought to come from a recognized yogic authority such as Vivekananda. Personally, I do not see anything contentious in this.</p>
<p>BK Raja Yoga is new, less than 70 years old not centuries. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patanjali.html" title="Patanjali">Patanjali</a>'s <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutras.html" title="Sutras">Sutras</a> or Classic <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a> is an enitrely different practise and more than 2,000 years old. I state that it is a confusion that needs to be clearly stated at the beginning of this article and so the statement as given does not need changed. If BK do wish to remove the statement, are they also going to assert that BK Raja Yoga is the original, Classical or Ancient Raja Yoga on the <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a> page as well?</p>

<p>Dear .244, Thank you for your quick reply. Let me be clear this time (perhaps I wasn’t before.) <b>You either provide reliable sources or that first paragraph will be erased, according to Wikipedia rules.</b> Before doing that, I will post a paragraph considering the evidence that we already have to replace the current one. I believe 3 days for you to produce reliable evidence for that first paragraph is plenty of time. If you did not have it and wrote the paragraph anyway, then … you don’t have evidence, don't waste our time here. As simple as that.</p>
<p>.244 we all know how easy it is for you to write and send emails around. Just remember to post a website with <b>the qualifications of your source</b> so I can double check it. You know I will.</p>
<p>Please let us know about your qualifications before you try to argue here about religious studies and research. Show proof of that. Let me copy again what you wrote: <b>"The real-world identity or beliefs of any of the contributors to this article are completely irrelevant."</b> That applies to you too. Do not forget that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.. I was forgetting about your friend, Green108… What can I say… If you do not like this debate.. just don’t look at it. If you think this article is not a big deal, good for you.. Others and myself included, do not think so. On the same token, If you like this article, then .. this is your chance to submit reliable sources so it can stay here.</p>

<p>OK. I have a citation from The London Observer dated September 1996. The London Observer is a Conservative broadsheet newspaper of public record, first published on 4 December 1791, and easily comparable to the New York Times that published the recent Wikipedia article. Indeed the British media, whether right or left wing, is general trusted more worldwide for its impartiality and detachment.</p>
<p>The London Observer records such BKWSU beliefs such as "<b>the axis of the [Earth] shall straighten from its angle of 23.5 degrees to the truly vertical</b>", "<b>The continents shall come together once more</b>" and "There will be springtime all year long ... a paradise of endless happiness" following Destruction.</p>
<p>It goes on to state that the "<b>The Brahma Kumaris emerged in India in 1937, when a wealthy Hindu diamond merchant, Dada Lekhraj, began to claim that Shiva, God the Supreme Soul, had entered him to begin the task of creating a new world order</b>" and the book "Adi Dev - The First Man" by Jagdish Chander.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Now, my question here, what is it called when one disincarnate spirit or soul enters into the body of another, takes control of it, starts talking etc?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In plain English, that is <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_possession.html" title="Spiritual possession">Spiritual possession</a>, or " the concept that gods, daemons, demons, animas, or other disincarnate entities may temporarily take control of a human body, resulting in noticeable changes in behaviour" to quote the wiki itself. There are no other word for it. Put that together with the BKWSU training manual, the Sakar Murlis and quotes given from Sister Jayanti regarding <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channelling_%28mediumistic%29.html" title="Channelling (mediumistic)">chanelling</a> and we have the first paragraph. Nothing controversial there; we have a paper of note, scripture, a published author and a senior administrator of the organization backing it all up.</p>
<p><b>In the article the journalist asks the BKWSU for comment on "whether six million Jews had died at the hands of the Nazis because of their 'bad karma'?" and the newspaper was told that, "Yes, indeed they had." My suggestion is that we include this in the section on Karma.</b></p>
<p>On a separate issue, the newspaper reports that London based Cult Information Centre, which monitors the activities of new religious movements, describes the BKWSU as a "religious cult". "<b>The Brahma Kumaris believe that the world is about to end in apocalyptic destruction, ushering in a Golden Age in which group members will be divine beings living in palaces 'decorated with multicoloured lights'</b>."</p>

<p>Dear .244, Thank you for you advice about the "sandbox," I agree that I am becoming more familiar with the policies at Wikipedia than the way you edit it...</p>
<p>Since you are preparing an "information pack to academics" right now, that means that you do not have the "reliable sources" as specified by Wikipedia to support your statements. Thus, you wrote this article without considering this important fact. Let me remind you that those references that you have are not cited at any point in that first paragraph in question.</p>
<p>As far as your article in the London Observer, please show us the site or make it somehow available for us to see it (your BKINFO site perhaps) As far as the first paragraph is concerned there is little that could be used. As a matter of fact, let me point out a reference which you added in this article (under bibliography/references) but have no cited at all: Dr. Kranenborg's work: <a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm</a> Please take a look at that article. Well written, in a non bias way, concise, "weasel words" are out of the question unlike the current article. See the difference? According to that article it says:"The movement was founded in 1936 in Karachi by Lekh Raj who was born in 1876." Thus, guess which "reliable source" is more reliable for an on line encyclopedia? Your newspaper or a scholar article. BTW, I obtained the permission from Dr. Kranenborg to quote his article...also take a look at the label he uses to describe BK: "Religion" or "new religion" thus in agreement with Dr. Richard Barz.</p>
<p>I know "bkwatch" has been very busy lately... hope to see a "reliable source" from your part tomorrow.</p>

<dd>yes i am upset by your comments, I quote 'Oh yeah.. I was forgetting about your friend, Green108… What can I say'. This implies some feelings on your behalf about me that I don't understand, also I don't like you saying you have the highest regard for me, are you saying you know me?.......who are you and why do you have opinions about me? I have asked you three times now, why don't you answer,,,,this is the business I care about, not the silly article, it's not a point scoring game, it's just an article about an organisation, so when I just happen to come on here to see how it's going, I read comments from a stranger that I feel are not in the highest regard at all, if I am wrong could you please explain it to me. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen108_7f29.html" title="User:Green108">Green108</a> 15:41, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confluence Age of 40 years / 1976 Destruction citations</span></h2>
<p>You are correct to state this this paragraph should be changed. It should read that "<b>at first it was taught that the Confluence Age was 40 years and then it was changed to 50/50, 50/60 ... etc.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The first reference or citation for this is a "<i>Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishvarya Vidyalya, HQ Pandav Bhavan, Mount Abu</i>" teaching aid poster "The Ladder", <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/uploads//e/e0/Ladder.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/uploads//e/e0/Ladder.jpg" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://www.shivbaba.org.pl/en/?name=galeria-3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shivbaba.org.pl/en/?name=galeria-3" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> in which it states clearly, "<b>Auspicious Confluence Age (Sangum Yuga) 40 Years</b>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also published and dated in <b>1967</b> is this BKWSU teaching aid poster "Lakshmi and Narayan" <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/uploads//3/33/Lakshmi-Narayan.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/uploads//3/33/Lakshmi-Narayan.jpg" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://www.shivbaba.org.pl/en/?name=galeria-2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shivbaba.org.pl/en/?name=galeria-2" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> which clearly states;</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>"Corruption, Irreligiousness, unrighteousness, vices, insolvency, and suffering will come to an end in Bharat within 9 years and Golden-aged, deity world-Sovereignty of Shri Lakshmi and Shri Narayan will come to be established after forth-coming huge World Destruction within 9 years"</i></b> .</p>
<p>which would equate to 1975-6 - or 40 years after the initial possession of Lekhraj Kirpalani and start of the channelled teachings.</p>
<p><br />
This and the other supporting citations, e.g. quotes from published books, magazines and scriptures, have all been previous given on these discussion pages and indeed the teaching posters are listed as a references on the topic page. Please do your homework first before making NPOV revisions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scriptural references for 40 years are; Avyakt Murli 25/10/69, 05/11/70, 03/02/71, 09/09/72, 04/02/74, 09/11/74 etc., as given here <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/articleindex.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/articleindex.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. As an example quotation from the 1969 Murli in which Shiva Baba says,</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>"The final Destruction of the whole World takes place within 6 years. Those who tell it to be 7 years have their position reduced"</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Scriptural references for 50 to 60 years are; Sakar Murli 2004/02/04</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Sadly, this underline how little due care and attention you are giving any given references that oppose your organization's current PR and, perhaps, how unaware or misled you have been of your own organization's history. If this is so, please ask your Senior Sisters why these changes have been written out of your organization's history, why the scriptures [Murlis] are being changed and what the significance of the 1976 date for Destruction was. Please note, the original posters were displayed in the Delhi center for many years with a sticker over the 40 years changing the date but these editions distributed worldwide. If you realy need me to pull out more references I can but I think we have established clear balance of probability, on sound citations, that I am correct.</b></p>

<p>This is the way the first paragraph of this article will look tomorrow unless "reliable sources" are presented today (10/24/06). Needless to say, any attempt to revert back without providing the required support will be considered vandalism.</p>
<p><b>Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya</b> or <b>Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University</b> is considered a new religious movement<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> according to John Wallis, Ph.D<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> or a religion<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> or as stated by Professor R. Kranenborg “Brahma Kumaris is in fact a new religion, originating within Hinduism but going its own way.” The Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University (<b>BKWSU</b>) teaches a form of meditation denominated Raja Yoga. According to Kranenborg: “<i>The entire way of the Brahma Kumaris can be characterized as raja yoga. One should not think here in the first</i> place of classical yoga, as described by Patanjali. Central to raja yoga is that one becomes connected with the Highest Soul and with the highest in oneself. It is a way to the true self, which is to be expressed in everyday life."</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Strong objection</b>. There is clearly no consensus on this. Especially whether or not Shiva is the highest soul. You do not provide any citations to suggest that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>There is no need to remove the core millenarianistic issues of Destruction and the Nuclear Holocaust that is so central and identifying to the BKWSU and you make no justification as to why it should be removed.</b></dd>

<dd>This paragraph, (first one) is referring to what is BK? what is Raja Yoga? and when it was founded and by whom?. I could add the "millenarian" label if you feel appropriate. After all Christianity is considered a millenarianistic religion as well, however; I do not see that in their WIKI page.</dd>
<dd>You have provided several books and links which do not match the content of this article.

<p>The movement was founded in 1936 in Karachi by Lekh Raj Kripalani who was born in 1876. "<i>When he wanted to withdraw from this life in 1936 so that he could devote himself to the spiritual life, he had a radical religious experience. He had the feeling that he had come into contact with the Supreme Soul or God; at the same time he experienced himself in this encounter as an eternal soul and the connectedness of that soul with the Supreme Soul.</i>”<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<dd><b>Strong objection</b> again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kirplani did not feel, it is cited clearly in BKWSU own publicity material that "God entered him". Whereas the initial possession by the so-called "Shiva", or "Supreme Soul" of Lekhraj Kirpalani, and the ensuing psychic visions of Destruction, Vishnu, souls leaving body etc, may have taken place from around 1936, the formation of some type of organisation, took place in 1937. Again, you have had the citation given to you many times.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>(1937)</b> - <i>Formation of world's first Trust of women and Baba's surrender of all property to the trust ". In the year 1937, a spiritual trust was constituted and Baba surrendered all his movable and immovable property to a committee of women and girls. Never before, in the history of the world had any mate [sic] surrendered all his belongings to a trust, constituted only of ladies. Nowhere had women been given such an honour, as here, to head and run a spiritual organisation. Baba called them Bharat Mothers and said that these would open the doors to paradise by educating people to be pure.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>[ ... and as a point of information, it was not the World's first Women Only Trust]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am afraid this underline how far out of touch with the reality of even your own organizations published history and how far you are pushing your own organization's PR agenda. This is not a Neutral Point of View. <i>"An exception to this rule of thumb is the technical use of this term in sociology, which is quite neutral (i.e. small religious group with novel religious beliefs and a high degree of tension with the surrounding society). However, the author shouldn't use the term in that sense without explaining exactly what he/she is doing, since that meaning is unfamiliar to most people. The adjective "cultic" (cultic group, cultic behavior) is in such cases preferable, as it is used in sociological context referring to the technical meaning but rarely in everyday language referring to the everyday meaning of cult."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>On the basis of the Wiki reference you are giving, I am fine with it. The Brahma Kumaris are a cult, exhibit cultic behavior and I am happy to follow the guidelines and write the article around why, as it suggests. These discussion pages are a fine example of the tensions both within and without the organization, made worse by the secretiveness [Murlis, see Kranenborgh above, being kept away from public and academic inspection] and dishonesty over its own history [Murli re-editing, Sevak Ram, 1976 Destruction etc]</b>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">.244 fails to provide reliable sources matching his paragraph.</span></h2>
<p>Dear.244, We will go back to the "cycle" of these articles. I wrote before, way up above...that you cannot use those sources and I gave reasons for it. Let me paste it again here. You have failed to provide reliable sources after the 3 days. All you are doing is arguing without support from reliable sources. Thus, the paragraph will be changed. Unless you show an accurate citation referring to that paragraph and using the Bibliography which you supplied, if you attempt to revert the article will be considered vandalism. You know, I will revert it back as it happened with the NPOV.</p>
<p>Here one more time: There are 3 problems with your (.244) citing of this policy:</p>
<p>1)The sources that you mentioned qualify under “sources of dubious reliability” since as I mentioned before, they do not belong to the category of “reliable sources” until it is quoted by a reliable publication. Therefore, these “dubious sources” can only qualify as sources for this article IF they are being used in an article about “ourselves” thus, the author(s) of this article are far from qualifying of being considered “ourselves.” As a matter of fact, it is an article written by a group (or individual) against “ourselves.” (The BK) Therefore, your claim does not fit this rule.</p>
<p>2)Quote:“Even those articles should not – on the grounds of needing to give examples of the source's track record – repeat any potentially libellous claims the source has made about third parties, unless those claims have also been published by more credible sources.” Claims that main editors are making in this article clearly fit under the “libellous” label (harmful and often untrue.) You cannot use those articles to do that. UNLESS you have a reliable source.. a “credible source.” (which you don’t.)</p>
<p>3) Note that out of all the bullets you pointed out to support your use of “dubious sources” the following do not apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not contentious: Clearly what the editors wrote in this article is contentious.(As explained above.)</li>
<li>It is not unduly self-serving: Far from true. It is completely the opposite, the statements in the article,</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 the written form of it have a high tendency to discredit the BK. The use of “weasel” 
 words to discredit the BK movement is high.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>It does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
This article has been referring to several other groups and how BKs are the “bad guys” when dealing
with them. Your links about obscure newspapers and bias websites lacking reliability are the proof for that.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>There is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it: Proof? How?</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, please use reliable sources. Otherwise this article lacks validity. Best, 72.91.4.91 12:30, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Whole sections are being Pruned off by Avyakt7</span></h2>
<p>Avyakt7 Luis et All/BK Tech Team are deleting whole sections while claiming to be adding citation:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=83276240" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=83276240" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=83276240</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Destruction has been provided with evidence on the very page.</li>
<li>Deleting information with citation is not proper.</li>
<li>Making the main paragraph into an advert for persons cited in wrong. Citations go into the proper area. There are only the points you choose to take to suit your interest/promotion. Will return back to discuss the other points in this area.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, once again the FULL TIME TECH TEAM is doing a hacket job on the article without denying any of the information or willing to answer "ONE" question posed to them. PEACE<a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkAbout_6f36.html" title="User:TalkAbout">TalkAbout</a> 14:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear TalkAbout:</p>
<p>Here it is what it was removed as I stated before:</p>
<pre>
I am citing Kranenborg. He is a Professor, he has done research in this subject.
Show your research counteracting this.
This paragraph, (first one) is referring to what is BK? what is Raja Yoga?
and when it was founded and by whom?. I could add the "millenarian" label if you feel appropriate.
After all Christianity is considered a millenarianistic religion as well, however;
I do not see that in their WIKI page.You have provided several books and links which do not match
the content of this article. As we discussed before, BK material is out of the question unless it
is quoted by a researcher. avyakt7 00:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
</pre>
<p>Talk About show us you research on this topic. At least one reference pointing to your article should be there.</p>
<p>Please do not make me repeat the same "record" over and over...Read my posts and show your research articles and then we can discuss this, otherwise; the page will be reverted. .244 has been warned and now you are being warned. Please show RELIABLE SOURCES. That is all... Thank you. Best 72.91.4.91 14:54, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Now that the references match the opening paragraph and the "origin" header, let us focus on the section which I named "History" to avoid having two "origin" headers. Under History, user .244. please submit your reliable sources which are easily verifiable under Wikipedia rules to support that paragraph. Look forward to reading them. Thank you. 72.91.4.91 13:19, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in this statement: "Dada Lekhraj, known then as "Om Baba", in turn denounced the Congress as "Kansa" or wicked and under pressure of Hindu public opinion, the Sindh government reluctantly banned the Om Mandali, which went to court and had the ban order quashed." Sources?</p>
<p>and this one: "spending their time in intense spiritual study, meditation and alleged self-transformation. During this time, mediumistic female followers known as "Sandeshputris" or trance messengers helped add to their spiritual knowledge through psychic visions and allegedly direct contact with God." Sources? Note the use of weasel words.</p>
<p>and of course, i find this very interesting: "the community moved to Mount Abu, mainly due to the religious resistance to its activities in Pakistan." Sources, please?</p>
<p>BTW, both of your links about the "history" of BK do not have all the extra "flavor" (for lack of a better word)that you have added. Without sources to back this up, it will be deleted as well. Your turn. Best Wishes, 72.91.4.91 19:14, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I cannot see anything distasteful, I can see caution in making unsubstantiate claims. What citations can you offer that anyone has been "transformed" by BK practise? It is not exactly a measurable scientific term, is it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The sources you have already been given and had pointed out to you many times already. What is the problem with them? <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 20:41, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
