<p>I notice that the links to the "BK teaching posters" in the article forward you to a site that doesn't appear to be recognised by the BKs. As they purport to be the teaching posters used by the BKs (rather than any splinter groups), can the author please provide evidence/verification that these posters are indeed official BK teaching posters - or that the site that they are hosted on is a recognised official BK site (as I may be mistaken). I understand a week is a reasonable time for an author to provide the requested information. If it is not forthcoming within that time, I'll delete the entry.

<p><a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a>, On November 17th <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">Riveros11</a>,<a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a>,72.91.4.91,72.91.151.117, 72.91.28.223et All, reverted all my citations which were part of the discussion here. His claim was that citations were vandalism, which is what he was asking for which seems contradictory. Today he deleted several sections, including ones with citations by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">Time</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89366047" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89366047" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I ask now in a most concerned way, is User Riveros afforded some special treatment in that I feel he should have been cited for vandalism for removing my items and for doing so with whole sections today saying that it was under your direction in the edit summary<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=89367556&amp;oldid=89366454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=89367556&amp;oldid=89366454" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89367556" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=89367556" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89366454" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=89366454" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Please explain as I just spent over $1,500 in research material feeling that I would meet the challenge (since he wants numbers of pages etc) but now feel that fairness is not being afforded to those of us that seek a fair and equitable view of this organisation beyond what has now become a copy of a report/PR view by Riveros. Please note that the references were there in plain view and that not once has Riveros nor any of the IT Team said no they were not true. Using the system to gain what they sought the whole time. What we have here is a piece meal removal of all that their (BKWSU) via their PR Chief KarunaBK wanted removed and the PR spin put in place. See that the very sections that he removed are the very sections <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarunabk_0546.html" title="User:Karunabk">Karunabk</a> wanted removed without discussion. Here Riveros is intimidating and busy placing big Stop signs on peoples pages yet feels he is beyond the rules that all must follow:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Karunabk" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Karunabk" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651663" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651478" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651478" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651379" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651379" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651293" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64651293" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64650983" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=64650983" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>As you may recall I asked for help on November 12th due to his multiple deletions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87176779" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=87176779" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. He said he would cooperate but I see not such cooperation or good will given that he has gone and done the exact thing and removed the citations.

<li>His intimidation tactics have been dully noted on multiple occasions. He has even begun on Sethie. Sethie has done good work on wiki efforts to link to other pages for meaning as is common in all other articles.</li>
<li>I would like it said that upon the citation being noted that the material should be placed back with out further ado by Riveros since the only point of argument was that the citations were not next to the very entry</li>

<dd>Dear TalkAbout,</dd>
<dd>Are you 64.121.65.67? Please answer that question. All your so called "citations" were never discussed in this page and most important, they are not considered reliable sources (researched material by authorities in the field of study) Also, please note that you are using one incident which is unrelated to this artcile to give a bad impression of Brahma Kumaris. Admin Jossi pointed out about the "child abuse case." Another one is Heide. Just because she was a BK member at one time, just like yourself or .244 that does not make her a representative of BK. As I said before, many well know criminals are out there who profess christianity, and that does not mean that I can put them in the Christianity page as examples. Please be resonable. Your work should be discussed here. You are not an exemption. You had ample time to do so, other than the fact that you come into this picture, whenever user .244 cannot, will not or does not contribute here,that makes you a non-regular editor who only shows up to change things around without previous discussion.</dd>
<dd>Please submit reliable sources. Look forward to seeing them in <b>this page</b> before being added. Thank you. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 22:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The unreferenced material was deleted because no sources were forthcoming. The "Heidi Fittkau-Garthe" section I am not sure what is the relevance of one person situation in an article about a religion, unless these types of behaviors have been widely reported as part of the religion or beliefs. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 01:04, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Following Jossi's suggestion, I propose the following deletions from the external links: In the ex-bk section, deletion of brahmakumaris.info - as it contains a lot of the unfounded assertions that Jossi termed not appropriate above (eg child abuse claims, etc). This is in breach of the links policy on wikipedia, which prohibits the linking to "Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research." I would also question the reason for having links to "ex bk sites" at all. Would any other faith/organisation have links to ex-members of their wikipedia articles? What is the relevance? There may be relevant reasons that someone can provide for keeping this section - but if not, I will delete it. I also propose deleting all the PBK links - as they are an organisation that are not part of the BKs or have any official relationship with the BKs. For the same reason, I also propose the link to the "Vishnu Party" be deleted. I will allow a week for the author/s who put up the various links I mention to verify the reasons for them to stay.

<p>Hi Sethie, i am not here comment to create more tension, i do apologies if this has happened, but i feel health and safety advice should be given to individuals, as people can live in a way without knowing, can harm themselfs or develop symptoms which will result into something more tedious to resolve, which i am able to see in here. as a psychologist so i feel some what irresponsible if i can see issues that people are displaying and not give information/advice in how to deal with the situation. i made this comment public as he/she is not the only. And when i sign with the ~ it comes up with jp auto. again i do apologize things were taken wrongly. &#160;;) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesselp_c8eb.html" title="User:Jesselp">Jesselp</a> 13:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Moonies wikipedia article contains no criticism about the organisation, but does contain links to critical sites (without saying what the criticisms are in the Moonies article itself). Is that the model you are proposing? (IE, separating the links section to official links, supportive views, opposing views and balanced views?). If that is what you are proposing, I don't have a problem with that, as long as the links are in line with wikipedia guidelines of course.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">7 day course deletion</span></h2>
<p>Dear All, On Nov. 22nd a post was made regarding the seven day course. We have not received any support on this as far as reliable sources to back up the explanations in it. As pointed out before, it will be very hard to find an expert explanation on it. However, there are a couple of links to the BK site which fully explain the expected content on these classes. If there are not reliable sources available then this content will be erased on Dec.7th. (Note that 15 days have been given). Thank you.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of mediumship and channelling from intro</span></h2>
<p>OK. I am challenging the removal of mediumship and channelling from intro and have replaced it as per earlier edits. The reason for this is plain. It is the one single element that so distinguishes BK Raja Yoga from Classical Raja Yoga and this has to be made clear. The academics all refer to it so there is no objection from that corner. It also highlights the issue that Shiva, the channelled being that is being mediumistically channelled through Kirpalani and Gulzar, cannot easily be referred to as "God" without qualification. One can state that the BKWSU believes that is it God but as the concept is so radically different from any other world religion, and would bring it into immediate conflict with all of them, we have to go cautious on this claim and not pander to BKWSU propaganda.</p>
<p>I am sorry but one can no more accept one sociologists view of yogic or psychic matters where they repeat BKWSU obfuscation of this matter, than one would accept Einstein's expertise in violin playing; because they are outside of their specialism. In preference, we have to rely on the organization's own original material. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 05:21, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had a look at similar topic on the Wiki, e.g. Scientologists or Moonies, and I see that the topic include links to such critical/opposing or balance views and so I see no difference to why the BKWSU article should exclude them.</p>

<p><a name=".22FRONT.22_organisations"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">"FRONT" organisations</span></h2>
<p>I propose replacing the word "front" with "affiliated" organisation. The use of the word "front" is clearly loaded and implies the organisation is trying to hide behind the identity of these other organisations. Better to just state that these other organisations are affiliated to the BKs - it's up to the individual to decide if they are "fronts" or just natural extensions of the BKs work. I also propose deleting the phrase: "At events promoted by any one of these entities, one might find other BKs present under the mantle of "representing" one of the other organizations rather than the BKWSU in a self-reciprocating manner." This is just commentary and contains sinister undertones, which is not relevant. I will amend within a week, unless a suitable argument can be put up. Appledell 10:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is difficult. Most are not affiliated organisation in the true meaning of the words, except perhaps the hospital. They are wholly run BKWSU fronts or "trading names" the BKWSU uses for "service". I dont see that the word "front" has negative connotations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the statement of how BKs turn up at meetings representing themselves as representatives of other BK organizations is certain true. I'll have a root around the references to see how this is best documented. Thanks. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 04:11, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Front" does have negative connotations - as it implies that the BKs are hiding behind the name (as you yourself clearly imply). I will replace it with "affiliated" unless you come up with a better, neutral, term. BKs may well come to events representing these different affiliated groups/fronts/wings. I don't see why that has any relevance. It is commentary. Again, I will wait until the 7 day limit for discussion I've put has been reached before I make the change.

<dd>An affiliation is between entirely separate groups. These are groups, or service campaigns, raised entirely by the BKWSU and quite specifically in the case of Inner Spaces, "shop fronts" to the organization.</dd>

<dd>If we look at the Wiki definition; <i>a <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_organization.html" title="Front organization">front organization</a> (or organisation), also known as a <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_group.html" title="Front group">front group</a> (if it is structured to look like a voluntary association); a front company, a shell corporation or simply a front (if it is structured to look like a company), is any entity set up by and controlled by another organization. A front organization may simply be a proxy that keeps the parent group's name out of the picture or it may look publicly as if it is set up to do one thing, but actually be set up to do something else on behalf of its parent group. Front organizations are also commonly used to shield the parent organization from legal liability; this is the most common reason for the creation of shell corporations.</i> it would appear to be quite accurate.</dd>

<dd>Using the definition you yourself have used: "A front organization may simply be a proxy that keeps the parent group's name out of the picture or it may look publicly as if it is set up to do one thing, but actually be set up to do something else on behalf of its parent group." Can you identify is each case where the organisation/company/group has been set up to do one thing but is actually doing something else? On each website it states clearly what the aims of that organisation/company/group are. To call them "fronts" requires them to have other aims to the ones they state (as per the definition you quote). Can you outline - with citations - what these ulterior aims are for each organisation/company/group? If you cannot, I maintain that the term "affiliated" is a better and more accurate term to use.

<p>Dear Appledell, Once the article has been reverted by someone without previous discussion, that article will be reverted back again. Thus, whatever changes you made will be gone as well.

<dd>I want to change the subsection "Concept of God" as following:</dd>
<dd>"However this is nothing new, as Shaiva Hindus also worship Shiva as representing Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh Himself. Shiva creates by entering the world through a corporeal medium, awakening humanity and restoring human souls to their original state of harmony (creator aspect). Because He is Mahāyogi (Sanskrit महायोगी) in Hindu Dharma He develops and sustains this balanced and complete human personality through the power of raja yoga and the knowledge he imparts to humanity (preserver aspect). He gets evil and negativity eliminated through the practice and lifestyle of raja yoga (destroyer aspect Ekambaranatha [Sanskrit एकम्बरनथ])."</dd>

<dd>Can you give an explanation as to why your suggested change is needed in this article? What difference does it make if the belief is "nothing new"? Nowhere in the article does it say that the concept of God that the BKs have IS new. By your logic, does every aspect of BK belief need referring in the article as being new or old? It just seems to be over-complicating the article.</dd>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">Maleabroad</a>, Thank you for following the guidelines. Your post is appreciated. Let me point out some things: 1)It appears to me that we need to provide reliable sources to back up our posts. 2) It was pointed out by admin Jossi that this article needs to be written having the "reader" in mind, which not necessarily may be knowledgful of Hinduism or a BK member, ex-member. 3)This article is about Brahma Kumaris. Brahma Kumaris is not Hinduism, just as Calvinism is not Christianity. Christianity is the root, but Calvinism is a colorful branch on its own right. I could make a similar analogy by introducing the concept of the "holy trinity" in Christianity (Father , Son and holy ghost) as well and compare it with the BK concept of the Trimurti. 4) Sanskrit is not used by BKs but rather Hindi. Would like to hear your side on these points as well.</dd>

<dd><b>How is the Brahma Kumaris not a Hindu organization?</b> A Hindu is a person who practices karma and bhakti for the achievement of Moksha. Obviuously you are not of Indian/Hindu background. You were not even born as a BK. Your attempts to create a wedge between Hinduism and BKs is vandalism and you will be reported! Just because the BKs prefer not to use Sanskrit does not make it non-Hindu. Several scriptures such as Puranas were written in Tamil and Tamil is said to be a holy langauge. The BKs are Hindus just as the Shias are Islamics.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, I think it is necessary to add the Mahāyogi (Sanskrit/Hindi महायोगी) as the paragraph derscribes Lord Shiva as creating the raja yoga and I think it is also necessary to add Ekambaranatha [Sanskrit/Hindi एकम्बरनथ] because the paragraph also describes Him as destroying evil and negativity.</dd>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">Maleabroad</a>, You are right, I am not Hindu. In this life, I wasn't born in Bharat. I am a Brahma Kumar. There is a difference here. You elect to become a Brahma Kumar, but yet it is in your fortune. There are many westerners who are Brahma Kumaris, but yet none of them Hindus. I am one of them.

<dd>Yes, so the Brahma Kumari is a spiritual group of which anyone can become a part of. It has a Hindu orientation but even a Christian or Muslim can be a part of it. if however the Westerners that become BKs practice both karma and bhakti for achieving Moksha, then by all means they are Hindus.</dd>
<dd>I will post what I previously discussed unless someone has an objection why it is not appropriate and a logical reasoning.</dd>

<dd>Dear <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">Maleabroad</a>, Thank you for your response. <b>I do have an objection</b>. I do not consider myself Hindu AND I do not practice bhakti, BUT I am a BK. As a matter of fact, in BK the whole aspect of devotion is replaced by knowledge. Physical devotion as when performing "puja" is out of the question. Thus, please do not jump in to posting yet. You need to demonstrate (hopefully with reliable sources)why do think that by practicing "karma" and "bhakti" for achieving Moksha makes a BK a Hindu. As a matter of fact, the state of Moksha is not permanently attainable according to BK knowledge, unlike the beliefs of other religions. Finally, according to BK knowledge; Karma is not something that you "practice" but rather is a mandatory requisite of experiencing life in the physical world. This is my logical reasoning.

<p>Let me explain to you what <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma.html" title="Karma">Karma</a> is. Karma is a rule that souls have to practice good. If they practice good, the supreme nature (or "Brahman") will award them. If however, a soul dooes bad deeds, they are in trouble. Good Karma has to be practiced by a soul. You might not consider yourself a Hindu, but BK is based mostly around Shiva. Non-Hindu BKs do not have to accept Shiva but since He is focused around so much, I think it is necessary to mention Him. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">Maleabroad</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think Shiva SHOULD be mentioned as the Mahāyogi (Sanskrit/Hindi महायोगी) so that people understand that BKs are not making up things about Him creating the raja yoga as Hindus see Him as the perfect yogi. I think Ekambaranatha [Sanskrit/Hindi एकम्बरनथ] should be added because Shiva is a destroyer or evil and negativity as He is described in Hinduism.</dd>

<dd>Dear Maleabroad, What you mentioned about karma is not what BKs think of it. Karma means "action." Actions can be neutral, sinful or elevated. There is a very profound explanation of actions besides the more simple label of "good actions."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Shiva, the Supreme Soul is mentioned in the article as a quote by Dr. Howell. Shiva is the Father, Teacher and Satguru in BK knowledge. Shiva is not the destroyer. That aspect of the Trimurti is represented by Shankar. (There is another deep aspect here concerning God Shiva as karankaravanhar which could only be understood if we can grasp paradoxes.) As you can see there are many discrepancies which allow me to say that BK is not Hinduism.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry but BK Hindus believe that karma can be practiced. How can a person not choose whether to be good or bad??</dd>
<dd>Furthermoer, BK Hindus believe that Shiva is the Supreme, and that He Himself can represent the trinity as Shaiva Hindus do. Furthermore, they believe that Lord Shiva is the destroyer of evil as everyone believes.</dd>
<dd>How can a Westerner born far from India without any Indian/Hindu background (and further without BK background) say that BKs are not Hindus. <b>BKs can belong to any religion.</b> The founder was a Hindu and it would be a disgrace if you keep propagating. I recommend you find another groups if you will disgrace the BKs. Others reading this article have been angered by your comments and false warnings that you give when they put their contributions.</dd>

As you mentioned: "How can a person not choose whether to be good or bad?" my response is: "How can a person not choose to be angry or not?" It is not my response what makes them angry.. It is them... It is their choice...their karma.</dd>

<p>Yes, karma is theirs, they can choose their karma. If you respect the Brahma Kumaris you will have to respect the Hindu Dharma, to which the group is oriented. The Brahma Kumari founder was a Hindu observing Hinduism and made His organization so that people of any religion can become close to God and even hoped to united all religions against irreligiousity. Whenever someone with no Indian/Hindu background makes bizzare claims, we Hindus see it as DISPICIBLE. I will post that Lord Shiva is the Mahāyogi (Sanskrit/Hindi महायोगी) and Ekambaranatha [Sanskrit/Hindi एकम्बरनथ]. In fact, it belongs in this article! I will also mention that His Holyness, the Brahma Baba chose Mount Abu as the BK center because it is a holy site, a pilgrimage for Hindus. - <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleabroad_1251.html" title="User:Maleabroad">Maleabroad</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Maleabroad, I respect all religions. I am just stating that Brahma Kumaris is not Hinduism. The founder of Brahma Kumaris is not a Hindu. It is the Supreme Soul "Shiva." known to religions as the "Father," "God." through a physical "chariot." Please produce some reliable sources to back up your statements. Provide reliable sources which prove that BK is Hinduism. Otherwise, without consensus, whatever you write will be erased. It is very simple.

<dl>
<dd>You are asking me to prove how BK philosophy is Hindu?</dd>
<dd>BK is not a religion but a spirituality of which a member of any religion can belong to!</dd>
<dd>How many times do I have to stress this?</dd>
<dd>Even if say, that the BKs are not Hindus, how are my posts describing Shiva as the Mahāyogi (Sanskrit/Hindi महायोगी) and Ekambaranatha [Sanskrit/Hindi एकम्बरनथ] not appropriate? By the way, BK Hindus are all named in Sanskrit. Shiva itself is either from Sanskrit <i>Si</i> meaning "auspicious" or <i>civappu</i> meaning "red."</dd>
<dd>A Hindu is a person who practices Karma and Bhakti for the achievement of Moksha. Then the BKs which do this are obvious Hindus just as the BKs that are Chrisitians are Christians and the BKs that are Muslims are Muslims.</dd>
<dd>A BK is a person who believes that Shiva is God, Brahma Baba is His messenger, Raja Yoga is the most auspicious yoga and that Moksha is the goal. Just because you do not practice Bhakti does not mean Bhakti was not intended by Brahma Baba.</dd>

<dd>Dear Maleabroad, I will start form the end to avoid expansion. Very happy to present proof to you <a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a><i>"I have the inclination to say that in Brahma Kumaris we encounter in principle a ‘new religion' in the process of being born. A few decades are still needed to be able to make a good assessment. However, we can see that in a certain respect Brahma Kumaris has become more ‘Western' in recent years and also that it has gone more in the direction of the ‘psychological line', more or less joining the company of many modern New Age psychological movements. If this tendency continues it could become clear that Brahma Kumaris is in fact a new religion, originating within Hinduism but going its own way."</i> This is Professor Kranenborg an expert in this field. This is what is called a reliable source. Now is your turn. BTW, there is no such a thing as "BKs being Christians" You are a BK, period.

<dd>Of course, that's what some foolish Westerners believe (or want to believe) about the Brahma Kumari path. Go ask a BK Hindu if they are not Hindu. Simply to do raja yoga does not make someone a BK. They have a worship too. You are getting yourself in deep bad karma. You and fascists like "Sethie" has no clue what you are discussing.</dd>
<dd>Apart from being a Hindu by practiginc karma and bhakti for achieving Moksha, BKs ALSO USE MANY HINDU SYMBOLS. They use <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.com.au/pages/news.php" class="external text" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.com.au/pages/news.php" rel="nofollow">Durga Ma</a> as She is <a href="http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/04oct23/body.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/04oct23/body.htm" rel="nofollow">slaying the buffolo Mahish</a>.

<p>I removed the reference to UN relationship as at present it is uncited. What happened is that the BKWSU was cautioned by the UN for over use or over exaggeration of the UN relationship.

<p>I left in the child abuse stuff because I found this citation;</p>
<p><i>Church, A., Edwards, L. and Romain, E. (1990) Cooperation in the Classroom. London, Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University: Global Cooperation for a Better World.</i></p>
<p>Which substantiates the self-published author of the report on the senior sisters response to the child abuse incidents, Romain, E., as an expert in the field of child care within the BKWSU. Indeed a former representative of the BKWSU.</p>

<dd>Having taken a fair amount of time reading the report (as I clearly have nothing better to do), it seems to me that the author clearly doesn't take an academic approach (look at all the repeated personal commentary in it). I agree this person may well have published academic works in the past, but the report you refer to isn't an academic work. The report highlights two individuals suffering child abuse in the organisation's 70 years history. Can you explain why including this is fair to mention in the context of this article, bearing in mind the size of the organisation? This reference in the controversies section will be removed later today as per my previous note above. Just to remind you (again)...here are admin Jossi's views on the controversy section:</dd>

<li>Rape and physical violence from families and partners of Brahma Kumaris ... No sources. Should be deleted if a reliable source is not forthcoming</li>

<dd>I have deleted link to the "child abuse report" from the "Critical" section of the links page. This is as per Jossi's comment about it when it was included originally in the Controversy section: " * Documented incidents of child abuse within the organisation brushed...<b>The source is a personal page and thus not a reliable source</b>" In addition to that, I sight the aspect of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>. The report looks into <b>two</b> cases in the organisation's 70 years history. It gives too much weight to them in the context of the organisation's history and the organisation's size. The report that is linked to is <b>not</b> an academic work. Reading the author's personal commentary throughout the report makes that pretty clear. Also note that Jossi's comments about the link were made on 21st Nov - more than a week has gone by and no-one has given any adequate reason for maintaining the link.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">.244 reverts page arbitrarily *again*</span></h2>
<p>I'm not getting involved in a "reverting war". It's clearly not conducive to wikipedia ethics. But I have deleted various things from .244's reverted version that has been discussed above - including the controvery section, link to brahmakumaris.info, link to BK teaching posters , link to PBK and Vishnu Party sites. All of these were done after having given 7 days notice to discuss them (look back up this discussion forum if you are unsure). Please do not revert back to your version by deleting my changes (which had also taken effect in Riveros's version on the same basis). Appledell 01:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say arbitrarily was a prejudical. You are late in on all this Appledell. Much of it we have been round and round on many times. See above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The posters are the Jagdish Chander books referenced. If you need to check they appear in unedited form. Have you seen these? Do we need specific page references or is this not enough. The accusation is that I have in some way doctored them but I have absolutely no connection with the website in question. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 01:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not disputing if those posters are authentic or not - I do not know. But there are strict guidelines on what can be linked to. The website that is hosting the posters is not a BK site (unless you can show it is?), so there can be the danger that those posters are not genuine. Also, if the posters <b>are</b> genuine then it is likely that it is copyright infringement to to host them. Therefore linking to a site that has content which could be an infringement of copyright cannot be used under wikipedia links policy. If you have a problem with that, discuss it here first before re-imposing the links. Appledell 13:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Specific controversies</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering about the "Rape and physical violence from families and partners of Brahma Kumaris." bit.</p>
<p>This refers to firstly, the time a high profile case that was reported in the Australian press of which my sympathies lay entirely with the sister victim; and secondly during beginning of the BKWSU when it was called Om Mandali. This was refered to in Adi Dev and Purity and, I think, the "world rejecting" academic papaer. I must did it out. It does seem to have been formative in the orgs world view about "anit-parties" and sex lust as violence.</p>

<dd>Dear Jossi, I will avoid using the word "vandalism" as you pointed out. I would like to remind you that the "7 day course" will be erased on Dec. 4th for lack of "reliable sources." (according to previous discussions) Normally, when there is a change like this, we had users reverting the page without previous discussion. At that time it would be helpful if somehow this is being stopped from happenning and the corrected version stays. Now is the time to discuss the 7 day course and to show reliable sources so it can stay. I will go ahead and blank some of the user warnings issued in my talk page as well.

<li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/bro_khem/" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/bro_khem/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bro_khem/</a> is a personal website of a BK.

<li><a href="http://www.livingvalues.net" class="external free" title="http://www.livingvalues.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.livingvalues.net</a>. There seems to be some abiguity what exactly the relationship between the BKs and this website is - there is no mention of the BKs on the website. It is alleged that it is a BK "front".

<p>Under <b>Bibliography</b>, I suggest the following deletion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report on Child Abuse,Beliefs and Lifestyle[26]. This is a personal website and the "report" is not an academic one, but a personal commentary from the author about his views of the BKs.

<p>If we look at the other IP address is uses 72.91.4.91 [ pool-72-91-4-91.tampfl.fios.verizon.net ] also Tampa Verizon and used for making vandalism attacks on Maleabroad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=88531259&amp;oldid=88381782" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=88531259&amp;oldid=88381782" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></p>

<p>I have no doubt that this is not exhaustive but it is exhausting ...</p>
<p>I would like to point out that the same team are also at work on Google Answers having critical or even independent pieces about the <a href="../../../b/k/w/BKWSU_0ac7.html" title="BKWSU">BKWSU</a> removed, e.g. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050826175344/http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=206345" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20050826175344/http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=206345" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> which is now <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=206345" class="external free" title="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=206345" rel="nofollow">http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=206345</a>, Yahoo and elsewhere. Yes, Wikipedia Foundation will be targetted next if they has not already done so. Scratch me and I will bleed citations.</p>
<ul>
<li>I just wanted to add for the sake of completeness a Request for checkuser that Luis did under the 72.91.4.91 user where he refers to himself in the third party, "<i>He also reported user riveros11 ...</i>". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/195.82.106.244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/195.82.106.244" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>.

<dd>I agree entirely. But we cannot allow any individual on any subject to attempt to intimate others into submission using vandalism warnings each time they make an edit (and it is not just me) and using blocking to achieve advancing their point of view</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let alone sneak around using different IP address to do so, Jossi. I went and removed similar intimidation from Maleabroad as he is a new editor and obviously not using his mother tongue.</dd>

<dd><b>What do we do? You have the guy's response below.</b></dd>

<dd>I can make clear and precise the balanced view that I think the article needs to accurately document the BKs. Will he engage? <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 06:12, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree Jossi. Some users have been using different tacticts in the past for such a long time (as could readily be verified in the archives) to throw "their weight around" and to "own" this article without providing a reliable source. It is a pitty, I must say; that the option of being entirely out of Wikipedia is not a choice, specially since BK did not started this article, but obviously it is an attempt of some users to demonstrate their animosity by using this on-line encyclopedia. A neutral non biased article worth to be placed in an online encyclopedia could never be expected out of an angry attempt by some to "get even" with an organization.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User .244 is resourcing to personal defamations</span></h2>
<p>Dear .244, To even suggest that user Maleabroad is somehow related with me is a strong defamation.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:72.91.169.22&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:72.91.169.22&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> look at this. Perhaps you did not have the chance to read the "talk" I am having with him just a bit above this under "To user Maleabroad."</p>
<p>User Maleabroad was blocked at one point as well, just like you. He was using several Ips coming from the university of Calgary in Canada. Please stop trying to make me "famous" here. You use my full name, my email to send me stuff from your brahmakumaris.info site, my place of residence and no only that but places of work...So, who will be the admin that will take that?</p>
<p>Perhaps we should rather look into the brahmakumaris.info and your account .244 as sockpuppet. You see, when are you going to answer my simple question? Let me repeat that for you in case you have forgotten: "Are you user brahmakumaris.info?" Hope to hear your answer on this. You are not the only one who can do a "nslookup" or "dig" on someone else's IPs...that is "basic stuff" my friend. You need proof... do not just defame me without it. You see, there is a difference. WHenever I use another IP, I signed beside it as avyakt7. FYI. Yes.. no everyone has a static IP with them to play with and the leisure to defame BK as well as you do and make it their life purpose.

<p>Just to get back to the topic, I found a citation to back up external charitable giving of the BKWSU, it is here <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/05/stories/2005010503390300.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/05/stories/2005010503390300.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>.

<p>Actually, it is not great news for an NGO that pulls $2 million per year from one European country alone. All it says is that "Bed sheets, foodstuff, clothes and vessels "<b>worth</b>" about Rs.10 lakhs had been rushed to the different places in the last few days." 10 lakhs is about $20,000 but it does not state whether these items were new, second hand, theirs or pulled from third parties. So, I am not convinced that it is notable nor that the org engages in alleviating poverty etc as it claims. Sorry.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of self-published sources (relates to 7 day course)</span></h2>
<p>Before we proceed, we really have to address this issue which Luis has been blocking me on and ignoring, the use of self-published sources.</p>
<p>Now Jossi, you have stated that;</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Self-published sources can be used alongside other third party sources, with proper attribution of the self-published sources. Press releases if properly attributed, can present the organization's viewpoints on certain aspects that may be needed for NPOV. Remember that NPOV asks editors to describe significant viewpoints, and these include the viewpoints of the subject of the article.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy itself states;</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Material from self-published sources, and published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as:</i></li>
<li><i>it is relevant to their notability;</i></li>
<li><i>it is not contentious;</i></li>
<li><i>it is not unduly self-serving;</i></li>
<li><i>it does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject;</i></li>
<li><i>there is no reasonable doubt as to who wrote it.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Now, I can go find more references but I feel that I have already provided them because Chander's and the BKWSU's later correspondence course are referenced on the article.</b> [Or were before the BKWSU team got to work on it]. Luis is not denying that these are in any way false. I see no problem in leaving the section, it is utterly relevant to their notability and is not contentious. I think the BKWSU wants to remove it but it does not want it exposed, a bit like the Scientology folk react.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources for "7 Days Course"</span></h2>
<p>The sources that I originally refered to were the original PBIVV published 7 Days Course by Jagdish Chander. various editions, and then the revision "Correspondence Course" by Jayanti Kripalani published by the BKWSU. Additional materials/qualifications were taken from "Eternal Drama of Souls, Matter and God" by Chander, Mt Abu 1983.</p>
<p>None of these are "secret", or non-public, as with the 1990s teachers training manual that also referenced which includes identical details. All of them were purchasable by the general public. It is possible to still buy them. Copies are even held in major major libraries, e.g. University of Washington or British Library.</p>
<p>The important issue for me to establish here is that within the limits above, publications by the PBIVV/BKWSU <b>are</b> acceptable sources. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 00:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear .244, Sorry to break the news to you but these sources could be acceptable to you but they do not make "reliables sources" which is the "bread and butter" of an encyclopedia. Chander is not considered an expert in the field by academia...and those books are published by BK itself. I have repeated this and showed to you how this does not fit the rules of wikipedia but you keep on trying. If it is that important for you, how come you are unable to find a reliable source in your local library? Why is it so difficult for you to search on databases? Please do not try to distract us with the same "old record" just show us your "reliable sources."

<dd>Then, why is it to hard for you to produce a reliable source where the academics are actually quoting Chander? Why do you make things so difficult?</dd>
<dd>You see, (another repetition) you cannot quote Chander. A professor or a researcher can do that. Then... you quote the researcher in turn... you quote his article. Otherwise, if you start "quoting" Chander, the we end up with the article that was here before.. a .244 interpretation with a very biased animosity. I am sorry, but that does not belong here...

<li><b>What are you thoughts regarding the use of the term Raja Yoga for the BK's practise?</b></li>

</dl>

<dd>Perhaps what you are suggesting is that more reference needs to be made on the relationship between the BKWSU teachings and classical Saivite Hinduism and to qualify them within the Hindu canon? In their registration documents, they state that they are founded to promote Hinduism.</dd>

So let us give him a little extra leeway and some help rather than intimidating other contributors. His point is valid, since this dispute arose the Indian aspects of this article have not been you people's strong point. I think you should stop naming up in the titles and them down Luis. What you ask is a bit like asking some for a citation that "Friday, Saturday and Sunday" is the weekend. Perhaps he can be asked to help rather than frightened off.</dd>

<dd><b>I agree that more references about the relationship of Brahma Kumaris and classical Hinduism would be fair and also that the starting paragraph is a little too Eurocentric for an organization and a tradition that is by far Indo-centric. Whether a Kranenborg has PhD or not, the referenced artilce is NOT a proper academic paper. As BK Raja Yoga is only 70 years old at the most, there is little to no evidence of what sort of path it is and so we have to be more objective. , He might not have as much authority as an Indian commenator would and the latter sentences quoted are too POV.</b></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BK Teaching Posters (again)</span></h2>
<p>I have deleted the teaching posters. As I mentioned above, there are strict guidelines on what can be linked to. The website that is hosting the posters is not a BK site (unless someone can show it is?), so there can be the danger that those posters are not genuine. Also, if the posters are genuine then it is likely that it is copyright infringement to host them. Therefore linking to a site that has content which could be an infringement of copyright cannot be used under wikipedia links policy. If you have a problem with that, discuss it here first before re-imposing the links. Appledell 11:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"As I have seen ShivBaba has given permission for their use via the medium Veerendra Dev Dixit and he is ascribed as the original author by the BKWSU." Yeah right! Though I admire your faith that ShivBaba speaks via the "medium Veerendra Dev Dixit" it is certainly not quite how I think the BKWSU and copyright law would see it. If the pictures were created by BKWSU then they belong to that institution. Veerendra Dev Dixit is not recognised as being a medium of ShivBaba by anyone not sharing the beliefs of the PBKs, or "Shankar party", as they are known by BKs. Also ShivBaba is not the author of the drawings, they were obviously drawn by human beings in terms of putting paintbrush to paper. The suggestion that an alleged channelled message from the head of another organisation, not affiliated with the BKWSU, can make degrees regarding the ownership BKWSU copyright literature is ridiculous.</dd>

<dd>Next is the question of authenticity. It is very easy to diddle any electronic document. Since the motive for including links to these pictures is to prove a point about the alleged failed prediction of destruction in 1976 I would like to draw your attention to these two examples documents, <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/uploads//e/e0/Ladder.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/w/uploads//e/e0/Ladder.jpg" rel="nofollow">exhibit_A</a> and <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/613/839460099724997/1600/Ladder_diddled_as_proof_of_concept.jpg" class="external text" title="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/613/839460099724997/1600/Ladder_diddled_as_proof_of_concept.jpg" rel="nofollow">exhibit_B</a>. Note the funky new date at the bottom of exhibit B&#160;:-) That took a few minutes to do using the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow">Gimp</a>. This is why I have a problem with any stuff you, or the PBKs, upload to some website. Notice that on the document, exhibit A, before I modified it, the gap where the "40 years" date is filled in is suspiciously wide and also there are two spellings of the same word, "Raven" and "Rawen" in the same poster. I suspect the poster has, in fact, been tampered with already either electronically or by painting over.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, on what basis do the posters represent the exact teachings of the BKWSU officially? We need some proof of this link before it is accepted as fact. Many BKs have had many ideas about the date of "destruction" based on their own thinking or interpretation. It is entirely possible someone inserted what their own idea was at the time when drawing the picture and no one really objected after.</dd>

<dd>Please stop trying to turn the tables with regards to the burden of proof. If you want to include something in the article the onus is squarely on <b>you</b> to provide proof that you have permission to use the material or that the site you are linking to does. Please read this policy, from the 2nd paragraph <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html#Linking_to_copyrighted_works" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights#Linking_to_copyrighted_works</a>. None of the sites you have linked to have permission. I can assure you of that. Also none of the sites are reputable sources and there is no guarantee that the pictures are an honest representation.</dd>
<dd>I am not denying that the same or similar pictures exist however the way you appear to be intending to use them is contentious since you seem to me to be using them out of context to make a big deal out of details which, in another decade, culture and continent, look a bit silly with the apparent motive of discrediting the BKWSU. These pictures were painted by people based on the teachings, but also how they saw the world at the time and perhaps even contain some mistakes and their own personal views. This probably would not have been so obvious to others in the 60s. Yes, some parts of some of the pictures were made under what you might term "channelled directions", but as far as I have been able to ascertain from those around at the time, this did not extent to the details of the text surrounding the pictures.</dd>
<dd>Is it really necessary to push the article so hard in that direction at this time? Right now I think it would be more constructive to concentrate on material that we all <i>can</i> agree on and leave the contentious stuff until we have a constructive working team of editors, hopefully including you, and a well written article based on team consensus.

<p>Dear Jossi; As you can see the article has been changed by user .244 again. It is hard not to quote you when you have stated some rules and even user Sethie's input has been accepted (discuss before posting specially in major changes) I will not revert this page this time to honor what I believe is a "gentleman" agreement. Please note that changes by user .244 do not have a single reliable source. The paragraph about "Believes and Practices" was modified according to your suggestion so it is not a straight quote from Kranenborg.. now is not even there... even the credibility of Professor Kranenborg is doubted. It is very hard to deal with individuals who do not want to provide reliable sources and who have not added a single worthwhile reference to this article. User .244 claims that I have used Chander. He does not realize that I have quoted a professor or researcher who has used him. I do not know the level of education user .244 or Maleabroad have but certainly, I wonder if an encyclopedia could ever be written with such input.

From an editorial point of view, quotation should be limited as much as possible. looking at benchmarks like the Encyclopedia Britannia, and most Wikipedia topics, they are not slavish copy and pastes. This whole chapter has merely been the BKWSU attempt to control the article by the misapplication of guidelines and the ignorance of policy. Quotes should be very sparing as an image would be.</dd>

<dd>I have stated clearly that I am happy to work with the references given by Riveros11, and in those there are multiple references to channelling etc., my query with arbitration is regards the acceptable use of self-published materials referenced by said academics to confirm details.

I would suggest to look into these as a way to enhance the article with such secondary sources.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arbitration</span></h2>
<p>Dear All, I just wanted to point out that I finally got the chance to post my side on user .244 request for arbitration. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Current_requests" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Current_requests" rel="nofollow">[57]</a> It is an account on how I view this issue. I have also added several "diffs" which I hope admins will take a look at them. These "diffs" portray a pretty accurate account on user .244 activities, intentions and character. These "diffs" are factual. It is not my own "paraphrasing." Finally, perhaps I should have added this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NinaEliza" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NinaEliza" rel="nofollow">[58]</a> as well, which emphasizes .244 feelings. I thought .244 was younger than me!<a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=bkwsuwatch" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=bkwsuwatch" rel="nofollow">[59]</a>...but then he calls me "young hot head." Such is the paradox... One more time, the seed of the problem in my view is <b>content</b>. We need reliable sources here. Best Wishes, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 13:40, 8 December 2006 (UTC) Ps: I noted that the way used here to find "sockpuppets" is by simple noting on which side of the world IPs and user names are coming (according to arbitration). I have not seen something about brahmakumaris.info and 195.82.106.244 yet... Are they coming from different sides of the world as well? or perhaps just England? Very curious about it. Om Shanti. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 13:40, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

It will really surprise me that the obvious cannot be seen. BTW, If you have the chance to read all of his writings in the above mentioned post, you shall see that the root of the problem is <b>content</b> alone. That kind of content is just wrong for an on-line encyclopedia. Thank you. Best<a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 01:09, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More on it: I just found out that user Thatcher131 removed my comments. Claiming that "evidence" should not be placed here... I wonder if he realized that user .244 is doing that and his comments are there as well...Anyway, here is the link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> I would really like to know from user Thatcher131 how a "traceroute" is possible without IP addresses... Can you do that by using just user names? How is this performed? and most importantly&#160;: <b>Is user .244 coming from the same place as brahmakumaris.info?</b> Why it was so easy for him to find that appledell, searchin man and myself are in different places and he/she did not mention about .244 and brahmakumaris.info?

<p>I am not going to revert it myself straight away since I understand the situation here is a bit delicate right now. I would like to know what the other editors and admins monitoring this page think of the edit in question.</p>
<p>Actually, credit where credit is due, much of the "bold edit" looks quite neutral this time which is quite encouraging. However I feel that it is also really important to have a harmonious working relationship amongst the active editors on this article. We have agreed a "controversial" tag to acknowledge that bold edits are going to need discussion and consensus before being implemented. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">User:195.82.106.244</a>, could you please indicate if you are able to work with us on this?</p>

<dd>Also Wanted to add what Thatcher131 wrote in my talkpage concerning .244 and brahmakumaris.info: "....By the way, traceroute shows that the web site bk.info is hosted in England, which is the same place the 195 editor is coming from, but I can't get more specific than that. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 01:38, 9 December 2006 (UTC)" Anybody can find that. All I need to do is run a traceroute and a Whois to do it myself...I have presented proof and I have links to pictures in the month of october about his site bk.info and the undeniable link to the IP address of .244. User Thatcher is overseeing this in my Statement. Moreover, user thatcher131 is not answering my question: Is the <b>account</b> brahmakumaris.info coming from England? He did not have any problems with "searching man" or "appledell"...what is the problem with this one? Yes.. I would like to add it in my "statement" but then it will go over the 800 words.

<dd>This individual is even bragging about how traffic will increase in his site.</dd>
<dd>Now , let us use some logic. It goes something like this: <i>"If A=B and B=C then, A=C" Which means, if user .244 recognizes that bk.info is his site and BKWSUwatch and bkwatch endorse the bk.info site AND there is an account brahmakumaris.info which obviously belongs to the bk.info site AND the IP 195.82.106.244 points to the bk.info site (at least used to point, but I have pictures which I took knowing that sooner or later .244 will shutdown this) THEN, user .244 is evidently involved with those sockpuppet accounts.</i> See the logic? Please see this collection of beautiful pictures depicting our friend's IP address at the bottom of my "fire fox" browser, for those of you not familiar with this site, this is www.brahmakumaris.info a well known antagonistic site to BK who is even trying to get an article about them in this encyclopedia!</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request for opinion, references re Mediumship and Early History</span></h2>
<p>OK Jossi,</p>
<p>request for opinion on references already and other. I have more but we will take this slowly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hinduism Today,</li>
</ul>
<p>It has an international print circulation of 100,000 plus, consultants to US President select committee, Ford Foundation sponsored and world's first desktop publishing network.</p>
<p>To start with, I would like to add to the references about the use of mediums within the BKWSU given by Howell, Walliss, Whaling and others for the channelling of the spirit they call God and their deceased founder Kirpalani. In the follow copy of a printed article, it is reported in the words of a Director of the BKWSU's herself how the deceased senior administrator Didi Manmohini came back from beyond the grave, was channelled through one of their mediums and gave messages about her experiences. Online archive of October 83 publication, here; <a href="http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1983/10/1983-10-03.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1983/10/1983-10-03.shtml" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sindh Story, by K. R. Malkani. Karachi, Allied Publishers Private Limited, 1984</li>
</ul>
<p>A history of the Sindhi people of which Kirpalani and the BKs were members. To establish its credibility, K.R. Malkani was Lt. Governor of Pondicherry (i.e. Senator) and Vice-President of India's major center right political party the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatiya_Janata_Party_8641.html" title="Bharatiya Janata Party">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> from 1990 to 1995. Vice-President of the <a href="http://www.chitrakoot.org/chitrakoot_project.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chitrakoot.org/chitrakoot_project.htm" rel="nofollow">Deendayal Research Institute</a>, New Delhi from 1983 to 1990. He was a member of <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajya_Sabha_68c5.html" title="Rajya Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> (Senate) from 1994 to 2000. Born where Kirpalani started his movement at Hyderabad in the Sindh in November, 1921, he also served as editor of many newspapers, was General Secretary of the Editors Guild of India from 1977 to 1978.</p>
<p>I wish to use it to support the version of the early days of the Om Mandali and Om Niwas movement and the reaction from the families and Bhaibund community.</p>
<p><br />
Please note that these references have been already but were removed because presumably the other editors have not read the book but frankly, racism towards the India point of view aside, Malkani is somewhat of an expert, the book is in English and as such any of his research is not primary reasearch on my behalf. The articles have been archived by third parties including academic facilities.</p>

<dd>Well, when I read the Hinduism today article I don't read "for the channelling of the spirit they call God." That sounds like your interpretation of that source. See if you can just stay with exactly what the article says. Notice how the article uses the word "Someone" took over the body and then "it began to say."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"deceased senior administrator Didi Manmohini came back from beyond the grave, was channelled through one of their mediums and gave messages about her experiences." Again watch how you interpret their words! The article does not say she "came back from beyond the grave." It does say that that after her physical death, "messages" came through about her experiences in the coma state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's great to have reliable sources, and Hinduism today easily fits that, now if you're going to use them, you need to be very clear and non-interpretive of what they say.<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 05:13, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The word <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channelling.html" title="Channelling">channelling</a> is a new term esp. used for New Age. Its retrospective use is probably logically correct, though unusual. I do not consider this somewhat doubtful use of the term channelling a major thing. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 06:28, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we have a problem with the BKWSU claim that it is "God" who enters into Lekhraj Kirpalani and Gulzar only and so that we should cover ourselves. I do not see the academics actually stating that this spiritual entity <b>IS</b> God, they report "call, claim, believe" etc and they are the best words we can safely use. What do you understand by a deceased "someone entered into" the medium Gulzar? It is not interpretion, it is the use of a techincal word. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 08:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heya Andries, please see that tag at the top of this page "controversial" and the disuccsion about the controversial tag. We've agreeded, as a page that all substantial changes will be disucssed first. I agree that 99% of the time, undiscussed is not a valid reason for reversion. However, this page, for the first time in.... months agreeded to something- that this is how we'd operate. If that doesn't feel right to you, would you be willing to disucss that under the controversial tag section?<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 05:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never made that agreement and will not agree with this editing procedure that contradicts generally accepted Wikipedia practices. I will use reverts of sourced material only justified by saying that they were undiscussed as evidence in the arbcom case, because I consider them disruptive.

When I look at then, I don't see them as being substantial either, especially the first 2 which look like just adding refferences.

<dd>I understand your willingness to "post" but some of us have been here sometime now and as Sethhie explained, we have a "gentleman" agreement. Hope you will acknowledge that agreement and share your reliable sources. Until then, I will revert this article back...and I have no problem in doing that as many times as it takes...

<dd>"<b>Brahma Kumaris</b></dd>
<dd>Modern Hindu religious organization founded in the 1930s by a Sindhi jeweler named Dada Lekhraji. In 1947, after the partition of British India into India and Pakistan, the organization relocated its headquarters from Sindh (in modern Pakistan) to Mount Abu in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Although the sect has only about 100,000 members - minuscule by Hindu standards - it is noteworthy for several reasons. Unlike most Hindus, the Brahma Kumaris aggressively seeks out and converts new members, and thus it has a much higher profile than other religious sects. The organization preaches a doctrine foretelling the imminent end of the world, which must be prepared for by radical asceticism. It is also noteworthy that since its beginning, the majority of its adherents have been women. [..]"</dd>

<dd>Dear Andries, Thank you for your understanding on this. Sure, I will place the template when requesting for a quote. I need to add that I have provided a pdf file for anyone to read of the article cited. I would be very nice if that additonal step is provided for the sake of completeness and accuracy.</dd>
<dd>Let me point out a couple of issues I have with your quote. For that I will use Kranenborg's article:<a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/bryn/br_kranenborg.htm" rel="nofollow">[77]</a></dd>
<dd>"If this tendency continues it could become clear that Brahma Kumaris is in fact a new religion, originating within Hinduism but going its own way." This is a reliable source and I am showing the website. Accordingly, the term "sect" should not be used. Firstable Wikipedia itself discourages it. See the archives with the link in it, since this issue was discussed before. Second, You added the following:"The movement agressively seeks new converts." Please elaborate what do you mean by "agressively." Is there any quotes regarding this term? Thirdly, 100,000 members is completely innacurate. BK has its own count on this and I wonder about the date of this quote. Above it states 2002 as the date for publication. Perhaps someone else could provide a number on this.</dd>
<dd>Fourthly, To state that Brahma Kumaris was founded "in the 1930s" is quite vague if nothing else. We are celebrating 70 years and provided a date for it.</dd>

<p>Hi, I think the membership figure is old. Also, I'd be uneasy using the word "<b>aggressively</b>". Although having said that, I think it is an interesting and worthy point that the Brahma Kumaris are quite unusual in that they do have a high conversion rate for an organisation of its size and history.

<dd>"Unlike most Hindus, the Brahma Kumaris aggressively seeks out and converts new members"</dd>
<dd>Dear Andries, Since you are <b>adding</b> a quote it is reasonable to expect justification of it. Your option is to choose a citation. You could have picked another one.. but you picked that particular one. I am only asking for support of that word with another quote. "aggresiveness" is a loaded word which has a negative connotation. Best, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 19:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>It was information missing in the article. If you think that it should be voiced as an opinion then that is fine with me because I have to admit that the word aggressive is not clearly defined in this context. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To all,</dd>
<dd>One of the reasons I haven't made any edits is due to this very <b>tone</b>(directed at <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a>) of the users that want to keep information out. This is a bit of a stretch: <b>"gentleman" agreement</b>. First, off this agreement that I understood was that information was going to be removed not because it was not true but because it did not have the little number next to it, the citations were in the bibliography. So, I asked for some time and when I went in and started to place the information back along with the citations as requested and I was reverted with the excuse that it had not been discussed here? I hadn't done any thing up until then awaiting the arbitration that was rejected, a new one is under way and so I am waiting to see………………hope is eternal.</dd>

My bet is Andries won't get the information in, even though it is cited and brought here. I noted that <a href="../../../b/k/s/User%7EBksimonb_ffe3.html" title="User:Bksimonb">Bksimonb</a> wasn't happy with the state of the article even though it reads like a glowing PR job.

<dd>I now have spent close to three grand on books (those little academic books are not cheap), so that perhaps I can have a shot at placing facts in the hope of making this of some value to individuals that want to look this up for what ever reason. I also feel that some of the "discussions" are a bit like: "Me, myself and I don't agree it should go in because it is not academic enough!" Oh, it looks more official to cut and paste.......like we all did so long ago. So, yes the article looks like a PRO Brahma Kumaris <b>mess <i>and I noted that one</i></b> <i>Academic'</i> dropped by to correct his name yet didn't bother to verify some things that would prove to him that it was the not the UN that helped the organization to grow, it was those Westerners that opened centres in the London, Japan, UK (Germany), Australia, Guyana, New Zealand, South America. If he did he might have found that some that ran some of those centres had indeed been here! How easily they were discarded, attacked, their work (decades) given to the UN emblem and on towards a rewrite of the events.</dd>

Sethie, did you notice that all the ExBK links are gone too? So, theoretically this group has no opposition and all is well and good in the world of Gyan. So, I won't hold my breath to see the entry by Andries in the article because I know it will be another verdict by "Me, myself and I".

<dd>The problem with terminology is that none of the words <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">new religious movement</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Sect.html" title="Sect">sect</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a></i> have only one clearly defined generally accepted meaning. For example, the term NRM is often confined to movements that were founded after 1945 which thus excludes Brahma Kumaris. I see no easy solution for this. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:34, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is the following quote that would substantiate your entry:
<ul>
<li>“ …as a result of its ‘’’extremely energetic’’’ proselytizing, the movement has a visibility out of proportion to its size.” &#160;:Redemptive Encounters (Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition), Lawrence Babb<a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~facultyprofiles/babb_lawrence.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amherst.edu/~facultyprofiles/babb_lawrence.html" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>, 1986, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-57766-153-2</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So, one could easily say the other is correct, although the above is more sophisticated and palatable. I could live with ‘’’extremely energetic’’’ if that is the only objection. I do believe that the membership was correct for that period time (78-79), below are more recent numbers and the year it was established.
<ul>
<li>Quote: “<b>In 1937</b> he established the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual Organization or Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University (BKWSU) at Hyderabad.”</li>

<dd>Hi all, just dropping by, - good to see that the discussion seems to be finally moving in the direction of basing the article around scholarly secondary sources. However this section clearly illustrates that there is a real danger of the edit war simply being refined and continued along the lines of ‘my scholar carries more weight than yours etc’.</dd>
<dd>One way to avoid this might be for editors to agree to consider the works of certain authors only? And having done that, to then try and further agree on their differing areas of expertise. For instance a cursory glance reveals that the research of Wallis, Howell and Kranenborg is more recent than say Babb or Barz. This is not to discount or invalidate the latter, but with a rapidly evolving NRM such as the BK, more recent works are bound to offer a more contempory analysis.

<dd>That's a good point and I think it would be a step forward to agree on certain academics. However, I think where academics contradict eachother, we should just say so in the article. Along the lines of: "X says Y about the BKs, but A takes a different view...". Otherwise, it can get tricky in working out how to decide how one academics view on a certain subject supersedes that of another one (except if its a matter of being most up-to-date, in terms of membership figures for example).

<p>With all the BK contributors on board here, why;</p>
<ul>
<li>is it still not possible for them to substantiate membership figures and what constitutes membership?</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked for this ages ago. All the academics are depending on the so called 'official figures' as 'actually figures' have not been independently reviewed. On that basis, it is probably best to leave any figure out or qualify it as a "claim".</p>
<p>Regarding the founding, the BKWSU was not founded in the 30s. The precursor OM Mandali was. In truth, BKWSU does not appear to have been founded anywhere until the 70s. It is just a sort of trading name for a variety of Trusts. Name and date the trusts please. Again, with so many BK contributors, why;</p>
<ul>
<li>can we not have references to citable legal documents and specific dates instead of vaguarities?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 08:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's fair to use the term "claim". Even the academic works have to rely on a guesstimate sourced from what the BKs say - so might has well use the most current figure that the BKs are using and attach "claim" to it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe we can say something along the lines of "the movement's history goes back to the 1930s, when it was initially known as Om Mandali"? I'm not aware of legal documents that state the start of the name BKWSU - but unless someone can provide that, we can say that "the organisation later became known as BKWSU"? Appledell 21:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I ask the same question, again, with so many BK contributors, why;
<ul>
<li>Can we not have references to citable legal documents and specific dates instead of vaguarities?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Ditto with the dates and documents of founding of the various stages.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With regards Kranenborg, he writes "If this tendency continues ...", that is future tense and predictions are not allowed on the Wiki. I also re-iterate that this is proper paper.</dd>
<dd>With regards to limiting to chosen scholars, there is no chance of that. The article has always been based on citable sources. As the later academics are largely dependent on what the BKWSU tells them, they are too subject to the institutional re-writes. Revisionism with regards to history is not the same as evolution which is why Babb, Barz or Chander are very useful.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kranenborg quote</span></h2>
<p>I want to qualify my reservation on the use of the full Kranenborg quote in the first paragraph again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although he may have academic qualifications, it is not a proper academic paper.</li>
<li>The web reference offers no citations to where he found his assumptions and no evidence is provided to sustain them</li>
<li>It continues the obfuscation between BK practise and classic Raja Yoga.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it may be good PR for the BKWSU but it is unsustainable until references are provided to sustain it.</p>
<p>The centrality of spiritual mediumship and the connection with the channelled beings the BKs call Shiva and Bapadada is on the other hand concurrent throughout many of the academics and their own literature. It is the most defining difference between their practise and others understanding of the terms. No BapDada, no BKWSU. The unchallenged reference to additional channelling carries additional weight in this argument.</p>
<p>Can I suggest a separate category within the article on "<b>The BKWSU use of mediums</b>" or mediumship?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Discussion</span></h2>
<p>Dear .244,</p>
<p>Ok. Let us discuss. I took my 6 hours off now I am ready... 1) Mediums: The word is channeling. The article (which will be reverted) had mentioned this at least once. What is your issue with this? Any other problems? 2) issue with Andreas: The article pointed out the words NRM and Religion when referring to Brahma Kumaris. As far as I can see the word in discussion was" Agressive." What would you like to post? BTW, I asked a question which wasn't even acknowledge. What is your interest in this article? You do not seem BK nor Ex-BK, a little search about you in wikipedia gives an idea of your interests, however; whether you want to answer this question or not, at least say so. You want me to answer your questions, likewise answer mine. Otherwise, it will look "poorly on me." alone, as Sethie put it.</p>
<p>Will revert article again. Best, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 13:28, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Medium is the word the BKWSU has used to describe Lekhraj Kirpalani.</li>
<li>Mediumship is the alpha and omega of BKWSU practise.</li>
<li>Without the mediumship of Shiva through Kirpalani there would be no BKWSU</li>
<li>The entity which is being channelled is the focus of BK medititation not what others consider to be God</li>
<li>Channelling is mentioned by most of the academics</li>
<li>The practice and process of channelling and mediumship is central to, consistent throughout and mention in the organization's own self-published material and websites including terms such as trance medium and trance messenger</li>
<li>A senior director of BK Raja Yoga centers clearly documents the mediumship of a deceased leader after the cremation of her body in a reliable and expert secondary source.</li>
<li>The Murlis specifically state that the said channelled entity works through BK Raja Yoga practitioners even if they are not aware of it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All of the above are what differentiate BK practise from Classical Raja Yoga and specifically identify the BKWSU and its practises. Indeed differentiate it from most religions. It is simply the most identifying factor, hence its inclusion in the top paragraph. How many other Universities,never mind religions, do you know of that have been started by a channelled entity and whose canon has been developed by channelled teachings?</dd>

<dd>I do not know the specifics of this case, but I strongly support the principle of giving emphasis to beliefs and practices that differ from mainstream Hinduism. In fact, giving emphasis of differentiating beliefs and practices is a guideline in the German Wikipedia for their Wikiproject religion that I intend to translate. For example, in the case of Christian groups the German Wikipedia recommends linking to the article <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and then only write down the peculiarities of that particular group. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 01:27, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As to who is Smeelgova, well I don't think this is a good tactic as now you are promoting the sussing of wikipedia editors at large. This could be seen as an act of intimidation. Please stick to the discussion of the article not members!' <b>"Will revert article."</b> is not a good answer. As to the cut and paste.... it becomes an advertisement when you only place certain items while leaving others out, putting on blinders etc to the other items that other editors here have tried to no avail to place in. So, the tag is warranted and in addition this article has a <b>clean up tag</b> in the talk page which would support the Advet tag as well.</dd>

<dd>Objectively, I did agree entirely on the advertisement tag. The lengthy Kranenborg quotation at the top was entirely unscientific, unacademic and unsupported by him.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>May I make a suggestion to involved editors? Given that most of you are engaged in an arbitration case about this and related articles, you may want to consider not editing the article until the arbitration case is completed. For those editors that are not engaged in the arbitration case, you may want to consider being very cautious with your edits as to avoid igniting more flames in this dispute, and to allow the arbitration case to proceed without extra burdens. Note that if any new editors become too involved with this article, they may become <i>de facto</i> parties to the arbitration case. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 17:12, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neutral edit</span></h2>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I reverted to the neutral edit as a starting point, and I state stating point.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is really due to the underhand manner in which the previous edit was achieved. I am afraid that I consider this to discredit the previous article and, given the academics assessment of BK evanglism being aggressive, have to view such editing techiques as being equally aggressive by normal standards.</p>
<p>Specifically I am talking about the blocking out of other contributors by intimidation and the use of secret IP user accounts by BK Luis to make admin requests and complaints which doesnot seem to have been acknowledged or commented upon by other contributors. Clearly part of a greater attempt to silence my involvement all together.</p>
<p>We have a problem here because discussion is not going on based on policy. But at least all the bogus vandalism claims and threats have stopped now Luis has been unmasked and the arbcom case has started. So that, at least, is an improvement.</p>
<p>I actually think that the current edit is neutral, better written and entirely concurrent with the academics and factual. If not complete. So rather than just mindlessly erasing it, what are the issues the BKWSU team has with it?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Replaced Vallabhacharya references</span></h2>
<p>I replaced the Vallabhacharya references as I believe it is both a fairly innoculous fact whilst also putting into some context Kirpalani's and Om Mandali's later development. The justification for this is based on Vallabhacharya's identification between Krishna and Param Brahman, or Paramdham in BK speak, and all of the other gods of Hinduism as parts or aspects of his all-encompassing being. As a note, the Pushtimarg view of deities other than Krishna is not that they do not exist but that they are inferior to and dependent on Krishna's existence. After a someone is initiated into the sampradaya, Krishna is ideally the only god who is to be worshipped making Vallabhacharya essentially monotheist because of his complete focus on Krishna as deity (even to the the diminishment of Shiva). For more discussion on the BKWSU and this sect, please see Barz.</p>
<p>The BKs, of course, believe that Kirpalani and Krishna are the same soul as referenced elsewhere. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 03:03, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's your definition? "Nonsense" is a bit of an exaggeration. MY interpretation: "Om" means "I am", "I am the one", "my original, true self". "Shanti" means peace.

Andries's resolution would in all fairness be accurate as, like the other nomenclatures, they are all taken from Classical Hinduism or yoga practises and used to hide new meanings. I appreciate that as a BK you will believe these meanings are the true meanings and Classical Hinduism is wrong, so please don't take offense at this but the Wikipedia has to come from a standard, objective point of view. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 01:59, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erm...that is "my" definition as that is what I believed it to mean - what's the problem? I've already said I'm happy to attribute it as a BK interpretation as per Andries' request. I don't appreciate you calling into question my honesty and integrity and can you stop labelling me as a BK as if its some sort of stick to beat me with - I have never referred to you as an ex-BK.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critical information???</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I realize that this article is locked and in arbitration at the moment, but it seems very odd to have no information about criticism in this article at all. I must admit I am unfamiliar with the subject matter myself, but surely some of the information from those critical sites is valid and deserves a section of itself called <b>"Criticism"</b>? Or perhaps a fork to an article called <b>"Criticism of Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University"</b>&#160;??? But not to have virtually anything at all in the main article on any kind of criticism seems really weird. <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smeelgova</a> 12:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>I suppose it depends what you mean by "criticism". There are plenty of aspects in the article which I'm sure the BKs would challenge for giving undue prominence and weight to certain of their beliefs, while not giving enough emphasis on other aspects. This might not be outright criticism, but it can certainly leave the reader with a negative view of the BKs. For example, the aspect of Destruction/End of the World...this is an aspect that is looked at near the end of the BKs' 7-day-course and not touched on at all in 99% of the talks/lectures/meditation seminars the BKs give. This is because it's not something the BKs obsess about. Yet, it is something that is prominently featured in this article - skewing the work of the BKs. There are plenty of other examples in the article of this sort of thing - but I'll leave it at that for now. Appledell 18:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
