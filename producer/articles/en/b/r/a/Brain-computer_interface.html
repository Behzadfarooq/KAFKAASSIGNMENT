<p>A <b>brain-computer interface</b> (BCI), sometimes called a <b>direct neural interface</b> or a <b>brain-machine interface</b>, is a direct communication pathway between a human or animal <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> (or brain cell culture) and an external device. In one-way BCIs, computers either accept commands from the brain or send signals to it (for example, to restore vision) but not both.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Two-way BCIs would allow brains and external devices to exchange information in both directions but have yet to be successfully implanted in animals or humans.</p>
<p>In this definition, the word <i>brain</i> means the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervous_system.html" title="Nervous system">nervous system</a> of an <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organism.html" title="Organism">organic life form</a> rather than the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mind</a>. <i>Computer</i> means any processing or computational device, from simple circuits to silicon chips (including hypothetical future technologies such as <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_computing.html" title="Quantum computing">quantum computing</a>).</p>
<p>Research on BCIs has been going on for more than 30 years, but from the mid-1990s there has been a dramatic increase in working experimental implants. Years of animal experimentation have produced early working implants in humans designed to restore damaged hearing, sight and movement. The common thread throughout the research is the remarkable <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortical_plasticity.html" title="Cortical plasticity">cortical plasticity</a> of the brain, which often adapts to BCIs, treating prostheses controlled by implants as natural limbs. With recent advances in technology and knowledge, pioneering researchers could now conceivably attempt to produce BCIs that augment human functions rather than simply restoring them, previously only the realm of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>.</p>

<p>Neuroprosthetics is an area of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuroscience.html" title="Neuroscience">neuroscience</a> concerned with neural prostheses — using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems or sensory organs. The most widely used neuroprosthetic device is the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochlear_implant.html" title="Cochlear implant">cochlear implant</a>, which was implanted in approximately 100,000 people worldwide as of 2006.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> There are also several neuroprosthetic devices that aim to restore vision, including <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retinal_implant.html" title="Retinal implant">retinal implants</a>, although this article only discusses implants directly into the brain.</p>
<p>The differences between BCIs and neuroprosthetics are mostly in the ways the terms are used: "neuroprosthetics" typically refers to clinical devices, whereas many BCIs are still in the experimental realm. Practical neuroprosthetics can be linked to any part of nervous systems, for example peripheral nerves, while the term "BCI" often designates a narrower class of systems which interface with the brain directly.</p>
<p>The terms are sometimes used interchangeably and for good reason. Neuroprosthetics and BCI seek to achieve the same aims, such as restoring sight, hearing, movement and even cognitive function. Both use similar experimental methods and surgical techniques.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In 1999, researchers led by Garrett Stanley at Harvard University decoded neuronal firings to reproduce images seen by cats. The team used an array of electrodes embedded in the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalamus.html" title="Thalamus">thalamus</a> (which integrates all of the brain’s sensory input) of sharp-eyed cats. Researchers targeted 177 brain cells in the thalamus <a href="../../../l/a/t/Lateral_geniculate_nucleus.html" title="Lateral geniculate nucleus">lateral geniculate nucleus</a> area, which decodes signals from the retina. The cats were shown eight short movies, and their neuron firings were recorded. Using mathematical filters, the researchers decoded the signals to generate movies of what the cats saw and were able to reconstruct recognisable scenes and moving objects.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Nicolelis_7f06.html" title="Miguel Nicolelis">Miguel Nicolelis</a> has been a prominent proponent of using multiple electrodes spread over a greater area of the brain to obtain neuronal signals to drive a BCI. Such <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neural_ensemble.html" title="Neural ensemble">neural ensembles</a> are said to reduce the variability in output produced by single electrodes, which could make it difficult to operate a BCI.</p>
<p>After conducting initial studies in rats during the 1990s, Nicolelis and his colleagues developed BCIs that decoded brain activity in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_monkey.html" title="Night monkey">owl monkeys</a> and used the devices to reproduce monkey movements in robotic arms. Monkeys have advanced reaching and grasping abilities and good hand manipulation skills, making them ideal test subjects for this kind of work.</p>
<p>By 2000, the group succeeded in building a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a joystick or reached for food.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The BCI operated in real time and could also control a separate robot remotely over Internet protocol. But the monkeys could not see the arm moving and did not receive any feedback, a so-called <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-loop.html" title="Open-loop">open-loop</a> BCI.</p>

</div>
<p>Later experiments by Nicolelis using rhesus monkeys, succeeded in <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feedback_loop.html" title="Feedback loop">closing the feedback loop</a> and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys are considered to be better models for human <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurophysiology.html" title="Neurophysiology">neurophysiology</a> than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted hand gripping force.</p>
<p>Other labs that develop BCIs and algorithms that decode neuron signals include <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Donoghue_c87e.html" title="John Donoghue">John Donoghue</a> from Brown University, Andrew Schwartz from the University of Pittsburgh and Richard Andersen from Caltech. These researchers were able to produce working BCIs even though they recorded signals from far fewer neurons than Nicolelis (15–30 neurons versus 50–200 neurons).</p>
<p>Donoghue's group reported training rhesus monkeys to use a BCI to track visual targets on a computer screen with or without assistance of a joystick (closed-loop BCI).<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>. The group created headlines when they demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of <a href="../../../z/u/c/Zucchini.html" title="Zucchini">zucchini</a> using a robotic arm powered by the animal's own brain signals.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Andersen's group used recordings of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premovement_neuronal_activity.html" title="Premovement neuronal activity">premovement activity</a> from the posterior parietal cortex in their BCI, including signals created when experimental animals anticipated receiving a reward.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to predicting <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinematic.html" title="Kinematic">kinematic</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinetic.html" title="Kinetic">kinetic</a> parameters of limb movements, BCIs that predict <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromyography.html" title="Electromyography">electromyographic</a> or electrical activity of muscles are being developed.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Such BCIs could be used to restore mobility in paralysed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles.</p>

<p>Invasive BCI research has targeted repairing damaged sight and providing new functionality to paralysed people. Invasive BCIs are implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain during neurosurgery. As they rest in the grey matter, invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but are prone to <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar.html" title="Scar">scar-tissue</a> build-up, causing the signal to become weaker or even lost as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain.</p>

One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Dobelle_8196.html" title="William H. Dobelle">William Dobelle</a>.</p>
<p>Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into Jerry, a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry’s <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_cortex.html" title="Visual cortex">visual cortex</a> and succeeded in producing <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphenes.html" title="Phosphenes">phosphenes</a>, the sensation of seeing light. The system included TV cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision and at a low frame-rate also requiring him to be hooked up to a two-ton mainframe. Shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and allowed him to perform simple tasks unassisted.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2002, Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle’s second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry-night effect. Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute.</p>
<p>BCIs focusing on <i>motor neuroprosthetics</i> aim to either restore movement in paralysed individuals or provide devices to assist them, such as interfaces with computers or robot arms.</p>
<p>Researchers at Emory University in Atlanta led by Philip Kennedy and Roy Bakay were first to install a brain implant in a human that produced signals of high enough quality to simulate movement. Their patient, Johnny Ray, suffered from ‘<a href="../../../l/o/c/Locked-in_syndrome.html" title="Locked-in syndrome">locked-in syndrome</a>’ after suffering a brain-stem <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a>. Ray’s implant was installed in 1998 and he lived long enough to start working with the implant, eventually learning to control a computer cursor.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Partially invasive BCI devices are implanted inside the skull but rest outside the brain rather than amidst the grey matter. They produce better resolution signals than non-invasive BCIs where the bone tissue of the cranium deflects and deforms signals and have a lower risk of forming scar-tissue in the brain than fully-invasive BCIs.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrocorticography.html" title="Electrocorticography">Electrocorticography</a></i> (ECoG) uses the same technology as non-invasive electroencephalography (see below), but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the <a href="../../../d/u/r/Dura_mater.html" title="Dura mater">dura mater</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> ECoG technologies were first trialed in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from Washington University in St Louis. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Invaders_f242.html" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a> using his ECoG implant. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> This research indicates that it is difficult to produce kinematic BCI devices with more than one dimension of control using ECoG.</p>
<p><i>Light Reactive Imaging</i> BCI devices are still in the realm of theory. These would involve implanting a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser.html" title="Laser">laser</a> inside the skull. The laser would be trained on a single neuron and the neuron's reflectance measured by a separate sensor. When the neuron fires, the laser light pattern and wavelengths it reflects would change slightly. This would allow researchers to monitor single neurons but require less contact with tissue and reduce the risk of scar-tissue build-up.</p>

<p>As well as invasive experiments, there have also been experiments in humans using <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-invasive_%28medical%29.html" title="Non-invasive (medical)">non-invasive</a> <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuroimaging.html" title="Neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> technologies as interfaces. Signals recorded in this way have been used to power muscle implants and restore partial movement in an experimental volunteer. Although they are easy to wear, non-invasive implants produce poor signal resolution because the skull dampens signals, dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons. Although the waves can still be detected it is more difficult to determine the area of the brain that created them or the actions of individual neurons.</p>

Recordings of brainwaves produced by an electroencephalogram</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroencephalography.html" title="Electroencephalography">Electroencephalography</a></i> (EEG) is the most studied potential non-invasive interface, mainly due to its fine <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temporal_resolution.html" title="Temporal resolution">temporal resolution</a>, ease of use, portability and low set-up cost. But as well as the technology's susceptibility to <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise.html" title="Noise">noise</a>, another substantial barrier to using EEG as a brain-computer interface is the extensive training required before users can work the technology. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer of the University of Tübingen in Germany used EEG recordings of <i>slow cortical potential</i> to give paralysed patients limited control over a computer cursor.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> (Birbaumer had earlier trained <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epileptics</a> to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment saw ten patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took many months.</p>
<p>Another research parameter is the type of waves measured. Birbaumer's later research with Jonathan Wolpaw at New York State University has focused on developing technology that would allow users to choose the brain signals they found easiest to operate a BCI, including <i><a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu_wave.html" title="Mu wave">mu</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_wave.html" title="Beta wave">beta</a></i> waves.</p>
<p>A further parameter is the method of feedback used and this is shown in studies of <a href="../../../p/3/0/P300_%28Neuroscience%29_6030.html" title="P300 (Neuroscience)">P300</a> signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily (<a href="../../../e/v/e/Event-related_potential.html" title="Event-related potential">stimulus-feedback</a>) when people see something they recognise and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first. By contrast, the biofeedback methods described above require learning to control brainwaves so the resulting brain activity can be detected. In 2000, for example, research by Jessica Bayliss at the University of Rochester showed that volunteers wearing virtual reality helmets could control elements in a virtual world using their P300 EEG readings, including turning lights on and off and bringing a mock-up car to a stop.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, researchers at Case Western Reserve University led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadriplegic.html" title="Quadriplegic">quadriplegic</a> Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify patterns in the noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Electronic <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neural_networks.html" title="Neural networks">neural networks</a> have been deployed which shift the learning phase from the user to the computer.

World first: Neurochip developed by Caltech researchers Jerome Pine and Michael Maher</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Development of the first working neurochip was claimed by a Caltech team led by Jerome Pine and Michael Maher in 1997.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> The Caltech chip had room for 16 neurons.</p>
<p>In 2003, a team led by Theodore Berger at the University of Southern California started work on a neurochip designed to function as an artificial or prosthetic <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocampus.html" title="Hippocampus">hippocampus</a>. The neurochip was designed to function in rat brains and is intended as a prototype for the eventual development of higher-brain prosthesis. The hippocampus was chosen because it is thought to be the most ordered and structured part of the brain and is the most studied area. Its function is to encode experiences for storage as long-term memories elsewhere in the brain.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida used a culture of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly a F-22 fighter jet <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_simulator.html" title="Aircraft simulator">aircraft simulator</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petri_dish.html" title="Petri dish">petri dish</a> and rapidly begin to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and trained to control the pitch and yaw functions of the simulator. The study's focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain-computer_interface.html" title="Edit section: Ethical considerations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ethical considerations</span></h2>
<p>Discussion about the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_ethics.html" title="Medical ethics">ethical implications</a> of BCIs has been relatively muted. This may be because the research holds great promise in the fight against disability and BCI researchers have yet to attract the attention of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">animal rights</a> groups. It may also be because BCIs are being used to acquire signals to control devices rather than the other way round, although vision research is the exception to this.</p>
<p>This ethical debate is likely to intensify as BCIs become more technologically advanced and it becomes apparent that they may not just be used therapeutically but to enhance human function. Today's <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_pacemaker.html" title="Brain pacemaker">brain pacemakers</a>, which are already used to treat neurological conditions such as <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a> could become a type of BCI and be used to modify other behaviours. Neurochips could also develop further, for example the artificial hippocampus, raising issues about what it actually means to be human.</p>
<p>Some of the ethical considerations that BCIs would raise under these circumstances are already being debated in relation to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_implant.html" title="Brain implant">brain implants</a> and the broader area of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>.</p>
