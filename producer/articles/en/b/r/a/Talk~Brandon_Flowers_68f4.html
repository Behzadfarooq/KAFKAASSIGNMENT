<b>hey guys... www.nndb.com said that brandon is bisexual.</b> im not sure how reliable this site is.. considering the company who owns the site also owns morally incorrect sites like <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten.com.html" title="Rotten.com">rotten.com</a> and boners.com</p>

...Okay, I'm not saying that he's gay or anything, but what is Brandon Flowers' sexuality? Only respond if you actually know, 'cause I don't want a bunch of fangirls going "NO! OMG LOLZ Hez just joking! Hez 2 hawt 2 b gay!" I want facts. Or, at least, a decent speculation. (By the way, marriage to a woman does not rule out bisexuality, so don't even <i>try</i> pulling that card.)</p>
<p>I doubt anyone will answer this, but if they did, that'd be great.</p>
<p>I've removed the following: Category: Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual people</p>
<p>Brandon has repeatedly stated he's not gay, nor is he bisexual. He's engaged to be married. There is absolutely no proof whatsoever that he is anything other than what he says he is, yet this keeps reappearing.</p>

<p>- Brandon has stated that "Somebody told me" is purely fictional. And without him coming out and saying "I am bisexual, or I am gay." then it isn't a proven fact. You can also have a crush on someone without it being sexual. He stated that he looked up to the guy, and looked at him as a hero, which can also be considered a crush, that doesn't mean he was sexually attracted to him in a bisexual way.</p>

<p>His crush on a male athlete alone qualifies him for the bisexual list. Jamocha345 19:34, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One samesex crush does not a bisexual make. Hate to disappoint you. I've talked to the author of the article you cite, and both of us came back after speaking with Flowers with the conclusion that he is a straight man whose lyrics have gained a substantial gay following, and who is comfortable with that following. That is all.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Bisexual does NOT mean he's sexually promiscous. Bisexual people are perfectly capable of having monogamous relationships.</p>
<p>I think none of us know his true sexuality because Brandon doesn't get caught up in stardom and the media and such and go around announcing everything about himself -- <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.200.116.73.html" title="User:207.200.116.73">207.200.116.73</a> 14:38, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If there is a real dispute here (and I don't really think there is) add the dispute tag, don't reference the talk page in the article itself. There's a difference. As it stands, I don't see how the statement that his lyrics have led some to believe he is bi but it has not been established that this is true is disputed. It seems to describe the situation quite accurately to me.

<dd>If there is not a dispute, then why do people keep adding and deleting comments about his sexuality. Just read this talk page to see further evidence of the dispute. In addition the dispute tag is for when several statements in the article or the article itself is disputed. The convention I used is appropriate for a single statement as mentioned in the link I referenced in the article's history. -<a href="../../../k/m/s/User%7EKmsiever_02b6.html" title="User:Kmsiever">kmsiever</a> 18:57, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has anyone disputed the statement "Some of the band's lyrics have led people to believe that Brandon is bisexual, however, there is no evidence of this"? That seems to sum up the situation quite well to me. If it needs tweaking then tweak it. What is in dispute: that he is bisexual or that some people <i>think</i> he is? If it's the latter than go ahead and stick a disputed tag or whatever on it, but if it's whether he is bisexual then leave it alone. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:03, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a moot point now, but "Some people have suggested that Brandon is bisexual" was just as legitimate, particularly seeing as not everyone thought he was bisexual based on song lyrics.

<dd>Oh. Well I wish you had mentioned that earlier. Would have been easy to fix. What I'm against is dispute tags (actual tags or text ones) being used when the dispute can easily be resolved in the article itself by stating the controversy rather than endorsing one side. Directing readers to the talk page should be a last resort, as it's self-referential in a way, and it's not part of the article. It's often silly arguments between editors that it's best the casual readers don't examine. Britannica doesn't air its dirty laundry and we needn't point ours out to people either. They'll find it if they really want to see it. Thats was my basic point anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:39, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He said in an interview that it was healthy to question your sexuality, do u seriously think a straight man would meantion that or wear a pink leather suit??</p>
<p>I'm not saying Brandon Flowers is straight (i don't really know) but wearing pink has nothing to do with it. Anyway, lots of bands are being accused of being bisexual (The Bravery, Franz Ferdinand)I think it's just a way to gain more publicity.</p>
<p>Brandon Flowers has said that he likes to writes songs from all perspectives (not specifically his own). The song lyrics to "Andy, You're A Star" make more sense if you think of it from a highschool girl's point of view.</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing Brand Flowers <i>isn't</i> bisexual for the simple fact that <i>bisexual</i> in itself means mental, sexual, physical, erotic, OR emotional attraction to both sexes. To which degree those attractions may be becomes irrelevant with bisexuality. And yes, I understand the avoiding labels route but because such labels do exist and we <i>know</i> he exhibits an unmistakably bisexual nature... wouldn't the logical conclusion be to call the man bi?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The subtext in songs like <b>Somebody Told Me</b> and <b>Change Your Mind,</b> the blatant nature of <b>Andy, You're a Star</b>, and the references to <b><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greta_Garbo_3a19.html" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a></b>, <b><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlon_Brando_e47f.html" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dean_4236.html" title="James Dean">James Dean</a></b> (all of whom are disputed or confirmed bisexuals) in <b>The Ballad of Michael Valentine</b> and <b>Under The Gun</b>; and his open and casual nature about a samesex crush would imply to me he is bi. When I had a hard time telling people I was bi, and they asked me what I was, I'd simply say "I'm not gay" or "I like girls" to let them assume what they want whilst still avoiding lying. Also, the boylove and his quote about abmbiguity would suggest similar. Personally I do believe he is bisexual, but untill there is a quote from him, his wife or a male lover or <i>something</i>, I think the page is going to have to remain as it is. <a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZythe_56f0.html" title="User:Zythe">Zythe</a> 01:22, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I know that it's fun to think that Brandon Flowers might be Gay or Bisexual for those of you who are, but songs do not prove a thing. Brandon is a great song writer and speaks about many things in his songs. It seems that many people who are gay belive that everything has something to do with being Gay or BI, this is just relating. Brandon is married and hopefully very happy, and for those of us who DARE TO DREAM need to just get a grip on (reality), untill he comes out.

<p><br />
Brandon is married doesn't mean he's not gay / or BI it is what it is and you could assume forever and never get an answer, or you could I don't know let it go until he comes out. Why do you care is a great question.</p>

<p>I really feel that Brandon Flowers sexuality is of no relevance to his musical talent, nor is it anyone else’s business. Worry about things that actually affect you. Besides, why are you so desperate to find out?

<p>Can someone please stop deleting my comments on the fact that Brandon is getting married to his fiancée Tana in October of this year, because it's true!! Brandon confirmed it in an interview with Q magazine last month. It's true...I bet you some girl fan is deleting it to "abandon the truth". So listen up....HE IS GETTING MARRIED....just face the truth...there is nothing you can do! Sorry!</p>
<p>A ton of different websites and interviews say he got married in March, to Tana Mundkowsky. -- 63.201.95.139 07:29, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all you'll never get close enough to him to marry him (Crazy Fans) two how rude is it to delete someones comment, get a grip. And third Brandon is married and there are more than a ton of webpages confirming this, one of which even shows a picture of them together at the MTV music video awards. They were married in Hawaii, private ceremony. Now this does not mean that he's not gay, it's just means he's married.</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing out that interview. It implies he has a gay following. It should be noted, however, that the Gay Icon article states a gay icon is usually a woman. The list on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gay_icon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gay_icon" rel="nofollow">Talk page</a> also has very few men in it. I suppose we should determine if Flowers has a large enough gay following to be considered one of the few men listed among the gay icons.</dd>

</dd>

<p>My problem is that I'm bi but I know for a fact that a lot of gay boys look up to Brandon Flowers, at least more than enough to be granted the status of Gay Icon. If I could compare him, I'd say he's on par with Morrissey from The Smiths. As for gay icons always being females, I had to roll my eyes at that one. Then I kinda snorted.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>He was raised in Nephi, Utah as a Mormon...Flowers occasionally defies his Mormon faith by smoking Marlboro Lights and drinking alcoholic beverages.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Though Flowers may have been raised a Mormon, do we know if he still considers himself to follow that religion?

<p>These sources seems to answer my question:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The husband and wife to-be are Mormons. Munbkowsky says she converted prior to meeting Flowers.</i><a href="http://www.lvcitylife.com/articles/2004/10/08/music/fear_&amp;_lounging/fearlounge.prt" class="external text" title="http://www.lvcitylife.com/articles/2004/10/08/music/fear_&amp;_lounging/fearlounge.prt" rel="nofollow">Las Vegas City Life news source</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This excerpt from an interview implies he belongs to a specific congregation:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You had a Mormon upbringing. Was your experimentation with fashion and make up allowed? Were you a bit of a rebel?</b></li>
<li><i>I wouldn't say I was a rebel, but I don't think the make-up would go down so well at church.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Does religion still play an important part in your life?</b></li>
<li><i>Oh yes. I believe in God and everything very much. My faith is very important.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Do your religious values impact how you feel about gays and their equal rights?</b></li>
<li><i>No. I think everybody should have equal rights. The church that I am in has never been opposed to that. It is a very tolerant gathering.</i> <a href="http://www.arjanwrites.com/arjanwrites/2005/06/interview_with_.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arjanwrites.com/arjanwrites/2005/06/interview_with_.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these, I think we can properly characterize him as a current Mormon. Nonetheless, I believe we should re-write the sentence to something less judgmental, like "Despite his Mormon faith, he has been seen smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol." By analogy, I don't think we'd write "Sean Hannity defies his Catholic faith by using profanity." I will make the change and others can edit it mercilessly.

<p>Unless anybody has a problem with it, I'd like to update the controversies section a bit.

<p>The cocaine part of controversies keeps being removed. I know for a fact that it's true. But as that's certainly not an acceptable source, I think leaving in "reported" or "rumours" is probably fair (because the subject of the rumours really is true!). Although cocaine rumours may not be appropriate additions for other personalities, I think as Flowers has in the past stated that he doesn't use drugs, is trying to cut back on tobacco (as if that was as bad as it got), respects his strong Mormon upbringing etc., reports to the contrary should not be deleted. Thoughts? (82.45.221.159, 10/11 Dec 2006)</p>
<p>I'm inclined to say no. There are a lot of rumors about a lot of bands and Wikipedia would be utterly clogged if all were included. If you can genuinely source it, I'm all for it, but otherwise, it makes Wiki too "tabloid-y." 71.202.239.45 10:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There needs to be some sort of unity on what music The Killers qualifies as. The Killers wiki page lists just "Rock" first, but Brandon's page says only Synth and Indie.
