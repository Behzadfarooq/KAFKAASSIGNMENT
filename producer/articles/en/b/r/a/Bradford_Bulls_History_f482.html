<p>The Bradford Rugby Club was formed in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>. Park Avenue was established as their home ground in 1880. They achieved their first major success by winning the Yorkshire Cup in 1884.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>, along with crosstown neighbours <b>Manningham</b>, Bradford were among 22 clubs to secede from the Rugby Football Union after a historic meeting at The George Hotel in <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, in response to a dispute over "broken time" payments to players. These 22 clubs formed the Northern Rugby Union. In 1903-4 Bradford finished level on points with Salford at the top of the league and then won the resulting play-off 5-0.</p>
<p>Mannington ran into financial difficulties and despite a summer archery contest that generated enough money to ensure their survival, their members were persuaded to change to Association football. They were invited to join the Football League in 1903, in an attempt to introduce the soccer to the rugby-dominated region, and the newly renamed <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_City_5ce8.html" title="Bradford City">Bradford City</a> AFC were voted into full membership of the Second Division without playing a game of soccer, having a team or being able to guarantee a ground.</p>
<p>There was also a demand for Association Football at Park Avenue, which played host to soccer matches as well as Northern Union games. The first game of Association Football played at Park Avenue is believed to have been between <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Rovers_f38c.html" title="Blackburn Rovers">Blackburn Rovers</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Olympic_b852.html" title="Blackburn Olympic">Blackburn Olympic</a> and in 1895 a Bradford side beat a team from Moss Side, Manchester 4 -1 in front of 3,000 spectators.</p>
<p>In 1905-6 Bradford beat Salford 5-0 to win the Challenge Cup and were runners up in the Championship. The following season they win the Yorkshire Cup 8-5 against <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hull_Kingston_Rovers_00be.html" title="Hull Kingston Rovers">Hull Kingston Rovers</a>.</p>
<p>With soccer already successful at Bradford City, a meeting was called of the club members on April 15th 1907 to decide the club's future. An initial vote appeared to favour continuing in the Northern Union, then opinion shifted towards <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> but the Chairman, Mr Briggs, used his influence to swing the committee behind <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">Association football</a>. This act, sometimes referred to as "The Great Betrayal", led to Bradford becoming a soccer club, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_%28Park_Avenue%29_A.F.C._7268.html" title="Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.">Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.</a> and a new team <b>Bradford Northern</b> was created to take their place in the Northern Union.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Bulls_History_f482.html" title="Edit section: Bradford Northern">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bradford Northern</span></h3>
<p>In 1933 Bradford Northern signed a ten year lease with Bradford council for a former quarry being used as a waste dump at Odsal Top. It was turned into the biggest stadium outside Wembley. Bradford Northern played their first match there on September 1st 1934.</p>
<p>Success came in the 1940s with a number of cup wins. They won the Yorkshire cup in 1940-1, 1942-3, 1944-5, 1945-6, 1948-9 and 1949-50 and the Challenge cup 1943-4, 1946-7 and 1948-9. There was no championship played between 1939-45 due to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, yet they were unable to win either before the war or after despite being runners up in 1942-3 and 1947-8.</p>
<p>The 1947-8 final was notable as it was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, King George VI, who presented the trophy. Unfortunately for Bradford, they lost 8-3 to Wigan.</p>
<p>In 1951-2 Bradford were runners up in the league but beat <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team_9c34.html" title="New Zealand national rugby league team">New Zealand</a> at Odsal in the first floodlit football match of any code in the North of England. In 1953, a crowd of 69,429 watched Bradford play Huddersfield in the Challenge Cup third round. This was Northern’s highest ever attendance. They also won the Yorkshire Cup final 7-2 against Hull.</p>
<p>After attracting a record low crowd of 324 against Barrow, Northern went out of business on 10th December 1963. In 1964, the Bradford Northern club reformed through the efforts of such people as <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Foster_8204.html" title="Trevor Foster">Trevor Foster</a> and Joe Phillips. They were accepted back into the Rugby League. They won their first cup after reformation in 1965-66 by beating Hunslet 17-8 in the final of the Yorkshire Cup.</p>
<p>In 1972-3 Bradford lost the Challenge Cup final against Featherstone 33-14. In 1973-4 Bradford won the Second Division Championship and were promoted back to the First Division. During this season Keith Mumby made his debut, becoming the Bradford's youngest player at only 16 years of age, scoring 12 goals and a try in a match against Doncaster. He went on to make a record 576 appearances for the club. In 1974-75 Bradford won the Regal Trophy 3-2 against Widnes.</p>
<p>Peter Fox joined Bradford as coach for the first time in 1977-78. Bradford won the Premiership final 17-8 against Widnes. They were also Championship runners-up.</p>
<p>In 1978-79 Bradford appeared in another Premiership final but this time lost 24-2 to Leeds. A year later Bradford won the Championship and Regal Trophy. Peter Fox won the award for Coach of the Year. They won the Championship again in 1980-81.</p>
<p>In 1981-82 Bradford lost the Yorkshire Cup final 18-7 against Castleford and lost again in 1982-83, this time 18-7 against Hull. Keith Mumby won the award for First Division Player of the Year while <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Noble_38bf.html" title="Brian Noble">Brian Noble</a> won the Young Player award.</p>
<p>In 1985 <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellery_Hanley_9b81.html" title="Ellery Hanley">Ellery Hanley</a> left Northern to join Wigan for a then record transfer deal, worth £80,000 and a player exchange involving Steve Donlan and Phil Ford.</p>
<p>In 1987-8 Bradford won the Yorkshire Cup final replay against Castleford 11-2 after drawing 12-12. In 1989-90 Bradford beat Featherstone 20-14 in the Yorkshire Cup final.</p>
<p>Bradford lost the Regal Trophy against Warrington 12-2 in 1990-91. In 1993-4, the last Championship before Super League, Bradford finished as runners up behind Wigan on points difference.</p>

<p>In April 1995, the Rugby League announced the formation of the European Super League. The Super League consisted of 10 clubs from the existing First Division (including Bradford Bulls) plus <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlequins_Rugby_League_d372.html" title="Harlequins Rugby League">London Broncos</a> from the Second Division, and new club <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_St_Germain_d1ba.html" title="Paris St Germain">Paris St Germain</a>.</p>

<p>In 1999 Bradford signed New Zealand international <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Paul_df6a.html" title="Henry Paul">Henry Paul</a> from <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigan_Warriors_62dd.html" title="Wigan Warriors">Wigan Warriors</a> who linked up with brother Robbie Paul for the first time at professional club level.
