	    <p>[edit] User:Brasileiro1969 Thread retitled from "To Quarl". Hi Quarl, I am Revivo formerly known as Brasileiro. I am asking you to unblock my Brasileiro1969 account as I am not associated with those other users as you think or like to believe.</p>
<p>You seem to have acted on "complaint" from aLii on your page about me. Alii's comment reads a bit like a footballer who is begging the ref for a red card after one of his fellow players (stubacca) claims to have been fouled.</p>
<p>The comment I removed from you (with explanation) on that SP allegation page, looked like you were necessarily trying to inflict damage to my position, with just saying sonmething along the lines of 'I agree as per above and he deleted one of my edits as well'. That does not strike me as very constructive towards a proper decision by a neutral party. Why am I not allowed to delete one of your entries? Where is the vandalism and disruption in that? Where was the warning from you if you really felt that strongly about the comment you added?</p>
<p>I merely had a content dispute with Stubacca and a discussion with aLii on his wholesale changes to an article without debating first. In my discussion with aLii, though pointed at times, I have done nothing wrong and he tried to leverage the false allegation Stubacca made and discredit me (an allegation which Stuba made as he could not further an edit based on his POV only, which also happens to be your POV on the matter I have read)</p>
<p>And with you as admin involved in this case, you should not be the one who is the accuser and judge rolled into one. An unfair principle, don't you think?</p>
<p>More reasons for you to reconsider what you have done, in my view. I am waiting for your response, which I expect to be balanced, open, honest and with a degree of self-reflection.</p>
<p>I ask you to unblock me and let me be and feel free to keep following me in my tracks as I am not a SP. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Revivo (talk • contribs) 17:19, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</p>
<p>Thank you for the message. The evidence for sockpuppetry was pretty strong so I'm not going to unblock. I noted the potential COI on AN/I before and after the block, and it was endorsed. I haven't blocked the sockmaster account (though it deserves to be); I would recommend letting the matter rest and editing using only the main account. —Quarl (talk) 2007-03-27 11:19Z I cannot and will not let it rest, as I am not a SP. Brasileiro1969 is main account (only created Revivo to start a direct discussion with you) so it is a matter of principle.</p>
<p>If you feel that he suggestion is so strong in your eyes why did you not leave the case open for a neutral Admin to have a look at? Given your involvement in the discussion as whole and your POV on the football page there is a clear, not a potential, COI here and you should not have acted unilaterally, so rashly. Not even mentioning the way aLii prompted you into action... aLii: Ref foul!! Give him red! like a player diving to the ground in agony after a mere brush.</p>
<p>Fact was: aLii preferred to play it like this rather than finishing the debate properly we had started on the discussion page. A debate he had reluctantly started after being pulled over for making wholesale changes to a page. ..and you.. you were there to oblige even with COI written all over you. Again I ask you to reconsider and unblock Brasileiro1969. Feel free to monitor my movements thereafter, but as things are now.. I cannot and will not let it rest.</p>
<p>COI, even the suggestion, for an admin is a dangerous and improper thing. You cannot be involved and be the final arbiter at the same time. One could have a case if the 'disruption and abuse' was so great and material that action had to be taken immediately. But was that REALLY the case? I dont think so. I was in the middle of a debate with aLii and getting towards some sort of consensus.</p>
<p>I await your reply.</p>
