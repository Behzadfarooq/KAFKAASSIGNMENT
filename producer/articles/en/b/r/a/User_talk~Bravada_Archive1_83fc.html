<p><small>Hi - thanks for communication - yes, I am East side of the Atlantic and in the UK we do not have a term 'liftback', so far as I know. We use the term 'hatchback' for a car-like vehicle with a lifting rear hatch (usually including the rear window). We use the term 'estate car' for the 'vertical back' type of vehicle, which is designed for load-lugging. What would you like to propose, for this entry (which must be relevant to many automobile articles)? I look forward to the discussion. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 06:52, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>Seems like a useful way forward - I look forward to seeing developments. - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 07:35, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>I really liked the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Liftback.html" title="Liftback">liftback</a> article. However, I'm not sure it won't earn a 'proposed merge' template, to be combined with <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatchback.html" title="Hatchback">hatchback</a>. I've taken the liberty of making a few minor edits and I stumbled over the caption edit (see 'history')! Let's see what happens ... - <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 11:14, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>As for 'liftback combi-coupe', I have no objection - ref. the edit I did in <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saab_900.html" title="Saab 900">Saab 900</a>, of course I woudn't have deleted your 'liftback' annotation - that would have been unfriendly and very un-WP!

<p><small>I've just read your message(s) - a) Your English is GREAT! b) I don't feel that I'm any sort of authority to grant or to deny you the 'green light' to integrate the liftback article - I can't see why not, though. c) I am afraid I didn't follow the Toyota Camry issue. What exactly were you asking me - I'm not sure how to apply the automatic translation from Google, to the Japanese Toyota article to which you referred. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 11:30, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Ref. 'Black Hole', yes, it would cause me to crack up, too! I've not ventured into Japanese translations yet - I suspect it's fll of pitfalls like the one you've discovered. Could be worth a 'trivia' entry but might be removed as being a bit POV and negative! Oh well. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBallista_ac30.html" title="User:Ballista">Ballista</a> 11:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>Bravada, regarding what you said about the Jackaroo/Monterey - I remember that for a time there was a 4x4 that Holden sold a while back called the Nullarbor. What was it? Was it another version of the Jackaroo?

<p><small>Hello, it's CBecker. Thank you for explaining the nuances of the template specific to Lancia. I am going to attempt a Volkswagen template using a similar style. But I don't want you to think I am infringing on your creative and technical efforts when I say this. My goal is not to change a few words and call it my own. My goal is to use your template as the preverbial "bowl of fruit" from which to study as an example while creating an interpretation based on it. And when completed, to submit it for approval/use without asking for credit of any kind. You are correct when you say there is a lot of formatting involved! However this is not intimidating for me as disecting code is the easiest way for me to learn it and I have done so on various personal projects in the past. The Wikipedia code is what is currently throwing me off the most, but no worries as it does not seem too complex. And I still have some memory of HTML and CSS for the rest of it. If you have any further concerns, please do not hesitate to address them. --<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECBecker_2b2d.html" title="User:CBecker">CBecker</a> 02:13, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>lmao! Well hello again Bravada! Good to see I'm not working alone on anything here, hahaha!</small></dd>
<dd><small>Thank you very much for your comments. I think I've got a good start on this. I'm very interested in the Volkswagen model line and history, so that's why I started with this company. I was trying to do as much as possible in one day Saturday, so I rushed some things (with the intention to polish it all up before submitting it), and certainly would not yet call it complete.</small></dd>
<dd><small>In regards to the image: it can be changed at any time by simply re-uploading. I personally own both a digital camera and a Volkswagen, so I can take a *good* shot of the grille emblem no problem. The image I put in there was more for an example for myself to get the size and basic look right. I'm assuming you are talking about the photo of the rear of the B6 Passat Wagon, not the text "Volkswagen" or "Volkswagen AG." I actually did make those both from scratch (not that hard, haha).</small></dd>
<dd><small>In regards to the layout: thank you for pointing out my category mistake. I'll fix it immediately. Oops! As for "further splitting/rearranging models in the template for easier navigation," if you have more specific suggestions I'm all ears. I took a look at the old, clumsy template and decided I'd clean it up considerably. I went through and changed some of the pipe link names, put them all in chronological order of their release, and read at least parts of almost every model page, on the English and German Wikipedias (to make sure I wasn't screwing anything up). Comparing the old and the new, I think you'd agree there is noticeable improvement. However, like I said, it sounds like you might have some hints. Please share!</small></dd>
<dd><small>In regards to my notes: well I certainly did not expect anyone other than myself to be reviewing those, haha! There are a few I definitely want to do, but the majority of them I simply wanted to throw out as ideas on the respective talk pages. Referring back to where I said I was trying to get as much done as possible in one day, I couldn't have read every single page thoroughly or become an expert on every model overnight! That's why I wanted to simply see how others felt about those ideas.</small></dd>
<dd><small>My reason for wanting to split the <a href="../../../../de/v/w/_/VW_Polo_a93f.html" class="extiw" title="de:VW_Polo">Polo</a> and <a href="../../../../de/v/w/_/VW_Derby_e944.html" class="extiw" title="de:VW_Derby">Derby</a> is because they are separate articles on the German Wikipedia (and Volkswagen being German I figured they'd know better than an American who has never even seen a Polo or Derby in real life). Their take on it made it seem to me that there was a definite distinction between the two models, whereas the Santana is basically just a different trim level or non-distinct variation of the Passat. The Golf and Jetta are considered distinct, whereas a Jetta Wagon or a Golf Variant are simply non-distinct variations or different trim styles. However, you claim the Derby "didn't have too much life of its own." If that is the case, then I would agree to keep them merged, however I'd like more than one opinion, no offense!</small></dd>
<dd><small>Also, note that the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_Caddy_1293.html" title="Volkswagen Caddy">Caddy</a> is actually many models and trims etc., rather than one distinct model line. I consider the first Caddy to be a non-distinct trim/variation of the Golf I and Citi Golf. The same for the second and third (other non-distinct trims/variations of yet <i>different</i> model lines and even companies). However the fourth Caddy, if I understand correctly, is its own model line with many of its own variations. I would make a proposal that the Caddy page be devoted simply to the model line by the actual name "Caddy" (Caddy IV), and merge the non-distinct trims/variations (Caddy I-III) into their respective model pages. If I am unaware of some reason that makes this a bad idea, someone will definitely let me know! Although if I discover that it is in fact produced by VW Commercial Vehicles I will simply remove it from the template altogether and worry about it later!</small></dd>
<dd><small>Good point about separating the CrossFox. I didn't notice how many other model lines had similar variations. I was simply making a note of how different they appeared from each other in the photos.</small></dd>
<dd><small>Also good point about the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen_Country_Buggy_657d.html" title="Volkswagen Country Buggy">Country Buggy</a>. There is almost no information (and zero pictures) on Wikipedia about this. If it really was a very different vehicle than the Beetle, I would certainly not merge it with the Type 1. "You don't have Kubelwagen merged into the Beetle do you?" No, but I would support a merge of the Type 1 Cabriolet with the Type 1. Although I don't think the Type 1 Cabriolet even has its own page.</small></dd>
<dd><small>"IMHO, the rule of the thumb should be the amount of information, and currently the info on the Fox page regarding SpaceFox and CrossFox does not merit separate articles." To humbly disagree, I think the rule of thumb should be each separate model line gets its own page, regardless of the amount of information (the idea is to expand the information on each model, yes?), and simple non-distinct variations/trims redirect to their respective model lines (ex: Jetta Wagon -&gt; Jetta). By the way, I didn't know you knew so much about Volkswagen? I think I will enjoy working on this project more knowing I've got someone to give me good pointers along the way. Thank you!</small></dd>

<dd><small>I certainly do not mind the help of a more experienced Wikipedian looking over my shoulder on this project. I could not have asked for a better favor. You are welcome and encouraged to keep on doing exactly what you have been doing. Your description of the Wikipedians involved on the automotive project is somewhat discouraging. I would like to help change that if there's any way that I could. Maybe if just keep working and you keep helping we could get some more people to join in the collaboration and start with that, huh?</small></dd>
<dd><small>Articles: Yes I do understand your point. However it was not my intention to honor any model by praising it with subjective material. I'm not sure if that's what you meant by that or not. Regardless, I think the idea of starting one page per model line is a good idea because it basically personifies the goal of Wikipedia: to build and expand on a single idea to form an ever-increasing database of knowledge. Just because a particular model might not have that much information on it today, doesn't mean that tomorrow an expert on that model won't come along and have a lot to say about it. But I'm in perfect agreement that a simple variation of the base model (like a station wagon version or hatchback version) SHOULD be merged with the main model's article UNLESS it really did live a life all its own (Golf and Jetta are perfect examples).</small></dd>
<dd><small>In regard to your comment about the Santana: I would again like to point out (assuming you are still referring here to my notes) that before merging or splitting an article on a model and its variations, I promise not to simply dive right in and change it (unless I happened to be an expert on the matter). Regarding the Santana, CrossFox, etc., I had not even heard of them until Saturday, which certainly does not put me anywhere near the level of expert on the matter. Before carrying out any bold measures like merging/splitting an article, I will first make a proposal on the talk page and see how others (with better knowledge and expertise on the subject) feel about it.</small></dd>
<dd><small>In regard to your comment about the Caddy: Again you surprise me with your knowledge of Volkswagens! You may be right about the Golf I Caddy. But even if that is the case, I would still recommend limiting the Caddy article to the Mk1 and Mk4. The Mk2 and Mk3 seem to be nothing more than variations of other cars (which should therefore be merged with their appropriate articles).</small></dd>
<dd><small>In regard to the Template: I know exactly what text VW uses in their marketing. It's called "VW Futura" font. I read somewhere it is unavailable anywhere. However, I am always of the opinion that the Internet is an infinitely large space, where anything and everything can be made "available" depending on how determined you are. I found the next closest thing, your basic "Futura Bold" font. And that is what I used. Now, if you think you could locate "VW Futura", it would take me all of ten minutes to redo the text "Volkswagen" and "Volkswagen AG". I will continue looking so that I can perhaps find it before finalizing the VW template. Colors are also easy to redo. I have a program that tells you the HTML value (and several other values) of any color which the tip of your cursor passes over. It would take no time at all to pull the exact color values off any VW picture I find that fits better than the Passat one I have on there right now. But I think I will wait to change the colors until after I have a better photo. Also, for the model lists, well I think having them in order of release is more educational than alphabetical order. Subdividing into classes might work but it raises the question of where the list of models would then be relocated to, and to answer that question I would recommend a template as the most convenient solution. A template that has to link to another template probably isn't doing its job, so the matter should be resolved by simply modifying the original. I don't think what I have here seems too difficult or frustrating to navigate, probably based simply on the fact that the list of cars does not excede 50 different models. But I don't really want to force that idea, because it would make me sound biased toward my work! I of course would much rather make something everybody could say "well, I like the way that looks" rather than something I alone could be proud of! If you have no objections to copying what I have now and making your own adjustments on your user page, I would definitely encourage it! We might reach completion much faster if we have more than one person collaborating on it.</small></dd>
<dd><small>My goal with this template is that once it is perfected, to simply take it, fill in a different picture, title, and colors, and use the same layout for all the companies under Volkswagen AG. So think of this as not only working to complete a template for VW, but also for Audi, Bugatti, Bentley, Lamborghini, Seat, Škoda, and VW Commercial Vehicles. And when people see all that work done, I'm hoping it will motivate more people to collaborate and revamp more templates and articles within the automotive project. Maybe that's a kind of out-there goal, but at the very least we'll have some cool new templates huh? Haha, and so far it's not like I've spent <i>too much</i> time or effort on this, so I don't feel like I'm wasting my energy. Thanks for your continued correspondence!</small></dd>

<p><small>Hi Bravada, Many many thanks for correcting things on the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Comerford_f1ec.html" title="Jane Comerford">Jane Comerford</a> page and also for all your hints and tips. Indeed, you are right in all you've said and I really appreciate that you sent me that message since I am fairly new and actually have no clue about the laws and copyrights here...- I'm stil learning and I promise I'll try to improve things&#160;:) I have never edited on Wiki before and just did it the same way I learnt it in school ages ago...that's why I put a few inappropriate comments in it. I'll take them off as soon as possible! I know Jane a little, I have met her once, went to a couple of concerts before and I'm a great admirerer of her music. She's a great musician, has a wonderful voice and composes lovely songs. She deserved the success she has right now in Germany! I was so pleased to see you started this article! Thank you for all your contributions and your kindness!!! Kind regards Jenny</small></p>

<p><small>Alright. I too had a brief look at the Stilo/Brava/Bravo articles and decided to improve a Renault Modus one - all it said was there might be a 'Grand' version. (?)</small></p>
<p><small>Oh, and by the way, feel free to edit the engines part (I don't mind at all). I found that the powerplants listed were terribly out-of date, so I updated them and restructured it a bit.</small></p>
<p><small>I'll try and find a link. In the meantime, I've got myself and interesting project. Dunno if you're interested in it, but this kinda caught my eye Perucac</small></p>
<p><small>You have my permission (alright, you could do, if you don't like that phrase.) to replace that dreadful picture with something much more flattering.</small></p>
<p><small>Right, Bravada, let me set things straight. I appreciate you are under considerable stress, but that was rather uncalled for. I was merely suggesting that the picture used in the original article wasn't the best, and <b>could</b> be replaced. I suggested the Marea on the Brazil homepage, but it seems you took me too seriously - maybe I can get a contact in South America to get me a few pics of a black one, and then that'll be that; we'll have our pictures. BTW - I've deleted the Rumours section on the Renault Modus (can't be fecked to scan and article in from an Auto Express mag - and it doesn't appear to be online anyway). I've found no such article for the Grand Modus either, so that's that stuffed.</small></p>

Not only I did some (minor) reviews, but also I don't feel impartial after getting involved with this whole debate. I will think it over though and will try to give suggestions how I think they could be improved. Until then, why not place them on the GA nominations list and wait for some really impartial reviewer to take a look at them. I actually find it much more rewarding (which is the real guilty pleasure we are yearning for editing WP, don't we) to have an article promoted by somebody I don't even know, than by solicitating praise from colleagues. There quite many involved GA reviewers who will surely take a thorough look at the article and give you some insightful suggestions there, promoting it or not - that's my experience at least.

<p><small>Okay I just read over this discussion and have come to the conclusion that I really didn't express myself very well as to why I didn't follow the GA policy. First, I saw that one article I was working on suddenly got a GA tag in the disucssion page after two years in existance. I though, well this user just added the tag, coming to the conclusion that user just come by a good article and add the GA tag if they think its appropriate. I didn't know about the nominations process until you told me, and by then I was used to just tagging my own articlea unwilling to wait for another user to do so. In other words, your the first one to tell me of the nominations process. Just so you know the whole story.

<p><small>We are sorry you did not like the article on the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_MKS_7136.html" title="Lincoln MKS">Lincoln MKS</a> because of "excessive speculation" and that it seems to "argue a point rather than inform the user". I beg to differ - all the material was extracted from the Ford Press Releases on the subject, and is properly cited with references to authoritative sites. Readers are warned that the article represents a "future automobile" that is subject to change as production nears. Your additional warning banner smacks of a "drive-by" vandalism edit with a hidden agenda, and even if well intended, has the effect of shooting down an actually informative article about an upcoming car. Where are the constructive critical examples of violations? Did you read the Ford Press Releases, or check the references? Or did you assume we all just made it all up out of thin air? We find your tone insulting and demeaning. If you are going to be consistent, and true to your own "wikipedia does not cover future" thesis, then you must add the same self-made banner to all the articles about all upcoming and future vehicles, including the unreleased 2007 models, and all upcoming events: movie releases, political events, etc. Your work is cut out for you. Thanks for your suggestions though, and we will look for the flaws you claimed and try to fix them. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 12:33, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>Hi, I've been trying to build up the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Template%7EMitsubishi_Motors_vehicles_38a2.html" title="Template:Mitsubishi Motors vehicles">Mitsubishi template</a> for a while now, and while I think the content is OK, I'm not nuts on the very bland, Wikipedian style of it. I was very impressed with the Lancia template when you "unveiled" it, as it was exactly the style I'd been aiming for. However, after <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s">User:Ed g2s</a> had his <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Automobiles_Archive_3_53d7.html#Template_images_removed" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Automobiles/Archive 3">logo purge</a> in April, I was wondering - has this template "sneaked under his radar", or have you had any official confirmation that a photo of a logo (especially one where the logo isn't presented at the "correct angle") is OK?

<dd><small>Actually, I came accross this photo at the Italian Wikipedia and this was my inspiration to create a whole template around it. If you'd click on it, you'd see it's actually a free (GNU-licensed) photo of a Lancia, or more specifically it's grille fragment featuring the logo. Which is why I believe there is no reason why it can't be used and it hasn't attracted any hostile actions (yet&#160;:D ). The photo is of absolutely superb artistic quality, and it also includes the tones which are what Lancia uses currently in its marketing, and I used as background colors. I also tried to replicate the Lancia logotype with a serifed font.</small></dd>
<dd><small>So, what you need is basically a super photo of the Diamond Star and a great idea for a layout inspired by Mitsu's marketing&#160;:D One fellow WikiProject member already tried this with VW, and this is not that easy, unfortunately... But do try, it's certainly worth it, I believe creating the Lancia template was one of the most satisfying things I ever did on WP!

<p><small>The Tagora article is improved, but still needs work on copyediting. The reason I don't go through and fix everything myself is simply that I don't have time to do that for every article I review. The majority of articles brought to FAC need copyediting; if FAC reviewers had to copyedit each of them, it would be impossible to keep up with the nominations. Ask around; there might be a good copyeditor at a related wikiproject who has time to work on the article. Oh, and what I meant about the citations was not that the changes you made weren't good, but rather that you should make sure that the footnotes I didn't check are also good--which you may have already done, and if so, great. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 03:12, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>Hi Eurosong, I'll reply here as I don't want this discussion to sprawl over too many pages as it often is the case. What I think should be done is Mfo should be reported to some admins for his repeated breaching of WP rules, and it is quite apparent he knows he does wrong.

<p><small>Dear Bravada, I am seeking your advice and input regarding the article <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurovision_Song_Contest_3be1.html" title="Eurovision Song Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>. I nominated it as a Featured Article, but it failed - <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Eurovision_Song_Contest_5be7.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Eurovision Song Contest">see the page here</a>. Many of the objections arose because there were not enough sources, or they were not properly cited.</small></p>
<p><small>I have now gone through the article thoroughly, and along with a few tweaks here and there, I have added many more references. I even bought a hard-copy book in order to ensure that some facts had been published, before citing it as a source.</small></p>
<p><small>Now I would like to ask you a favour, as one of the people who objected to the original nomination. Could you please take another look at the article, and let me know if, in your opinion, it looks better - and now up to Featured standard with regards to source citations? I do realise that most of the sources are online ones: unfortunately there has been surprisingly little published in hard-copy about the history of the Eurovision Song Contest, and most of the information that I know myself comes from having simply lived and breathed Eurovision for the past 14 years - attending the Contests, and experiencing the events, stories and rule changes as they have happened. If I could get more "hard copy" to verify this then I would, but it doesn't seem to be out there. It is, however, online. Therefore I have formatted all my web citation templates as best I can.</small></p>
<p><small>With regards to many of the criticisms which you mentioned and changes you proposed in the FA discussion, as you can see I have taken much of your advice on board: thank you for that.. I do value other people's input. However there are some things I have not changed, because I disagree with them - and these things are not formal WP guidance as to how articles should be; they're just matters of prererence (for example your suggestion of moving "criticism" into the "voting" section). Anyway...</small></p>
<p><small>I am seeking to re-nominate this as a FA. However, before I do so I would value your input, as a former objector.

<dd><small>Hi Chris, thanks for all the nice words! I am happy that you found my review of some assistance. Keeping the article and the PR on my watchlist I am seeing all the improvements you are constantly making. However, the whole PR has now grown to considerable size and I just need to be able to put away a bit more time to be able to go through it thoroughly once again - which obviously isn't that easy, especially given all the backlog I have both concerning WP and other stuff (sometimes referred to as real life).

<dd><small>Hi.. I see you left a message on the talk page of the Eurovision article. Are you back from Köln? Hope you had a nice time&#160;:) So... yes, I made a lot of changes, after your useful suggestions in the Peer Review. I addressed all the points which were addressable: the issues you raised which I did not address were things which I considered to be just the way you would have laid out the article if you had been the major writer - for example the issue about the Contest's expansion, when you suggested that the information should be moved elsewhere. I responded by saying that I disagreed, as the expansion is a major theme of the Contest, and needs its own section to highlight the changes. But anyway... I believe I have addressed everything possible, which might serve as a barrier to a successful FA nomination. Before I re-submit it, I shall myself go over every word of the article with a fine-tooth comb just to make sure that everything reads as it should. <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewis_R_f8db.html" title="User:Lewis R">Lewis R</a> recently improved a few sentences here and there, which is good.

<dd><small>P.S. I agree with your comment on the talk page about perceptions of the Contest in different countries. It would be extremely difficult to find well-written, objective, NPOV references which describe the different attitudes towards the Contest. Practically everything I have ever seen on the matter is polarised, either in fan magazines which blindly love the competition, or in the British media where it is trashed with no factual basis. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 22:59, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>I tend to reply on my own page, but I'll reply here since it's more useful to do so:<br /></small></p>
<p><small>There's no reason to assume that <i>all</i> the entries will remain as "permastubs". Just because I don't happen to know that this song was later covered by a particularly legendary Japanese singer or that melody would turn up in another country selling aftershave two years later doesn't mean that <i>nobody</i> knows it. For example, you're a Poland-based editor, so I daresay you'd know more about the Polish entries than I ever will for the simple fact that I don't speak much in the way of Polish. As I see it, what I'm doing is doing the groundwork for others to jump on after me - I'm not one of those people who claims "ownership" of an article beyond a general feeling that I don't like seeing my work vandalised - so I fully expect that over time there'll be a great many stubs converted into fully-fledged articles. Obviously not all of them will be, but that's the mechanics of the thing.<br />
Where lyrics are concerned, you're right that I'm trusting to the Thrush (or my own German, where applicable). Again, as with the general information, someone who speaks Estonian is welcome to explain what "Nagu Merelaine" really is all about, but until they do, it serves as a useful summary. That said, I think we can both agree that one of the great joys of the ESC is that most lyrics call a spade a spade - there aren't any Dylanesque metaphors to deconstruct.<br />
The idea of combining the less notable ones as you've suggested could well be viable, but there are two main caveats I can see:</small></p>
<ul>
<li><small>Some of those pages themselves are looking suspiciously like duplicates of the pages of the artists who won the national finals in question. That's obviously something which can be worked on over time, but at the moment they look like that.</small></li>
<li><small>As I said earlier in relation to the permastubs, it's not going to be too easy to decide offhand what is and isn't notable. Even getting a Belgian to adjudicate notability on the Belgian entries and so on would be a bit of an issue, as the notability may well come from the song's life outside the relevant country ("Volare", for example).</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>That said, I do take your comments and to a greater or lesser extent I see your points. What I'd suggest, though, is that we don't do anything too hastily just at the moment. There'll be time enough to merge articles together once they're all there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 13:18, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Ok, dear, I've examined the discussion in question, and I think I get the picture now. I'll give you my humble opinion, tho keep in mind that it's just that: my own personal impression and my modest advice. I don't think I have an extensive experience in Wiki policies (tho I sincerely thank you for your kind words!&#160;;) and that all I can offer you is my grasp as someone who likes to read the discussions and try and reach an acceptable and NPOV agreement.</dd>
<dd>The way I see it, there's merit in your appreciation that the mere term "flop" has an inherent personal judgement and its limits cannot be clearly precised in an encyclopedic fashion. On the other hand, the list itself is useful, and although calling a commercial failure "flop" may be questionable, there doubtlessly is a big number of models which have not met its sales expectations. This is one of those cases where a solution can be reached without much consequence and trauma, as long as everyone involved is willing to discuss and reach an agreement, imho. The longer this discussion goes, the worse the personal arguments will get, and trust me, that's useless. I believe Rogerd and Vegaswikian have provided the best solution: since the commercial failure of many automobiles deserve an article; and, since the term "flop" can be considered inherently POV (as you correctly point out, again imho), the best solution is simply to rephrase the name of this list into truly neutral wording; something like, i.e., List of automobiles that were commercial failures. I also understand your concern regarding the contents of the list itself; and yes, tho some models may be doubtless failures, there will always be gray areas when it comes to such issues - it is inevitable. I'd recommend to keep an eye on the list and request for proper sourcing using the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} template where needed; it is very common, hun. But trust me, the worst you can do is entangle in personal appreciations, so it's best to try to enforce NPOV in the most open way - we all tend to be more receptive if we add a little kindness to the discussion... again, my own 2 cents!</dd>
<dd>Words to the wise, my dear Bravada, I praise your courage in being bold and posting this for AfD; but if you ask me, I would have tried to discuss it previously with the regular editors of this article at its talk page. I have seen one too many bitter arguments over articles that have been proposed for deletion, disputes that could have been easily and quickly solved through better communication. Still, I believe this case will reach an acceptable conclusion easily, so please, don't worry nor blame yourself over this - I repeat, there "is" merit in your reasoning, and if this episodes helps you to guide yourself in similar situations in the future, then its purpose will be accomplished. Hope this helps you, hun, and if you ever need my help, you know where to find me, right?&#160;;) Take good care, and big hugs! <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedriel_2584.html" title="User:Phaedriel"><b><font color="#00BB00">Phædriel</font></b></a> <b><font color="#FF0000">♥</font></b> <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel"><b><small><font color="#22AA00">tell me</font></small></b></a> - 23:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about never responding to your note on my talk page--I've been too busy to edit lately--but I just wanted to congratulate you on the Tagora article getting featured, and to note that the copyedit by <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant">Kierant</a> got it to right where it needs to be in terms of prose quality (I wish I'd noticed in time to withdraw my objection). Thanks for stepping up and sheperding the article through the process; it isn't an easy job, but you handled it well. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 15:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. You wrote, "I guess the EU thing would add confusion, but it's important to note that DCX is headquartered in BOTH Germany and USA - if you REALLY need to have those designations anyway..."</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. Question with DCX. I was under the impression that DCX, even though having a "dual-headquarters" was actually for all intents and purposes incorporated and legally based in Germany. Actually, I think a lot of the Germany/USA stuff goes back to the publicity blitz that DCX tried to use to make it look more of a merger than as an acquisition. That is why I just listed it from Germany, because it is actually the real truth behind the matter.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, I saw similar designations used before, so I used them here to quickly give the user an idea of where the Top 15 companies are from. Maybe it would be better to go ahead and spell out the countries. Do you have a strong opinion either way on having or not having those labels? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.105.105.111 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.105.105.111_b1e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.105.105.111">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>First and foremost, I would like to encourage you to log in - that way, you make sure everybody recognizes your edits as done by a single, registered user, and you will not be accused of possible vandalisms and such done by other users from the same IP. Moreover, you will be able to sign your comments in talkpages and in general it's much easier to work within the Wiki community with a fixed login. It takes about 15 seconds to establish a login and then you do not even have to log in everytime, provided you are using the same computer.</dd>
<dd>As concerns the country issue, I have seen that in auto catalogues and such, whose roots go back to times when the auto industry looked so much different than today. In the days when major automakers are much more of global companies than national ones, it is a bit irrelevant, if you'd ask me. IIRC, e.g. Honda manufactures more vehicles and probably does more turnover in the USA (or America in general) than in Japan.</dd>
<dd>The "EU" thing - I think it's fairly obvious that given countries are members of the EU to the general readers, and for those who don't know, it's not that relevant anyway. It also creates confusion as to what that means - now it more or less indicates where the company is headquartered, but if you add the EU comment, does that mean that the company is also headquartered in another EU countries, onlyoperates within the EU or what? Just as well one might describe GM as USA (NAFTA).</dd>
<dd>DCX - whatever the propaganda Kirk Kerkorian fuelled to make some cash in his "palimony suit" said, DCX is actually headquartered in both Stuttgart in Auburn Hills. They always indicate so in official documents. I believe they are incorporated in Germany, as you can't probably have a company incorporated in two countries at a time, but I think that Chrysler Group is actually still incorporated in the US in that form or another. Whatever one might want to believe concerning the "merger" thing, the company actually DOES operate like it had two separate headquarters, much like Renault/Nissan, despite the fact that the latter two are still separate entities by law.

<dd>Sorry to hear that you have a problem - hope all blows over soon. No, I didn't want you to upload, it's just that some people have in the past, so I permitted it - but added that I didn't want to lose them from english WP (last time someone did it, they removed them from english WP!). Not dimwitted at all - I was not giving the full picture. Thanks for the tip on how to upload quickly to Commons - that's very helpful and makes it worthwhile that I approached you. Ref. air conditioning, I did put a request out, for someone to write it (not my area of interest or expertise).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_Archive1_83fc.html" title="Edit section: Brazillian cars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brazillian cars</span></h2>
<p>Hello again Bravada. The <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel_Tigra_46ea.html" title="Opel Tigra">Opel Tigra</a> was sold in Brazil simply as Tigra. The front emblem was changed from the Opel to the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet.html" title="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a>'s which is the GM brand for Brazil (or Latin America, I don´t know). They are the same car. The Opel Tigra article should clarify that (I'll check it). In Brazil the fuel injection was remapped to drop the 110 cv engine to 99 cv due to taxing law (cars under 100cv paid less taxes, so it could be sold with a greater profit margin or lower price or both). The 15' wheels were also exchanged for 14' wheels to lower maintenence price since Brazilian roads tend to <i>destroy</i> tires faster and 15' replacement tires are more expensive than 14's. Here we use the brand names GM and Chevrolet interchangeably, there are no clear distinction among them. Opel is less known because it is from Europe, but I think it would also be used interchangeably if it was more common around here. The Opel/Chevrolet Tigra was imported from mid 1998's until early 1999's. The Dolar was almost paralallel with the Real and U$ 1,00 was worth aproximately R$ 1,29. This valorization of Real was maintained with government intervention and since it wasn´t an actual valorization the government had to drop it's messing witht the financial market so by 1999 the Dolar suddenly (but not unexpecting) reached the value of R$ 3,50 or so. So suddenly the Tigra, which was imported from GM/Chevrolet and not manufactured here suddenly cost more than 2,5 times it´s intented price, so Chevrolet ceased importing it. I was one of the lucky to get my hands on a Tigra and only recently parted ways with it. I now own a <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fiat_Marea_9eeb.html" title="Fiat Marea">Fiat Marea</a> but I will be buying a Chevrolet <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opel_Astra_dba7.html" title="Opel Astra">Opel Astra</a>, which here in Brazil isn´t yet the last Astra model. In fact I don´t know it the Astra sold here is exclusive for Brazilian market. The front is clearly different from the 1998's Astra B, the rear is also slightly changed as also are the tailights. The interior is also a litle changed. So I don´t know how to categorize the current Brazilian Astra in European classification (the brazilian Vectra is also not the actual Vectra. It was a brazilian designf over the Astra platform, with a front very similar to the current European Astra and a unique rear, very, very beutiful.) See pictures from the current Brazilian Astra <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com.br/astra/index.shtm" class="external text" title="http://www.chevrolet.com.br/astra/index.shtm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>Answers to your questions on my talk page:
<dl>
<dd><i>I understand all Opel and Opel-based cars, both imported and locally made, are branded as Chevrolet in Brazil, and the Opel brand is never used in official marketing, right?</i>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you´re right. Opel brand is never used. The emblems, car manuals, all are changed to reflect the chevrolet brand and emblems.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>I understand that Chevrolet models are also referred to as "GM" in Brazil, e.g. "GM Astra" and the like - this would explain the propensity of some editors to generate articles such as <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_Astra_da2e.html" title="General Motors Astra">General Motors Astra</a>, which looks absolutely atrocious to users from Europe or North America. Is the "GM" naming only used only in common parlance, or officially too (marketing, press release, technical literature)?</i>
<dl>
<dd>GM is only used in common parlance. Officially and "marketly" all cars are from the Chevrolet brand. But there is another catch: It´s not the Chevrolet Astra. Here we know it only as Astra. You never say, "I´m going to buy a Chevrolet Astra", instead you said "I´m goind to buy an Astra, or a Marea". I´ve also took the liberty of correcting the General Motors Astra issue. It now redirects to Opel Astra and I did moved the contents and the discussion. The history tough are only on the old General Motors Astra article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>I am quite interested in Latin American cars, so I know about the Brazilian Astra and Vectra - I would say the Brazilian Astra can be classified, despite modifications, as Astra B/G, while the Vectra is a sedan version of the Astra C/H. Anyway, I believe the differences between the Brazilian and European models should be explained in respective articles.</i>
<dl>
<dd>I will see what I could do to help.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>In general, I think the division of GM models between articles should be sorted out - I will raise the issue on the WikiProject talk page. Stay tuned&#160;;)</i>

<p>The Maxima is a mid-sized vehicle, always has been, always will be. Never was an executive vehicle. So stop trying to add it as such. Also, the '{{world}}' tag is unnecessary because the problem HAS been addressed and solved.

<p>Oh, and just so we're clear, I will reiterate for you - the term "executive car" is used "generally to describe a passenger car larger than a large family car" as defined. It also mentions "Equivalently sized cars in North America are usually called mid-size cars", and gives the example of a luxury (or executive) sedan as the 2002 Lincoln Town Car... a full-size, luxury car. It also mentions "there are certain guidelines by which the luxury cars are defined. Currently, that means its Mean Selling Price (MSP) is in excess of roughly US$36,000 or higher" (which the Maxima is not, nor never was). And also, it mentions "Mainstrean Japanese manufacturers (like Honda, Nissan and Toyota) sell slightly more expensive cars than European manufactueres (Opel, Peugeot, Renault) but are considered in the same category as them." Thus, the Maxima is a MID-SIZED car, NOT an 'executive' car. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 19:18, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it does not answer my concerns. The <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infiniti.html" title="Infiniti">Infiniti</a> line was released to be executive class. One statement I found says "In the past, Nissan did not have any strong products to compete in the executive sedan segment, which is dominated by Mercedes E-class and BMW 5-Series." The Maxima is not in the same category as those two. "In Japan, Nissan used to have Gloria and Cedric to please conservative businessmen. That's why Ghosn decided to build a new executive car for the global market." (The <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infiniti_M_9149.html" title="Infiniti M">Infiniti M</a>, which IS an executive car). "Compared with Audi A6, BMW 5-Series, Mercedes E-class and Lexus GS, the Nissan executive car looks relatively conservative." But since the definition goes as being in the UK, then I see it's validity... especially in light of not having it be biased. If any of the articles need tweaking or rewriting, we can do so to expand on more world-wide models. However, it mentions the histories in Japan, the UK, Australia, etc. - thus, the tag is unnecessary. <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 19:49, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The English equivalent of "Ober Mittelklasse" is "upper middle class", not "executive". I think this is getting twisted around due to semantics. You mentioned that the definition states "Cars in Europe's equivalent category to North America's mid-size are generally known as large family cars or executive cars" but that is contradictary in itself, since the executive car definition states that it is "a passenger car larger than a large family car". <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 20:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
