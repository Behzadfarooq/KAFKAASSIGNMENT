<p>Thought this might be considered ancectodal evidence, I must say that I drive, on a daily basis, a vehicle equiped with hydraulically-actuated, four-wheel drum brakes, of the dual-servo, self-adjusting type. Since re-shoeing all four wheels several thousands of miles ago, I have, in a wide variety of braking conditions, experienced no brake fade. Could it be the modern linings?</p>
<p>I also wish to point out that the brakes lack power assist, which the servo action seem to make up for, and, that braking control driving on ice and snow was much better than what I have experienced on ABS and non-ABS power-assist front disc/rear drum equiped vehicles.-WK-139.78.96.115 01:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope you can accept what I have done to your "brake fade" page. Having worked on disk brake development and working with tribology (friction and wear) I came across the items I mention in the rework of that article. The gas bearing and drum expansion are things mechanics, not engineers, cooked up and it is obvious because servo effect is not part of their technical understanding. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 06:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, no. Your rewrite is either original research or simply unsourced. It is counter to the sources presented. For example, you state that only drum brakes suffer fade?

<p>I think you should re-read what I wrote and tell me what part you don't understand. The article as it was is based on myth and lore, that you cite from a popular magazine. That is not a valid citation, only a repetition of what you have repeated. I explain why the gas bearing hypothesis is false and defies all reason. Having worked on disk brakes in high performance cars from the outset of disk brakes I can explain how this works and did so. If anythinng, you should show proof that expanding drums and gas-bearing exist. As I mentioned, disks operate at red hot temperatures, ones that gas bearing drums never did, using similar friction material. You should also consider why drums were discontinued when friction materials that cannot out-gas have been designed. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 03:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>That you restored the old version seems to indicate that you believe it is correct. I suggest that you give proof that drum expanding or gas bearing causes brake fade. The references listed are not technical support for this physically impossible hypothesis. If you are skilled in the design of brakes you shoudl recognize what the downfall of drum brakes is and why we no longer have brake fade.

<p>To make the point that you are repeating auto lore, I have asked for references on a few of your unsupported claims. Alternately you could explain how these things occur and their cause instead, but you do neither. Especially the gas bearing item needs explanation or proof, that being a lot of gas with no apparent source. Remeber, after cooling, faded brake pads show no sign of having lost gas or otherwise changed permanently. In fact, they will do it again if put to the test.</p>
<p>Please give what I wrote some thought. Also your talk of high performance equipment has nothing to do with the causes and remedies of drum brake fade. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 05:04, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Question. Are those claims that you object to not sourced by the materials presented? Are you saying that the sources mentioned in the article are wrong and those sources are simply repeating misconceptions or lore, as you call it? Thanks.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As you see, <i><b>justanother</b></i>, the anonymouse author of this piece, shows no reasonable explanation for the effect of brake drum expansion causing fade, the <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion.html" title="Coefficient of thermal expansion">Coefficient of thermal expansion</a> being vanishingly small in comparison to normal ovalization of drums by braking forces. The gas bearing scenario cannot be found in Dunlop, Girling, Lockheed or any other brake manufacturer's literature. It is folklore. The volume of gas required for such an effect cannot come from friction material, once or repeatedly, brake fade occcurring again as easily as the first time. The citations listed are auto enthusiat magazines, neither of which explain what these gases are and how they keep coming out of brake pads that were originally formed at high temperature in manufacture.</p>
<p><b>Brake fade is unique to drum brakes</b> because they use self servo action (leading brake shoes) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_brake#servo_design" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_brake#servo_design" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] whose servo effect relys on the proper friction coefficient, one that reduces at elevated temperatures. I request that <i><b>justanother</b></i> cease deleting my re-write of this article and not continue purvey myth and lore.

<p>justanother, I beg to differ. Having worked in the disk brake business I am aware that these folklore stories of gas are some sort of widely believed <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cargo_cult.html" title="Cargo cult">cargo cult</a>, even though there is no credible explanation, nor any analysis of its existence. You won't find a technical source for proof of the gas bearing or brake drum expansion theory. On top of that, not much is being written on drum brakes these days, except the repition of the gas theory. Please review what I wrote and the proof I gave about drum brakes operating in a narrow friction coefficient between lock-up and fade. How does the gas hypothesis explain drum brakes locking? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 20:07, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

That your article is backed up mainly by another's repetition of drum brake lore does not seem to stike you as odd. That citation contains no explanation of what causes fade, only that it is caused by thermal expansion and gas generation, both of which have not been shown to exist. This is a hypothesis from brake mechanics, not an engineering staff at a major brake manufacturer. Repeating it from auto magazines does not make it credible. We don't need Wiki's to repeat such stories when you can get that from the man on the street.<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 03:37, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jobst, you are mocking me when I am going out of my way to be helpful. This is not "my article". If you check the history then you will see that I mostly cleaned it up and clarified somewhat based on sources. The bit on drum brakes was already in there and I left it. I also left the fact tag that you put on it. I added a "drum brake" section for you to add correctly sourced material. Regarding what you consider incorrect material, if it has a good source then it stays unless you can provide alternate sourcing. Any published article is considered a good source. Rather than fight with me (I am not your opponent), just learn the rules here and have fun! If you have a question about how the rules work then feel free to ask me on my talk page. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 14:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I guess a source from 1959 is better than no source at all. Now, instead of rudely destroying the work of other editors, please use the section on "Drum Brakes" to explain, with sources, how the servo effect contributes to fade. That would be great! Your source only mentions it with no explanation. Note also the below from your source which seems to be something that you disagree with?
<blockquote>
<p>As the brakes get hot the drums expand away from the shoes and the pedal travel increases. The friction coefficient of the hot linings drops and finally the brakes fade.</p>
</blockquote>
I am restoring your destructive edit again. Please contribute sourced material instead of removing sourced material that you disagree with. Disk brake fade is a reality. The 1959 reference had it wrong but can be forgiven for that.

<dd>As I said, I did not invent this article and I am not invested in it all being "correct", as-is. Looking at what I could find on the net, I agree with you the the self-energizing design of leading-shoe drum brakes is a major source of fade in drum brakes. Since such brakes rely on a "force multiplier", as it were, of friction leading to more friction then they would be very sensitive to any drop in friction co-efficient. This should be added to the article along with mention of twin trailing shoe designs to reduce fade. I would rather that you wrote that section and I, for one, would not be a stickler for sources at this time (they should show up at some point). But I want to stress that you are part of a team and should not tear apart the work of others without very good cause and discussion here if anyone objects. I would really rather that you became the good contributor that I think you can be rather than someone that tried and got in trouble over here. I am not trying to be patronizing or condescending; I am trying to be helpful.

<p>Whether it is <b>your</b> article or not, you seem to be its sole defender and thereby assume authorship. Bluntly, it is erroneous and false. Apparently you didn't read the referenced study in which among other findings the following is mentioned:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Another attempt to beat fade is the two-trailing shoe brake. It needs servo assistance, but it is much less liable to fade than brakes such as the two leading shoe type which depend heavily on a self-servo effect for their efficiency."<br />
<br /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Finally, the disc has no self-servo effect, so it gives a stable and consistent action free from fade, whether hot or cold. It will go on working even when the disc is glowing red with heat."<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>By reinstating your brake folklore article you ignore logical explanations that should have dissuaded you from the belief in the drum expansion and gas bearing hypotheses, neither of which are physically possible. Editing and elaborating on these fables does the readers of Wiki a disservice. This is not a forum for myth and lore. You have shown no explanation how drum expansion and gas bearing cause fade or that they do so. What I wrote, as well as in the reference citiation from a scientific journal explains how the servo effect of drum brakes causes brake fade.</p>
<p>Is there no one else reading thse pages with comments on the subject? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 20:49, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jobst, your reference is hardly a "study". It appears to be an article written in 1959 by a junior or senior is a university dairy program. So now, rather than work together to improve the article, you are putting it up for deletion? All due respect, but if that is your best effort at working with others, well, OK then. I guess we won't be working together to improve the article. I am not "defending" the article against "the truth", I am simply trying to get a disruptive editor, you, to make necessary adjustments to his style of "editing". Do you think I have any hope of succeeding? I am, needless to say, removing the "prod". Your next step if you want to pursue deletion is called <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>.

You say you are not the author but you expanded the article to have more sections, mostly not about brake fade and its cause. Since the introduction of disk brakes, more than 30 years ago, fade has no longer been a concern to drivers, making the other parts of the article irrelevant.</p>

<dd><b>Girls, drum brakes are still used on the rear of light trucks &amp; SUV's; and (all but) exclusively on medium &amp; heavy duty trucks.

<p>"Brake fade - There are many types and causes of braking fade. Fade may result, for example, from a reduction in friction between linings and drums caused by exposure to water. Most typically, however, fade involves a reduction in braking force experienced when dragging brakes on a long grade. If brakes are maladjusted, and overheated drum may expand to the degree that push rod travel is insufficient to fully actuate the brakes. This is one example of mechanical fade, which also may result from various mechanical defects (e.g., scored drums) within the foundation brake system. In contrast, heat fade occurs when linings overheat and become less aggressive. Gradual and predictable fade is desirable as a warning."<a href="http://www.roadranger.com/ecm/groups/public/@pub/@roadranger/documents/content/rr_axag-0300.pdf?bcsi_scan_4084C5AB3DBD951A=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=rr_axag-0300.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadranger.com/ecm/groups/public/@pub/@roadranger/documents/content/rr_axag-0300.pdf?bcsi_scan_4084C5AB3DBD951A=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=rr_axag-0300.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>"At Bendix Spicer Foundation Brake, we developed the metallurgy in our 17-inch rotor and paired it with our advanced friction material specifically designed to optimize friction performance at high temperatures, thus significantly reducing brake fade and maximizing brake pad and rotor life. As a result, there is virtually no degradation in stopping power when brake temperatures rise under heavy use."<a href="http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/brakes/airdiscbrakes/98035776" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/brakes/airdiscbrakes/98035776" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Justanother, you suggest:<br />
"Jobst, that is a great reference and I wish that you would use it to improve the article rather than to abuse the process here. It is clear from the article that friction fade is a factor on disk brakes and that Bendix has claimed to made a breakthrough to reduce it. Good for them! The issue of fluid fade is not addressed because Bendix is not selling brake fluid in that ad. --Justanother 13:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Thanks, but how do I merge this with the current article, there being a conflict about the definition of fade and its cause. As I mentioned in my article, friction coefficient is affected by temperature, a change that is magnified by servo action of drum brakes, the bane of vehicles descending steep roads. I believe that loss of hydraulic stiffness between pedal and brake pad should not be called fade. Power assist brakes bridged most of that effect. Fade, as I see it, occurs at the friction interface. As Bendix mentions: "Virtually no brake fade and no degradation in stopping power." is not the fade phenomenon of drum brakes, but a reduction in brake response that is effectively imperceptible. As mentioned, disks work well even at glowing temperatures.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this discussion, the concept of thermally expanding drums and gas bearing was what I believe should not be endorsed in Wikipedia. What I wrote addressed those issues so how do I get my text together with yours without apparent contradiction? I would like to submit what I currently have so you can indicate which parts you believe need modification. I find appending it to the current Brake fade page illogical. I also believe that brake fluid effects should appear under a separate heading of mechanical brake degradation as Bendix does, because otherwise it clouds the issue of resolving what makes drum brakes (friction) fade prone.<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 18:46, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jobst: How do you justify this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fade was commonly attributed to thermal brake drum expansion, reducing brake shoe contact with the drum. This ignores how little expansion a hot drum experiences, (about 0.024 inch for a 400°F temperature rise) far less than normal deformation caused by brake shoe pressure.</p>

<dd>This is false: The deflection of the very rigid cast iron drum is minimal compared to the mild steel of the web and table of the brake shoe, which is quite flexible.

<p>I found interesting that there was no truck drum-brake fade mentioned in these papers although they measured fade of brake materials.

<p>I don't see anything in the Bendix page contradicting what I wrote, consdering that the drum expansion that I chose at glowing hot temperatures giving 0.012" per shoe is insignificant in comparison to drum ovalization under hard braking. We may be putting the cart before the horse in requireing citations for everything stateded. If that were necessary there would be no text and only links to other places. I believe that only if the item is not reasonably credible other justification needs to be cited. Do you believe 0.012" is enough to prevent brake pads from making contact? You are probably aware that unless the contact area is severely compromized, applied force and friction coefficient, independent of contact area, give the drag force? Such considerations need to occur when reading descriptions, otherwise an entire high school physics book would need to be referenced, not to mention higher mathematics and college physics. I believe there is no comflict between Bendix and "Fade in drum brakes" because the "push rod" mentioned is found only on truck air brakes. I also don't believe this Bendix brake is intended for tandem dual axles but mainly for front truck axles judging from the size of its lug bolts.<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 06:01, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<b>Comments</b></p>
<p>I am unclear on what "Oppose" and "Support" mean. I am opposed to deleting the sections but I support verifying that gas bearing or drum expansion are causes of brake failure. There has been no technical explanation of these phenomena. People not in the brake design business have repeated them so often that proof by repetition seems to have been achieved. I referenced thermal expansion coefficient and its effect and pointed out that enough gas to float brake shoes is inpossible to generate repeatedly from friction material that shows no material change between incedents of fade and no loss of performance when cooled. Effects of self servo are found in mechanical and electical journals apenty and that the drum brake relies on this to function. My reference to the Michigan University article links servo to the problem unambiguously. Unfortunately there are so few cars with drum brakes that we no longer experience this. Disks have been here so long that no one publishes drum brake research today. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 23:01, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was referring to text that I wrote, not text in other sections of the Brake fade piece. However, I find the two paragraphs before "Fade in drum brakes" misleading and in need of rewrite. When I did that originally, it lead to this bruhaha. The piece overlooked the basic weakness of internally expandig shoe drum brakes, which is at the core of what is commonly known as brake fade, or drum brake failure from loss of servo effect.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Working my way upwards (since it's late at night), the cause of drum brake fade is NOT the loss of servo effect: If this were true, then fixed anchor drum brakes (such as the FMSI part# 501 on the Ford Tempo or 583 on the Taurus/Sable) would not suffer from fade; nor would heavy trucks using the 4311 (Eaton), 4515T (Timken) or 4515F (Fruehauf) cam brake assemblies, nor the 4602 wedge brake assembly, also all with fixed anchors. Instead, it is caused by the friction coefficient curve (friction vs temp curve) reaching the kneepoint where phenolic resin breakdown starts to occur. Please see my entry below.

<p>That makes the rest of the article a bit confusing, because it relies on the unsubstantiated drum expansion and gas bearing hypotheses. Unfortunately this idea has been repeated so often that it passes without challenge or technical explanation and need not be further substantiated. There is no scientific explanation for these scenarios.</p>
<p>I am aparently not able to rewrite those parts without the rewrite being erased and the original resinstated. In the discussion that ensued I was informed that it didn't matterr who is right or wrong, but that the procedures be followed.

<p>I notice that under "history:" you feel that verification is needed to prove disk brakes operate when glowing temperatures. At the moment I cannot find a picture or technical item to cite but many pictures have been in the press showing red hot brake disks on cars to adequately to prove that it occurs without brake failure.

<p>As I said, what parts of self servo is not sourced? What I find more important is the concept of drum expansion and gas bearing not held to the standards you demand.

<dd>Hi. It is possible that you need to make an adjustment to your idea of how this wikipedia works. You do not demonstrate or prove anything with explanations or calculations. All proving is done by showing sources. This is NOT about writing explanations. You can write an explanation, sure, but it must be backed up by sources. This is about sourcing. Every single idea should have a source and the source should be mentioned. If not then you can put the <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag and ask for a source. But don't discount "popular media" as sources. They are allowable. To clarify. This is unsourced
<blockquote>
<p>This ignored how little expansion drum heating causes, (about 0.024 inch for a 400°F change) far less than normal drum deformation caused by brake shoe pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
And so is this
<blockquote>
<p>they are physically impossible, considering the volume of gas required to generate a gas bearing.</p>
</blockquote>
You seem to be wanting to debunk myths there and you are not provinding sources. I am saying please incorporate the Bendix data on drum expansion leading to fade and please take a look at the sources I provided already and see what they say about gas cushion, gasified material deposition, glazing, binder melt. All issues that you do not address but that are covered in the sources I provided. I think that you just want to write this off the top of your head and without sources and that is not what we do here.--<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 03:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

Per your link red = 1400 F = 760 C.

<p>Drum brakes do not operate at the temperature you chose to calculate and cars have roughly ten inch diameter brakes. You'll note, my example took 400°F rise, your example nearly doubled that and doubled the brake diameter. The thermal expansion coefficient is 12ppm/°K. So let's get to the basics. If you believe in the expansion and gas scenario, you should give reasons for readers to believe it and give a reference that explains iut, not just repeat what common belief is. That servo is cause of drum brake failure can be deduced from what the article originally stated, that the friction coefficient decreases with temperature increase and that there is a self servo effect. You'll need to be more specific which source material you don't like. I don't know what you find amiss with my references. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 04:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are air brakes on trucks that most often lock-up leaving long dual skid marks that we see on highways because they have servo action. That drums as large as these, greater than twice the diameter of passenger car brakes, which are the ones of interest, when "maladjusted" can lose contact, does not contradict that the servo action of drum brakes is the primary cause of brake failure at high temperatures. The "maladjusted" is a major caveat in that sentence. Truck brakes in question use pneumatic diaphragms with pushrods to rotate mechanical cams that spread brake shoes against their drums and are in that way different from hudraulic car brakes. Please stop creating spurious diversions. The claim of gas bearing and brake shoes not making contact on car brakes is unsupported. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 05:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hve submitted this dispute to WP:RfC and hope to find a way of resolving the two versions on the origins of brake failure through fade in this article. As I see it, servo effect of drum brakes is the culprit, the reason why they are no longer used in passenger cars and especially racing cars.

<p>I stumbled across this thread by accident: I was chief engineer of Guaranteed Brake Parts Company, in business from 1947 to 1996; originally in north Philly, and from November 1963, Camden, NJ. Among other things, we had the largest bonding oven in the world in the Camden plant; and in in the early 1950's my Grandfather and B.F. Goodrich engineer Leon Fiedler perfected the brake lining bonding process, with the phenolic A602-B thermoset adhesive. Also, our family was heavily involved with the APRA Brake Institute, with my father (Joseph Schwartz) holding the presidency of that body in 1990-1992. As a major rebuilding operation with, at the peak, producing almost a half-million disc pads and 240,000 new and rebuilt brake shoes, we had the choice of various friction material manufacturers, such as Brassbestos, Bendix, Carlisle (truck only), Certified/Lear-Siegler, Krasne, and Nuturn (Turner &amp; Newell/Ferodo) under the Grizzly brand.</p>
<p>There are several causes to brake fade; but at this moment I need to clarify a common misconception about the Friction Material Standards Institute (FMSI) friction coefficient lettering. The codes consist of 2 letters, indicating the cold and hot friction coefficients, usually FF or FE. The misconception centers around the belief that the higher the friction letter (say, FG), the better the quality of the product. Not so: The piece of rubber used on a bicycle rim clamp brake is very high; but if it were attached to a disc pad it would burn right out!</p>
<p>Instead, what we want is a constant friction-vs-temp curve that does not have a sharp drop-off: If the curve is too steep either upwards or downwards, the result is often "grabbing" at high or (usually) low temperatures.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the temperatures can get quite hot in a braking assembly, as the brake is no more than an energy dump. One of the best illustrations of this is during NASCAR broadcasts from Martinsville, where you see the cast iron rotors glowing so red hot (my estimate from the color is as high as 1100°F) it can actually damage the bead of the tire!</p>
<p>When the brakes get very hot, with conventional phenolic resin &amp; asbestos or Kevlar in the area of 600°F one reaches the "kneepoint" of the curve, where the phenolic resin binder actually starts to break down. By the time the material reaches 850°F the resins "go exothermic," i.e. they catch fire! This is the principle involved with debonding furnaces, where once the lining catches fire, the resins in the lining decompose as does the adhesive. In fact, in our Bayco debonder furnace, which holds up to 4,000 shoes(!), the two main one million BTU gas burners shut down at 850°F and the water sprays kick on, to keep the load temperature under control to avoid warping the steel cores. One time during installation testing of the Bayco oven in 1986, we let a load of 4515 &amp; 4311 truck shoes get to 1100°F to see where the non-asbestos riveted linings would completely disintegrate, turning into powder.</p>
<p>OK, so we've established that brake fade on drum brakes and asbestos disc pads starts from the surface decomposition of the friction material starting at about 600°F. BUT! That is only one mode of brake fade!</p>
<p>Another cause of brake fade started to rear its' ugly head with the advent of metallic disc brake linings: Boiling of the brake fluid. Up until the 1970's, plain old DOT 3 brake fluid was fine for 4-wheel drum brakes, as the friction material would reach the temperature-friction kneepoint long before the brake fluid would boil. However, metallic disc pads were no longer an effective thermal insulator, instead conducting the heat through the pad, through the backing plate... And right on to the cast iron or aluminum caliper and (especially) steel piston(s), boiling the brake fluid. This led to high temperature DOT 4 and silicone-based DOT5 brake fluids, to handle the higher temps yet not boil.</p>
<p>[Alas, DOT5 brake fluids have a tendency to foam when used in anti-lock brake systems from all the "churning," causing fade at operating temperatures... But that's the subject of a whole `nuther discussion!]</p>
<p>We once diagnosed an interesting cause of brake smell (and attendant brake fade) in FoMoCo E/F-350 delivery vans in NYC: Brake balance! Turns out that the proportional valve was set to the factory specs, which put over 70% of the braking force on the front axle when the vehicle was empty. Problem was, when the trucks were (over)loaded, the rear brakes were (all but) tagging along while the front brakes were handling all the load. We solved the smell &amp; fade problem by using a lower friction front pad and a very aggressive rear brake lining originally used in truck brake blocks.</p>
<p>(More to follow in a day or two, after I dig my engineering notebooks out of my parents' basement and dust them off...)</p>

<dd>I've been out of the brake shoe and disc pad manufacturing industry since 1995; though I've stayed in touch. I'll have to dig down in the dusty shelves in my parents' basement for some of the Grizzly and Bendix TSB's (tech bulletins), especially on the NAO linings &amp; pucks. The problem is that when a customer's customer (like a rental fleet at JFK, or the Atlanta PD, or AC casino limos) would have a problem, I or my father would go out and investigate (most of the time is was installer error, like not machining the rotors when switching to NAO, i.e. just doing a "hang job); but if it was serious, an engineer from the lining manufacturer would join us... Then this information would either be fed back to the manufacturer's engineering for reformulating (like pads crumbling under excessive loads: For obvious liability reasons this would be confidential inside the friction material manufacturers, with silent changes to the formulation and/or "silent recalls" where we would swap out customer stock); or technical information would be conveyed to our W/D &amp; jobber customers, such as the E/F350 brake balance problem on overloaded city delivery vans (see above). We would call the customers who were affected; and also on occasion put a "statement stuffer" to alert all customers. Keep in mind this was all before the Web came into prevalent use (pre-1995); and this was the customary trade practice for decades. <b>Deal with it!</b> Dan Schwartz <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDiscpad_c028.html" title="User:Discpad">Discpad</a> 13:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although there are lots of words under the current discusssion heading (Article all screwed up) I see no reference to servo action of drum brakes or why motorcycles and passenger cars no longer (and Railways never could) use drum brakes. I hope those involved in editing this article can separate changes in friction coefficient, as Dan mentions, from brake failure, commonly swept under the same rug in the past. I tried to capture that in the sub-article "Why drum brakes fade" as Justanother suggested. I hope we can get the whole articel to agree at some time. You can see what I initially proposed in my first edit that got bumped for the original version. I prefer to have change in friction coefficient defined as brake fade and brake failure resulting from such chages identified as a result of drum servo action, the reason we don't use drum brakes any longer where speed control is most needed.<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobstbrandt_df5e.html" title="User:Jobstbrandt">Jobst</a> 01:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
