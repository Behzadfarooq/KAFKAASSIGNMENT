<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Dudley_Hill_6dd4.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Established just after the First World War, Dudley Hill RLFC has a very long, proud and illustrious history. The team originally played from the old Bierley estate led by <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> legend Stanley Brogden. After his top class career with Leeds, Yorkshire and Great Britain as a quality stand-off, Stanley wanted to put something back into the grassroots of Rugby League.</p>
<p>The club was disbanded prior to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. It was due to Les Brady and Vincent Heslop that the Club was reformed in 1948. Les Brady was running the very successful Bierley under eighteen team at the time.</p>
<p>Vince Heslop advertised in the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraph_%26_Argus_55a0.html" title="Telegraph &amp; Argus">Telegraph &amp; Argus</a> for players and together with players progressing from the Bierley under eighteen team, the Dudley Hill open age team was formed. Les Brady and Danny Cullerton were of great assistance during this period.</p>
<p>Funds were raised by various ways, including a football buster and a Bradford Northen Forecast.</p>
<p>The first match played was at Queensbury. Dudley Hill lost by over fifty points to nil, missing a free kick under the posts in the last few minutes. The first match that Dudley Hill won in the first season was at Prince Smith and Steels, 4 points to 8 points. One of the Dudley Hill Players broke his arm and Vinney Heslop had to stop playing to take him to hospital, as he had the only available transport (ex Army Wagon). As there was no insurance available, a collection was taken every week for injured players. Dudley Hill at the completion of that first season, finished just above Prince Smith &amp; Steels who were bottom of the league.</p>
<p>Various changing rooms were used during this period, but eventually settled down at the Imperial Hotel on Tong Street, begging buckets of water from 'mine host' for washing.</p>
<p>Eventually, thanks to Bernard Dotchin who installed a boiler and Vinnie Heslop who installed a bath, washing facilities improved. Even so, players would often use the cottage baths at the entrance to Knowles Lane Recreation Ground.</p>
<p>The changing room was above the stables, one large room with a combustion stove which used to glow red hot. After one argument between players, the opposing player made contact with the hot stove, this did nothing to cool tempers.</p>
<p>For away matches, the players usually met in town, outside 'Carters' or 'Knottons Sports Shops' and proceeded to the matches by public transport. The away matches at Queensbury and Thornton were the worst venues to travel to, both being at the top of hills which had to be climbed before the match. Home matches were played on various grounds. Two on Knowles Recreation Ground, Knowles Lane and Odsal Rec.</p>
<p>During the next few seasons with new players coming into the team from Bierley and other sources, better results were achieved and the foundations were laid to make Dudley Hill a force in Amateur Rugby League circles.</p>
<p>The Coach at this time was Frank Hodgson. Together with Bernard Dotchin, then Chairman and Roger Burnham, Frank recruited key players that were to complement the sprinkling of talented young players at the club. Among them, Ian Dickinson who was then a young 18 year old and Ian Reed.</p>
<p>Mick Oldfield became the first Dudley Hill player to play for Yorkshire in the post-war period, Vinnie Heslop was the first player to progress to Bradford Northen and R. Rudd the first international player. During the next few decades, a host of players followed Vinnie and Mick. Some ending up in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional.html" title="Professional">professional</a> ranks and some playing amateur representative football for <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford.html" title="Bradford">Bradford</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>.</p>
<p>Clifford Turnpenny and Vinny Heslop continued to be essential figures and for the next 30 years served the club with distinction. Other important figures in the early years, Bernard Dotchin and Roger Burnham, are still supporting the Hill today.</p>
<p>The formation of the British Amateur Rugby League Association (<a href="../../../b/a/r/BARLA_3d30.html" title="BARLA">BARLA</a>) in 1973 was to be the catalyst for the Hill to move forward. In that season Dudley Hill finished the old Bradford League at the bottom. As result, when the Regional Leagues were established Dudley Hill were placed in the new <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennine.html" title="Pennine">Pennine</a> <a href="../../../l/e/a/League.html" title="League">League</a> 3rd Division. The Club worked tirelessly to progress in successive years from the 3rd to the 1st division before finally reaching the Premier Division.</p>
<p>The 1973 season saw Dudley Hill start their long climb to the very pinnacle of the amateur game. Even with the improved results and stronger team, it was not until 1979 that Dudley Hill won their first winner's <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trophy.html" title="Trophy">Trophy</a>. The Bradford League Seven-a-side Competition. Hill's ambition was realised in 1986 when <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill.html" title="Hill">Hill</a> gained membership of the 10-team inaugural National League (now the National Conference league).</p>
<p>A major tragedy affected the development of the club. It has to be said that this tragedy kick-started the club and inspired key members to accelerate development in the memory of Neil Hunt. December 1976 was the month and year that Neil Hunt was to lose his life as a result of an accident on the field of play. Neil suffered a broken neck in a one-on-one tackle, a freak accident that we hope we have never to experience again. Neil was 16 years old and was making his way in what was becoming a very promising career that was tragically terminated.</p>
<p>September 1st, 1979 was the year Dudley Hill moved to the new Neil Hunt Memorial ground, the current pitch was dedicated to the memory of Neil by St Johns Vicar the Reverend Mr. J Fry. In December 2001, it will be re-dedicated in a ceremony to remember Neil Hunt 25 years on.</p>
<p>Along the way from 1979 until 1992 Dudley Hill won every trophy available to them at local, Regional and National Level. During the period 1984 to 1992 they were at the very top of the amateur game.</p>
<p>In December 2001 Dudley Hill celebrated 25 years of the clubs history, and many successes both on and off the field. On the field the club has achieved success in all the games major competitions, pride of place goes indeed to the successful years around the 1980`s when the Hill were to win very trophy available to them in a purple period for the club from 1984 until 1986 wining the BARLA National Cup, BARLA Yorkshire Cup, BARLA National Sevens, Pennine League Premier Division, Pennine Cup, Bradford Cup 3 times running as well as numerous Sevens titles.</p>
<p>1993 saw the Hill be instrumental in establishing the new National Conference League along with the inaugural other 11 teams that made up the very premier division. In 1990 Dudley Hill won the National League title under the Coaching of Peter Roe and Kelvin Lockett. In 1991 Dudley Hill under the coaching of Kelvin Lockett also finished up a very credible runners-up in the BARLA National Cup final in Salford. A tragic car accident followed at the start of the following season when several members of the first team squad were involved in a serious accident on the way to a social event in Whitley Bay which resulted in two of the stars of the 1991 Cup Final runners up, Stuart Tighe and Paul Baxter were to receive serious injuries Stuart Tighe a current U21 International losing his leg.</p>
<p>The success of the Youth &amp; Junior levels was the catalyst for the formation of a Youth &amp; Junior development programme. The programme is the envy of all Yorkshire developing teams at every age group. 1987 saw the formation of a Women's team who were inaugural members of the fledgling first Women's League.</p>
<p>1993 saw the fulfilment of a dream for Dudley Hill with floodlights, new dressing rooms, and an extension and refurbishment of the clubhouse. This was made possible by an arts and sports council grant of £75,000. The work was lead by Fred Berry who saw the dream through on time for the commencement of the 1993-94 season when the improvements were opened by the Lord Mayor of Bradford, Councillor Bob Sowman.</p>
