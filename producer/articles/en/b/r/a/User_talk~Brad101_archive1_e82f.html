<dd>Ok, thanks. I wasn't sure. I thought it would be better to leave them there for awhile to show people there's some progress. At some point there was a big momentum going on.

<p>Hey Brad, Love your work so far on the Mojo page... Do you live in the Detroit area and what would I have to do to talk you into hooking me up with copies of any of his shows that you've got around? 1 or 100, I don't care... I've moved so many times in the last 20+ years that all I have left are a handful from '97 when he was on 105.9 and 1, maybe two from WMXD. Let's make a deal, thanks. dj detroit butcher 18:37, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oops ^that was me above^ ... edited my preferences today and was distracted by other things going on - didn't mean to change my nick at all. Damn people and their cats!smokeverbs 18:41, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still in the area but I do not have any shows recorded. I guess I never thought of it. Would be nice to have some of the early ones, prior to WJLB. In 2002 I discovered quite by accident WDTR 90.9 and their playlist was an excellent reminder of all the tunes that Mojo made so popular. Having to commute 2 hours a day at that time I was able to listen quite a bit. I was a faithful listener until they changed the format in late 2004. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 15:03, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why on earth did you propose merging <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Liberties_194e.html" title="The Liberties">The Liberties</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_Dublin_bd93.html" title="Georgian Dublin">Georgian Dublin</a>? The articles are about two different locations, miles apart, developed centuries apart, that have nothing to do with each other. One is a mediaeval section of Dublin, the other 5 squares developed in the Georgian period hundreds of years later, miles away. I've removed the ridiculous merge tags. Please be more careful to propose merging things that are the same, not things that aren't. It was about as inaccurate as proposing to merge Canada and the US, or articles on mediaeval history and georgian history, or Spain and Portugal. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:31, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw a note you left on the Jackson Sanitorium talk page and just wanted to clarify something. Websites, pamphlets, books and other media do not require any type of copyright notice - they are automatically covered under copyright laws. So yes, the act of "copying" even when there's no notice is the same as a copyright violation. Wikipedia can only use material where copyright is specifically waved or the material is released under a free license like the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p>Hello, I just noticed that you unmoved my user page. I had originally moved it from <a href="../../../s/i/b/User%7ESibaz_c84f.html" title="User:Sibaz">User:sibaz</a> to Simon Bazley because I intended to create some articles about Wycombe, following on from my election to Wycombe District Council. I saw today an article about the by-election which noted that election <a href="../../../w/y/c/Wycombe_local_elections.html" title="Wycombe local elections">Wycombe_local_elections</a>, but I don't want to link to my user page. My persona as an editor of wikipedia has nothing to do with that as a politician, and I wanted to have kept them separate. Should I create a new 'User:Simon Bazley' which I use when editing things of a political nature and leave the geeky stuff to User:sibaz.</p>
<p>Here, by the way is a page for one of my colleagues on Wycombe District Council, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Hayday_9062.html" title="Darren Hayday">Darren_Hayday</a>. I'm also not enamoured by you claiming that its vanity in the comments, hence I'd rather like you to move it back if you wouldn't mine.

<dd>Hello. You'll have to forgive me but I've edited hundreds of articles as part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWIKIFY_0f2f.html" title="WP:WIKIFY">wikification drive</a> so I don't recall exactly the reasons I moved the page. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> are two guidelines that are used to determine an article's worthyness for wikipedia. Writing an article about yourself is usually frowned upon in the community even if it meets the above guidelines. There are a lot of articles either purposely or mistakenly entered when they really should be user pages. <a href="../../../u/f/y/WP%7EUFY_da84.html" title="WP:UFY">Userfy</a> is another edit action that happens often here. You're certainly welcome to recreate the article Simon Bazley by a copy/paste of the text, though it's possible another editor in the future may do the same as I did. Hope that helps. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 03:29, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brad</p>
<p>I spotted someone who had removed lots of wikify tags without having made any significant changes to the article I went through and added the tag back onto any which I thought could do with more work. (They had done good work on some other articles too, new user, and so they seemed to get better at is as they went along!) I went through very quickly, as it was quite a long list, so it's entirely possible I've added it back somewhere where the article is fine, so feel to take it back off again if I've made a bo-bo! -<a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadybirdintheuk_176f.html" title="User:Ladybirdintheuk">Ladybirdintheuk</a> 10:38, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That doesnt matter! Wiki linking to Dog is pretty pointless but in Master Status there are a few things - such as the list of features etc. (spirituality). The whole point of linking is to co-joinas many articles as possible to make things <i>complete</i> and to make the articles look better / become more useful&#160;:D Oh and as to the secondary school you detagged with a few minor tweaks? There were no end of links to do and secton headers to put in (don forget that is a job for wikifiers too!), take a look at what i did to it. --<b>Errant</b> <small><a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorton166_173f.html" title="User:Tmorton166">Tmorton166</a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/m/o/User_talk%7ETmorton166_fe7b.html" title="User talk:Tmorton166">Talk</a>)</sup>(<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Tmorton166_32cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Tmorton166">Review me</a>)</small> 14:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess we have different standards as to what an article needs or doesn't need. With over 7000 articles to wikify and few people to work on them I'm not really sure why we're having this conversation to begin with. Anyway, no offense and not whining but this has rather turned my stomach as someone who has hundreds of wikified articles behind him.

<p>You tagged <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility_de32.html" title="Mirror Fusion Test Facility">Mirror Fusion Test Facility</a>, but did not offer any comment in the talk page. What do you think needs to be done to the article to improve its style? It appears to be very similar to all "small pages" on the wiki. Can you be specific?</p>

<dd>I see that the vast majority of the comments on this page are "complaints" about drive-by tagging. <b>Please</b>, if you add a tag that is not extremely specific, like a wikify tag, <b>put comments in the discussion page</b>! That's what it's for. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 21:43, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My response is going to be about the same for the last two persons who wondered why I was tagging 'their' articles. Tagging articles for various problems is not vandalism or meant to be insulting the person who wrote the article. <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWIKIFY_0f2f.html" title="WP:WIKIFY">WP:WIKIFY</a> can be found by following the link within the tag for all you need to know about wikifying an article. A wikify tag is a rather specific task on wikipedia and there are currently over 7000 articles tagged as such. Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrad101_32fb.html" title="User:Brad101">Brad101</a> 01:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brad, I <b>did</b> follow the link in the tag, and it did <b>not</b> answer the questions. The article appears to be perfectly valid according to the style guide. Unless you have some specific objections or examples of things you'd like to see changed, I think I should just remove the tag. I'm not asking for anything other than a one-liner on the discussion page. Is that <i>really</i> too much to ask? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 15:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll reply here to the comments referenced above for <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Scott_415d.html" title="Roger Scott">Roger Scott</a>, because it seems pertinent to this discussion. Brad, you mention that there are over 7,000 articles tagged with <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWIKIFY_0f2f.html" title="WP:WIKIFY">WP:WIKIFY</a>, and I think that is the point. There are so many, it is almost pontless, and adding articles that are clearly new, being written, and require relaively minor changes does nothing but increase the number. Its not that the article is "my" article (it certainly is not), or even that I am offended by the tag (I am not), it just is puzzling when it is added to an article and the only improvement required is a couple of links. If the tag was applied more selectively, to articles that clearly need style or other changes, the number of articles might be reduced to a more manageable size and the tag might actually mean something. Certainly waiting for a while after the article is first created might save everyone some time. For those articles requiring relatively minor changes, like <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Scott_415d.html" title="Roger Scott">Roger Scott</a>, it might be more helpful to simply make the actual changes in the article as you did in response to my question, for which I thank you. --<a href="../../../r/x/u/User%7ERXUYDC_0144.html" title="User:RXUYDC">RXUYDC</a> 17:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have put in a request at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Template_talk%7EWikify-date_460d.html" title="Template talk:Wikify-date">Template talk:Wikify-date</a> to make things more clear to those articles with wikify tags.

<p>Dear tag inserter. Why did you put a Wikify tag in the article <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_Biscay_57c8.html" title="Lord of Biscay">Lord of Biscay</a>? I think it's perfectly Wikified. Where's the problem?</p>
<p>I think you should add a comment to make the creator or other users willing/able to make the proper changes how can be the article imporved to be correctly "wikified".</p>
<p>As I see that these kind of complaints are common and the tag is actually irrelevant, I'm deleting it.</p>

<p>Hi Brad...I see you inserted a dispute on this page I submitted. I'm new at all this so forgive my ignorance (in fact I hope I'm doing this right!). When I looked up what a neutrality dispute was, it said that when someone disputes a page, they need to insert why they are disputing it on the talk page. However, you inserted nothing that I can find. Unless I'm missing something, it seems like it does little good to dispute something without leaving some sort of comments as to why you're doing so. If I've missed the comments, perhaps you could point them out to me. The article was actually written by a group of people and read by even more before submission, all of whom have something to do with The Musical Theatre Guild. There was never any talk about it being impartial or lacking neutrality. So if you could help us out here with why you tagged the article, it would be greatly appreciated. Otherwise, please remove the dispute.</p>
