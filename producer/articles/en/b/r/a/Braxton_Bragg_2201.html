<p>Bragg was born in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrenton%2C_North_Carolina_4883.html" title="Warrenton, North Carolina">Warrenton, North Carolina</a>, the younger brother of future <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bragg_fbb5.html" title="Thomas Bragg">Thomas Bragg</a>. He was often ridiculed as a child because of his mother's stint in prison. He graduated fifth in a class of fifty from the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Military_Academy_8e07.html" title="U.S. Military Academy">U.S. Military Academy</a> in 1837 and was commissioned a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_lieutenant.html" title="Second lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 3rd U.S. Artillery.</p>
<p>Bragg served in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Seminole_War_7822.html" title="Second Seminole War">Second Seminole War</a> in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> and took part in the occupation of <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. He won promotions for bravery and distinguished conduct in the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a>, including a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28military%29.html" title="Brevet (military)">brevet</a> promotion to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a> for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Monterrey_fe24.html" title="Battle of Monterrey">Battle of Monterrey</a> and to <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_colonel.html" title="Lieutenant colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Buena_Vista_4bfb.html" title="Battle of Buena Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. He gained the respect of Gen. <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachary_Taylor_d92b.html" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>.</p>
<p>Bragg had a reputation for being a strict disciplinarian and one who adhered to regulations literally. There is a famous, perhaps apocryphal, story about him as a company commander at a frontier post where he also served as quartermaster. He submitted a requisition for supplies for his company, then as quartermaster declined to fill it. As company commander, he resubmitted the requisition, giving additional reasons for his requirements, but as the quartermaster he denied the request again. Realizing that he was at a personal impasse, he referred the matter to the post commandant, who exclaimed "My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarreled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarreling with yourself!" It is alleged that some of his troops attempted to assassinate him on two occasions in August and September 1847, but he was not injured either time. In the more serious of the two incidents, one of his soldiers exploded a 12-pound artillery shell underneath his cot. Although the cot was destroyed, somehow Bragg himself emerged without a scratch.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1856, Bragg resigned from the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> to become a sugar planter in <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thibodeaux%2C_Louisiana_83bd.html" title="Thibodeaux, Louisiana">Thibodeaux, Louisiana</a>. He also served as Commissioner of Public Works for the state.</p>

<p>Before the start of the Civil War, Bragg was a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a> in the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> Militia and was promoted to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_general.html" title="Major general">major general</a> of the militia on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>. He commanded the forces around <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a>, but his commission was transferred to be a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a> of the Confederate States Army on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">March 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>. He commanded forces in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensacola%2C_Florida_d556.html" title="Pensacola, Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, and the Department of West Florida and was promoted to <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_general.html" title="Major general">major general</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>. His command was extended to Alabama, and then to the Army of Pensacola in October 1861. His tenure was successful and along with friend <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Taylor_%28general%29_8f58.html" title="Richard Taylor (general)">Richard Taylor</a> he turned his men into some of the best disciplined troops in the Confederate Army.</p>
<p>Bragg brought his forces to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinth%2C_Mississippi_c550.html" title="Corinth, Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>, and was charged with improving the poor discipline of the Confederate troops already assembled. He commanded a corps at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Shiloh_088c.html" title="Battle of Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> and attacked the Hornet's Nest with piecemeal frontal assaults.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> After the Confederate commander, General <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Sidney_Johnston_bdce.html" title="Albert Sidney Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>, was killed at Shiloh, General <a href="../../../p/2E/g/P.G.T._Beauregard_a844.html" title="P.G.T.

On that day, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>, Bragg was promoted to full <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a>, one of only eight in the history of the Confederacy, and assigned to command the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Mississippi_5a2e.html" title="Army of Mississippi">Army of Mississippi</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The next day the Confederates were driven back to Corinth. After the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Corinth_d31d.html" title="Siege of Corinth">Siege of Corinth</a>, Beauregard departed on account of illness, although he failed to inform President Davis of his departure and spent two weeks absent without leave. Davis was looking for someone to replace Beauregard because of his poor performance at Corinth, and the opportunity presented itself when Beauregard left without permission. Bragg was then appointed his successor as commander of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Tennessee_dc07.html" title="Army of Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> in June 1862.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braxton_Bragg_2201.html" title="Edit section: Army of Tennessee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Army of Tennessee</span></h3>
<p>In August 1862, Bragg invaded <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, hoping that he could arouse supporters of the Confederate cause in the border state and draw the Union forces under Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Carlos_Buell_20ed.html" title="Don Carlos Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a>, beyond the Ohio River. Bragg transported all of his infantry by railroads from <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupelo%2C_Mississippi_4b68.html" title="Tupelo, Mississippi">Tupelo, Mississippi</a>, to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee_d431.html" title="Chattanooga, Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, while his cavalry and artillery moved by road. By moving his army to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee_d431.html" title="Chattanooga, Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, he was able to challenge Buell's advance on the city. Once his forces had assembled in Chattanooga, Bragg then planned to move north into Kentucky in cooperation with Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Kirby_Smith_c066.html" title="Edmund Kirby Smith">Edmund Kirby Smith</a>, who was commanding a separate force operating out of <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee_7d3c.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>. He captured over 4,000 Union soldiers at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Munfordville_7b41.html" title="Battle of Munfordville">Munfordville</a>, and then moved his army to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardstown%2C_Kentucky_c2cb.html" title="Bardstown, Kentucky">Bardstown</a>. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">October 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>, he participated in the inauguration of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hawes_f781.html" title="Richard Hawes">Richard Hawes</a> as the provisional Confederate governor of Kentucky. The wing of Bragg's army under Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonidas_Polk_9e1f.html" title="Leonidas Polk">Leonidas Polk</a> met Buell's army at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Perryville_3ef9.html" title="Battle of Perryville">Perryville</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_8.html" title="October 8">October 8</a> and won a tactical victory against him.</p>
<p>Kirby Smith pleaded with Bragg to follow up on his success: "For God's sake, General, let us fight Buell here." Bragg replied, "I will do it, sir," but then displaying what one observer called "a perplexity and vacillation which had now become simply appalling to Smith, to Hardee, and to Polk,"<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> he ordered his army to retreat through the Cumberland Gap to <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee_7d3c.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville</a>. Bragg referred to his retreat as a withdrawal, the successful culmination of a giant raid. He had multiple reasons for withdrawing. Disheartening news had arrived from North Mississippi that <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Van_Dorn_5be1.html" title="Earl Van Dorn">Earl Van Dorn</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling_Price_4982.html" title="Sterling Price">Sterling Price</a> had failed at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Corinth_4edc.html" title="Second Battle of Corinth">Corinth</a>, just as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> had failed in his <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland_Campaign_2402.html" title="Maryland Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a>. He saw that his army had not much to gain from a further, isolated victory, whereas a defeat might cost not only the bountiful food and supplies yet collected, but also his army. He wrote to his wife, "With the whole southwest thus in the enemy's possession, my crime would have been unpardonable had I kept my noble little army to be ice-bound in the northern clime, without tents or shoes, and obliged to forage daily for bread, etc."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The invasion of Kentucky was a strategic failure, although it had forced the Union forces out of Northern Alabama and most of Middle Tennessee; it would take the Union forces a year to regain the lost ground. Bragg was criticized by some newspapers and two of his own generals, Polk and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_J._Hardee_5af9.html" title="William J. Hardee">William J. Hardee</a>, but there was plenty of blame to spread among the Confederate high command for the failure of the invasion of Kentucky. The armies of Bragg and Kirby Smith suffered from a lack of unified command. Bragg can be faulted for moving his army away from Munfordville, out of Buell's path, a prime location for a battle to Confederate advantage. Polk can also be blamed for not following Bragg's instructions on the day before and of the battle.</p>
<p>In December, Bragg fought the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stones_River_6c99.html" title="Battle of Stones River">Battle of Stones River</a>, and nearly defeated Union Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_S._Rosecrans_2c16.html" title="William S. Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a>, but withdrew his army from the field to <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tullahoma%2C_Tennessee_d5a0.html" title="Tullahoma, Tennessee">Tullahoma, Tennessee</a>, after the urgings of corps commanders Hardee and Polk. The attacks upon Bragg started anew and several of his supporters now turned against him. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_M._McPherson_8097.html" title="James M. McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> wrote about the aftermath of Stones River:<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>While Washington breathed a sigh of relief after Stones River, dissension came to a head in the Army of Tennessee. All of Bragg's corps and division commanders expressed a lack of confidence in their chief. Senior Generals William J. Hardee and Leonidas Polk asked Davis to put Johnston in command of the army. Division commander B. Franklin Cheatham vowed he would never again serve under Bragg. Breckinridge wanted to challenge Bragg to a duel. Bragg struck back, court-martialing one division commander for disobeying orders, accusing another (Cheatham) of drunkenness during the battle, and blaming Breckinridge for inept leadership. This internecine donnybrook threatened to do more damage to the army than the Yankees had done. Disheartened, Bragg told a friend that it might "be better for the President to send someone to relieve me," and wrote Davis to the same effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">James M. McPherson, <i>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stones River was also another in which blame can be spread beyond Bragg alone. Bragg has to be faulted for the ground on which the battle was fought, which offered few advantages to the attacking Confederate army and offered more advantages to the defending Union army. He also selected his military objective poorly, resulting in a Union defensive line that became more concentrated and stronger as Bragg's became spread out and weaker. The ill-advised assaults he ordered <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_C._Breckinridge_6618.html" title="John C. Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> to make on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">January 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, weakened his army without gain. But his subordinates were at various degrees of fault. The inexperienced Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_P._McCown_c4dd.html" title="John P. McCown">John P. McCown</a> was found guilty by court-martial of disobedience to Bragg's orders, which diluted the force of his division's attack and possibly cost the Confederates a victory. The charge of drunkenness pressed against division commander <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Cheatham_63a5.html" title="Benjamin F. Cheatham">B. Franklin Cheatham</a> was merited as there were claims that he was so drunk during the battle that he fell off his horse while leading his men forward. Both Polk and Hardee can be faulted for not coordinating their attacks, but instead choosing to attack <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echelon_formation.html" title="Echelon formation"><i>en echelon</i></a>, which led to much of the confusion. Fault is also given to <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, who sent Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carter_L._Stevenson_a63c.html" title="Carter L. Stevenson">Carter L. Stevenson</a>'s division to the defense of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vicksburg_dbec.html" title="Battle of Vicksburg">Vicksburg</a>. The loss of these troops weakened Bragg's army and if Bragg had had these troops victory might have been possible.</p>
<p>Many members of Bragg's army sought to get him transferred after the battle, citing the failure of the Kentucky invasion and the recent defeat at Murfreesboro, as well as the lack of faith the army had in Bragg, as reasons to remove him. Polk became the ringleader and tried to influence his friend Jefferson Davis through a series of letters explaining to Davis about why Bragg needed to go as the commander of the army. Hardee became Polk's second-in-command, so to speak, as he went about trying to influence the officers in the army against Bragg, while presenting a friendly face to him. Davis was unwilling to choose between Bragg and Polk, so he empowered Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_E._Johnston_d8d6.html" title="Joseph E. Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, commander of all Confederate forces in the Western Theater, to relieve Bragg of command. Johnston visited Bragg, found general morale in the army to be high, and decided to retain him. Bragg was then driven from Tullahoma to Chattanooga and into <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a> during Rosecrans's <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tullahoma_Campaign_2a82.html" title="Tullahoma Campaign">Tullahoma Campaign</a> in late June 1863, during which he constantly outflanked the Confederate army of their positions.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_S._Rosecrans_2c16.html" title="William S. Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a> had consolidated his gains and completed his hold on Chattanooga, he began moving his army into northern Georgia against Bragg's army. Bragg began to suffer from inattention to his orders on the part of his subordinates. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_10.html" title="September 10">September 10</a>, Maj. Gens. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_C._Hindman_01f6.html" title="Thomas C. Hindman">Thomas C. Hindman</a> and <a href="../../../d/2E/h/D.H._Hill_c0c4.html" title="D.H. Hill">D.H.

On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, Bragg ordered Leonidas Polk to attack Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_L._Crittenden_2f33.html" title="Thomas L. Crittenden">Thomas L. Crittenden</a>'s corps, but Polk ignored the orders and demanded more troops, insisting that it was he who was about to be attacked. Rosecrans used the time lost in these delays to collect his scattered forces.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Finally, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, Bragg, reinforced by two divisions from Mississippi, one division and several brigades from the Department of East Tennessee, and two divisions under Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Longstreet_bedd.html" title="James Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> from <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Northern_Virginia_5129.html" title="Army of Northern Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>, turned on the pursuing Rosecrans in northeastern Georgia and at high cost defeated him at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chickamauga_f5b7.html" title="Battle of Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a>, the greatest Confederate victory in the Western Theater during the war. After the battle, Rosecrans's <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_the_Cumberland_d101.html" title="Army of the Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a> retreated to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee_d431.html" title="Chattanooga, Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, where Bragg laid siege to the city. He chose to use the victory to rid himself of his enemies within the army and managed to get Polk and D.H. Hill transferred. Bragg blamed for Polk for the numerous occasions in which he disobeyed instructions. Hill, one of the many generals who were allies of Polk, spoke out against Bragg so much that <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> removed him from command and canceled his endorsement for Hill's promotion to <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_general.html" title="Lieutenant general">lieutenant general</a>.</p>
<p>Things came to a boil in the Confederate high command in the aftermath of Chickamauga. Some of Bragg's subordinate generals were frustrated at what they perceived to be his lack of willingness to exploit the victory by driving the Union Army from Chattanooga and pursuing them. Polk in particular was outraged to being relieved of command. The dissidents, including many of the division and corps commanders, met in secret and prepared a petition to the president. Although the author of the petition is not known, historians suspect it was Simon Buckner, whose signature was first on the list.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Longstreet_bedd.html" title="James Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> wrote to the Secretary of War with the prediction that "nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander." <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest_6db5.html" title="Nathan Bedford Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>, dissatisfied after a long association with Bragg, and bitter about his failure to pursue the defeated Union forces after Chickamauga, refused to serve under him again. He told Bragg to his face, "You have played the part of a damned scoundrel. ... If you ever again try to interfere with me or cross my path it will be at the peril of your life."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> With the Army of Tennessee literally on the verge of mutiny, Jefferson Davis reluctantly traveled to Chattanooga to personally assess the situation and to try to stem the tide of dissent in the army. Although Bragg offered to resign to resolve the crisis,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Davis eventually decided to leave Bragg in command and denounced the other generals and termed their complaints "shafts of malice".<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>When finally reinforced and now commanded by Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, the Union Army broke the siege by driving the Confederates from their commanding positions on Lookout Mountain (the famous "Battle Above the Clouds") on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, and Missionary Ridge the following day. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chattanooga_III_0db7.html" title="Battle of Chattanooga III">Battle of Chattanooga</a> at Missionary Ridge resulted in a rout with the Confederates narrowly escaping total destruction and retreating into Georgia. The loss of their hold on Chattanooga is partially attributed to poor placement of artillery; instead of locating the guns on the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_crest.html" title="Military crest">military crest</a>, they were placed on the actual crest of the ridge, allowing the approaching infantry to remain in defilade. Bragg, under advice from Davis, sent <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Longstreet_bedd.html" title="James Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> and his divisions, as well as <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Bolivar_Buckner%2C_Sr._c8f4.html" title="Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.">Simon B.

Gen. <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrose_Burnside_cb2b.html" title="Ambrose Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a> and his forces located in the city. While this move was gladly accepted by Longstreet, and Bragg believed he could prevent Burnside from marching to Grant's aid. Only after the Confederate collapse at Chattanooga did Davis accept Bragg's resignation and replace him with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_E._Johnston_d8d6.html" title="Joseph E. Johnston">Joseph E.

<p>In February 1864, Bragg was sent to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>; his official orders read that he was "charged with the conduct of military operations of the Confederate States", but he was essentially Davis's military advisor without a direct command, a post once held by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>. Bragg used his organizational abilities to reduce corruption and improve the supply system. He reshaped the Confederacy's conscription process by streamlining the chain of command and reducing conscripts' avenues of appeal. Later he commanded in turn the defenses of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilmington%2C_North_Carolina_0392.html" title="Wilmington, North Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia, the defenses of <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusta%2C_Georgia_e540.html" title="Augusta, Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>, the defenses of <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savannah%2C_Georgia_bd58.html" title="Savannah, Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, the defenses of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina_d5d8.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, and in January 1865, the defenses again of Wilmington. His performance in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Fort_Fisher_b889.html" title="Second Battle of Fort Fisher">Second Battle of Fort Fisher</a> caused the loss of the latter city, but he managed to escape with the bulk of the garrison and win a small victory at Kinston. Near the end of the war he served as a corps commander (although his command was less than a division in size) in the Army of Tennessee under <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_E._Johnston_d8d6.html" title="Joseph E. Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolinas_Campaign_c971.html" title="Carolinas Campaign">Carolinas Campaign</a> against Sherman and fought at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bentonville_1378.html" title="Battle of Bentonville">Battle of Bentonville</a>.

<p>After the war Bragg served as the superintendent of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a> waterworks and later became the chief engineer for <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, supervising harbor improvements at <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile%2C_Alabama_e278.html" title="Mobile, Alabama">Mobile</a>.

<p>Bragg was walking down a street with a friend in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galveston%2C_Texas_848c.html" title="Galveston, Texas">Galveston, Texas</a>, when he suddenly fell over dead.

<p>James McPherson's reference to "the bumblers like Bragg and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_C._Pemberton_51b8.html" title="John C. Pemberton">Pemberton</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bell_Hood_4e04.html" title="John Bell Hood">Hood</a> who lost the West"<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> sums up the judgment of many modern historians. Bragg's shortcomings as an army commander included his unimaginative tactics, mostly his reliance on frontal assault (such as the Hornet's Nest at Shiloh, Breckinridge's assault at Stones River, and numerous instances at Chickamauga), and his lack of post-battle followup that turned tactical victories or draws into strategic disappointments (Perryville and Chickamauga). His sour disposition, penchant to blame others for defeat, and poor interpersonal relationships undoubtedly caused him to be criticized more directly than many of his unsuccessful contemporaries were. Historian Peter Cozzens wrote about his relationship with subordinates:<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Even Bragg's staunchest supporters admonished him for his quick temper, general irritability, and tendency to wound innocent men with barbs thrown during his frequent fits of anger. His reluctance to praise or flatter was exceeded, we are told, only by the tenacity with which, once formed, he clung to an adverse impression of a subordinate. For such officers—and they were many in the Army of the Mississippi—Bragg's removal or their transfer were the only alternatives to an unbearable existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">Peter Cozzens, <i>No Better Place to Die: The Battle of Stones River</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some counterarguments have emerged in recent years. Judith Lee Hallock called the blaming of Bragg for Confederate defeats in the west the "Bragg syndrome." While most agree he was a poor army commander, historians such as Hallock and Steven Woodworth cite his skills as an organizer and that his defeat in several battles can also be partially blamed upon bad luck and incompetent subordinates, notably Polk. Of his troublesome subordinates, Hardee was considered to be a solid soldier even by Bragg. Polk, although personally brave and charismatic, was simply an average tactician known for insubordination and piecemeal attacks.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Unfortunately, he was a close friend of Davis, who was unwilling to relieve him. Bragg also never got the support Davis gave to Robert E. Lee and Sidney Johnston.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> That his abilities were only properly utilized in 1861 and 1864 also shows the inability of the Confederacy to make proper use of many of its generals.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Despite his faults, Bragg was able to impress on occasion his superiors, such as Taylor, Davis, Beauregard, and Sidney Johnston.</p>
<p>Historians <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grady_McWhiney_ec0c.html" title="Grady McWhiney">Grady McWhiney</a> and Steven Woodworth have pointed out that, contrary to popular belief, Davis and Bragg were not friends, having bitterly quarreled during the antebellum years. Davis was impressed with Bragg, but was willing to relieve him in early 1863. He did not relieve him, in part because no suitable replacements could be found, a consistent problem for Davis. Even Bragg's harshest critics have generally failed to suggest a suitable replacement.</p>
<p>Although many historians have written about Bragg's lack of popularity with his men and officers, there was a sizable portion of the army that did support and remain loyal to him, generals such as <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wheeler_1b7e.html" title="Joseph Wheeler">Joseph Wheeler</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_C._Walthall_8dba.html" title="Edward C. Walthall">Edward C. Walthall</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_B._Bate_93b1.html" title="William B. Bate">William B. Bate</a>, Jones Withers, Arthur Manigault, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patton_Anderson_dd98.html" title="Patton Anderson">Patton Anderson</a>. Bragg's support among the lower ranks can best be seen in the letter of South Carolina Captain C.I. Walker, who wrote in July 1864, "For our sakes I am glad that the country has so much confidence in our commanding General, people will not blame us for not fighting, but I cant help thinking that Genl. Bragg would have conducted the campaign very differently and perhaps with other results, and I believe better results as we now can see."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
