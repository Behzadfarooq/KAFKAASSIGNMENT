<p>Brahminism is probably the last of the caste based occupations to still exist in all parts of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. In rural areas unfortunately the practice still continues. A barbers son will eventually become a barber and a brahmins son will be a brahmin. But the situation has changed tremendously even in the rural areas in the past 2 centuries. People are leaving villages to go to the towns. In the giant melting pot of towns like <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>) all the distinctions just vanish.</p>
<p>08:45 am. Crowded local train - direction CST (<a href="../../../c/h/h/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus_0550.html" title="Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus">Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus</a> formerly known as <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Terminus_df9d.html" title="Victoria Terminus">Victoria Terminus</a>). Easily carrying more than 1000 souls. There is barely enough place to stand. One has to get to the office in time. Trying to guess the caste of the person next to you is the last thing on your mind.</p>
<p>Brahminism is practiced in the privacy of ones home. The feeling of misplaced superiority a century ago has been replaced by a quiet humility. Brahmin fathers tell their sons and daughters - "The only way for a Brahmin to get a good life in these days is to concentrate on education. Make sure you study hard to make the tough life a little bit easier"</p>
<p>One interesting phenomenon I would like to mention here is about a small village called <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trimbakeshwar.html" title="Trimbakeshwar">Trimbakeshwar</a>(Near the big town <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasik.html" title="Nasik">Nasik</a>, some 200 Km from Mumbai). Brahmins there have established themselves as authorities on certain rituals that can be performed only by the brahmins of that village. These rituals are designed on the centuries old vedic rituals and are supposed to cancel out the evil effect of stars and planets in your horoscope. It is also said to have deeper meanings related to the deaths of your ancestors. One can see people from all over India (and in rare cases, abroad) flocking in hundreds and thousands to this ancient village and paying these brahmins some fees to get these rituals done and hope for a better life.</p>

<p>The thought of moving the arcitle about Brahminism to Hinduism is as good as moving the description of a pillar to that of house just becaue you think house potrays a bigger picture and thus its pillar can be described as houses' part itself.</p>
<p>No doubt that Bhrahminism is included in hinduism ,its is one of the strongest pillar but then it has its own meaning and speciality.</p>
<p>Thoughts of person above this comments are right ,today Brahminism is declinig in the storm of modernism and as brahmins have never been good traders ,businessmen their best bet is to find bread and butter for life via the thing that they have been doing fro generations , learning. Sadly today no one is there to support their simple way of life "biksha". It was the generous donatiosn of the students they used to teach and offering of their disciples which used to give them the resources to support their life for which they have to do a kind of business now..study and get it yor self. This is a capitalistic idea , to cash on something you know , the old vedic system was different. It believed in giving more then cashing on to what you know.</p>
<p>Talking like this I feel too idealistic,to confess the truth I am also one of those sham,cashing on what I know..working for a company. But some day I hope I have enough of the resources and knowledge that I could revert to the old ways to give little hope to the dying ways.</p>
<p>Please keep the two articles seprate , as they have different meanings.</p>

<p>Brahmanism and Hinduism are distinct - though Brahminism could be seen as an aspect of Hinduism, they are separate. If one were to roll everything into Hinduism like this, you'd have an inconceivable mess. The reason Brahminism is separate within the Hindu religion is for the very same reason. A purely Western perspective may not comprehend this, which is good - but that does not mean that an Eastern way of thought has to be forced to comply with the Western perspective. The English left India a while back.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Further, adding Brahminism to Hinduism could give the false perception that they are one and the same. This is not true.</p>
<p>The two articles should be kept separate. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 23:31, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Buddha section either needs more after it, or it needs to be deleted. The way it stands now, it sounds to me like "First there was Vedic Brahminism. Then Buddha appeared. And Vedic Brahminism was no more", which is hardly the case. For instance, <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adi_Shankara_9078.html" title="Adi Shankara">Adi Shankara</a> was a strong influence in the opposite direction. Hinduism and Buddhism in India have undergone several cycles from about 500 BC to about 800 AD. We also need stuff in there about decline of Brahminism in the 20th century (refer Dravida movement, Mandal Commission etc). I'll see what I can do over the next few days.--<a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrhaspati_5095.html" title="User:Brhaspati">Brhaspati</a> 07:52, 2005 Jan 7 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you very much about what needs added, but would discourage you from deleting. Rather I'd much prefer if you would be willing to fill in the empty spaces. The information I added was almost entirely from the 1911 britannica, and it should be no suprise that it was lacking in contemporary detail. Mention of Budhism <i>is</i> important, since it was a signifigant challenge to Hinduism, and especially the Brahmins, but I agree that british colonialism, Hindu Nationalism, and Hindu religious and social reforms need a great deal more emphasis and content.

<dd>um, well, in that case it should be merged with <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>. Come on, why should an article entitled "Brahmanism" start out with a definition of "Brahmin"? The "proto-Hinduism" bit seems pov. Who said that?

Or that Brahminism is a "sacerdotalist" current of Hinduism?

<p>Further, adding Brahminism to Hinduism could give the false perception that they are one and the same. This is not true.</p>
<p>The two articles should be kept separate. When you talk about POV forks, perhaps you should consider POV integration. Look to thine self. Remove the tag and be done with it, there are bigger issues to deal with. --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETaranRampersad_d7aa.html" title="User:TaranRampersad">TaranRampersad</a> 23:34, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article should absolutely not be merged w Hinduism. Some feel Hinduism is a modern religion built upon older religions, of which brahmanism would be among the earliest. Even if one disagrees, brahmanism was still distinctly different from hinduism today. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 01:03, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Sam. There are a lot of different views on the history, and fortunately we don't have to discuss those... we'd lose our minds.&#160;:-) My POV is that Brahmanism itself laid an indirect foundation for Buddhism, where some Hindus believe that the last Buddha was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu...the 9th, I believe. But history is much more complicated...&#160;:-)</dd>

<li>I think it is important to distinguish Brahmanism from Hinduism. For example, I am a Brahman by birth and by belief (to an extend), but not Hindy by any means. Making these two same is like saying, Japanese are Chinese. I am preparing more facts for this discussion and for the article, which would make it clear for us all. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESechzehn_6413.html" title="User:Sechzehn">[[User:Sechzehn|&lt;span style="color:white;background:#778"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background:#889"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="background:#99a"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background:#aab"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="background:#bbc"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background:#ccd"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;</a> &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;[[User talk:Sechzehn|(T)]] [[Special:Emailuser/Sechzehn@]] [[Special:Contributions/Sechzehn|(C)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am born bramhin. I have gone through the article and would like to thank the gentlemans, who have collected such a good material, which is useful to collect for every bramhins. Many of us donot know whether the collected material is true, partial or prejudicely written. If we go to the history, there is no mention of any castism before the invasion of Alexander the great, Mughals and Britishers. Before these invasions, some foreign travelers came to India like Magasthenes, Whensong and others and lived here for a very long period. These travelers have written in their diary about the civilian sense of Indians communities and its hormony in between the different castes. There is no findings of any instance of the torture of the lower caste written by these travelers. HINDU word came from the Mughals because they came in India through HINDU-KUSH Mountains. In Pasto and other Arabic language the pronunceation of hindi "Sa" can be hindi "Ha" pronounced viceversa. The Mughals have to cross the Sindhu River to come to India. Those who are residing in the across Sindhu River is pronounced HINDU or SINDHU by the Mughals.</p>
