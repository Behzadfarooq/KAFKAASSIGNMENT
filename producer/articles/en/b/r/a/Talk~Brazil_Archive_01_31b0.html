<h2><span class="mw-headline">MISTAKE</span></h2>
<p>The article says that "In fact, it borders every South American nation except for Ecuador and Chile". It's missing Trinidad and Tobago, which is also a South American state and it's listed as such at the bottom of the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trinidad and Tobago actually belongs to Central America. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmedyr_6f49.html" title="User:Amedyr">Amedyr</a> 19:51, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opening comments</span></h2>
<p>The quality of the English in some parts of this article is terrible. The opening paragraph:</p>
<p><i>Originally inhabited for amerindians (approximately of 3 the 5 million), the territory that today belongs to Brazil, beyond the remain of the South America, already was divided between two european powers, Portugal and Spain before exactly of its official discovery. Some historians believe that the fenícios had arrived at this beyond-sea 2,000 years before the Europeans, the point to be appeared some maps in the North of Africa, the Middle East and even though in the Chine that demonstrated to have a great portion of land beyond the Atlantic Ocean.</i></p>
<p>That reads like somebody wrote it in Portuguese and ran it through a software translator. Can somebody please rewrite this so that it makes sense to English speakers?</p>

<p>I would recomed simply putting that the Brazilian economy is larger in PPP terms. It makes little sense to use any other exchange rate when comparing GDP countries, since economic theory says that an exchange rate can easily deviate from it's "correct" path, making PPP the best alternative we have (being considered as such by, I would guess, the majority of economists). In portuguese: Eu sugeriria simplesmente colocar que a economia Brasileira é maior em termo de PPP. Faz pouco sentido usar outra taxa de cambio para comparar o PIB de paises, uma vez que a teoria econômica prevê que taxas de cambio podem facilmente desviar de seu "valor correto", então o PPP é a melhor forma de comparar (sendo considerado assim, imagino, pela maioria dos economistas).--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo200_7ba1.html" title="User:Vertigo200">Vertigo200</a> 00:35, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Jorge,</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this important subject. Please know that you and I are not the only ones who care about it. We both will agree that every language or dialect has its 'worth' in this world...</p>
<p>That said, however, I would like to suggest that perhaps you were a little hasty in your decision to remove information from the Brazil page regarding immigrant languages. If you don't like the expression "Immigrant Languages" perhaps we could explore alternatives. Myself, I am fighting against invisibility here. There are strong political motives on all sides, obviously (explícitos ou não). However, immigrant languages do exist in Brazil and they are indeed very unique to that part of the world.</p>
<p>Both indigenous and immigrant languages are in need of recognition all over the world. This is no different in Brazil!</p>
<p>For example, this year German speaking Brazilians and their friends commemorated one hundred and eighty years of German immigration to Brazil. Most of these German-Brazilians speak a Brazilian variation of the Hunsrückisch dialect which was aptly classified as "Riograndenser Hunsrückisch" by Dr. Cléo Vilson Althofen, a linguist from Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hunsrückisch proper is still spoken in the Hunsrück region of Germany today. Not unlike the Venetian language which continues being spoken in Italy today.</p>
<p>I can see that you have very strong feelings about your native language but please try and see other people's perspectives. That is all I'm asking...</p>

O Dicionário do Talian contém palavras do sessenta milhões de taliani que andam pelo mundo e, quem sabe de quantos que, depois da experiência migratória, continuam a falar esta língua, agora definitivamente, com palavras definitivas, porque o Senhor já os chamou para o definitivo, sereno, feliz e alegre destino. - Rovílio Costa .</p>

<p>Língua de imigrantes italianos, muito falada atualmente no Brasil (cf. Luzzatto, 1994). Os falantes do talian se concentram na Região Sul, distruibuindo-se em diferentes cidades de cada Estado, por exemplo: Caxias do sul, Farroupilha, Garibaldi, Bento Gonçalves, Flores da Cunha, Veranópolis, Erechim, Carlos Barbosa - no Rio Grande do Sul; Joaçaba, Caçador, Chapecó, Concórdia – em Santa Catarina; Cascavel, Pato Branco, Francisco Beltrão, Medianeira, Toledo - no Paraná). É pela relação com o movimento de imigração de italianos para o Brasil no fim do século XIX e início do XX que podemos compreender a emergência do talian como uma língua. Quando chegavam ao Brasil, os imigrantes eram conduzidos a fazendas ou a áreas ainda não habitadas nem cultivadas. Disso resultavam as colônias de imigrantes, vinculadas ao processo de colonização dessas áreas. No caso da região sul, de modo geral, dividiam-se essas novas áreas em linhas e travessões e nelas se estabeleciam os imigrantes, aleatoriamente agrupados. Dos imigrantes italianos que se dirigiram ao Sul do país, em finais do século XIX, 95% eram provenientes do Vêneto e da Lombardia. Destes, 60% tinham língua e cultura vênetas, o que fez com que formas dessa língua predominassem nas situações de conversa entre eles, resultando no talian.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vicent Yáñez Pinzón DID NOT DISCOVER BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p>To say that Vicente Yañez Pinzón discovered Brazil is not only historically wrong, but it is an insult to Brazilians and Portuguese people. Whoever believes otherwise, we want to see your sources (and no, a Spanish encyclopaedia doesn't count).</p>
<p>At the last resort, if there is really a dispute (which is not the case -- only if you WANT to believe that Pinzón discovered Brazil), then we should stick with what the Brazilians and Portuguese claim, and any claims from Spanish sources should be taken with suspicion, since Spain and Portugal disputed territories in the Americas. So, Pinzón went down the Amazon River. So what?</p>
<ul>
<li>The River goes beyond the Brazilian territory -- even today.</li>
<li>Brazil's territory expanded due to the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Tordesillas_552d.html" title="Treaty of Tordesillas">Treaty of Tordesillas</a>, which happened way after Cabral and Pinzón. Therefore Brazil's territory was way smaller at the time. Which means that the region explored by Pinzón was probably Spanish territory at the time. See: <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_colonization_of_the_Americas_908a.html" title="Portuguese colonization of the Americas">Portuguese colonization of the Americas</a>.</li>
<li>The population of Brazil was not developed in the region where Pinzón made his way. Until today, only Indians leaves there, and Brazil want to keep it this way. The whole development of Brazil started on its East coat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, if a State expands its territory to a place/region which dates before the colonization/foundation/discovery of the State itself, doesn't mean that whoever claimed this new acquired territory before, is now the colonizer/founder/discoverer of the whole State.</p>
<p>Brazil was colonised by Portugal, claimed by the Portugal crown, the emperor was Portuguese, they speak Portuguese, and Brazil wouldn't accept otherwise. So please, let's avoid further discussions on this topic: <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral_6e54.html" title="Pedro Álvares Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a> discovered Brazil. Want to claim otherwise? Let's talk about it here, ok?</p>
<p><br />
If I sound like I am overreacting, I am sorry. But as a Brazilian, such claim is quite upsetting. You don't see me going to the Airplane page and wiping of the name of the Wright Brothers claiming that Santos Dummond invented the airplane, do you? (Although I do belive he invented the first proper airplane, and that his name should be at least mentioned somewhere&#160;;-) )</p>
<p><br />
___</p>
<p>My first source was a wikipedia article, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Brazil_b373.html" title="Colonial Brazil">Colonial Brazil</a>, where somebody wrote:</p>
<p>"Brazil's discovery is officially dated at April 22 of 1500, by Pedro Álvares Cabral, who was trying to discover a new route to India, around Africa. However, his pioneerism is still debated. He was in fact preceded by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón who discovered the Amazon river months earlier on January 26, but if the Amazon is now part of Brazil it was then west of the Tordesilhas Line, therefore actually Spanish".</p>
<p>Then I read fast some pages about Brazil's discovery, all in english:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reconcile.org/thespain.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.reconcile.org/thespain.htm" rel="nofollow">The mother that betrayed her children</a>, brazilian</li>

</ul>
<p>There are biographies about Pinzon:</p>
<ul>
<li>[<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/pinzon.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/pinzon.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote "when the first European explorers, Led by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Pedro Álvares Cabral disembarked on 1500". As you see, I don't delete to Cabral. You deleted Pinzon.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't know because the possible fact of Brazil's discovery by Vicente Yañez Pinzón could be an insult to Brazilians and Portuguese people.</p>
<p>In the Spanish Empire, as example, many explorers were portuguese: <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Magellan_63f8.html" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Cabrillo_b6ed.html" title="Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo">Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo</a> (João Rodrigues Cabrilho), etc. The own Columbus was probably genovesian. Hernán Cortés had 300.000 Amerindian allies and only 100 soldiers. Idem with the Tercios españoles in Europe, bankers, etc.</p>
<p>On the other side, all the brazilians are not of portuguese origin, too. See <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Brazil_e290.html" title="Demographics of Brazil">Demographics of Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>The debate exists, and we can't deny by nationalism. Where would be the truth?</p>
<p><br />
___</p>
<p>Grimferrer, tell any Brazilian or Portuguese that Brazil was discovered by anyone else rather than <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral_6e54.html" title="Pedro Álvares Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a>, and let me know if they agree with it. As I mentioned before, the estuary of the Amazon River only became party of the Brazilian territory long after both Pinzón and Cabral were gone.</p>
<p>Also, all these Internet sources are dubious. Probably done by some Spaniards with sense of nationalism towards the Issue. "Who discovered Brazil" is a discussion that normally takes place in little bars on the streets of Galicia, where elder Spanish and Portuguese people keep debating (with nostalgy) which country is more influential.</p>
<p>____</p>
<p>Well, I'm not expert about issue. I will read about it later. Ah, I've reverted <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_%C3%81lvares_Cabral_6e54.html" title="Pedro Álvares Cabral">Pedro Álvares Cabral</a></p>

<p>From Época, <a href="http://epoca.globo.com/especiais/500anos/esp20000124.htm" class="external text" title="http://epoca.globo.com/especiais/500anos/esp20000124.htm" rel="nofollow">Em memória do navegante andaluz Cidade pernambucana antecipa a celebração do Descobrimento, que atribui ao espanhol Pinzón</a>&#160;:</p>
<p>"A presença do navegador espanhol em terras pernambucanas é questão controvertida, mas poucos duvidam de que tenha pisado em território brasileiro antes dos portugueses".</p>
<p>"Ao desembarcar numa ponta da atual Praia do Paraíso, em Pernambuco, o navegador batizou-a de Cabo de Santa Maria de la Consolación e lavrou o termo de posse. O documento só não foi oficialmente reconhecido devido ao Tratado de Tordesilhas, assinado em 1494 por Espanha e Portugal, dividindo entre as duas potências territórios conhecidos ou por descobrir".</p>
<p>"Já no dia do desembarque reabasteceu as caravelas e seguiu costa acima até o Cabo Orange, no extremo norte do país. Na foz do Amazonas, impressionou-o o tamanho do rio, que batizou de Mar Dulce. Dali, navegou até o Caribe e voltou em seguida à Europa com uma fortuna em pau-brasil, topázio, canela e animais exóticos".</p>
<p>"A versão foi contestada por um livro do historiador cearense Capistrano de Abreu, para quem Pinzón efetivamente pisou as areias do Cabo de Santo Agostinho. "Infelizmente, o primeiro capítulo da História do Brasil é também o mais obscuro e mal contado", lamenta a historiadora Maria do Socorro Ferraz, da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. Ela coordena uma equipe de dez técnicos que vasculha o Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino, em Portugal. O projeto, apoiado numa verba de R$ 500 mil, trará ao Brasil cerca de 300 mil documentos relativos ao período colonial. "Sem a paixão nacionalista de portugueses e espanhóis, os brasileiros se abstêm ao remontar essa confusa parte da História", argumenta".</p>
<p>"Não podemos contar a História em função do Tratado de Tordesilhas", pondera o pesquisador amador. "Está na hora de mexer nesse vespeiro." Em novembro, Santo Agostinho tornou-se "município irmão" de Palos de la Frontera, terra natal de Pinzón.</p>
<p>____ Well, when it says that "poucos duvidam de que tenha pisado em território brasileiro antes dos portugueses". I would mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only people from Pernambuco thinks so.</li>
<li>Even if that is the case, once again, that was NOT BRAZIL at the time. It was annexed. So what?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me put it this way: <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliningrad.html" title="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a> is a province in the Middle of Europe that belongs to Russia (anexed by Russia during Soviet times). This doesn't mean, that Russia was founded by King <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottokar_II_d36b.html" title="Ottokar II">Ottokar II</a>, does it?</p>
<p>_______</p>
<ul>
<li>The historical truth is not a show of hands. Did you know if this people from Pernambuco have any proof (prueba)?</li>
<li>According to wikipedia, "the first permanent Portuguese settlement [...] São Vicente was founded in 1532". After only two years, "In 1534, Dom João III, king of Portugal created the Hereditary Captaincies. Pernambuco, one of these captaincies, was granted to Duarte Coelho. ", so Pernambuco would not be an annexed territory. It would be a Captaincies of the original Brazil.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I was surprised to red "After Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva came to power 2004 January 1st, the government has changed economic policies. The economy is growing again, and is expected to do so for the forseeable future." All observers agree that the macro economic policies were maintained. Maybe they were exacerbeted... The central bank was put in the hands of someone from of Cardoso's party and The Lula government concluded it first year with a negative growht!</p>

<dd>Did you ever consider that there was a relatively recent change in the brazilian educational curriculum? I am brazilian, and although this has never come to my attention, I was just discussing this with someone from an earlier generation and he seemed pretty familiar with Vicente Pinzón. Also, are either of you defending this point of view actually historians? I hardly think elementary school knowledge should take precedence when writing an encyclopedia article. However this strays from common sense, there is no reason to blindly reject the idea, instead of doing further research on it. The subject is at least controversial, such controversy deserves at least a mention within the article to acquire a neutral point of view other than that of what schools teach as national history. The case is, there's an official version of the story, yet there is a whole context to be considered when talking about the great navigations. Looking deeper into history, we know Brazil's discovery was far from unintentional, as is thaught to kids nowadays. I'd just like to point out that it is a shame to let any piece of knowledge or research that is different from your "secular consensus", fade away out of close-mindedness. To find the truth, one must always question and consider every point of view. I'd also like to remind those who defend that it was not Brazillian territory, or that it was not a "discovery", that it is a case of semantics, while you do not consider that the official discovery of Brazil, other people in the world might have different conceptions than you and actually disagree. There are reports about several expeditions that might have arrived in brazilian territory before Cabral, such as João Coelho da Porta da Cruz, Duarte Pacheco Pereira, Diogo de Lepe and the oh so controversial Pinzón. Why are these incidents not deserving of mention in any form? Why should wikipedia readers be shielded from this knowledge? I think a proper solution should be found to achieve a true neutral point of view. While I would agree to make a compromise and allow further detailing and recognition of the "official" point of view, the other versions are AT LEAST deserving of mention. I expect a reasonable reconsideration.</dd>

CIA factbook "estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS;" I've read this and I must admit it came as a shock that such misconception was still being disseminated in such, let's say, "dependable" website. I had heard about several conflicts between Brazil's front aginst AIDS/HIV and what had been proposed but Mr. Bush, but to say that Brazil has 3% less people than predicted by US Census because of the high death rate in AIDS is ludicrous. I am not denying there has a problem but it's far from being the main cause of death in Brazil. Poverty, violance, infitile mortality, sure, but not AIDS. I've been in the US for the past 7 years and there has been a conflict between this administration's desire to implement abstinence as the only solution to HIV and those who understand that the reality of the matter is a little bit more complicated than that.

<p><b>Problem in the Major Issues of the Economy section</b></p>
<p>I've spoted the following text in the major issues part of the Economy section:</p>
<p><i>Also the concept of private property, although protected by the Brazilian constitution, has been disrespected recently [6], common fact in developing countries that burdens capital costs of companies. The Landless Workers' Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST) stimulates a large diversity of vandalism acts against private properties, including productive and development areas. On March 08, 2006, MST sponsored an aggressive attack against Aracruz Celulose, destroying a nursery and a research center in Barra do Ribeiro, 56 km from Porto Alegre. [7]</i></p>
<p>I think there is way too much partiality in this paragraph. It is not a question of whether you like or not the MST, it is a question of remaining impartial. Talking about invasions and actions of "vandalism" (this conveys too much of a harsh image) is one thing (when proper references are supplied), however deriving from that that the "concept of private property has been disrespected" and that this "burdens the capital costs of companies" is a bit too much.</p>
<p>More than that, I think proper attention should also be given to the movement itself and to its supporters. Moreover, it is also important to note that that property is not defined in Brazil as it is in many other countries and that the definition of property does not follow a clear pattern throughout all developed countries (in fact, in some european countries, like The Netherlands, invasion of uninhabited houses is legal!).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The name 'Brazil'</span></h2>
<p><i>Named after brazilwood, a local tree</i></p>
<p>Does anyone have any information on this? I was under the impression that Brazilwood was named after Brazil, not the other way around. I've also heard allegations that the name Brazil is somehow related to 'Hy Braseal', some Celtic legend. I don't know how true that is. --<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBletch_389c.html" title="User:Bletch">Bletch</a> 13:52, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, for what I have studied in school (being myself Brazilian), our country is named after the wood.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps Brazil come from a heraldy ancient french word for red color, so that is the color of the ink took from brazilwood.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please! Avoid these irish things. There IS a celtic legend about Saint Brandon (is that his name?) and a island called Brazil (see <i><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil_%28movie%29.html" title="Brazil (movie)">Brazil (movie)</a></i>) Although, Brazil was named after Brazilwood. In Portuguese (Pau-Brasil), it is related with the word Brasa (ember). <b>Brasil</b> is something like <i>emberish</i>. (notice that we do not use this word currently).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Brazil is definately named after the Brazil tree (Pau Brasil): Here is Brazil's sequence of names&#160;: Terra de Santa Cruz (because of the southern cross constellation), Terra de Vera Cruz (the 'true cross' ) and Brazil, which was NOT a 'given' name but one that was adopted from common use _ a terra do brazil _ meaning the land of brazil wood, since pau brasil was at the time the main export and source of revenue for Portugal. The Brazil wood has a charateristic deep red colour . As mentioned already, the word for ember in Portuguese is 'brasa'. Also the reference url given for this version of the name Brazil is based on hear say and is given by an american who lives in Arizona and does not claim to be a historian or an expert. I highly doubt that the portuguese at the time were at all aware of celtic legends.... As to french heraldic names it would be helpfull if we were told the actual french word. French and Portuguese are latin languages and have common roots. However I do not think the Portuguese wold have adopted a name based on anything french at the time since they were colonial competitors and the french more than once tried to occupy brazilian territory (as did the Dutch also).</dd>
<dd>I really think this entry should be edited, the main reason for it being, as I said before, that Brazil was not a 'chosen, given' name but was adopted from commom use decades after the actual 'discovery' and is based on economical circumstances. I'm brazilian.</dd>

<dd>First of all I would like to know whether the two maps differ in presentation or in matter. Are there any any differences in international / maritime boundaries depicted in the two maps. I could not see any, but I might have missed some. If not, I feel the CIA map is much better as it is less cluttered.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Brazilian city names -- standardized disambiguation?</span></h2>
<p>Attention all Brazilian and Brazilian-interested editors. <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curitiba.html" title="Curitiba">Curitiba</a> is located at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curitiba.html" title="Curitiba">Curitiba</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manaus.html" title="Manaus">Manaus</a> is at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manaus.html" title="Manaus">Manaus</a>, and that's all well and good. But when it's necessary to disambiguate a location, the Brazilian cities are currently using a number of different systems. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/%C3%A3/o/S%C3%A3o_Paulo%2C_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_bf23.html" title="São Paulo, São Paulo">São Paulo, São Paulo</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Let's pick one method, standardize on it, and record the decision in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28city_names%29_4643.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (city names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (city names)</a>. Taking Coimbra as an example, the options would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coimbra, Brazil -- transparent to foreigners, but problematic if there turns out to be another Coimbra in (eg) Paraná.</li>
<li>Coimbra, Minas Gerais or Coimbra, MG -- the US/Canada "comma convention".</li>
<li>Coimbra (Minas Gerais) or Coimbra (MG) -- using the domestic abbreviation/format. Probably not very transparent to foreigners, but the (parenthetical) helps make pipe-linking much easier.</li>
<li>Coimbra, MG, Brazil -- no chance of confusion at all, but makes for very lengthy article names.</li>
<li>Others?</li>
</ol>
<p>We could of course have redirects from any number of the alternatives, but it would be useful to set a standard for the article locations themselves. And standardize now, to avoid a lot more work later. My vote, as an outsider, would be for #2, for clarity's sake and because it's a very familiar format for English-speakers, but perhaps the force of local custom would decide it in favor of #3.

<p>Alex Gomes 23:17, 25 February 2006 (UTC)If you feel that the convention naming is that important, go for it, create a system. I doubt that the brazilians including myself would honestly be willing to accept it. The different systems are there for a reason and it is to make life easier. If we choose one single method, it will obviously create confusion, so why dont we leave as it is and let us be bothered about something more important? As far as brazilians are concerned the current system works just fine.</p>

<p>As a Brazilian I can't agree with this statement&#160;:"Blacks are a significant minority". What are we missing here? Ok, we don't have a clear distinction between black and mixed race as we are so diverse and racially mixed, but it is ridiculous to believe that in Brazil Blacks or half-blacks/Mixed-blacks(?) are a minority.</p>
<p><a name="Racial_Diversity" id="Racial_Diversity"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Racial Diversity</span></h2>
<p>While I understand that this article has been written fot an english audience, I still find it colonized by the use of some "politically correct" terms the US insinsts of applying worldwide. "Afro-Brazilian" is a disrespect, a cultural submission, incorrect, and also not used (thank god) widely.</p>
<p>In Brazil, there isnt a tenth of the racial tension that exists on US. Surely, racism exists, but to a much milder extent. As noted elsewhere on the text, the very palpable discrimination that exists on brazilian society is that of the social status. Also, there are important differences in the naming of non-white people; The equivalent of <i>negroe</i> (in portuguese: negro) is preffered to refer to people of dark skin. The use of <i>black</i> (portuguese: preto) is considered highly offensive and charged with racism. A popular T-shirt is one that says "Preto é cor, negro é raça" (Black is a color, negro is a race). Even more, brazilians think of themselves as a single block of people, even if diverse. Thus its unnatural for a brazilian to think of himself as Afro-brazilian, when he prefers to be called just brazilian, as the rest of the population does. You dont see people on the street claiming "Im portuguese-brazilian", "arab-brazilian" or "ukranian-brazilian". Therefore, the "political correctness" (which is euphemism for euphemism) in using the US -created "Afro-" prefix is completely unnecessary. The other people of darker skin are sometimes called collectively "morenos" (which loosely translates to brunnetes[-skin wise]).</p>
<p>Also, I saw no note on the article that says that "Mulato" is the mixing of white and black races, "Mameluco" is the mixing of native indian and black races, and "Cafuzo" is the mixing of indian and white races. "Mestiço" (which means "mixed") would be the mixing of any one of these. <a href="../../../l/t/d/User%7ELtDoc_16d4.html" title="User:LtDoc">LtDoc</a> 13:32, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree pretty much enteirly with you LtDoc (except for the "preto" part, some people don't mind and / or don't think it's tinted with racism, so it's not universily held as a racist classification, albite a significant portion of people do), but I don't think we should change the entier article. Instead, we should probably make these observations and clarifications at the start of the article, because otherwise we run risk of entering a revert war with people who don't agree. In any case, we should step lightly on such changes.</p>
<p>While I agree with your sentiment, yoour use of the word "equivalent" is way off. Because negroe is offensive in English and Preto is offensive in Portuguese, these are the real "equivalents" and proper translations. The same idea holds true for "Black" and "Negro." So, the solution would be to simply use these terms correctly in within their source language and forget about spelling similarities between the "incorrect translation" pairs negroe-negro and black-preto.</p>
<p>Also, your comment has left off the most common self-identifier of all - pardo. The majorty of Brazilians identified themselves as pardo in the last census. The trouble with pardo is, it's awefully hard to translate or describe in English, meaning something like "mixed race / other / darker than white and paler than black." My point is not to advocate for using pardo, but the impossibility of discussing Brazilian race in English using a language even close that that used by Brazil's supposedly color-blind society. We simply have a cultural gap on the race issue, and since this article is in english, it should probably simply follow something like American/English conventions for discussing race, along with a caviot that tries to explain that few Brazilians would discuss race in anything like the same terms.

<p>"This obvious abism between the rich and the poor is common in today's extremely globalized and culturally, economically interdependent world, and comes from external and internal means of exploration (typical effects of internationalized capitalism), driven by the United States central pole of power. This problem is incredibly accentuated in Brazil: while the brazilian rich people mantains their almost uncontested control over the State, which sees itself obliged to follow external market rules and pay the huge, massificated external debt, the privatization of State-based services advances, making it harder and harder for Brazil to assume control of it's own social disparities."</p>

<dl>
<dd>I strongly disagree with the proposal of removing the paragraph. This "perspective" is based on simple and solid observation of the country's reality. The previous text wasn't even an analysis (and a subject like poverty absolutely requires analysis). Beyond that, I say the text wasn't neutral at all. It presented a mainstream, ideologically corrupted, superficial view of the problem. It wasn't descriptive: on the contrary, the text contained typical right wing arguments, trying to transform complex social mechanisms into problems that appear from the present, with no roots or connections with any social, historical context. Don't make it invalid (and don't say it's perspectivism) because it's more analytical. A little bit of historical insight on the matter quickly shows privatization of State-based services and elitism in underveloped countries as two persistent and constant phenomenons (or do you think that's just another "point of view" too? -- globalization is not a fact?; do we or do we not live in a world of economical and political interdependence?). I urge you to note the difference between the history automatically injected and imposed by those who win wars and a true contextual analysis of a reality. Reality of the powerful and the poor. The abysm exists, it's there, it's not a vague concept (can you deny that?). It's not trough acceptance of what's agreed and settled that you will achieve that so-called "neutrality". This is fake. There is no neutrality when your argument has no purpose. And the previous text, as I wrote, doesn't just denote the facts, objectively. It imposes the mainstreamed argument, which is less neutral than anything. It is based on a small piece of the ideology on which our world was built upon. Look at the results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have to change it, then do it by the book and transform the paragraph into a thesis. Call it, lets say, "Thesis 1". Then, based on research and discussion, make "Thesis 2", and maybe "Thesis 3". For now, you could just make a subtitle called "The roots of poverty" and put it in there, with a notice capable of clarifying that this is what you call a given perspective. --Ww2 20:43, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok. I rewrote the whole thing, based on the general toughts of authors and intellectuals, including Milton Santos and Demétrio Magnoli (both brazilian, which makes sense). I didn't really use any information or thesis provided specifically by these two autors, but I tried to translate the uttermost idea of this "point of view". I think the text still has its flaws, but you have to agree it's a lot more NPOV compatible than before, since now it clearly exposes perspectives that do exist and are shared/formalized by brazilian intellectuals (perspectives shared by a whole segment, obviously, not just one or another individual). Suggestions are welcome, in case you don't want to directly edit the text. Do you think it can be kept now? With a little more improvement, maybe? Anyway, you may say it exceeded the theme of poverty... I disagree with that in advance, since, from this given "point of view", poverty in underdeveloped countries and globalization are profoundly and intrinsically related. --Ww2 21:30, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it's much improved now, because at the very least, anyone reading this will know from whom this type of analyses and conclusions come from (and may be able to judge if they agree/disagree, look them up…). However, I still disagree with most of the conclusions presented and I, unfortunately, disagree with that it hasn't exceeded the subject matter. Personally, I think we should divide the text into two: a more "descriptive" text and an analytical one. The first would be put into the main page, where we would concentrate on putting forwards the basic facts and then creating a new page where we can present the multiple views points on the subject (we could create a page like "Causes of poverty on under-developed countries"), putting a link on the main page to the new page. That way, this page won't be contaminated with the clearly NPOV that both of us possess, while still allowing for a presentation of our different POV's. For now, we should leave as it is and await further comments, at the very least because of your pretty good effort at leaving it more NPOV compatible.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo200_7ba1.html" title="User:Vertigo200">Vertigo200</a> 20:37, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with your very good suggestion of splitting the theme of poverty in Brazil and other underveloped countries (but I still think the focus should remain on Brazil) in "basic facts" (and that should be composed mainly of socio-economic statistics, and not only the typically used purely market-related ones, since these banalize the theme -- statistics preferably coming from multiple sources, making it possible for the matter to be properly considered and further understood) and "analytical" as a separated page. But why do you disagree with the conclusions (talking freely now)? To me they find perfect matching when put up against historical facts and evolution of the human condition (and I'm talking about simple phenomenons that are not necessarily bound to any kind of arbitrary understanding of how things developed: like the existence of a ruling class, like capitalism as a "device" that inherently, necessarily, feeds from exploitation, since it is by nature based on competition... or the domain of alienation trough cultural means... aren't those matters of fact, literal concepts that you can learn from observation of the ends and means?). I think that, in some way, calling something that truly works against the <i>status quo</i> a "point of view" has more roots in alienation itself than on pursuing any level of neutrality (I mean, points of view do exist, obviously, but follow what I'm trying to say). People seem to unconsciously caracterize everything that goes deeper into analysis as arbitrary points of view, instead of doing analysis themselves (as in Dictionary.com: "analyze - to examine methodically by separating into parts and studying their interrelations"). Most base their "understanding" of the world in completely arbitrary views, imposed and self-imposed concepts that, even if not intentionally, serve the interests of keeping things as they are (and you have to agree with me... poverty, wars, an abysm between rich and poor, death everywhere... those are punctual consequences that, theoretically, don't exactly appeal to a large amount of people). And if a mentality, a point of view, inevitably servers the purpose of keeping things as they are (and that can be concluded after doing minor evaluation of that specific mentality and admitting the simple implicit fact that consequences must have a cause -- no need for subjectivism here, since you don't have to see too far to know someone must be poor for some other one to be rich) isn't that point of view fake? Anyway, it seems very clear to me that the human race, considering we have rationality, making us, therefore, primarily social beings, can only truly coexist without the need for killing. So, after all, what point of view is more true: the one that necessarily involves killing and keeping the interests of few, keeping the <i>status quo</i> (which one seeks to keep the <i>status quo</i>? As I said before, this is no hard conclusion to be made: it's the one that comes from capitalism, since capitalism <i>is</i> the <i>status quo</i>), or the one that, trough peace, not war, seeks equality, erasing social contradictions and therefore, erasing the need for war? It's all a question of considering the effects means have on ends, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Of course Wikipedia must pursue "neutrality" trough multiplicity of opinions. But it's a thin line that divides what could be easily considered fact and what's actually coming from alienation or/and lack of analysis (to exemplify: can the economy statistics we see in regular newspapers, and I mean <i>only</i> punctual market statistics, be considered solid truth? I mean, they are facts, aren't they? But even being true facts they still impose a given view of truth, the mainstream view, which is naturally going to be propagated as unconscious truth). I mean, there is a clear need for differenciating what's plural, what's carries multiplicity, and what does not. Anyway, this was all for the sake of discussion (and I hope you and more people argue here, since this is, I suppose, a truly important question for the concept and future of this free encyclopedia).--Ww2 00:08, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just made some major alterations and removed virtually all of the contested material. I would like ask that we discuss it here in some detail before placing it back into the article. Presenting the ideas of Marxists as if they are true, in an economic analysis, is first, about as scientific as presenting the ideas of Homeopaths as if they are true, in an analysis of health. That is to say, these are highly controversial and non-mainstream views, and should at the very minimum be labelled as such.</dd>

<dd>Well, I meant no offense. Ww2 had written "Capitalism's typical production relations, as described by Karl Marx, are based on principles of exploitation of work in order to generate profit for the exploiter. To many intellectuals these principles would take place not only locally, inside a factory or office, but globally, between countries: the relation of exploitation would manifest itself under the larger spectrum of an interdependent, globalized world." I don't know what to call that, other than a Marxist analysis. --<a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemalu_349c.html" title="User:Anemalu">Anemalu</a> 10:40, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This is totaly biased and non-objective. The title of the section is "Poverty and Lack of literacy", and it quotes Karl Marx with what goal? To illustrate the country's reality?

<p>Now, as regard for Ww2 question as to what I think, unfortunately, I must admit that I have a POV so completely different from yours that I don't know where even to begin! You might say that I have a POV that conforms with what the mainstream point of view is (I do have a degree in economics after all...)</p>
<p>To begin with, I'd point out to you that calling the "mainstream view" as having lack of analyses and / or alienation is to complete discredit such analyses, rendering them false from the start and pointless to debate. But that’s far from the truth, there is a rich and complex analyses (with which you may disagree entirely) behind this POV, so please don't treat it as being false or else we won't have much of a discussion! =] Regarding your specific example, economic statistics, I'd say they aren't the <i>Truth</i>, far from it, but they are what I consider to be the best estimates regarding certain aspects of an economy. They always have a degree of imprecision within them, but there's nothing else (better) we can use.</p>
<p>I think I understand your point, that since they are formulated / aggregated from a mainstream point of view, they may be false if you considerer that point of view to be false, but if you don't take that as a common ground, then what is a common ground for you? We have to have some sort of starting point from which we can debate, and if you don't accept something like that as a common ground, then unfortunately there will be no debate, because that means we stand a diametrically different positions. If that's to be the case, then I simply propose we improve the "facts page" (contained in this article) and create the POV page as I suggested, presenting our different POV's. Until then, I hope that an edit war doesn’t begin because of the recent changes. I would ask everyone to ask / tell before they make changes to article, so as to not have the situation leap out of control. One last thing: Ww2, I'm pretty sure you're Brazilian and since I am too, fell free to communicate with me in Portuguese if you fell like it.--<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo200_7ba1.html" title="User:Vertigo200">Vertigo200</a> 16:07, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Incredible how Mr. Ip Adress just showed us his deturped view on social contradictions (that if he does think social contradictions exist) and classified the analytical one I wrote (giving proper references and making it clear it was a point of view, and a point of view shared by authors, which can actually be verified) as "Marxist", automatically dumping it in the trash with his Delete key. Well, I say your view on brazilian agriculture (saying absurdly contraditory and VERY discussable things like "the mechanization of agricultural techniques is alleviating conditions of poverty" -- this DOES NOT happen if the State doesn't direct the money to "social alleviation") is CAPITALIST. Basically, what you did was intentionally incorporate to the article a view that IS discussed and contested troughout people in the area, without giving any references to make it clear it wasn't simply what you tought... your political view (I'm refering to what you wrote in the agriculture-related paragraph).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know the text wasn't perfectly descriptive yet, but it was coming to be. What you just did is censorship. You censored a different perspective (yes, the text was written, as I said, with the intention of making it clear it was a perspective, and not the truth).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to do anything just now, so no "edit war" is started. But you should have respected what we were planning to accomplish (which you should have read in the discussion above) or should at least have warned us before doing anything so drastical.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Vertigo200, in relation to our discussion, I can't consider "common ground" something that does not make any logical sense for me (the "mainstream view", which, logically speaking, is obviously the force, being it cultural or political, that, in my understanding, alienates people in order to keep things as they are, preserving interests of few). Our perspectives have obviously taken completely different ways. But what I was asking you (when I explained what I tough of the matters discussed) was why do you think it's not correct to see capitalism as a system with interdependencies (isn't that thesis applicable even within the scope of economics?) that cause a more powerful country to exploit another; why do you not agree capitalism bases itself on exclusion and competition (you can't accept that even when seeing a glance of the present situation in the news, with countries that are underveloped and countries that are developed, with rich and poor people and poor working for rich?)? I feel those are punctual affirmations... it shouldn't be hard for you or anyone with knowledge of the facts to explain why they are false or not (there is a logical "why", isn't there?).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, anyway, what I mean to say can be summed up by our friend's prepotency: he promptly classified an analysis on history and social roots of poverty as not "scientific" enough and showed how the mainstream (and mainstream doesn't mean true and less compromised, lets remember that) view of the world can be easily accepted as the only "serious" one, whereas a critical view suffers with the prejudice of yers of unquestioned socially-acquired premises.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well that's all well and good, and a perfectly fine starting point for a polemical essay. But this is an encyclopedia, and therefore fringe views should not be presented as fact. The vast majority of people see the incredible advances in wealth being brought about by technological change and warmly embrace these changes as our best hope for alleviating poverty. Are they wrong? Let us imagine that perhaps they are. Nonetheless, it is not the job of Wikipedia to present, as fact, something that is clearly highly contentious (and, to my mind, quite simply and transparently false). As I said, this material would be perfectly appropriate for an article entitled something like Marxist views on Brazilian poverty -- not for the main Brazil article.--<a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemalu_349c.html" title="User:Anemalu">Anemalu</a> 10:45, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to reiterate my disagreement with Pinecco and Anemalu: The first one mentioned above that this encyclopedia shouldn't contain political points of view. Now I ask: how can a subject like poverty NOT be approached from a political perspective? How do you actually PROVE that a non-analytical (statistics, post-card pictures, maps, agribusiness information with no contestation = INFORMATION BEING SELECTED) approach on a matter IS NOT political? How come a mainstreamed view be more right and more acceptable to the purpose of Wikipedia just because it's accepted by most? Is this knowledge or acceptance?</p>
<p>The NPOV policy makes it very clear: multiple points of view should be presented, not supressed. It also states that "neutrality" is not achievable trough information itself. It can be achieved trough multiplicity: presenting every possible perspective, if that perspective is relevant (of course perspectives based on obvious prejudice, for instance, should be supressed, there has to be a consensus on such things, don't you agree?). I don't see how an analysis that has manifestations troughout the speech of important intelectuals, that is FORMALIZED, can't be considered serious or "scientifical" enough.</p>
<p>I agree in every way that any political perspective should be presented as something OTHERS say, not what this encyclopedia says. That was the goal (before someone decided to censor it).</p>
<p>But making a page called "Marxist view on poverty" would be the same as relegating this perspective as not worthy enough to be on a main page, saying, based on nothing (other than your radical disagreement), that it's not serious and therefore shouldn't be put in the same level of the mandatory shallowness. Isn't that judging already? Why don't you delete the poverty subtitle altogether, and concretize this as a touristic page?--201.6.165.229 00:05, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on Brazil, specifically, but this looks to me an awful lot like arguments that have been around for 40 or 50 years about <a href="../../../d/e/p/Dependency_Theory_f771.html" title="Dependency Theory">Dependency Theory</a> and World System theory (see <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Wallerstein_bfc9.html" title="Immanuel Wallerstein">Immanuel Wallerstein</a>), with some Brazil-specific set of issues, primarily having to do with the agricultural base and perhaps the structure of national politics. I think if this article is going to take on the issue of povery in Brazil (beyond noting that it's fairly widespread and that the difference between rich and poor is fairly acute and has increased a bit over time), you have to acknowledge that the arguments about the sources of poverty are contested. I think it's okay to note that there's a fairly broad level of popular political revolt and that analysts don't necessary agree on what the best solution to the problem is. But a bit here that says "...according to scholars, including Ronald Chilcote, the problem is best described as [something]....while Richard Graham has argued [something else]...and William Summerhill says [something else still]..." seems like it could work here. Just recogize that there's a debate here, give it a few paragraphs, and root in in the scholarship.

<dd>It is a common misconception that Brazilians can speak and do speak Spanish. The ones that do, are only because they studied it or somehow had an exposure to the language (such as living close to border with Uruguay), otherwise, they speak Spanish as Pepe Lew Pew speaks French&#160;:). Spanish and Portuguese languages might sound similar, but they have several 'false friends' as well grammatical and phonetical differences. Also, do we really need to point the CIA factbook to make a point in this case?&#160;;)</dd>

<dd>To clear things up a bit, Spanish is not a common second language here (I'd say that English is much more so), though the similarities between the languages mean that communication is possible between people who speak Portuguese and Spanish.

<dd>Brazilians that live in borders of Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia is very common speak spanish - because the cities of borders has integrated commerce, comunity and schools.

<p>Just so you all know, the current presitent recently passed a law to make Spanish part of the official corriculum as well (along with English).

<p>I was missing a reference to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portunhol.html" title="Portunhol">Portunhol</a> here... That's probably what most (on both sides) speak when they want to communicate, unless they have learned the other language just like any other foreign language. <a href="../../../g/%C3%AA/_/User%7EG%C3%AA_bb6b.html" title="User:Gê">Gê</a> 16:15, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just made some small edits to the language section. While some mutual comprehension is possible between Spanish and Portuguese (I tried once in Portugal when I only spoke Spanish - it's pretty much only good for getting directions), you really can't call that a language. Portunhol, as a dialect/language however, is worth mentioning. So rather than focus on the dubious "very similar"nature of the two languages, I re-worded the whole issue. I also changed "very few" to "relatively few" for the who learns English. Perhaps it's just because I know a lot of lawyers and doctors in Sao Paulo, but this seems like a bit of an insult - more Brazilians have a usable fluency in English than Americans attain in any foreign langauge.</p>
<p>Well, to my knowledge, if you have portuguese of spanish as your mothertongue, you can comunicate with somebody that speaks the other language, as long as you DO NOT try to speak the other language. For example, if you speak Portuguese, and meet somebody that speaks Spanish, do not try to speak Spanish, but speak Portuguese, in a slow pace and he will understand you(at least in my experience). I belive that it works this way, because both languages share similar words, but they are more used in one then another, so with a more in depth knowledge of one language, you can understand the other one. This will not work on your case, because you dont really have a big vocabulary on Spanish, making the chance of words that you know having a similar meaning in Portuguese even smaller.</p>

<dd>"Civil right violations are an issue almost everywhere"...This kind of sentence really surprises me. In all developed countries, a civil/individual right violation is a scandal. Anyway, the comment citing that "bugs on politicians is not a serious issue" also scares me. But , in addition to that, I must say that ordinary people, companies and press/media institutions have been recently threatened by this tool. Violation rights is not o POV issue -what really shows how Brazilians are immature when dealing with this subjetc. It is an important issue to be commented in the article. Agree with Fbergo when he says that is a current event - but that for undevelopded countries. Nobody wants "specific cases". What I want is a clear sentence indicating constant lack of respect individuals rights. I was asked some reference, and I mentioned them. The article is really uncomplete. Again I say, Wikipedia is not place for nationalisms...forget your proud. Let's focus on reality. That is the objetive of an encyclopedia. Cloretti 14:25, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my view, a bug on a politician telephone is much less important than a massacre like Corumbiara's (the umn.edu link above posted by 200.160.104.250), but I sounded like it was "normal" and "acceptable", and I apologize for that. Cases like Corumbiara aren't "common" (they don't happen everyday). Urban violence (as depicted by the web.amnesty.org link provided by 200.160.104.250 above) is more common in Brazil. Its causes and reasoning are complex (the amnesty makes it look like the police is the only wrong party, there are wrongs on every side - the police using unnecessary violence, the favela people who help the drug traffickers and cover up for them, and the traffickers). If anyone can find a link with yearly stats on rights abuse, go on and add a paragraph based on citeable sources. I've done a quick check on the wikipedia articles of several African countries (Namibia, Angola, Ethiopia...) and few of them cite human rights abuse. See <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda.html" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> for an example of citation (a deeper article can be found in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Uganda_c436.html" title="Human rights in Uganda">Human_rights_in_Uganda</a>). A section like that would be reasonable for the Brazil article, but sources are definetely needed. <a href="../../../f/b/e/User%7EFbergo_bbc4.html" title="User:Fbergo">Fbergo</a> 20:04, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please, source it, it is important. Just remember that the most of these bugs are legal and made by the police in order to investigate criminals and it is not a human rights violation.

<dd>I agree with San Martin about bugs being, im most cases, legal. But think a little bit...Not just because a legal system of a country approves, it does not characterize a violation (in international standards). Many times it DOES characterize a clear violation. I have heard that judges in Brazil authorize bugs on unconscientious basis.A really scary thing. It is like a George Orwell system. What is legal is not, many times, fair or right.

(by the way, I don't think we can blame judges for bugs that were wrongly asked by the police) But the bugging itself (used for crime investigation) cannot be characterized as a civil rights violation. If it did, you should say that being in prision for a crime is a violation of one's rights of freedom and liberty. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 16:06, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Art in Brasil</span></h2>
<p>I have been to Brasil and I understand the complexity of its social and economic problems and I know that while some are trying to solve these problems, others block their way. What I would like to draw attention to is the political and social impact of art in Brasil. This goes way back to the military dictatorship (which it challenged at some cost) but now continues to thrive in a fairly spartan economic climate (in terms of public funding. Private funding is there, but is very limited). I am surprised that nothing on this section refers to the great work going on in art in Brasil. I know the country has a lot of problems but actually, in spite of all the economic and political hardships (or maybe because of these) the fine arts in Brasil are some of the most interesting, dynamic and accessible in the world of art today. Artists use everyday materials (because they mostly lack the funds to do otherwise) and they have a richness in concepts and ideas that the northern hemisphere and the west apparently lack, which results in really challenging but engaging art that not only involves critics but also the public. Brasil is a model that the tired old west should be referring to, not feeling superior to, in its ignorance. There are many artists in Brasil who are producing work that needs (and would benefit) a wider audience. Antonio Manuel, Cildo Meireles, the late Helio Oiticica to name but seventeen. Give Brasilian artists a chance to change their world and the world.... What is art for, other than this?81.159.61.198 22:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

OK, I am a newcomer in this net and I do not know the rules! My real name is Carsten Kotas, (Via Google you will find me and my CV) Years ago I studied in Rio and I thought it is a good idea to create a website on Rio de Janeiro mainly for German speaking travellers. The site will be translated to English within the next months and contains a lot of information about Rio de Janeiro and it is sponsored like other sites via affiliate agreements with marketing partners (like others i.e. www.rioforpartiers). But the content is far far away to be spam. Please take 5 minutes and look at these pages.</p>
<p>May I suggest the following:</p>
<p>a) The site will not be placed on top of the list, but in alphabetical order in the menu "Brazil", so here you are right.</p>
<p>b) The site will not be being added several times to the same article (I will cancel the other link)</p>
<p>c) The site will not being added to several articles (only to the main article "Brazil", I will cancel the other link)</p>

<dd>The stress is caused because there are many more political and economic relations between the countries closest to us. Must I remind you of Mercosur and the attempts to broaden and improve economic and political relations between it's members?</dd>
<dd>There is also considerable stress between Brazil and Chile due to Chile's allegiance and closeness to the United States when making economic contracts and it's refusal to be part of Mercosur. Besides, that's somewhat arbitrary to say it is a coincidence just because we are in the same continent, as I am sure Brazil doesn't have any stress with other countries outside of South America for the same reason it doesn't have with Ecuador. What I am saying is that it is most natural for "tension" to occur between neighbors and countries who practice constant relations, but overall I don't agree with the whole concept of stress in the region. The whole idea just seems a little poorly sustained and far-fetched to me, but do develop your point of view so there can be a better conclusion on this. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 18:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>not necessarily. as long as the encyclopedia mentions that "Brazil" is an English spelling and that Brazilians spell the country "Brasil," it's enough IMHO. as an aside, imagine how difficult it would be to change every country name link in english to the language of the country, e.g. "Germany" to "Deutschland"; "Spain" to "España".... <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreamless_02e2.html" title="User:Streamless">Streamless</a> 19:24, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It`s worthnoting that a great part of Northeast population is composed by descents of Jews. Those people live in their majority as Catholics. There were given the name Marranos, which name in Hebrew is אנוסים (Anusím-forced-ones),during inquisitorial times. The same also applies to Minas Gerais State and Espírito Santo. Some of the are also found in Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo and Goiás.</p>

It is easy to recognize a surname of a <i>marrano</i> descendent they are normally named after trees and animals. (or even saints. Perhaps my surname, San Martín, comes from them...). But this happened before the colonization in Brazil, and nowadays they carry (almost) no inheritance from the jews.

<p>There is another theory about Brasil name. Is said that the name come from Hebrew BARZEL ברזל which meaning is iron.</p>

<dd>Indeed, <i>Barzel</i> is very similar to <i>Brazil</i>. As similar as Brezel, that means <i>Pretzel</i> in German. There also a theory remembering a celtic king.

<dd>This isn't any further from alternative theories in linguistics or astrophysics, unless he's just invented it. I actually heard about jews fleeing from the european inquisition and coming this way, being newly converted for the purpose of evading prosecution. Of course I can't cite this, so disconsider that argument. But you need to keep an open mind, history has shown itself to be able teach entire populations using unilateral points of view. While you might consider some things to be unreasonable, making a judgement and dismissing them would not be ethical, scientific or a neutral pov. Again, if he is able to cite reliable sources, he should. It's Pinzon all over again. Just because theres the institutionalized version thaught in schools, based on the portuguese version of the story, which obviously was prevalent in our country, doesn't mean that people must hear just that side of the story. Same thing happens with other issues such as the invention of the airplane. Maybe the rest of the world should dismiss Santos Dumont as gibberish, and simply accept the Wright brothers as the sole inventors. My purpose is not to divert the discussion or present an avalanche of arguments to supress you, but to state how this kind of behavior might be harmful. History is constantly rewritten, I am open to the idea to let it do so and I believe that is a forward manner of thought. And I did hear about the supposed Celtic king, but the version I heard was like this: they were phoenician navigators, and the name would come supposedly from the term "Basileus", and they would have arrived as early as the 1000s and this would have been transmitted in the native language until the portuguese explorers arrived to listen to it again. I think I even read about some inscriptions in some caves relating to that matter. Tell me you are not intrigued by that possibility. I suppose you can differentiate that from the Pretzel theory out of arbitrary language similarities, based solely on that. What I am saying is, historians themselves constantly investigate these theories, and while only people with a masters or doctors degree might have a more direct contact with them, this certainly shows up in historian circles at a college level as thought provoking trivia. In any case, this will lead us nowhere, so I will just leave the opportunity for your rebuttal if you like, and refrain from further discussion until credible sources actually arrive to legitimate it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 17:28, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The philosophical discussion was simply to make a point of how science works in human sciences, which seems a miss in this discussion. Well, here we go, I took it upon myself, and if you type in google or other search engines "Fenícios Brasil" you will get tons of websites discussing what I mentioned earlier, some examples are <a href="http://www.acasicos.com.br/html/fencios.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acasicos.com.br/html/fencios.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.libano.org.br/pagina42.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.libano.org.br/pagina42.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.novolibano.com.br/imprensa/pesquisadores_acreditam_que_fen%C3%ADcios.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.novolibano.com.br/imprensa/pesquisadores_acreditam_que_fen%C3%ADcios.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.vidhya-virtual.com/Vidhya3/antigahistoria_intro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vidhya-virtual.com/Vidhya3/antigahistoria_intro.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ufoburn@yahoogrupos.com.br/msg03309.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mail-archive.com/ufoburn@yahoogrupos.com.br/msg03309.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, some of these cite published works. These are far from original research, as I had nothing to do with these works. These are not an assorted collection of everything since it pertains to the subject. I believe citing those policies are either a far fetched attempt to dismiss the argument or a missinterpretation. Does it matter? Yes if you care about the content on wikipedia. As you can see, the brazilian history is not that well documented, as your average brazilian would have no clue as to who Pinzón is, or anything about the phoenicians arriving here that early. Well, maybe it is well documented, just not well known. You could say that it deserves a new article, but I prefer articles merged into one big article, sometimes people just read the short version which often misses the point or omits opinion changing facts. In any case, discussing this subject in this article is still justified. This accepts mainstream Cabral theory according to whom? Not only I disagree with that, I also accuse it of openly using mainstream BIAS, and is therefore not neutral. I have yet to see other articles that omit other theories being discussed in the scientific community to stick with the mainstream version. While I am not saying we should go deep with this, it is deserving of mention if we want a better article with more information. If we were to make a compromise, what is, in my opinion, undesirable, then yes, I will do something along the lines as the section in <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilha_do_Brasil" class="external text" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilha_do_Brasil" rel="nofollow">this article from the portuguese wiki</a> which has many of the examples discussed here earlier, maybe translating some of it to english.

<p>Not at the moment, but I'll look into it in a few days. The link is interesting. I had read something similar. I think there's a website which calls Brazil "a name waiting for a place to name", or something like that. However:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Despite the myths surrounding it, belief in the island was so strong that several expeditions left to search for it in the late <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_century.html" title="Fifteenth century">fifteenth century</a>, the last led by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cabot_6901.html" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a>. Some claimed to have seen the island, or even landed on it, the last supposed sighting being in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>. Roderick O’Flaherty in <i>A Chorographical Description of West or H-Iar Connaught</i> (1684) tells us "There is now living, Morogh O'Ley, who immagins he was himself personally on O'Brasil for two days, and saw out of it the iles of Aran, Golamhead, Irrosbeghill, and other places of the west continent he was acquainted with."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This gives the impression that Cabot himself set sail to search for the mythical Celtic island. But, looking at <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH33/croxto33.html" class="external text" title="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH33/croxto33.html" rel="nofollow">the sources of the article</a>, there's no confirmation of that. The goal of his voyage seems to have been the same as that of the voyage of Columbus: to find a passage to the spice lands, this time through northern latitudes. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilipeS_f1e1.html" title="User:FilipeS">FilipeS</a> 18:28, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>O.K. I looked it up. In the 7th edition of his etymological dictionary (1995) J.P. Machado argues that the common name <i>brasil</i> probably comes from Italian <i>brasile</i>, itself from the Arabic name for a kind of plant with which a yellow-red dye was produced, or from an adjective which designated the colour of that dye. The full explanation is several paragraphs long. I can quote it if you wish, but I don't know if that would go against Wikipedia's copyright policies... <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilipeS_f1e1.html" title="User:FilipeS">FilipeS</a> 15:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Brazil simplified</span></h2>
<p>Reading this article quickly reveals it is essentially a extremely poor, streamlined vision of today's Brazil. (Plurality and knowledge-wise). Please, let me make my point and then you can throw my arguments out to the dogs.</p>
<p>For the people who wrote the major part of this which is now regarded as "a good article": did you consider that the "CIA Factbook" and whatevever touristic guide you took as research elements are not the only (and certainly not the most neutral) sources of so-called "fact"? There are numerous well-known brazilian (or foreigners) antropologists, historians and philosophers that wrote on Brazil and didn't limit themselves to carnival, soccer and (under the presented scheme) meaningless numbers. If this was actually a printed publication, anyone with reasonably deep and concise notions would contest this page's lack of purpose and incapacity of offering any room for critical interpretation.</p>
<p>I tell you this as Brazilian: the aggroupment of everything written in this article seems utterly ridiculous for someone that has lived here for a long enough period of time and has had a mind just open enough to acquire a intelectually mature level of notion as to what is our reality.</p>
<p>Enormous disparities of living (like known sources announce, Brazil is third in the ranking of income concentration) that are paradoxal when considering the whole of our development state: as your fact-trained mind is probably aware, Brazil is between the bigger world economies and is the largest soy bean exporter. Now, answer me that: could a foreign, using Wikipedia to research about Brazil for his school paper on underdeveloped countries, assert such paradox by following nude, totally segregated statistics? How is that "facts", "facts", numbers and more "facts" are capable of actually providing instruction and means of independent thinking?</p>
<p>Behind all there is to Brazil there are numerous factors: internal and external edemas. I'm not naming such factors, this is discussable and would be subject for larger discussions. But this article is failure even in scratching the surface of such complexities. How is this plurality?</p>
<p>Doesn't the principle of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> (Neutral point of view), agreeably Wikipedia's most important policy, clearly states that plurality - aka all or at least the most relevant point of views - must be presented?</p>
<p>Exerted from the NPOV policy page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views. The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these are fairly presented, but not asserted. <b>All significant points of view are presented, not just the</b></i> <b>most popular one<i>. It is not asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one.</i></b> <i>Readers are left to form their own opinions.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>What is happening here? By sliding through the article's page all you see are howling postal card photos, carnival with all its typically brazilian beauties. Completing a synthetization of the very usual North Americanized view of our world, you are offered contextually disconnected statistics (no history behind, no relation of cause and effect, not even the slightest possibility of allowing the reader any social criticism). Even on the consolidated fact part this article appears to be biased: most of it deals with diversion subjects, avoiding any analysis, superficial or otherwise, on Brazil's most problematic questions. (For problematic questions, I give you a few examples: heritage of slavery, dictatorship, ethnical and rural conflicts and chaotical urbanization: all extremely relevant issues, considering Brazil's history and formation - Why aren't these subjects regarded with precedence over superfluous images and assertions?). The unpleasant side of it was, in large part, conveniently ignored.</p>
<p>How is this plurality? Certainly not via the current unconcious decision of allowing the "most popular [point of view]" to erase and take precedence over anything else. This is pure <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>. Do your math.</p>
<p>I propose the creation of a list containing part of the historically relevant questions to be addressed in "Brazil". I believe following this procedure would also, as a consequence, bring up the ones that are, consensually, the most polemical issues.</p>
<p>Lets also remember that this page, for its name and evidence (after all, it is and it will always be the main article on Brazil), takes precedence over anything else Wikipedia has related to the forementioned country. It would be in itself an unfair and biased decision to create separate pages for discussable subjects and underlying points of view, since such subjects are certainly more important to the understanding of Brazil than beloved <i>carnaval</i>. --Ww2 21:22, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Not exhibitionism, but I think this is still as relevant as before. I hope the next time it actually turns into a discussion, instead of being ignored (while subjects like "Brazil x Brasil" get a fair share of the page's space). --Ww2 14:36, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sports section</span></h2>
<p>The sports section has been a stub for a while now. It used to link to a "main article", <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport_in_Brazil_8776.html" title="Sport in Brazil">Sport in Brazil</a>, with half a dozen lines of misinformation, even though it used to be more complete. I did a major rehaul on the main article and added a lot of stuff to it, so now the section on the Brazil article seems both poorly written, and redundant with the other article, and kind of hindering the good article status of the page considering it is a stub. I propose either writing a reduced and more concise version of the article, just as an opening leading to the main article, or a merger. That stub, the way it is now, kind of bothers me. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarghost_b711.html" title="User:Starghost">PHF</a> 19:16, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subtropical Weather</span></h2>
<p>Subtropical weather is being underrepresented here. There are lots of pictures portraiting the sunny beaches of Rio and the Northeast but not a single one of a cold, frost landscape, wich is an important part of southern Brazil's culture and historical formation.</p>
<p><a name="Pronunciation" id="Pronunciation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>I find it interesting that the IPA pronuncation listed at the beginning of the article claims it is "standard" Brazilian pronunciation. I lived in Sao Paulo for years and have traveled all over the country. I've never heard ANYONE say "Republica" with an "r" sound, rather with an "h." I don't have IPA on this computer, but it would sound something like this (using English pronunciation rules) Heh-poob-lee-kuh--no trilled R anywhere. Paulistano 23:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)BJ</p>
<dl>
<dd>The IPA here is a broader transcription. I do agree that [h] is closer to the sound we speak, but it is not good in this broader transcription, because it is nothing but an alophone of [ʀ]. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 00:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I actually must disagree with you. /h/ is not an allophone of /r/, but an allophone of a different phoneme. Take for example the minimal pair of /karo/ and /kaho/ (caro and carro, respectively). Since they exist in overlapping distribution, they must be allophones of different phonemes. I think the IPA should be changed to reflect the /h/.Paulistano 05:31, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Don't misunderstant! [ʀ] [r] and [ɾ] are three different things.
<ul>
<li>[ʀ] is the r that is characteristic in French and German. This is the sound in Portuguese ca<b>rr</b>o.</li>
<li>The [r] is Spanish double rr, like in pe<b>rr</b>o or the Italian initial r (we don't have this sound in Portuguese).</li>
<li>And the sound in ca<b>r</b>o is [ɾ], like in American English li<b>tt</b>le. <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_phonology.html" title="Portuguese phonology">Right</a>?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>[h] is an alophone of [ʀ] and my argumentation above is still valid. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 12:20, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If I may, two comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound [ʀ] is used in Parisian French, but not in Portuguese. The one we use is [ʁ] (which also appears in some dialects of French, or as an allophone of [ʀ]). It is not a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trill_consonant.html" title="Trill consonant">trill</a>.</li>
<li>I suppose the real issue here is which pronunciation should be used in the sample? If it's the pronunciation of São Paulo, then use [h]; if you want to use the pronunciation of Rio, then I believe it's [x]. Since the article is about Brazil, it makes sense to use a Brazilian pronunciation.</li>

<dd>We must be carefull when putting pictures, because the excess of pictures pollute an article. (Wikipedia is not a photo gallery, see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>) Yet, relevant pictures can be inserted in some sections, like Society Issues, Culture and Geography. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanmartin_df27.html" title="User:Sanmartin">José San Martin</a> 00:21, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, San Martin, I agree with you. Wikipedia should not be a photo gallery (and this is not a matter of agreeing, since it's a rule of the web site); yet, if you compare this article with other country articles the amazing low quantity of pictures here calls your atention. I'm not saying (and i'm sure the first user to post here agrees) that we should make this page an Embratur web site, but we should post enough pictures (say, between 10 and 15, the average on caountry pages) here to help the reader understand the country better, to have a more profound knowledge of the urban, rural and natural landscapes, as well as it's typical and peculiar figures. However, the lack of organization in this article is revolting. Users post pictures without asking other users, and the result is a page with no coherency, as we see today. I'm not saying these pictures don't meet it's purpose but they are definetly not enough. If you ask me, the best version of this article was the one before this we have today, but people don't seem to be satisfied and they keep changing the whole page in a very authoritarian way.</dd>

<p>just for the record: the "USA" page has 27 pictures and 4 maps; the "Canada" page, 13 pictures and 2 maps; Argentina, 9 pictures and 2 maps; France, 9 pictures, 3 maps, 2 national seals.
