<p>Alicia, nicknamed sugar snowflake. Ciara , nicknamed Spunky. Twin of Diona. Aqua eyes, deep cranberry and black hair, beauty mark, pale skin tone. Cloe, nicknamed Angel. Blonde hair, varying eye colours (usually blue), light skin tone in most lines (but has also been produced with tan and pale skin tones). Charli, nicknamed Squitty Squirrel. Brown hair, light blue eyes, light skin tone. Dana, nicknamed Sugar Shoes. Brown hair (has also been produced with auburn), varying eye colours (usually blue), light skin tone in most lines (but has also been produced with a tan). Diona, nicknamed Sparkly. Twin of Ciara. Aqua eyes, deep cranberry and black hair, beauty mark, pale skin tone. Felicia, nicknamed Glam Gecko. Brown eyes, brown hair with golden highlights, darkest skin tone. Fianna, nicknamed Fragrance.

In the TV series, this character is said to be of Latino heritage. Jade, nicknamed Kool Kat. Varying eye colours (usually brown or green), black hair, light skin tone in most lines (but has also been produced pale and tan). Style It Jade caused some controversy; her alternate shirt features a Chinese take-out box with a Japanese flag on it and the words Thank You in a stroked font, suggesting cultural ignorance on the designer's part. This character may be intended to be of Asian heritage, as her eyes are often less rounded than other characters'. Katia, nicknamed Flirty Turtle. Brown eyes, dark brown to black hair (often with cranberry highlights), light skin tone. This character was intended to be of Russian heritage, according to Toy Fair reports. Kiana, no nickname given. Brown eyes, black hair, deep tan skin tone. This character was intended to be of Native American heritage. Only produced once, in the Wild Wild West collection, this character was discontinued due to Mattel holding a trademark over a similar name ("Kianna"). Kiani, nicknamed Prankster Parrot.

Lilee Light blonde hair with reddish higlights, pale skintone. Mandy, nicknamed Beauty Girl Maribel, May Lin, no nickname given. Brown eyes, black hair, pale skin. This character was only produced once, as a Toys R Us store exclusive in the Bratz World Tokyo, Japan collector's line. She was the first Bratz character to be permanently discontinued, as her name was culturally inaccurate and considered offensive - May Lin is a misspelling of Meilin, a stereotypical Chinese name, yet the doll was portrayed as being Japanese with no backstory explaining this. Meygan, nicknamed Funky Fashion Monkey. Varying eyes (often green), varying shades of red hair (Sportz Teamz Tennis Meygan has brown hair, and a factory error led to some early batches of Sleepover Style Meygan dolls having blonde hair), light skin.
