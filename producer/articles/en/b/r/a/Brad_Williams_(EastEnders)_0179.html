<p><b>Brad Williams</b> was a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> in the popular <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>. He was played by Jonathan Stratt.</p>
<p>Brad was the errand-boy for the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Firm_%28EastEnders%29_29c7.html" title="The Firm (EastEnders)">The Firm</a>, and frequently liased with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Den_Watts_5e73.html" title="Den Watts">Den Watts</a> to relay the wishes of his mob bosses. He wasn't the brightest individual, Den was far smarter and he managed to use this to his advantage on several occasions.</p>
<p><a name="Storylines" id="Storylines"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Williams_%28EastEnders%29_0179.html" title="Edit section: Storylines">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Storylines</span></h2>
<p>Brad was a mobster heavy for the east end gangster organisation known as The Firm. Although he liked to think of himself as a big player, he was actually of low importance within the organisation and was generally just used as an errand boy. He was first seen in March 1986 and over the next two years he would show up occasionally to inform <a href="../../../d/e/n/Den_Watts_5e73.html" title="Den Watts">Den Watts</a> (who was working in league with the Firm) of his bosses orders.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1987 Brad was instructed to put the frighteners on the gay graphic designer, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Russell_79f1.html" title="Colin Russell">Colin Russell</a>, who was a jury member in a trial for an associate of the Firm. Brad and Den put pressure on Colin to give a verdict of 'not guilty' at the trial, and when he refused Brad stole his keys and vandalised his flat, causing all sorts of problems for Colin.</p>
<p>During 1988 Brad was seen more frequently on the Square, turning up to aid the running of the Firm's business in Walford, Strokes winebar, which was being managed by Den and was really a front for an illegal gambling den. The petty criminal <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Roberts_%28EastEnders%29_77f9.html" title="Darren Roberts (EastEnders)">Darren Roberts</a> managed to get on the wrong side of Brad when he tried to play him off against the owner of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dagmar_f0f4.html" title="The Dagmar">The Dagmar</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wilmott-Brown_4b58.html" title="James Wilmott-Brown">James Wilmott-Brown</a>. The Firm's money lending business, 'Walford Investments', were in the process of securing the take over of James' ailing winebar, albeit against his wishes. Darren, sensing an opportunity, promised to provide James protection against the Firm, whilst all the while attempting to get onto the Firm's payroll via Brad. Incensed by Darren's audacity, Brad took him aside and gave him a severe beating, and Darren left Walford shortly after.</p>
<p>In July 1988, Den discovered <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Hills_6a44.html" title="Kathy Hills">Kathy Beale</a> after she had been raped by James Wilmott-Brown, and instantly sought revenge. He demanded retribution from his contacts within the Firm, Brad and <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanne_Francis_ffe5.html" title="Joanne Francis">Joanne Francis</a>, and was enraged when they refused to act. Den managed to persuade Brad to help him anyway by conning him into thinking that James' downfall would please his bosses, and Den watched with glee as the Dagmar burnt down in flames. However the resulting police investigation put the Firm's business in serious jeapordy. They then decided that in order to put a halt to the investigation either Brad or Den had to take the blame for the arson attack. Neither Brad or Den was willing to take the blame, and both were then involved in a personal war to persuade the other to take the rap.</p>
<p>Brad immediately called on the services of <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Norman_f7a9.html" title="Rod Norman">Rod Norman</a> (via threats), and forced him to give the police a tip off about Den. The police began questioning Den and realising that he had gotten in way over his head, he decided that he would accept the blame for the arson, but instead of serving time in prison, he decided to flee the country to avoid arrest. The Firm agreed to this and Den was taken into hiding. However the Firm subsequently set up a hit on Den, which failed when he escaped custody and turned himself into the police to avoid the Firm's heavies.</p>
<p>As the Firm busied themselves with ways in which to silence Den from inside, Brad caused more grief by doing a bit of <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonlighting.html" title="Moonlighting">moonlighting</a>; breaking into several people's houses on the Square with an accomplice who worked as a cab driver for <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Osman_7c6d.html" title="Ali Osman">Ali Osman</a>. The burglaries resulted in a greater police presence in the area. The Firm were not impressed and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Mantel_302c.html" title="Gregory Mantel">Gregory Mantel</a> — a superior member of the Firm — threatened Brad with serious repercussions should his deviance continue. Brad stopped the burglaries, but his accomplice continued without him and was eventually caught by the police and was quick to implicate Brad. The investigating officer, D.I. Ashley, decided to use this piece of information to manipulate the dimwitted Brad. He threatened to put him in prison unless he acted as an informant. Brad was forced to relay information on The Firm. Strokes was closed down as a result and various members of the Firm were arrested. With the Firm under threat from the police, Gregory Mantel decided that Den had to be the informant and made arrangements to have him eliminated.</p>
<p>On the day of Den's trial, Mantel's heavies broke Den out of custody and took him to the Firm's headquarters, where he was greeted by Brad. Brad imprisoned him in a room to await the arrival of Mantel. However, Den was not about to go down without a fight and knowing how easily influenced Brad was, he made one last attempt to secure his freedom. He played upon Brad's fears, relaying that he had heard that Brad was to be the next victim on the Firm's hit-list. Brad was easily swayed and he decided to help Den escape. He lured the other gang member, Marco, into the cell where an awaiting Den jumped him and threw him to the floor, whilst Brad locked him up in Den's place. The two then escaped from the headquarters, and Brad sped off in his car, leaving Den to fend for himself.</p>
<p>Brad immediately went to the police and handed himself in. He promised to confess everything he knew regarding the arson, Den and the Firm. Meanwhile, Mantel, who was furious with Brad's betrayal, tracked Den down, he was shot and presumed dead for over 14 years. However he returned to Walford in 2003, revealing that he had faked his own death to secure his survival. It was also revealed that Brad had been charged for the arson attack of the Dagmar in exchange for a prison spell in isolation, which was necessary to avoid the inevitable revenge attacks of the Firm. Subsequently, Den was no longer wanted by the police for the torching of the Dagmar.</p>
