<p>I think that you're talking about a comment I left at W:AN/I. If so, I didn't doubt the existence of the lawyer (is it you?), only complained that referring to "a lawyer" who said something on a mailing list, without any further details, wasn't adequate reason to criticise my comments about out-of-process deletions. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 12:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy Brad,</p>
<p>this is a one-time attempt, and if you tell me that you don't want to get entangled in © issues here on-Wiki, I'll just let it drop silently. So far nobody has found serious errors on <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublic_domain_57d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Public domain">Wikipedia:Public domain</a>, but then, no professional lawyer has ever looked over it, as far as I know. Interested to take a look and give feedback or improve it? A second, and really more current issue is to get {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-USSR_abc6.html" title="Template:PD-USSR">PD-USSR</a>}} right. See <a href="../../../p/d/-/Template_talk%7EPD-USSR_d490.html" title="Template talk:PD-USSR">Template talk:PD-USSR</a> for pointers about previous discussions. Input from a professional might be very helpful... <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 09:25, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please look more carefully. I'm getting somewhat annoyed at having to explain this time and again. <i>None</i> of his image uploads are summarily <i>deleted</i>. They have been removed from the articles, but not deleted. They are being checked individually now. See also <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_9b32.html" title="User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">User talk:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a>, and also <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_New_Jersey_6bcb.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject New Jersey">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject New Jersey</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarnildo_0cba.html" title="User talk:Carnildo">User talk:Carnildo</a>, and, of course, <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>. As to his claimed desire for discussion (according to the OTRS mail you quoted): he misunderstands two things: first, his images are not being "punished", and second, he has, with his blatantly false licensing claims, damaged his credibility to the point that I don't see why I should trust his say-so on any image. If that means that we inadvertantly will get rid of a few images that we could have otherwise kept, then that's entirely his fault, not ours. <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupo_5a34.html" title="User:Lupo">Lupo</a> 08:16, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that his say so isn't the criteria on some of the images. *Any* image of the 1850 census is non-copyvio. The baby/bathwater argument is aggressive, and based on your interpretation of his credibility. Demonstrable credibility or not, I was confirming (which you have) that these are being looked at individually and not bot-deleted en mass.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">BradPatrick</a> 14:52, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the census images are obvious PDs. Others are not. Some are very likely PD, some are mistagged, some are copyvios, etc. If you'd like to help checking them, there's <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/Gallery.php" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/Gallery.php" rel="nofollow">an excellent tool</a> that helps a great deal.

<p>With regard to <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konigun_Ninjutsu_e129.html" title="Konigun Ninjutsu">Konigun Ninjutsu</a>, why are you removing discussion of this subject? I'm going to assume as a lawyer that you have a particular reason, yet Wikipedia discusses many court cases before they are finished. Is Wikipedia involved in the court case? If so, and we need to abide by some injunction we should say so.

<p>Okay, you caught me. I'm not an attorney, I'm a rodeo clown. Hmmm. Do you report anonymous administrators who use Wikipedia "with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person" to the local U.S. Attorney's office (President Bush signed this new law on January 5, 2006), or does that portion of what you are "obligated to do" get lost in shuffle?

Because of the seriousness of this vandal's actions (repeatedly posting a user's home phone number in edit summaries, implicitly inviting real-life harassment), this should be a case where the Wikimedia Foundation itself officially contacts the ISP (= Sympatico, Canada's largest ISP) rather than well-meaning volunteers contacting the ISP as private individuals. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 20:02, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think you're misinterpreting what I wrote. I'm not saying that ordinary users or ordinary administrators should presume to speak in the name of Wikipedia; they can't. What I'm wondering (and grumbling) about, is why hasn't anyone ever been designated who <i>can</i>? Limited to the narrow area of formulating terms-of-service complaints to ISP abuse contact personnel, of course.</p>
<p>How do you suggest dealing with people like the anti-Alkivar phone number vandal... this is a real-world harassment issue, not some mere editing dispute. If this guy's ISP got in touch with him and told him to knock it off or get booted for violating terms of service, then he'd knock it off. But how to get them to do so? I suspect any complaint by an ordinary user will be brushed off, something along the lines of "ask your site's webmaster to get in touch with us". Before the ISP acts, they'll probably need to know that the person contacting them really is making the request on behalf of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Right now there's no such person who can do so, barring some extraordinary and rare personal intervention by Jimbo or board members. There really ought to be some not-quite-so-exalted person who could do so. The Arbitration Committee was formed quite some time ago to delegate dispute resolution without requiring Jimbo's personal intervention every time; could not something similar be done here? Right now it seems that there's a problem, but there's nobody minding the store.</p>

<p>Greetings. My apologies that I inexplicably overlooked the very last (no least!) entry on <a href="../../../s/g/r/User_talk%7ESgrayban_9b6c.html" title="User talk:Sgrayban">User talk:Sgrayban</a>. As I have just informed Danny, the user assures me that he has no intention of taking legal action against the foundation, that he will adhere to <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> and any other applicable policies, and that he, voluntarily, withdraws from all article/s in dispute. With this informal probationary period charted, with the consent of some of the other involved parties including the blocking admin, I have unblocked him. Which brings me back to my original oversight: if you or Danny feel that the arrangement with the user should be revoked or modified, please feel free to suggest, or to take, any course of action you see fit.

<p>FYI Sgrayban remains unblocked. Given the weirdness of his threats against Adam, Jforrester, and some others, I doubt that this is a good idea. I'm certain that this user's only interested in causing disruption.

<p>Hi! Well, I've been meaning to search out a lawyer to look at the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a> article, specifically the "Legal Issues" section. It seems to have been edited a lot, sometimes by people who are clearly NOT lawyers and who have no idea what's what in copyright law ANYWHERE (at one point, it even said that self-published fan fiction was "totally legal" in Japan, which is NOT the case; it's either illegal or in some sort of gray area, it's just that the Japanese are somewhat non-confrontational and tend to view the <a href="../../../d/o/j/Dojinshi.html" title="Dojinshi">dojinshi</a> market as a breeding ground for new talent, and thus choose to ignore or encourage the thriving underground in dôjinshi which often features some form of fan fiction).</p>
<p>Um, anyway. Would you consider taking a look at it, or maybe giving me a hint where I can find people who are genuinely qualified to tackle that section? Copyright law is complicated and messy sometimes, I know, but it can't be half as confusing as the "Legal Issues" section on that page is!&#160;:P <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 06:57, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you very much for taking a look at it! I know what you mean by the lack of sourcing; in the recent Peer Review I requested, people noted the exact same problem. Thus far, since I'm too twitchy about touching the legal section, especially without knowing of any good citations for it, I'm working on backing up the major theories as to the origins of it in the history section and two major approaches to modern fan fiction broached in the current draft of the introduction. In the course of my research efforts online I almost immediately found a draft copy of an academic paper from a Dr. Judge, Phd., of a law school (I can't remember which one, since that link is bookmarked on my home computer right now, and not this one, but I'll update you over the weekend after I've been back online on that computer and been able to look it up again) that brought up the "descended from oral storytelling" theory <i>with cited sources</i>, as well as (this is the main focus of the paper, actually) describing the history of 18th-century printed fan fiction and some of the hullabuloo that arose from it, and copyright law of the time - which effectively provides an I assume reasonably reliable history for what's arguably some of the earliest of <i>modern</i> fan fiction and the surrounding legal and ethical issues of the time. What's more, from the look I took at it last night before bed, it seems to list a lot of specific trends (such as writing and publishing unauthorized sequels before an author could meet demand for one themself), and specific, apparently high-profile cases, such as an unauthorized sequel case involving <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robinson_Crusoe_f001.html" title="Robinson Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>. Since it was marked as a DRAFT, and since it was requested on the paper itself that the author of it be contacted before any citations or quotes, I've emailed Dr. Judge regarding it. I have yet to hear from her, but I believe I emailed her 12 hours ago or less, not to mention it's the weekend, so that's understandable.&#160;:P Again, thank you VERY much for taking the time to look at it! <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 19:37, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notwithstanding that I fail to understand why this is something to be brought to Brad Patrick in specific, Mtz is, IMHO, correct. With respect to the first diff, the page at present doesn't contain an <i>External links</i> section; if Chuck wants to create one, surely we can discuss, consistent with <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, what ought to be included, but the fashion in which he adds the links is plainly against policy and custom (and, to the extent that Chuck bolds each entry [formatting each a subhead], unencyclopedic). With respect to the second, his case is stronger here, but it's eminently clear that Mtz is not acting in bad faith (of course, without such clarity, Chuck ought to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, especially in view of Mtz's evident [and proper] disinterest vis-à-vis any specific links), and that the issue, as Mtz suggests, ought to be brought up at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_web_directories_7c59.html" title="Talk:List of web directories">Talk:List of web directories</a>; <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">reverting</a> something other than plain vandalism oughtn't likely to be done prior to consultation with other editors, with whom one ought to collaborate in any event, and surely not with cursory edit summaries/less-than-substantive talk page comments. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 00:22, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
