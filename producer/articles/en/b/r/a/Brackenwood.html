<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: Environment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Environment</span></h2>
<p>The series is set on the fictional planet of Brackenwood. It seems to contain creatures based off of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_mythology.html" title="Irish mythology">Irish mythology</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/e/Faeries.html" title="Faeries">faeries</a>), <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptozoology.html" title="Cryptozoology">Cryptozoology</a> (Littlefoot and Bigfoot), and others from the creator's own imagination. The planet is so small that one could walk from pole to pole in only about thirty days. Covering the entirety of the planet's surface is a seemingly endless forest that varies from grasslands to jungles. Beneath the surface, however, is a vast and unexplored aquifer that nourishes the forest above. One of the series various mysteries includes the nature of the aquifer's elusive pale faced denizens.</p>
<p><a name="The_Forest" id="The_Forest"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: The Forest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Forest</span></h3>
<p>By far, Brackenwood's most prominent feature is its forest. It has no end, and plant life is its most diverse and varied form of life. Nearly any form of plant life able to evolve and thrive is said to be found somewhere on the surface. There are countless species yet to be discovered. Some of the more notable species in the Brackenwood series include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Whispering Tree:</b> Whispering Trees have smooth bark and grow crookedly. The surface is peppered with small holes which cause these trees to "whisper" in the wind. Whispering trees are also a haven for anyone afraid of Yuyus, as they are repelled by the whispers. During a unique form of Brackenwood weather called a Musical Storm, Whispering Trees literally scream, making them dangerous to be around.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Stairway Tree:</b> The way the limbs of this tree are arranged about its trunk is reminiscent of a spiral staircase, making it a simple task to climb to the top. They are also some of the tallest trees in the forest. Stairway Trees make excellent vantage points from which to gain one's bearings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Globe Tree:</b> These trees punctuate the grasslands. They grow in all sizes and are home to many creatures due to their hollow dome shapes and very spacious interior. They grow in full sunlight with slightly translucent wood. Their shape also reflects most sound, making Globe Trees safe, quiet, and well lit shelters in any weather, particularly Musical Storms.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Musical_Wind" id="Musical_Wind"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: Musical Wind">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Musical Wind</span></h3>
<p>One distinguishing aspect of Brackenwood weather is what is known as the Musical Breeze, a soft, soothing music that carries on some of the planet's winds. It begins like the tinkling of a bell or the trill of a tiny bird, and gradually the strange, sometimes haunting melody builds. The origins of the music are a mystery.</p>
<p>Sometimes the winds are silent, so the music isn't always to be heard. While musical breezes are soothing, Musical Storms are far from this. They are a deafening and frightful cacophony of colliding notes and detuned howls. This gale does nothing to damage the ears, but instead sends one insane.</p>
<p><a name="Inhabitants" id="Inhabitants"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: Inhabitants">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inhabitants</span></h2>
<p>The origin of Brackenwood and its inhabitants is another mystery in the series, but they come together to build an intricate, if not bizarre tapestry. The wealth of Brackenwood's environment supports a great deal. Despite this profusion, civilized, let alone intelligent inhabitants number very few. Those few take so little from nature and give so much that they are likened to greenkeepers. For this reason Brackenwood appears untouched since its dawn of time.</p>
<p><a name="Prominent_Characters" id="Prominent_Characters"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: Prominent Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prominent Characters</span></h3>
<p>So far the series displays Brackenwood's characters moving around in their environment. It brings them to life with individual personalities, showing how they relate and interact with one another. For this reason each Brackenwood episode so far is more of an introduction for one or more characters than an actual story.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bitey:</b> Bitey is the fastest creature on the planet. He has the appearance of a hairy faced humanoid and bears resemblance to a Satyr or Faun. Bitey has exceptional eye-sight, which was proven in <i>littleFoot</i>, where he spotted the littleFoot from several miles distance. Growing up completely alone has made him a cruel, selfish, arrogant opportunist with a dangerous excess of hubris. Nothing makes his day more than ruining someone else's. Bitey's only weaknesses are pride and spiders. As a side note: In Episode 1 he is picking on a fat-sack. However, later on he has a dream about having one as his best friend/pet. Having unmatched speed doesn't always save him, though- Once his pride has him captured he has little way to escape. He is introduced in his own episode <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" rel="nofollow">Bitey of Brackenwood</a>. He also holds a main role in the episodes <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/prowlies.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/prowlies.html" rel="nofollow">Prowlies at the River</a>, <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/littleFoot.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/littleFoot.html" rel="nofollow">LittleFoot</a>, and <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/theYuyu.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/theYuyu.html" rel="nofollow">The Yu-Yu</a>. Bitey has never made any noises besides snickers, dismissive sounds, and chomps, but is capable of speech.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bingbong:</b> With origins as obscure as any of the other mysterious creatures in the series, Bingbong has the physical likeness of a sort of childlike elf or goblin, and is the embodiment of innocent stupidity. Despite Bingbong's slight build and infantile mentality, he is the strongest being on the planet. He means no harm to anyone, and often goes out of his way to help where he can. This often turns to disaster simply because Bingbong has no concept of his own strength. His introductory episode was in the first Brackenwood episode <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/bbWindow.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/bbWindow.html" rel="nofollow">Bingbong of Brackenwood</a>. He is also in the episode <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/prowlies.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/prowlies.html" rel="nofollow">Prowlies at the River</a>. Bingbong is also safe from the wrath of both fairies and musical storms by his sheer stupidity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Auld Sage:</b> The Auld Sage is a very old and very hairless Bigfoot. Despite the hallmark stupidity of Bigfeet, he is the wisest being in the world. And while he knows everything there is to know, he is much more interested in a long conversation over a cup of hot tea, than imparting any knowledge or wisdom on request. The Sage loves his world and all in it, things nasty and polite alike. The Auld Sage sings a Coldplay song in his eponymous short "Auld Sage" and has a short appearance in <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" rel="nofollow">Bitey of Brackenwood</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Lemonee Wee:</b> The Brackenwood witch spends her life taking care of the forest all over the world. She lives alone, but each day spends time with her fast friend the Auld Sage. Being intolerant of nonsense or damage to her forest, she is quick to summon a spell to clean up a mess, repair broken foliage or to teach a lesson. Like the Sage, Lemonee Wee knows much of Brackenwood's History, but he is the only one intelligent enough with whom she can discuss such things and carry on conversations with. She has only appeared in the Brackenwood episode <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" rel="nofollow">Bitey of Brackenwood</a>. One of Wee's most common spell is a water spell that gives water the behavior and appearance of fire, which ades both in watering high trees and capturing annoying creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Secondary_Characters" id="Secondary_Characters"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: Secondary Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Secondary Characters</span></h3>
<p>In addition to the more well known characters, there are also a number of secondary creatures still significant to the series and its development. As of yet these include the elemental Faeries and Yu-Yu, and the strange, if not awkward Prowlies.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Faeries:</b> They appear as tiny dancing flames and act as guardians to the forest. Almost Celtic in its culture. While in general the Faeries prefer to be left undisturbed, they are well known for mischief. Still, any sort of intrusion upon their affairs will undoubtedly be punished. These punishments range from minor physical ailments to sorts considered too frightful to mention. In all, the Faeries can be regarded as nothing short of dangerously unpredictable. If seen in a yellow color, it is presumed that you are not noticed or safe. If they turn a bright red or dark orange, its time to leave.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Yu-Yu:</b> Well known for their droning chant of 'yu-yu yu-yu', this dangerous race of diminutive shadow people serves the role of Brackenwood's bogeymen. The Yu-Yu spirit away any hapless creatures on the verge of sleep that they can find. Their victims are taken to a shadow world to serve as slaves in the darkness. They surround their victim and transform into a thick fog like creature that acts as a gateway to this shadow world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Prowlies:</b> Prowlies are a type of territorial, piscivorous pack animals. They tend to live in groups of no more than five. When their numbers exceed this, any extra Prowlies leave the group to start their own family. Prowlies are naturally curious, intelligent, and resourceful. They also posses a sort of innate maternal instinct, sometimes going to extraordinary lengths to protect creatures smaller than themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Wildlife" id="Wildlife"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackenwood.html" title="Edit section: Wildlife">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wildlife</span></h3>
<p>Brackenwood's animal life is as diverse as its plant life. Each new episode reveals at least a few new fantastical creatures.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bigfeet:</b> These large, hairy, bipedal vegetarians are the forest's gentle giants. They serve as its guardians, watching over and protecting its inhabitants. One of the more prominent Bigfeet is LittleFoot, who appeared in the fourth episode <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/littleFoot.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/littleFoot.html" rel="nofollow">LittleFoot</a>. When a Bigfoot is angry, its purple-red eyes turn green. LittleFoot can go into a 'berserker' mode when stressed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fatsacks:</b> Fatsacks are one of the most popular creatures in Brackenwood, but by far the most useless. They resemble a bloated water balloon with eyes, that moves like one too, that is, if water balloons <i>could</i> run. The fatsack is an insectivore that tears at the grass with its little claws, then inhales the disturbed gnats from the air with its stub-like trunk. Digestion is an ongoing process within the fatsack, so gases are released frequently and noisily from its trunk. The most well known Fatsack is Jiblet, who appeared in Brackenwood's second episode <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/biteyWindow.html" rel="nofollow">Bitey of Brackenwood</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Chisel-Lizards:</b> A Brackenwood equivalent to the Woodpecker, these lizards can be heard endlessly chiseling holes into trees. Chisel-Lizards, though noisy, are difficult to find and observe. Other than the fact that it possibly eats wood, their diet is a mystery.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mood Birds:</b> Literally one of Brackenwood's most colorful inhabitants, Mood Birds are a Brackenwood parallel to Chameleons. They are small birds whose disposition is reflected by the color of their feathers. When content they appear blue, when cautious they are green,, possibly for camoflauge purposes, and when angered they turn a bright red and attack whoever has disturbed them. The feathers of a Mood Bird, if detached, will forever stay the color of the Bird upon detachment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Blood-Coats:</b> Blood-Coats are small, bipedal, arboreal, and fairly harmless insectivores. The name "Blood-Coat" is taken from their dense and shiny crimson fur. Much like Flying Squirrels, their skin is saggy like an oversized coat. By extending its arms, legs and tail the skin stretches into wings that allow it to fly with quick flapping movements. It also has very dextrous hands, each with five naturally sticky fingertips, like those of a gecko, which help it to climb trees and grasp prey.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Palefaces:</b> These "Palefaces" are one of Brackenwood's most mysterious inhabitants. They are occasionally glimpsed staring up with wide black eyes from below pond and lake surfaces. The nature of their existence is completely unknown and the regions they inhabit continue to go unexplored. The "Palefaces" have yet to be seen in any episode of the Brackenwood Series.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Umbrellafly:</b> The Umbrellafly resembles an umbrella, and pulses through the air like a jellyfish. When not airborne, it lies on the ground, upturned and open like a flower. Its colorful tentacles resemble pollen-coated flower parts, which attract feather-gnats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Other Animals:</b> In Brackenwood there are countless more animals yet to be discovered. There are also also several of which very little has been made known. These include fireflies, beetles, white birds, the aforementioned feather-gnats and Hairy Ants, as seen in Prowlies at the River.</li>

<p>Future plans for Brackenwood merchandising include a graphic novel, an 'Art of Brackenwood' book, a 'Brackenwood Wildlife Field Guide' book, plushies, caps and bags, as well as other Adam Phillips' merchandise innovations.</p>
<p>Of all requested merchandise, the most common is for "anything with the yellow farty thing". Fatsack plushies are unarguably the most desired articles by the Brackenwood fanbase. There is also a great deal of hype among fans for a Brackenwood video game.</p>
<p>Currently the only available Brackenwood merchandise are <a href="http://www.biteycastle.com/merch.html" class="external text" title="http://www.biteycastle.com/merch.html" rel="nofollow">t-shirts</a>.</p>
