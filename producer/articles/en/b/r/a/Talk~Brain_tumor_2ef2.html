<p>Do brain tumors always result in death? 64.136.27.226 23:40, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. In fact, a benign tumor is very <i>un</i>likely to cause death. Many times they can be surgically removed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most "benign" (low-grade) gliomas tend to transform into malignant ones (anaplastic degeneration), and their complete surgical removal is extremely difficult, to say the least, due to their infiltrative nature. Whether surgery has any beneficial efect in slowing down anaplastic degeneration and extending survival time is far from being proven. On the other side, many extra-axial tumors, such as meningeomas, can be surgically cured.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that the user above was asking if <i>malignant</i> brain tumors always result in death. I was wondering the same thing, because I knew of two people who had brain tumors, and they both died as a result. Is this always the case? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 00:52, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm getting a really mixed set of messages from this. I've got the one side that says that many brain tumors are treatable and yet theres another, well represented in the article, that seem to have a very pessimistic view. I'm not really sure how serious a brain tumor inherantly is. Can anybody reconcile this, I'd really appreciate a solid answer. Blademaster 02:20, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Any brain tumor is inherantly serious and life threatening. However brain tumors (even malignant ones) do not automatically mean death. It depends on the type - I am a medulloblastoma survivor and there are many others. Glioblastoma Multiforme however almost always results in death.</p>

<p><i>Brain cancer develops from overexposure to watermelons, as well as taxis. One who spends over 1 hour near any of those substances will automatically develop this condition.</i> A troll?</p>
<p>Update: <i>The first symptom of brain cancer is the development of excessively sweaty armpits. Followed by chronic lying. The person becomes unable to tell the truth about anything. Constipation is the third major sign. Should anyone begin to notice theses symptoms they are advised to see their closest drug dealer immediately.

<dd>It takes a somewhat careful reading and wording to state this correctly: The United States diagnoses more total cases of childhood leukemia each year. Due to higher mortality rates, brain tumors are responsible for a greater number of deaths.

<p>I like having a separate small article with particulars. The big articles are pretty intimidating somtimes. Frankly, I'm reading this because a friends child has one, and I don't want to have to deal with the big picture. I want to know what it is, how it progresses and so forth and the Medulloblastoma article did a good job of this for me. If I want more of an overview I can always easily get to the brain tumor article. In some ways it's easier to get a small article right, and if it ever gets big with details (as opposed to overmuch repetition of the brain tumor article) then it does deserve it's own article. I guess that's the question, how much duplication is there? I'm poorly equipped to answer this question because I've not taken time with the brain tumor article. None the less, at this moment I vote to keep them separate articles. --<a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKop_c923.html" title="User:Kop">kop</a> 23:01, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that medulloblastoma merits a separate article from brain tumors. There is significant detail that is unique to medulloblastoma. Also, brain tumors are an extremely broad category of medicine, and subcategorization is essential. -Michael Miller, Dartmouth Medical School</p>

<p>Hi I would like to request that you add a link to my website: Clinical Trials and Noteworthy Treatments For Brain Tumors at virtualtrials.com</p>
<p>We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity, and our website is the most complete resource for brain tumor information.

<p>Hi Overall, pretty good job on the article... but the section on treatment and prognosis is now incorrect and badly needs updating. For example, for glioblastomas, there IS now a standard treatment protocol that is surgery with maximal amount of tumor removal and insertion of gliadel wafer (if possible... as there are a few situations where surgery and/or Gliadel shouldn't be used), followed by a combination of Radiation and chemotherapy using Temodar, followed by chemotherapy with Temodar. You menioned a prognosis of months. With the above protocol, it is actually over a year. <a href="http://virtualtrials.com/news3.cfm?item=2555&amp;showtext=y" class="external free" title="http://virtualtrials.com/news3.cfm?item=2555&amp;showtext=y" rel="nofollow">http://virtualtrials.com/news3.cfm?item=2555&amp;showtext=y</a> However, there are many clinical trials going on now where average survival is over 2 years and some patients have been going for many years with no sign of recurrence. <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2764420022542063525" class="external free" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2764420022542063525" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2764420022542063525</a> So there is finally some hope at beating this. And finally - I am new to Wikipedia, but whenever I read something as important as this article, I like to know who wrote it and what affiliations (and possible conflicts of interest) they have. Why aren't Wikipedia articles signed by who wrote them? And who wrote this one?</p>
