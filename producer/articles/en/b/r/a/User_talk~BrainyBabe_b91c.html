<p><b>Posted on <a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkTroll_2925.html" title="User talk:ClockworkTroll">User_talk:ClockworkTroll</a></b></p>
<p>Thanks for your welcome. I must admit I was a bit surprised by it, as I had created my account several days previously and wasn't aware of having done anything controversial. So my first thought was (especially with your nickname, which looks at first glance like an automatic non-human thing, at least to people like me who don't know better): the software has finally got around to acknowledging me after several days of existance. My second thought was: oh, it's a real person, so I must have done something wrong to get their attention. I'm glad that's not the case.</p>
<p>I would like to take advantage of your friendly helpfulness to ask two questions.</p>
<p>1. I use the computers at work to pursue my own interests (eg Wikipedia), with my employer's knowledge. When I get to the first page of Wikipedia, and click on "log in or create an account", it already shows my username, with the field for the password blank. I would prefer that it did not show my username. Can this be re-set more securely?</p>
<p>2. I found an article that appears to have been lifted from another webpage. ( I think the plagiarism is this way around, because the other organisation is highly reputable.) I can't list it now, as I seem to have lost my sources, but if I ever find it again, is there someplace I can report this to within Wikipedia? Simply editing out chunks of text (or the whole text) might only result in an edit war.</p>
<p>Many thanks. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainyBabe_cef5.html" title="User:BrainyBabe">BrainyBabe</a> 14:13, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)BrainyBabe</p>

<p>Hi, Brainy! Thanks for your message. "Ephebe" makes sense to me—I know what an ephebe is—but I have to say I'm so far from an expert on bishies that I'm not sure. The username hides me more than it describes me: I'm not pretty, not a boy, and, most importantly in this context, not knowledgeable about Japanese culture.

<dd>Thanks for the thanks. I've been a fan of Starhawk for years to. Usually when I comment on a section I just hit the little "edit" button at the section head and then precede it with a colon (to indent it a bit). Two colons indents a bit further, etc. Don't worry, though. If you stick around a bit I'm sure you'll get the hang of it! <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Be bold</a> and have fun! - <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorybowman_5a57.html" title="User:Rorybowman">Rorybowman</a> 00:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, thanks for the message. The message to the anon was actually a template; simply put {{subst:sofixit}} in a talk page to include it. (Try it in a sandbox.) I'm not sure who reverted the trivia thing, but the problem is amassing enough content that the section doesn't look too, well, trivial, if you see what I mean. Halliburton is already mentioned under tolls; the palindrome thing is mildly interesting... why not start collecting stuff on the talk page, then we can move it into the article when it gets some momentum? If you can include references to back things up, that would be great.

<dd>Update: I just noticed you put the redirect in "quotation marks" - thats what caused the bot to be triggered. -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 17:01, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your response. I used the quotation marks because I was following the instructions on <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages</a> under "performing the merger". I have never done this before (we all have to start somewhere) so perhaps I followed them too literally. If you know how to change that page, so that it says "without the quotation marks", that would help. Also, I found the bot message harsh and unhelpful, to be accused of vandalism when I thought I was following all the proper procedures (discussion to merge, waiting for comments, etc.). It put me off my lunch till I figured out it was an auto-thing and not a person reverting me. So perhaps you could consider changing the message. I am sure your bot exists for a good reason; I just hope you can see that it can come across the wrong way. I hope these comments are constructive for you.

<dd>Ok, I've bolded the <b>automated bot</b> text in the message, I've been yo-yo'ing between the messages, essentially its a copy paste of a stock message with the automated bot portion and link if you think the bots in error. If you have any suggestions on how to make the message both friendly enough and stern at the same time, it would be very much appreciated. I've also changed the help page to note "without the quotation marks", let me know if it looks more helpful. I hope I didn't ruin your lunch, it really is entirely automated, I only saw the message in the morning when I woke up -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 17:29, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your comments and also for clarifying the help page, whihc I hadn't realised was open for everyone to change. I think your bot paragraph of explanation is good (friendly AND stern); it is just the little tag that comes up on the history (which I can't find right now) that uses the words "revert" and "vandalism". I think that is the most abrasive part of the procedure. I have had lots of chocolate biscuits since lunch and feel good about having learned yet another Wikipedia process. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainyBabe_cef5.html" title="User:BrainyBabe">BrainyBabe</a> 17:44, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes everything should be in order, for now. I moved all the double-redirects. You have to do that or else people get redirected to a redirect page, which can cause some confusion. There are a lot of pages that link here under several redirect pages so it's a bit troublesome. <a href="../../../d/f/o/User%7EDforest_93e6.html" title="User:Dforest">Dforest</a> 18:09, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your recent edit added <i>" to become <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_meat.html" title="Horse meat">horse meat</a> for human or animal consumption"</i>. I was about to revert this as nonsense as in the UK horse meat is not, as far as I am aware, used for human consumption. Likewise the article '<a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_meat.html" title="Horse meat">horse meat</a>' confirmed my understanding that it is not eaten in the USA either. With a foal presumably having little useful meat on them, are you sure about them being used for human consumption, and if so where ? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:39, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi David. It's a reasonable question, but just because the US and UK don't do something, doesn't mean there isn't a globalised market in it anyway. As I understand it, most of the pregnant mares' urine is produced in Canada (some in the States), and all is processed by one company in Ontario. The foals are shipped from these farms, and either slaughtered in-country, or, sometimes, exported live, to Japan, Italy, and other countries where there is a taste for horse flesh. Apparently most are 2-4 months old, so the "little useful meat" argument would be as for <a href="../../../v/e/a/Veal.html" title="Veal">veal</a> calves -- less of it, but tender. I got this info from www.premarin.org, an "anti" website that has conducted its own research into the trade (including fact-finding interviews in Japan). Hope you consider this sufficient. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainyBabe_cef5.html" title="User:BrainyBabe">BrainyBabe</a> 05:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hadn't heard that the fictional Who's Who entry was created for the U.S. editions. I have read all the books in the UK versions and I'm fairly sure that the San Serrafino reference predates the Guardian's joke of 1977 by some years. The spoof award is referred to several times in the text of various books as well, although I could not say off-hand which ones.</p>
<p>However, you are likely quite right that it is essentially the same joke. One might consider adding a reference in the San Serriffe article, however this might be considered original research unless you can find any verifiable info on it.

It has appeared in industry publications and conferences (not only by Scott Thornbury) for several years. Having said that, I am not in a position at the moment to search for those articles.

<p>Hi Brainy Babe,</p>
<p>I got a new stub up for Dogme and it was deleted. The reasons are unknown to me but someone named Calton has basically gone off at the mouth making spurious analogies and claiming right of censorship. Whoever Calton is that user has serious problems with consensus. Do you know that user? I have replaced the stub and it received a speedy deletion notice evidently by claiming that it was deleted before--i.e. the first spurious deletion now becomes the sole argument for the second. I have Requested arbitration. Anyway, do weigh in and let your thoughts be known. It looks like a one man crusade to delete at will. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangthon_65cb.html" title="User:Malangthon">Malangthon</a> 00:33, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Circa 1000 CE, the Arabs controlled the strategic Mediterranean island of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>, famous for its <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey.html" title="Honey">honey</a>. They built a large sugar refinery, possibly the first such industrial facility. Their name for the island was Qandi, the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> word for crystallized sugar. [History of Food, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat,Translated by Anthea Bell (Barnes &amp; Noble Books:New York) 1992 (p. 549-554)] The island and its capital, now known as <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraklion.html" title="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>, were subsequently called <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candia.html" title="Candia">Candia</a> under Turkish <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> rule (Greek Χάνδαξ or Χάνδακας, Turkish Kandiye).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alas, Toussaint-Samat is a really, really unreliable source, full of legends and misinformation, and since she doesn't footnote most of what she writes, there's no way of verifying it. In this case, there is one major error, one minor error, and another dubious claim. The Arabic name Khandaq quite clearly comes from the Arabic word for "moat" (they dug one around the city), and has nothing to do with Qandi or Candy. It is true that Crete was sometimes called Candy, short for Candia, but this is pure happenstance. The island and the capital were not called Candia under Ottoman rule, but under Venetian rule (before the Ottomans). I don't know where she gets the idea that the Arabs "built a large sugar refinery". This may or may not be true, but I don't know of any evidence for it. ِAn article I found, "The Mediterranean Sugar Industry" (J. H. Galloway, <i>Geographical Review</i> <b>67</b>:2:177-194 (Apr., 1977)<a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0016-7428%28197704%2967%3A2%3C177%3ATMSI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0016-7428%28197704%2967%3A2%3C177%3ATMSI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), shows sugar being produced in Crete from 1300-1600 (during the Venetian period), but shows only question marks for 800-1300. Upshot of all this, I have deleted this section of the article. Of course, if you have other sources for the Cretan sugar refinery claim, that would be great.... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 22:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, thanks for this. I too have put hours of work into <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a> (29 May, 2 Aug, 18 Sept 2006 especially) quite boldly reorganising, limiting, and clarifying the article -- and other related articles as well, e.g. <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_meat.html" title="Horse meat">horse meat</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premarin.html" title="Premarin">premarin</a>, and <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumis.html" title="Kumis">kumis</a>. Leaving aside the question of vandalism, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a> seems to attract padding, presumably largely from new editors, perhaps because of the emotional connotations but also because it is a top level article.</dd>
<dd>I did understand your edit comments negatively ("snippy" is a lovely word, and I shall now add it to my <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideolect.html" title="Ideolect">ideolect</a>), and was confused by the one where you said:

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I thought that meant you were encouraging me to go ahead and reorganise that section, which I did, and which you then largely reverted, which was rather discouraging. However, no harm done -- the articles end up all the better for multiple checks.</dd>

<dd>No harm, no foul. <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">Horse</a> has needed massive work and I agree with what happens there. It's bloated, it desperately needs more sources (thanks for yours, by the way), and everyone wants their "thing" in there. I broke out a couple of sections and made completely new articles out of them, so did some previous editors. What I have seen happening with the bigger articles is a lot of redundant material gets inserted too...the same basic statement in different sections. Perhaps not identical comments, but so closely related that you can wind up with near-duplicate sections. As for the US-Centric tone in much of wikipedia, well, that's where the authors are coming from, as more people worldwide make contributions, that will probably improve. As far as misunderstandings in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_in_Warfare_b61e.html" title="Horses in Warfare">Horses in Warfare</a>, well, much of what's in there is a carefully crafted compromise between myself and some other editors (well, they whined more than they actually edited, I did most of the real work), we had quite a dustup over the Polish cavalry issue, and in general I just do not want to attract the attention of the military historian types--they can be quite brutal in their edits and comments. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 20:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I wish WP had a pouch annex to the article, where the citations, illustrations etc can be stored, but until its done, I believe posting the original texts is impractical. On top of this, none of the non-English WPs provide English texts in footnotes for their translations to individual languages. I hope this is a satisfactory explanation. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 05:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
