<p><b>Brainiac</b> is a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a>, a <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervillain.html" title="Supervillain">supervillain</a> and frequent opponent of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>. Created by <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Binder_bd43.html" title="Otto Binder">Otto Binder</a>, he first appeared in <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Comics_442a.html" title="Action Comics">Action Comics</a></i> #242 (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html#July" title="1958">July 1958</a>). Due to complex storylines involving <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloning.html" title="Cloning">cloning</a>, and revisions of <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuity_%28fiction%29.html" title="Continuity (fiction)">continuity</a>, several variations of Brainiac have appeared.</p>
<p>Though at his core Brainiac is formless, most incarnations depict him as a bald, green-skinned <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture.html" title="Extraterrestrial life in popular culture">alien</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/Android.html" title="Android">android</a> from the planet <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Colu</a>, and one of the most intelligent villains in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_universe_6a6e.html" title="DC universe">DC universe</a>, capable of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_possession.html" title="Spiritual possession">possessing</a> others, creating and manipulating <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> systems, and exerting some control over time and space.

<p>Brainiac has been one of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>'s most important enemies ever since the villain's first appearance, and was adapted into the <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Friends_75d8.html" title="Super Friends">Super Friends</a></i> <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_series.html" title="Animated series">animated series</a>, as well as the subsequent <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Animated_Universe_512c.html" title="DC Animated Universe">DC Animated Universe</a> and the live-action <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> adaptation <i><a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28TV_series%29_b037.html" title="Smallville (TV series)">Smallville</a>.</i></p>
<p>Brainiac's name derives from the -IAC naming trend among <a href="../../../o/n/e/Category%7EOne-of-a-kind_computers_f873.html" title="Category:One-of-a-kind computers">early electronic computers</a>, after <a href="../../../e/n/i/ENIAC_3400.html" title="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>: <a href="../../../i/l/l/ILLIAC_I_023b.html" title="ILLIAC I">ILLIAC</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/JOHNNIAC_e0b7.html" title="JOHNNIAC">JOHNNIAC</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/MANIAC_I_5864.html" title="MANIAC I">MANIAC</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/l/SILLIAC_24c5.html" title="SILLIAC">SILLIAC</a>, <i>etc.</i> In the television series <i><a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28TV_series%29_b037.html" title="Smallville (TV series)">Smallville</a>,</i> BRAINIAC is said to stand for "BRAIN InterActive Construct".</p>

</div>
<p>First appearing in <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Comics_442a.html" title="Action Comics">Action Comics</a></i> #242 (July 1958), Brainiac was a bald, green-skinned <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanoid.html" title="Humanoid">humanoid</a> who arrived on Earth and shrank various cities, including <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28comics%29.html" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>, storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore Bryak, the planet he ruled.</p>
<p>While fighting Brainiac, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> discovered that the villain had previously shrunk the <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krypton_%28comics%29.html" title="Krypton (comics)">Kryptonian</a> city of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kandor.html" title="Kandor">Kandor</a>. He was able to restore the Earth cities to full size, but the Kandorians sacrificed their restoration to help him. <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> stored the city in his <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortress_of_Solitude_3b36.html" title="Fortress of Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a>, vowing to return the natives to full size.</p>
<p><br />
In <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a></i> #167 (February 1964), it was discovered that Brainiac was a machine created by the Computer Tyrants of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Colu</a> as a spy. To increase the illusion that he was alive, Brainiac was given a "son", a young <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Coluan</a> boy who was given the name "Brainiac 2", but escaped; this was <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_5.html" title="Brainiac 5">Brainiac 5</a>'s ancestor. It was later revealed that his name was <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vril_Dox_9954.html" title="Vril Dox">Vril Dox</a>, and that he went on to lead a revolt against the Computer Tyrants. His "origin" as a tyrant of Byrak could be considered a cover story, as part of his illusion. It was in this story that Brainiac first appeared with a distinctive gridwork of red <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diode.html" title="Diode">diodes</a> across his head, later explained as the "electric terminals of his sensory nerves"; this would remain his appearance throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>DC Comics attempted to re-define several aspects of its <i>Superman</i> series in the 1980s, in order to boost sagging sales. At the same time <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a> acquired his green-and-purple battlesuit, Braniac was re-envisioned (under the auspices of writer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marv_Wolfman_a37d.html" title="Marv Wolfman">Marv Wolfman</a>). In <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Comics_442a.html" title="Action Comics">Action Comics</a></i> #544 (June 1983), Brainiac had constructed a giant, artificial, computer-controlled planet and used it in his latest attempt to destroy Superman; unfortunately, his defeat at the hands of the Man of Steel left him trapped at the center of the planet, unable to escape. He was forced to make a nearby star explode in a <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova.html" title="Nova">nova</a> in order to destroy the machine-world and allow him to re-create his form. His new body (designed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Perez_835c.html" title="George Perez">George Perez</a>) had the appearance of a <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeleton.html" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a> of living metal with a grey, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeycomb.html" title="Honeycomb">honeycomb</a>-patterned "braincase."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> He also created a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship.html" title="Starship">starship</a> to house his new body, that was actually an extension of himself; the ship was shaped like his own skull, with metal tentacles dangling from it that he could manipulate at will. Brainiac retained this appearance until after the <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>.</i></p>
<p>As part of Brainiac's re-creation, Wolfman added a new aspect to Brainiac's personality. During his regeneration, Brainiac experienced a vision in which he saw Superman in the guise of a God-like "Master Programmer." This Master Programmer was responsible for a massive conspiracy to destroy Brainiac and keep him from achieving perfection (and domination of the universe). From this vision, Brainiac concluded that it was necessary for him to destroy the Master Programmer in order to achieve his goal -- therefore, his ultimate goal was to destroy Superman, who he saw as the Master Programmer's "angel of death." This new, insane motivation re-cast Brainiac as a cold-hearted, ruthless machine, and he appeared several times in this aspect until he was re-written. Further <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retcons</a> of Brainiac removed the "Master Programmer" aspect of his personality entirely.</p>

<p>Brainiac's legacy was revealed in <i><a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_Comics_442a.html" title="Action Comics">Action Comics</a></i> #276, in a <i><a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super-Heroes_043c.html" title="Legion of Super-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></i> back-up story. This introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox, or <b><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_5.html" title="Brainiac 5">Brainiac 5</a></b>, who believed himself to be Brainiac's 30th century descendant. Unlike his apparent ancestor, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_5.html" title="Brainiac 5">Brainiac 5</a> used his "twelfth-level intellect" for the forces of good, and joined the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_9731.html" title="Legion of Super Heroes">Legion</a> alongside <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergirl.html" title="Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, with whom he fell in love.

Vril Dox was now a radical <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Coluan</a> scientist who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Colu</a>, was sentenced to death. In his last moments, his consciousness was attracted to Milton Fine, a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias "Brainiac." Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a> powers, which he frequently wielded against <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>.

The <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diode.html" title="Diode">diodes</a> in Brainiac's head now increased and stabilized his mental powers, as well as allowing him direct access to computer banks. He continued to plague <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>, using a combination of mental powers and computer control. On one occasion, Brainiac even returned to his pre-<a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis</a> incarnation's city-shrinking tactics.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossover.html" title="Crossover">crossover</a> story <i>Invasion!</i>, it was revealed that, prior to its dispersion, the Computer Tyrants allowed Dox to clone a lab assistant, <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vril_Dox_II_0f25.html" title="Vril Dox II">Vril Dox II</a>, who would go on to form <a href="../../../l/2E/e/L.E.G.I.O.N._278d.html" title="L.E.G.I.O.N.">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a>, and (although he never uses the name) is the post-<a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis</a> version of Brainiac 2.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, Brainiac returned with a vengeance in a storyline entitled "Panic in the Sky". He seized control of Warworld and managed to convince Maxima to assist him. Then he brainwashed Supergirl (matrix) and the alien warrior Draaga before capturing Metron and setting off for Earth. Orion and Lightray of New Genesis attacked Warworld, but they were quickly taken down by Maxima and Supergirl. Brainiac sent the mental image of the new gods captured to Superman in order to taunt him. He also sent his "headship" to Earth in a punitive expedition.</p>
<p>These acts prompted Superman to go on the offense rather than wait for the inevitable invasion. He gathered a coalition of most of the world's superheroes and launched a preemptive strike at Warworld before it could arrive on Earth. A small, elite force was left behind for any scouting forces that would be sent ahead. Superman lead the attack on Warworld, where Supergirl and Draaga managed to shrug off their brainwashing and rally to Superman (although Draaga was killed in the fighting). Maxima would shortly switch sides in the fighting too, perceiving Brainiac as the true villain at last. Brainiac briefly took control of some of Earth's heroes, but it was not enough to turn the tide. Flash, Maxima, and the Metal Men attacked him in his lair, where Maxima managed to lobotomize him (but was stopped short of killing him). His vegetative body was taken back to New Genesis for observation.</p>

<p>Brainiac would next emerge about a year after the Death and Return of Superman. After a dead body appeared in Superman's tomb, prompting the world to wonder if the Superman who was flying around was the original or a fake, Superman began to track down all of his foes who might be capable of such a hoax. While Brainiac was initially eliminated as a suspect, he soon turned out to be the true culprit, creating the illusion even in his comatose state on New Genesis. He managed to revive himself there and returned to Earth in secret. While hidden, he created even more delusions, causing Superman to question his very sanity before realizing who was really at fault. Superman and Brainiac squared off in Metropolis, where Superman taunted the evil villain, claiming that at heart he was really just Milton Fine, a cheap entertainer. This caused some break in Brainiac's mind where Fine's personality reasserted himself, burying Brainiac's. "Fine" was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.</p>

<p>Brainiac's mind reemerged at the hospital. Brainiac's new plan was to lure Superman there where he managed to pull a "mind switch" on the Man of Steel. Brainiac's mind was put in Superman's body, while Superman's mind was put into the body of a 13 year old mental patient--one who thought that he was Superman! Brainiac, frustrated with the lack of mental powers Superman's body afforded, came up with a plan to download a vast amount of knowledge into the minds of all Metropolis citizens, thereby using them as a giant storage device. To that end he built a new lair in the center of the city and sealed it off from the outside. Superman, in the body of the kid, managed to infiltrate the city and switch everyone's minds into the right bodies. Unfortunately, this left Brainiac back in control of his original body and he quickly blasted Superman with his psychic abilities. Luckily, the young boy whose body Superman had been in managed to save the day, reversing the flow of information Brainiac had created, jamming all of the vast knowledge into Brainiac. This left him completely nearly catatonic again, muttering in binary code.</p>

In order to preserve his life, he concocted an elaborate scheme: he had an agent of his, a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Coluan</a> named Prin Vnok, use a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time machine</a> to travel to the most inhospitable time in existence, the <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_Time_7b6b.html" title="End of Time">End of Time</a> itself. Brainiac's goal was to rescue <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_%28comics%29.html" title="Doomsday (comics)">Doomsday</a>, who had been left there by <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverider_%28comics%29.html" title="Waverider (comics)">Waverider</a> to ensure that he would never be a threat again.</p>

There, a terminally-wounded Brainiac transferred his consciousness into <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_%28comics%29.html" title="Doomsday (comics)">Doomsday</a>'s body, temporarily becoming the most powerful being in the universe, a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a> <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a> mind inside an unstoppable, indestructible titan. However, <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_%28comics%29.html" title="Doomsday (comics)">Doomsday</a>'s own raging mind would eventually overwhelm even Brainiac's will, forcing him to find another body. Although Brainiac attempted to clone a new <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_%28comics%29.html" title="Doomsday (comics)">Doomsday</a> that he could fully inhabit, his efforts failed and he was forced to adopt a robotic body, dubbed <b>Brainiac 2.5</b>.

<p>At the turn of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a>, Brainiac revealed that he had placed a sleeper <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_virus.html" title="Computer virus">virus</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexCorp_749d.html" title="LexCorp">LexCorp</a>'s <a href="../../../y/2/k/Y2K_bug_2f42.html" title="Y2K bug">Y2K bug</a> safeguards; this was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. Instead, it allowed his upgraded future self, <b>Brainiac 13</b> (or "B-13"), to arrive from the 64th century. Brainiac 13 began transforming <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28comics%29.html" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a> into the 64th century version of the city, which, apparently, he controlled. When it became apparent he was to be defeated by the combined efforts of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>, and his own past self (now possessing the body of Luthor's infant daughter Lena), Brainiac 13 gave control of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28comics%29.html" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a> to Luthor in exchange for Lena/Brainiac 2.5, whom he forced to help him escape.</p>
<p>He returned to Earth during the <i>Our Worlds at War</i> crossover, in which Earth and its allies fought a multi-front war against Brainiac 13 and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperiex.html" title="Imperiex">Imperiex</a>. Brainiac 13 claimed to be allying himself with Earth, but this proved to be part of a complex plan to regain control. His chief aide was "Leniac", a green-skinned teenage girl with "control discs" on her forehead, suggesting the <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diode.html" title="Diode">diodes</a> of earlier Brainiacs (and identical to the forehead discs of the "upgraded" <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_5.html#Post-Reboot" title="Brainiac 5">Brainiac 5.1</a> in the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_9731.html" title="Legion of Super Heroes">Legion of Super Heroes</a>, and the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">Superman: The Animated Series</a></i> version of the original Brainiac). At the end of the war, Brainiac 13 and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperiex.html" title="Imperiex">Imperiex</a> were both sent back in time, becoming part of the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>, and Brainiac 2.5 was expunged from Lena, who reverted to infancy, although the discs remained.</p>
<p>In the upcoming <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC</a> Minimates action figure line, Brainiac 13 is packaged with Battle Damaged <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Brainiac used his "granddaughter", Brainiac 8 (aka <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigo_%28comics%29.html" title="Indigo (comics)">Indigo</a>), to kill <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Troy_5a8c.html" title="Donna Troy">Donna Troy</a> in order to ensure the fate of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Colu</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigo_%28comics%29.html" title="Indigo (comics)">Indigo</a> then infiltrated the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsiders_%28comics%29.html" title="Outsiders (comics)">Outsiders</a> until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac and his allies, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>, and a brainwashed <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29_559e.html" title="Superboy (Kon-El)">Superboy</a>, who had attacked the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titans_%28comics%29.html" title="Titans (comics)">Teen Titans</a>. In the ensuing battle, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigo_%28comics%29.html" title="Indigo (comics)">Indigo</a> died and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29_559e.html" title="Superboy (Kon-El)">Superboy</a> broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.</p>
<p>In this recent storyline, it was revealed that Brainiac was able to utilize Luthor's secret facilities to restore the majority of his organic body. Brainiac 8 chided him for this act of vanity, explaining that, in her time, all of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colu.html" title="Colu">Colu</a> had abandoned organics. Though it's unclear just what year she originates from, she must be at least a few decades removed from the early 31st century as Brainiac 5, of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_9731.html" title="Legion of Super Heroes">Legion of Super Heroes</a>, is an organic Coluan, as are other Coluans from that era.</p>
<p>Shortly after this storyline, the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titans_%28comics%29.html" title="Titans (comics)">Teen Titans</a> broke into one of Luthor's labs in order to procure a serum to save a dying <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy_%28Kon-El%29_559e.html" title="Superboy (Kon-El)">Superboy</a>. In this encounter, they discovered many failed attempts in cloning a new body for Brainiac, and fought the so-called <b>Brainiac Alpha</b>, a murderous, aborted <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_%28genetics%29.html" title="Clone (genetics)">clone</a>.</p>

<p>Brainiac returned in the 2006 <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct-to-video.html" title="Direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> animated feature <i><a href="../../../b/r/a/Superman%7E_Brainiac_Attacks_54d7.html" title="Superman: Brainiac Attacks">Superman: Brainiac Attacks</a></i>, where he was voiced by <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Henriksen_1cc0.html" title="Lance Henriksen">Lance Henriksen</a>.</p>
<p>The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteor.html" title="Meteor">meteor</a>. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> destroys him with his <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic.html" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptonite.html" title="Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a> beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>.</p>
<p>Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolved around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be defeated by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed.</p>

This prompts Darkseid to come to the Watchtower and ask the Justice League for help. The story was a ruse, however, one intended on luring the Justice League and Superman in particular to Brainiac's mainframe. Darkseid then betrayed Brainiac, however, and in the subsequent battle both the machine intelligence and Darkseid were destroyed.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>During a previous encounter years before (in the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">Superman: The Animated Series</a></i> episode "Ghost in the Machine"), Brainiac had delivered a nano-robotic probe carrying a portion of his consciousness into <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>. It began modifying Luthor's body, subtly controlling him into committing actions that resulted in a major <a href="../../../s/t/o/Story_arc.html" title="Story arc">story arc</a> that occurred throughout the first two seasons of <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i>.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode "Panic in the Sky" and continuing into the following episode, "Divided We Fall", Brainiac revealed himself to the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a> and assimilated <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a> from the alien Dark Heart machine as well as technology derived from <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazo.html" title="Amazo">Amazo</a>. At Luthor's urging, Brainiac merged with Luthor, becoming a single entity possessing Brainiac's goals and approaches tempered by Luthor's ambition and cruelty, with the new purpose of destroying the universe and recreating it in their image.</p>
<p>The traditional Brainiac skull-shaped spaceship and "Brainiac controlling <a href="../../../l/e/x/LexCorp_749d.html" title="LexCorp">LexCorp</a>" storyline were evident in "Divided We Fall." This version of Brainiac was mostly gold and blue, and partially robotic. Though they managed to subdue most of the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a> members, Luthor/Brainiac were ultimately defeated by the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wally_West_3092.html" title="Wally West">Flash</a>.</p>
<p>After the defeat, all that was left of Brainiac was a small piece of its body, which somehow came into the possession of <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla_Grodd_87ad.html" title="Gorilla Grodd">Gorilla Grodd</a>. Luthor himself continued to speak to Brainiac's consciousness, apparently still existing within his own mind. Urged by Brainiac to escape prison, Luthor was picked up by Grodd's <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Doom_96e1.html" title="Legion of Doom">Legion of Doom</a> and convinced to join by the promise of getting his hands on the Brainiac fragment, with which he could reconstruct and re-merge with him. Though he eventually usurped leadership of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Doom_96e1.html" title="Legion of Doom">Legion</a> from Grodd, Luthor remained unable to unlock the Brainiac fragment for some reason, and instead used it to locate the quadrant of the universe where Brainiac had been destroyed along with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkseid.html" title="Darkseid">Darkseid</a>. Using a combination of technology and magic, Luthor intended to reintegrate the surviving pieces into a new version of the android, only to wind up resurrecting <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkseid.html" title="Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, who was reformed with extensive Brainiac technology integrated into himself, allowing the dark lord to destroy the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Doom_96e1.html" title="Legion of Doom">Legion</a>'s headquarters/craft and return to <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apokolips.html" title="Apokolips">Apokolips</a>.</p>
<p>Luthor and the surviving <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Doom_96e1.html" title="Legion of Doom">Legion</a> members returned to Earth and joined forces with the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a> to stop <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apokolips.html" title="Apokolips">Apokolips</a>' attack on Earth, and Luthor claimed to no longer be able to hear Brainiac inside his head, although when Luthor was then transported to the Source Wall and recovered the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Life_Equation_69ea.html" title="Anti-Life Equation">Anti-Life Equation</a>, it was claimed that only a "twelfth-level intellect" could accomplish this, and the only individual with this <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_560e.html" title="IQ">IQ</a> is Brainiac. Ultimately, however, it was never explicitly revealed if Brainiac had <i>ever</i> truly existed within Luthor's mind, or if Luthor was partially insane.</p>
<p>In the year 2979, as it is revealed in the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">Superman: The Animated Series</a></i> episode "New Kids In Town", Brainiac still lives and has made enemies of the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_9731.html" title="Legion of Super Heroes">Legion of Super Heroes</a>. During that time, it learned how to pass its code down biologically and created <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_5.html" title="Brainiac 5">Brainiac 5</a>; however, this iteration of the Brainiac identity turned out to be good, and joined the Legion in an effort to atone for the crimes of his predecessors. The original Brainiac traveled back to the past to kill the teenage <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Kent_46f6.html" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a> before he would become <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>. Thanks in part to <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Boy_a262.html" title="Cosmic Boy">Cosmic Boy</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chameleon_Boy_0e33.html" title="Chameleon Boy">Chameleon Boy</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_Girl_d876.html" title="Saturn Girl">Saturn Girl</a>, Clark defeated Brainiac, and it was teleported into the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">sun</a>, where it incinerated, destroying what may have been the last remnant of its original form for good.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergirl.html" title="Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, along with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stewart_%28comics%29_6b5e.html" title="John Stewart (comics)">Green Lantern</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a>, was pulled to the 30th century to help the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_9731.html" title="Legion of Super Heroes">Legion</a>, she and Brainiac began to fall in love and Supergirl ultimately decided to stay in the 30th century. This left Lantern and Green Arrow in the unenviable position of telling <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> that Kara had stayed behind partly because of her feelings for <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_5.html" title="Brainiac 5">Brainiac 5</a>, and of trying to explain why that is not a problem.</p>

</div>
<p>In the fifth season of <i><a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28TV_series%29_b037.html" title="Smallville (TV series)">Smallville</a></i>, Brainiac is introduced as a recurring villain, played by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Marsters_8681.html" title="James Marsters">James Marsters</a>. In all of the episodes in which he appears, he is referred to as "Milton Fine", although he is referred to as the "Brain InterActive Construct" by <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jor-El_0b7b.html" title="Jor-El">Jor-El</a> in the episode "<a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28Season_5%29_3546.html#Vessel" title="Smallville (Season 5)">Vessel</a>". In the season six episode "<a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28Season_6%29_b5d0.html#Fallout" title="Smallville (Season 6)">Fallout</a>", Raya is the first person to actually pronounce it "Brainiac". <i>Smallville'</i>s interpretation of Brainiac is similar to the one used in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Superman%7E_The_Animated_Series_7a6c.html" title="Superman: The Animated Series">Superman: The Animated Series</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i>; that of a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin.</p>
<p>His first appearance is at the end of the episode "<a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28Season_5%29_3546.html#Arrival" title="Smallville (Season 5)">Arrival</a>". Brainiac is seen taking human form from a black liquid that oozes from the black <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krypton_%28comics%29.html" title="Krypton (comics)">Kryptonian</a> spaceship which crash-landed in the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28Season_4%29_f566.html" title="Smallville (Season 4)">Season 4</a> finale. The liquid forms into a bubbling cluster of black crystals that eventually morph into a humanoid body.</p>
<p>The first time Clark is introduced to Brainiac is in the episode <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28Season_5%29_3546.html#Aqua" title="Smallville (Season 5)">Aqua</a>. He is acting as a professor of world history at Central Kansas A&amp;M University. He hires <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Kent_46f6.html" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a> as a research assistant and takes him under his wing. He exhibits the ability to transform his fingers or hands into spike-like weapons (much in the same manner as the <a href="../../../t/-/1/T-1000.html" title="T-1000">T-1000</a> in <i><a href="../../../j/u/d/Terminator_2%7E_Judgment_Day_6dc9.html" title="Terminator 2: Judgment Day">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></i>), stabbing and slaying people with them. Fine has no true form, and uses the black ship to create multiple copies of himself.</p>
<p>Through several acts of deception, Fine is able to poison Clark and later convince him that he is a fellow Kryptonian. Again Fine uses deception to further sway Clark into his grasp when he infects Martha with a mysterious Kryptonian disease in the episode <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28Season_5%29_3546.html#Solitude" title="Smallville (Season 5)">Solitude</a>. Fine quickly convinces Clark that it is Jor-El's doing and that he must take him to the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortress_of_Solitude_3b36.html" title="Fortress of Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a> so that they can sever Jor-El's ties to Earth and save Martha. As soon as they are there it's clear that Fine is lying, as he betrays Clark and sets out to free <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Zod_1922.html" title="General Zod">General Zod</a>, whom Fine had previously referred to as a freedom fighter against the tyrannical ruler Jor-El. When he betrayed Clark, he informed him that Jor-El was a benevolent leader, and Zod, a power-hungry insurrectionist.</p>
<p>Clark meets Fine again in Lex's mansion. Fine claims that Clark was originally intended to be Zod's vessel, but when <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jor-El_0b7b.html" title="Jor-El">Jor-El</a>'s spirit proved to be too strong in Clark, he was forced to turn elsewhere. When Clark refuses to aid him in his plan again, Fine unleashes a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_virus.html" title="Computer virus">computer virus</a> that quickly infects every computer system on Earth, shutting down every bit of technology and causing widespread chaos. In one last confrontation, Clark chooses to kill Fine instead of Lex, in an effort to prevent Zod's coming, but inadvertently causes the very thing Fine was trying to accomplish. Clark's efforts, though they free Zod, manage to destroy Fine, and all his subsequent copies.</p>
<p>On a humorous note, while posing as a professor, Fine posed the often-repeated question and answer to the class, "Where is the most powerful computer in the universe?", followed by several taps on his own temple, making the subtle joke that his <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> is more powerful than their natural intelligence.</p>
