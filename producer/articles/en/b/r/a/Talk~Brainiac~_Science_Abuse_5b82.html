<p>She's quite obviously a rather bad Tina Turner "impersonator", which is of course the intended joke</p>
<p>Yes, that's right, she is bad, indeed. But if she's bad or not is more a matter of personal taste. I found it useful to find that information about Tina Turner and her bunsen burner in the article, and could even add a tiny fact (about Nutbush, where she alledgedly used to blew up cars first) to that portion that someone might like to be just there. Who knows... Trivia knowledge that sometimes appears here. But if it is based on facts I appreciate it. Who knows what it is good for.</p>
<p>Do you think the Tina Turner and her bunsen burner item on the list is too biased?</p>
<p>No, I do not think the Tina Turner item is a bias in itself. I do not like the following pharses because they are not neutral enough, exaggerate without a reason or are irrelevant:</p>
<p><b>rather obvious</b> - if it is obvious or not is in the eye of the observer. I think she walks like Tina pretty well.&#160;;-)</p>
<p><b>pop star</b> Tina Turner - if she's a star or not ... maybe she is. she definitely is a singer.</p>
<p><b>coloured cars</b> - yes, sure ... aren't all cars coloured?!?</p>
<p>explosives <b>such as gunpowder</b> - I think to mention explosives is enough, who cannot imagine an example of an explosive can look it up in the relevant article.</p>
<p><b>metal burning fireball</b> - sounds like from a star trek movie...</p>
<p>current version:</p>
<p>Tina Turner and her Bunsen Burner - A rather obvious impersonator of pop star Tina Turner "takes a break" from show business to do explosive science with her bunsen burner "like she did in her lab in Nutbush", and with any type of explosives such as gunpowder that she needs to destroy her choice of a coloured car; she lights it up with her burner and waits until it becomes a metal burning fireball.</p>

<p>It has already been hinted in the current article, but I think it would be appropriate to point out how unreliable the results of the experiments carried out in the shows are. The show is, of course, mainly meant for for entertainment, but unreliable results may give the viewer false ideas. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHauberg_81bd.html" title="User:Hauberg">Hauberg</a> 18:53, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please state exactly which experiments have incorrect results, what the results "should" be, and the reasons. --207.109.251.120 05:25, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry for not being specific. One example would be an episode in which they conducted an experiment concerning which remedy was best for avoiding tears when chopping onions. Three different remedies were tested by having three different people testing one remedy each. The host of the show concluded that holding a lemon in your mouth was the best because the person using this method shred the least amount of tears. This is, by my reckoning, an example on unreliable and possible invalid results, as the fact that the difference in shredded tears could just be a result of the three persons not being equally prone to the tear inducing chemical from the chopped onions.</p>

<p>This very point has now been added to the page. Although if you can't tell that the show isn't serious, you do seriously need a sense of humour replacement. However, as i've stated in the Mythbusters section below, i've added this info.</p>

<p>This show completely rips off, or should I say attempts to rip off Mythbusters. However, being complete retards with no knowledge of anything, brainiac had to add semi naked woman to make their show seem cooler. I hope you all die of bird flu</p>
<p><br />
..</p>
<p>Congratulations for completely missing the point. I've now removed your blatant trolling from the Brainiac page.</p>
<p>Sigh this show does not rip off mythbusters, it hardly EVER puts myths to the test, in fact I'd say this show is more like Bill Nye than Mythbusters. How would I know, I see both shows. This show is more about experiments, in fact in one episode they tested to see which type of packaging material is the most effective, they did this by chucking TVs out of a van going 65 mph (each one coated with a different protective packaging). I should also remind you about their attempts to destroy a black box flight recorder and of course electrocution now does that sound like mythbusters?</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed that the show's experiments lack any scientific analysis? The Brainiac team tends to use random guesses and sporadic pieces of inconsistent data to prove uncertain points. Or is that the humor behind the show?</p>
<ul>
<li>I question the inclustion of a link to the <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythbusters.html" title="Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a> article due to the above valid reasons. It's just another TV show that performs experiments and has no relationship to Brainiac. The only reason I can imagine for the cross-reference is due to the oft-heard "Mythbusters Rip Off" argument. As this argument is debunked above, I think the cross reference should be removed --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickMeasham_8e0a.html" title="User:RickMeasham">RickMeasham</a> 07:21, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds a bit like MythBusters mixed with Bill Nye, with just a hint of Beauty and the Geek (you know, weird tasks for smart people that still appeal to the general public), if you ask me. It really doesn't "rip off" anything... I've never seen it but from the description, it sounds like a few key elements fused into one show, which, in theory, sounds interesting.162.83.104.252 01:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Without going into too much detail (because it's fairly clear from the article), the content appears to reflect a negattive bias againts the show. Whilst it's fairly conclusively been established that much of the "science" is either faked or embellished, it should be presented in suh a way that reflects exactly that - that it's not actually been proven. <i>This comment was added 15 July 2006 by User:81.170.50.65</i></p>
<p>I think most people realise that Brainiac is an entertainment show first, and a science show second. For good or for bad, that's why it is a ratings success. So any alleged "embellishments" are not so bad as they might be on a serious science show. There are some proper scientific segments, but I suspect there are a lot of viewers who just want to see a caravan explode.</p>
<p>I think it's similar "controversy" as to Have I Got News For You being scripted.</p>

<p>If you look here: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,,1826518,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,,1826518,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,,1826518,00.html</a></p>
<p>you'll see that they have admitted to faking some of their experiments without informing their viewers of this. I think, maybe it should be in the article?</p>

<dd>I fully agree that this should be added to the article. Additional references are here: <a href="http://www.badscience.net/?p=270" class="external free" title="http://www.badscience.net/?p=270" rel="nofollow">http://www.badscience.net/?p=270</a> . Seriously the explosions in this experiment: ( <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=m55kgyApYrY" class="external free" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=m55kgyApYrY" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=m55kgyApYrY</a> ) was done purely through dynamite, and not through the chemicals they put in the bath. You can even see the detonating wire going into the bath in some of the shots.
