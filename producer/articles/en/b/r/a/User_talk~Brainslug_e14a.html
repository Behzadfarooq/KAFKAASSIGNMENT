<p>I just edited the Aly &amp; AJ page removing the following trivia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aly &amp; AJ have been playing piano since they were six.</li>
<li>In a Radio Disney interview they say every holiday season they each do something, Aly: Decorates the house, AJ: Cooks.</li>
<li>Aly won a contest in 4th Grade. She had to design a holiday greating card and it was made into a Hallmark card.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then check my watchlist and find that you added: "At age 10, Aly's greeting card design won the Hallmark Kids Card Contest." This trivia is not Wikipedia-worthy. It's interesting, but even by trivia standards, it doesn't belong on Wikipedia. I am going to remove it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We had an edit conflict. I had been working on the trivia at the same time, attempting to find sources and clean up the grammar. Since I had a cite for it and it was mentioned in the trivia on the official website, I figured it might as well stay in. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainslug_c5db.html" title="User:Brainslug">Brainslug</a> 23:26, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had no problem with your grammar changing; I do that all the time. I'm not accusing you of adding the trivia about the piano, the Radio Disney interview, and the Hallmark card; all I'm saying is that, when I removed them, you added the Hallmark Kids Card Contest (with a reference). I removed that too. All I'm saying is that you added information not Wikipedia-worthy. However, if it turns out that that information was Wikipedia-worthy, then I'm sorry I removed it. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 23:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure exactly when trivia about a musical artist is Wikipedia-worthy; since this particular piece was included as trivia in an official biography, I thought it was worth keeping. In any case, I'm not insisting that it be reinstated, just making it clear what happened. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainslug_c5db.html" title="User:Brainslug">Brainslug</a> 00:24, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not totally sure what qualifies as trivia either (so I ask other Users about it), but I do know that adding information about cards that they made is certainly not trivia. However, the piano trivia could be re-added, but it should also be lengthened. Adding something about a song they did would count as Wikipedia-worthy trivia. Anyway, at least you weren't vandalizing the Aly &amp; AJ page as others have been doing recently. Keep up the good work. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcalamari_163c.html" title="User:Acalamari">Acalamari</a> 01:11, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted the same edit as you to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delores_Park_b510.html" title="Delores Park">Delores Park</a> article, but I think the IP may have been trying to make a good faith edit, even if s/he is doing it improperly.</p>
<p>I have to say that I enjoy seeing some of your edit summaries - e.g. "rv... puh-lease" when removing a bogus rumor about someone being gay. At the same time, it's important not to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">bite newbies</a> as they are a valuable resource for the project.

<dd>I am actually very suspicious of this edit, even with the attempt to cite it in the edit summary, since the only reference I can find to the "Weiner Section" folks is on somebody's MySpace page. I also live near the park and have not seen any evidence of it. But you're right, I am probably harsher than I ought to be, and my edit summaries are sometimes not informative. I will endeavor to improve. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainslug_c5db.html" title="User:Brainslug">Brainslug</a> 17:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm now convinced that the edit was vandalism, since the cite they came up with seems to refer either to new information retrieved from an interview conducted with a man who died 45 years ago, or to a book that has no mention of them in the index. It's remarkably cheerful vandalism, though. In any case, I appreciate your feedback. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainslug_c5db.html" title="User:Brainslug">Brainslug</a> 03:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I am the one posting the information about "Weiner Section" and I admit I am new to editing Wikipedia but I am trying to give some information that I have a bit of information. "Weiner Section" are indeed mentioned in that interveiw but more importantly the group is one in exsistance today and can be found daily in Dolores Park. They are indeed a huge part of the contemporary culture of Dolores Park and should be mentioned. If you do indeed live near the park, do some personal research on the matter and take a stroll through the side of Dolores Park closest to 18th street. I most commonly spot them on the weekends any time from 6PM-1AM. Sorry if this was an inappropriate place to post this. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukereiser_216d.html" title="User:Lukereiser">Lukereiser</a> 03:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, what interview? Where can we read this interview? It is not in my recent printing of the book you mentioned. Second, it doesn't seem like this is, in fact, a huge part of the culture of the park, since I know the park very well and have never heard of it, since there are no references on the web or in the local papers (I checked three of them) to this group. Third, the only references in general I can find are to a group of idiots on MySpace, and while this may be hilarious to them, it's not helpful to the larger Wikipedia effort. I am going to request protection of the article if these edits continue without proper sourcing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainslug_c5db.html" title="User:Brainslug">Brainslug</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brainslug_266b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brainslug">contribs</a>) 03:49, 6 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Obviously you do not have a very broad knowledge of the culture of Dolores Park... The article on Wikipedia is very exiguous and does not mention anything about either Weiner Section nor Big Kid Fun two very important cultural aspects of Dolores Park. If you would like, I could type out the entire interview that I found in my copy of The Barbary Coast, but that you have failed to find. I will try to find another source that makes reference to Weiner Section and perhaps Big Kid Fun (BKF, a similar group). If you are truely trying to help the greater Wikipedia effort please let people include information on contemporary culture espcially when they have exclusive information relating to the topic as well as a published (Notable) paper source. Like I said before, if you truely want to make an effort to disprove do some personal research and come to Dolores Park and ask KIDS if they know a thing or two about Weiner Section or BKF. Thats all I ask, Thank you. P.S. How can you argue with the picture!? <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukereiser_216d.html" title="User:Lukereiser">Lukereiser</a> 04:15, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not a troll... My only intentions have ever been to spread some interesting and truthful information and all you have tried to do is try and prove it wrong without even the slightest attempt to help a new Wikipedia editor submit a legitimate and notable peice of information. I see no reason why anyone would even have the inclination to fabricate this in the first place. I think that it is simply your believe that the name "Weiner Section" is a strange and possibly silly one so you automatically assumed that the information was not legitmate. I do not believe you live anywhere near the park and have not encountered this group of youngsters, like I said take a look around the park, I am sure you will be able to find them around Friday night. Try by the green container closer to 18th street side or perhaps near the statue in the middle. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukereiser_216d.html" title="User:Lukereiser">Lukereiser</a> 04:32, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The matter is settled, as far as I'm concerned. The sources you gave were fraudulent, the evidence of gang activity is a photograph of some teenagers in the park, the only references one can find that mention this "Weiner Section" are some pages by a giggly clique on MySpace, and your story about the source of the material has changed significantly. I am sure that there are in fact a bunch of giggly potsmoking teenagers who hang out in the park; I am not sure why this fact would be worth mentioning in a Wikipedia article. And since you have been dishonest in the past, I am not inclined to continue speaking with you directly.</dd>

<dd>That is fine post an RfC or I will. What you seem to be doing is making me the enemy and any information I want to post "vandalism" when really we are both interested in Dolores Park but just have different ideas of what should be included in the article. To my knowledge this bit of information meets all Wikipedia's notability requirements Why don't you just let me include this information and perhaps we can work together to add a part to the article debating the legitimacy of this information until you stop being lazy and read the interveiw yourself. I can type up and email you the interveiw, or you can go get the version of the book I have and look at it youself. What you seem to be forgetting (lost somewhere in your personal dislike for myself) is that this information is true and current. Like I said find out for yourself, or email the man who did the interveiw at info@gangsorus.com or call him at 803-345-2600. I acquired all this contact information from Robert Walker's website www.gangsorus.com. Thank you and please be open to reconsider. I am unfamiliar with these MySpace pages, but they seem interesting considering MySpace is the number one social networking tool in the world. If you could, please link them to me. Thank you.

<dd>I accept the rebuke, but I'm pretty sure that at least most of the reverts that I did (you don't specify where the problem was) were attempts to undo vandalism and restore order. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainslug_c5db.html" title="User:Brainslug">Brainslug</a> 06:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Too often one editor' vandalism is another's order. In such cases it's best to ask for page protection (<a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">WP:RFP</a>) or other help. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 07:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't mean to say that you vandalized your own Talk Page. I should have said that clearing message from your own Talk Page <i>could</i> be interpreted as hostility or vandalism.

<p>I have added a "{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}" template to the article <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophie_Maxwell_6729.html" title="Sophie Maxwell">Sophie Maxwell</a>, suggesting that it be deleted according to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">proposed deletion</a> process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>). Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, or, if you disagree with the notice, discuss the issues at <a href="../../../s/o/p/Talk%7ESophie_Maxwell_cd89.html" title="Talk:Sophie Maxwell">its talk page</a>. Please do not remove the notice without addressing the issues it mentions (it is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>). Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a> or it can be sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarfieldian_373f.html" title="User:Warfieldian">Warfieldian</a> 19:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
