<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_Harrington_4cef.html" title="Brandy Harrington">Brandy Harrington</a></b> (age 15) (voiced by <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaley_Cuoco_77ec.html" title="Kaley Cuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a>): Brandy is a female <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphic.html" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> dog from an opulent family she constantly brags about. Because of her social origins, she is accustomed to <i>the finer things in life</i>. Her character is modeled after Paris Hilton, from the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Life_d261.html" title="Simple Life">Simple Life</a> series in appearance and with stereotypical condescending attitudes of opulent people. While on her way to a five-star spa, a mishap with Mr. Whiskers caused the two of them to fall straight into the Amazon Rainforest, most likely a door blowout on the aircraft. This theory is proven by two things, the very first being that their falling out of the aircraft is featured on the beginning clip. The second being the door used on the treehouse is an aircraft exit door. A strange thing happens, the door appears to release pressure when opened (usually by Brandy storming in). Brandy prefers to make the most out of any situation and she attempts to improve her own standing by mistreating and abusing the kindness of her friends, though she does care for her friends at times. However, she is always on the lookout for escape opportunities and she wants nothing more than to be able to get back home to her family in Florida.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Whiskers_ca9e.html" title="Mr. Whiskers">Mr. Whiskers</a></b> (age 7) (voiced by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Adler_%28voice_actor%29_f91a.html" title="Charles Adler (voice actor)">Charles Adler</a> and later <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_West_%28voice_actor%29_4124.html" title="Billy West (voice actor)">Billy West</a>): Mr. Whiskers is a white rabbit who hasn't had very many friends during his lifetime. On an initial observance of Mr. Whiskers, one would perceive him as silly, sloppy, stinky, gross, batty, insane, hyperactive and overall annoying. After further observance of Mr. Whiskers one would notice that he is highly intelligent with a large vocabulary, which is exhibited at special moments. He is also very loving and caring, but he can be clumsy and clueless at times although he is arrogant and naughty. When he first met Brandy he was on his way to a zoo in Paraguay, though he soon made a mistake that caused the two of them to fall into the Amazon Rainforest. While Brandy often is embarrassed by his antics, Whiskers does his best to help out Brandy and he does cherish his friendship with her, though she doesn't always feel the same way. Mr. Whiskers' other best friend is Ed, a river otter whom he often spends his time with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cheryl and Meryl</b> (voiced by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherri_Shepherd_5f02.html" title="Sherri Shepherd">Sherri Shepherd</a>): Cheryl and Meryl are cute, twin toucan sisters that have a grudge against one another. While they care for one another, they tend to compete and bicker over petty matters, though they do agree with each other in certain rare circumstances. Cheryl and Meryl's fights often lead to catastrophes that divert the paths of the plans concocted by Mr. Whiskers and Brandy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ed</b> (voiced by <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Kenny_8606.html" title="Tom Kenny">Tom Kenny</a>): Ed is a river otter who is quite dull in his personality and his ability to speak, though he is often a tome of knowledge in the Amazon; he knows quite a lot about many different things. He is happy to help out Mr. Whiskers whenever he needs his assistance, and he is one of the few people who can actually tolerate Mr. Whiskers' behavior for prolonged periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Lola Boa</b> (age 20) (voiced by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanna_Ubach_c887.html" title="Alanna Ubach">Alanna Ubach</a>): Lola Boa is often the voice of reason amongst Brandy's friends. While she often has great ideas, sometimes Brandy believes her ideas aren't too bright and Brandy secretly believes Lola is gross because she swallows rodents whole while they're still alive. However, Lola remains one of Brandy's best friends and she's usually there to help her out when the going gets tough, though Brandy's cruel nature is sometimes too harsh for her to even tolerate. A running gag with Lola is the fact that as a snake, she has no outer appendages from her elongated body.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Margo</b> (voiced by <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Hale_eb05.html" title="Jennifer Hale">Jennifer Hale</a>): Margo is a stick bug who is above Brandy in the social chain of the Amazon Rainforest. When Brandy first arrived in the Amazon, Margo helped her out by giving her some inside information on where the popular people hang out, though Margo believes Brandy shouldn't hang out with Mr. Whiskers. Despite the fact that Margo hangs out with Brandy in some instances, she isn't afraid of belittling her in order to improve her own social standing. Sometimes she can be very nice but mostly she is mean.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Gaspar Le Gecko</b> (age 20) (voiced by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Sogliuzzo_0e4c.html" title="Andre Sogliuzzo">Andre Sogliuzzo</a> and later <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_West_%28voice_actor%29_4124.html" title="Billy West (voice actor)">Billy West</a>): Gaspar Le Gecko is the self-appointed dictator/entrepreneur/musical director of the Amazon Rainforest. However, the only reason he is the leader is because no one else bothered to take the position. He has a strong desire to eat Mr. Whiskers and he often tries to make schemes in order to gain an opportunity to do such. Gaspar is one of the few individuals in the rainforest who has the ability to help Brandy get back home to civilization, though after Brandy betrayed him by going back on his deal in the first episode, he hasn't since offered to help her out again. Gaspar is often seen with his monkey henchmen, and often serves as the antagonist of the series. Gaspar also tends to like using others (mostly Brandy and/or Whiskers) to get what he wants. However, Gaspar has shown a softer side of somewhat friendship to Brandy and Whiskers when it suits his best interests. He also displays a more sensitive side that he usually keeps to himself, such as liking ballet and little dolls.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_%26_Mr._Whiskers_caf9.html" title="Edit section: Lesser-Seen Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lesser-Seen Characters</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Wolfie</b>: Appeared in "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Wolfie%7E_Prince_of_The_Jungle_fd95.html" title="Wolfie: Prince of The Jungle">Wolfie: Prince of The Jungle</a>". Wolfie is a dog who was raised by a monkey who was raised by a panther who was raised by a coconut tree. He became Brandy's boyfriend after saving her, but his uncultured lifestyle got to her. Whiskers eventually turned him into a gentleman, but by then he was helpless to do anything as he watched Brandy fall into the water. Realizing he didn't like this, Brandy decided to let Wolfie be himself, which he quickly took to, ending their relationship. Wolfie did appear again in "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandys%27_Best_Boyfriend_Ever_8d28.html" title="Brandys' Best Boyfriend Ever">Brandys' Best Boyfriend Ever</a>" with a new girlfriend quite similar to himself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mr. Cantarious</b>: Appeared in "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27ve_Got_Snail_65f9.html" title="You've Got Snail">You've Got Snail</a>". Voiced by <i><a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Knight_8c96.html" title="Wayne Knight">Wayne Knight</a></i>. A jungle snail who was discovered to be the underside neighbor of Brandy and Whiskers when Whisker's ball rolled into his house and smacked into him. When Cantarious refused to give Whisker's ball back, Brandy and Whiskers did acts of revenge to him, including filling his yard with candy wrappers and having a loud party at night. However, Cantarious got back each time by sliming them with his snail slime, usually somehow orally. (The running gag was Brandy, Whiskers, and anyone else who suffered his wrath running to a river, washing out as they go "Gross, gross, gross!") However, they eventually made peace...but only for a short time when Whiskers offered to lend him salt.</li>
</ul>
<p>On another note, Cantarious's name sounds like "cantankerous" which means a rude, unappealing person with a mean streak, perfectly suiting this snail.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Melvin</b>: Appeared in "<a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_For_Waffles_9fba.html" title="Time For Waffles">Time For Waffles</a>". A marsh deer who was another of Brandy's one-time boyfriends. Brandy got the idea she could only get his attention by whitening her teeth (another of Gaspar's plots). In reality, he did like her but only started talking to her when she did to him (He got creeped out by all the smiling she did). He confessed this when they were being chased by a jaguar and his son who were finding him, Brandy, and Whiskers easily when their teeth were so bright, it could be seen at night. It is unknown why they broke up, but Melvin can be seen again with a new girlfriend in "Brandy's Best Boyfriend Ever,"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Vic</b>: A jungle snake who appeared in "<a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin_of_Eeeeeeeevil%21%21%21_608a.html" title="Skin of Eeeeeeeevil!!!">Skin of Eeeeeeeevil!!!</a>" and "Any Club that Would Have Me as a Member," He often refers to himself as "The Vic" and was the target of Lola Boa's infatuation in "The Skin of Eeevil!". In his second appearance, the Vic was the head of the jock-like Carnivore Club that Whiskers wanted to join. Unlike most of the other predators seen that chased after Brandy and Whiskers, the Vic and his two friends (a panther and a jaguar) were not foiled but rather left hungry, feeling dejected that they were out-smarted by a plant eater</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Isabelle</b>: Isabelle is a giant lizard who appeared in <i>"<a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyranosaurus_Rex_3fe6.html" title="Cyranosaurus Rex">Cyranosaurus Rex</a>"</i>.Whiskers had a crush on her and did all sorts of weird things to impress her like acting <i><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangsta.html" title="Gangsta">gangsta</a></i>. She has a very short temper and lives with her parents. Isabelle doesn't like him back and ate him. Whiskers found a new crush and moved on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dr. Phyllis</b>: A <a href="../../../d/u/g/Dugong.html" title="Dugong">dugong</a> who is a physician that helps people with their problems, especially Brandy and Whisker's problems. She recommends Brandy to be Mr. Whiskers, and Mr. Whiskers to be Brandy, which by the way, ticked off Brandy. After Brandy turns the tables on Whiskers into going back to his normal self, they promised to Dr. Phyllis to never say THE blaming word ever again. Dr. Phyllis' name was based on a parody of Dr. Phil. The parody name was also used for the Character Dr. Phyllis Tupper in the Drake and Josh episode, 'The Dr. Phyllis Show. Dr. Phyllis appeared in <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freaky_Tuesday_70dd.html" title="Freaky Tuesday">Freaky Tuesday</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tito</b>: A monkey who teaches samba lessons and appeared in the episode "<a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain_Delay_d429.html" title="Rain Delay">Rain Delay</a>", and in the episode <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_Harrington_4cef.html" title="Brandy Harrington">Brandy Harrington</a> tries to reach him before Margo in bad weather conditions and finally found out that the lessons were cancled because of the bad weather, but it is found out that Brandy did date Tito once but they Broke-Up as he is seen with a new girlfriend in Brandys Best Ever Boyfriend.</li>

<li>There originally was supposed to be 42 episodes, however, due to terrible ratings, Season 2 ended 3 episodes short.</li>
<li>In Rip Van Whiskers <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_Harrington_4cef.html" title="Brandy Harrington">Brandy Harrington</a> kisses <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Whiskers_ca9e.html" title="Mr. Whiskers">Mr. Whiskers</a>.</li>
<li>The show breaks the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Wall_edd5.html" title="Fourth Wall">Fourth Wall</a> on many occasions, one being in the episode Payback, Lola Boa tells Brandy "This is not a cartoon,it's real life." Then Brandy turns to the screen and says, "I haven't the heart to tell her," Indicating that most of the characters know that they're characters of a sitcom.</li>
<li>A reference is made to Disney Channel in the series, when Brandy's youth gel has Disney Channel written on it.</li>
<li>Brandy's white t-shirt with a red heart and pink pants that appears in varied episodes was worn by <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Possible_5e05.html" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a> as a form of casual wear.</li>
<li>The tapirs seen in the show are not <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Tapir_bbb7.html" title="Brazilian Tapir">Brazilian Tapirs</a> but actually <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayan_Tapir_265c.html" title="Malayan Tapir">Malayan Tapirs</a>, which don't live in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon_Rainforest_eeac.html" title="Amazon Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a>.</li>
<li>The show also resembles <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilligan%27s_Island_f6c0.html" title="Gilligan's Island">Gilligan's Island</a>. For instance, Brandy and Mr.Whiskers land in a jungle, they try to get back home, and in the Christmas special Brandy finally returns home, but she decided to go back, which is similar to the ending of Gilligan's island.</li>
<li><b>Buffy &amp; Mr. Whakadoo</b> is a parody of <b>Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers</b>.</li>
