<p>The band London formed in the summer of 2000 with brothers Jonathon and Nicholas Newby. After assembling the initial lineup, they recorded the first of a series of homemade demos and played three Muncie, Indiana shows in late 2000. In early 2001, London renamed themselves Brazil and began small bouts of weekend touring. Self-releasing their debut eponymous EP early summer 2001, Brazil embarked on a defining 3-week tour that took them to the East Coast and the South and tested the band's physical and mental limits with a self-imposed itinerary that had them traveling for days at a time in a run down minivan. More frequent small tours followed as the members finished their schooling. During this time, the band wrote and performed CONQUER, a three part collaboration with members of the Ball State University Symphony Orchestra. In 2002, Brazil signed a small contract with California label Fearless Records, who released the band’s sophomore EP, Dasein. The band toured on the EP for approximately five months before returning home to write <a href="../../../a/_/h/A_Hostage_and_the_Meaning_of_Life_db4e.html" title="A Hostage and the Meaning of Life">A Hostage and the Meaning of Life</a>, their debut full length album of 2004, also released by Fearless Records. Hostage was released in September of that year and the band embarked on a tour lasting nearly fourteen months, completing approximately 4 circuits of the United States and four entries into Canada. Upon returning home, the band found themselves without funding for their next record but were able to quickly secure a deal with California label Immortal Records, who released the band’s sophomore album <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Philosophy_of_Velocity_505c.html" title="The Philosophy of Velocity">The Philosophy of Velocity</a>. The band began touring promotion in August of 2006 and continues to perform in support of the record.</p>

<p>Founding member and guitarist. Smith is known for his non-technical and intuitive approach to playing guitar, often eschewing theory and technique for expression and energy. He was the band’s original bass player. Smith also sang in political punk band American Youth, and played guitar in art noise band Pharmacy Liquor. He recorded guitar on all Brazil releases through 2006.</p>

<p>Guitarist. Johnson joined just before the recording of the Dasein EP, making Brazil a 2-guitar band for the first time. He’s known for his very precise and consistent style which, when juxtaposed against Smith’s expressionistic approach, creates much of the unique tension that comprises Brazil’s sound. Johnson has also recorded with renowned Chicago engineer Steve Albini, and currently plays in saababanks, a band often compared to noisy and rhythm-heavy bands such as Shellac, June of 44, and The Jesus Lizard. He recorded guitar on Dasein, The Lost EP, the Wrapped Around Your Finger cover, A Hostage and the Meaning of Life, and The Philosophy of Velocity.</p>

<p>Brazil has recorded a handful of one-off tracks and demos. In 2005, Brazil recorded a cover of The Police’s Wrapped Around Your Finger for the Fearless Record’s Punk Goes 80s Compilation. Additionally, the band recently recorded an original track called Cities Made of Snow for Immortal Records Santa Cause Benefit Compilation, released for the 2006 holiday season. Several demoed songs also exist that did not make it onto the albums. One track was left over after the Hostage sessions, and six tracks were left over after the Philosophy sessions. The band is currently recording acoustic versions of some album tracks for future release, as well as demos for new material.</p>

<p>Brazil have often been compared to the now defunct band <a href="../../../a/t/_/At_the_Drive-In_6006.html" title="At the Drive-In">At the Drive-In</a>, a comparison the band goes to great lengths to distance themselves from. A few factors play a part in the oft-cited comparison of the two bands. Namely, both bands released their formative records on Southern California record label <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fearless_Records_2a8e.html" title="Fearless Records">Fearless Records</a>, both bands recorded early records with Los Angeles producer Alex Newport, and both band’s vocalists have similar ranges. Ironically, only one member of Brazil has admitted to being a fan of the late <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso%2C_Texas_243a.html" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso, Texas</a> based 5-piece<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, though the other members appreciate their reputation and contribution to music in the early ‘00s. The band has often bemoaned the idea of being grouped solely with bands from the punk genre, a scenario often repeated on tours and with record labels, preferring instead to be regarded as simply a modern rock band.</p>

<p>The Ministry is a loose community of fans who follow Brazil closely and help disseminate information regarding the band and their activities. Most are long-time acquaintances of the band in various parts of the world with whom the band keeps in close contact via telephone, although membership is not exclusive. The Ministry also participates in secretive endeavors, such as the revealing of hidden websites involving the band’s work, and the organization of ‘Pataphysical Odd Occurrences, or P.O.O. - grassroots reading circles devoted to the literary work of Jonathon Newby.</p>
