<p>The names section, by saying that Pressburg and Pozsony "remained in common use until WWI", seems to imply that Bratislava was also a name at that time. But as far as I am aware, this was not particularly the case. The city was not a Slovak city, in any event, but even so, my understanding was that the name Bratislava was essentially invented (based on some very old stuff) in 1919. This should be made clearer. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 17:16, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I was just looking up some info on that "Express Tram," and apparently the city was spelled Preßburg... That adds a new twist. Did this remain until the German spelling reforms, or did this change earlier? <a href="http://www.sabor.co.at/vef/Tramway/chronik.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sabor.co.at/vef/Tramway/chronik.htm" rel="nofollow">See 1914 on this site</a> -<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">newkai</a> | <a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewkai_0287.html" title="User talk:Newkai">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Newkai_916c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Newkai">contribs</a> 17:27, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(1) Frankly, I do not understand where your problem lies...What the article says is basically correct and Bratislava was the official name since 1919. (2) Bratislava was only, predomninantly, or at least <b>also</b> a Slovak city since the 9th century at least...Depends on what you understand by <i>Slovak city</i>, of course...</p>
<p>Addition: OK, now that I have read it once more, I've got your problem. I hope it's OK now...<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 19:44, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A few months later...Given that this seems to be an instance of a name change, rather than a mere matter of differing translations of the same name, I've put Pozsony and Pressburg at the beginning of the article as old names. In terms of whether it was a Slovak city before 1919 - well, our <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bratislava_ad33.html" title="History of Bratislava">History of Bratislava</a> says that in 1918 70% of the population was German or Magyar (I would assume this figure also includes Jews). That would mean, presumably, that another 30% was Slovak. So, I suppose, it was as much a Slovak city as it was anything. But it was just as much a Hungarian city, and a German city. Essentially, it was a city in Hungary (the second city of Hungary, in fact) with a mixed population of Magyars, Germans, and Slovaks...The basic fact is, though, that the article (and even more so <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bratislava_ad33.html" title="History of Bratislava">History of Bratislava</a>) needs to be cleaned up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 3 July 2005 06:41 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe it is a surprise to you that there are other years and centuries in human history than 1918 and the 19th century...<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 3 July 2005 17:25 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> -- thanks so much for initiating this change. Being Slovak and having both Magyars and Jews in my ancestry this was one my pet peeves in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava.html" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> article. I think other cities with rich multiethnic history deal with this issue very similarly - see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Gdańsk</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilsen.html" title="Pilsen">Plzeň</a> or <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budweis.html" title="Budweis">České Budějovice</a>. <a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbetak_984b.html" title="User:Jbetak">Jbetak</a> 3 July 2005 17:45 (UTC)</p>
<p>Juro - before the 19th century there is no accurate demographic information. I would also assume that the Slavic population of the place increased in the 19th century due to industrialization. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 3 July 2005 17:49 (UTC)</p>
<p>If <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava.html" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> is comparable to <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilsen.html" title="Pilsen">Pilsen</a> or <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budweis.html" title="Budweis">Budweis</a> in this regard then <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> could be right. There was a dramatic increase of the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech.html" title="Czech">Czech</a> population in both cities towards the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. <a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbetak_984b.html" title="User:Jbetak">Jbetak</a> 3 July 2005 17:57 (UTC)</p>
<p>(1) A general remark at Jbetak first: try to avoid discussions about topics you have no idea of. Bratislava is a name change, i.e. it has nothing to do with Danzig, Pilsen etc. (2) There are lists of inhabitants, archaelogical findings, reports of travellers and for example names of city parts and villages for older centuries enabling approximate percentages of nationalities. The situation in Czechia is totally different, because the situation in the Kingdom of Hungay was totally different compared to that in Austria. To put it shortly: Bratislava was a purely Slovak town until the 12th century. Some Magyars occured in the 12th century by founding a village. There were also foreign traders as visitors in the town, especially Italians and Austrians/Germans. The real "germanization" started in the 13th century when German "colonists" were invited to settle in the Kingdom of Hungary. Since then the percentage of Germans has been increasing gradually up to the high levels in the 18th century. In the 15th century, the patricians were all German, the subordinates all Slovaks, besides there were some Czechs, Moravians, Italians and a negligible number of Magyars. The majority of the Magyars came (like to most parts of Slovakia) only in the 16th century, fleeing from the Turks in present-day Hungary and given that Bratislava was the capital of Royal Hungary. Besides them, there were however many Slovak, Croat and Austrian immigrants. Throughout the early 19th century there were 65% Germans, 27% Slovaks in the town, and the rest were Hungarians and Jews. It was only after 1880 that the number of Hungarians suddenly increased by a process known as <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magyarization.html" title="Magyarization">Magyarization</a> (officially promoted by the government). In sum, to use Kenney's terminology, the town was originally a Slovak town for centuries, then a German-Slovak town for centuries (with a majority of Germans in the end), a Slovak-Magyar-German town around 1900 and a Slovak town since.</p>

<dd>Please don't take it the wrong way, but politeness and good manners go a long way. I appreciate you elaborating on the topic and don't see any reason why I shouldn't participate in this discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I believe you have misunderstood my comments about <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilsen.html" title="Pilsen">Pilsen</a> etc. What they all have in common is a history of multiethnic (or at least periods of different ethnic) development. Although the time-lines and other technicalities will obviously vary from case to case, they all face a similar challenge of how to come to terms with their past.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What caught my interest in your comments was the claim that <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava.html" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> has been Slovak since 1900. Perhaps you meant March 27, 1919? And even if you did, I don't believe that the city had a Slovak population majority until sometime in the 1930s. Furthermore the 27% figure you gave on for the Slovak population minority in "the early 19th century" is likely incorrect, since I have found a source quoting 15% Slovaks in 1880.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most disturbingly, what you and the Wikipedia article fail to mention is that Slovaks, Germans, Hungars, Jews, Czechs and Croats all lived in Bratislava in exemplary tolerance during the interwar period.</dd>

<dd>If you are unable to follow this, please do not waste the time of other users. (1) I repeat: your (or John's) assumption about immigration of Slovaks from somewhere in analogy to Czechia is wrong, the percentage of Slovaks decreased (this means it was 27% and then it was lower) over the 19th century. I do not understand why you are unable to understand such a simple statement. (2) I said "around" 1900 (of course I meant 1919) and formulated the whole sentence deliberately in a very loose way, because any statement of the type "German"/"Slovak" etc. city is basically also imprecise and actually ridiculous. (3) I do not see where we have been discussing issues of tolerance in this discussion. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 4 July 2005 11:05 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe most people would agree that I have just done that i my comment above. This is indeed a simple matter. I still object to your tone and the coarse reply. If you prefer German or Slovak (I know that they are lot better than your English) why don't you use it?</dd>

<dd>To clarify: I think we are beyond territorial claims. What is less simple and takes more time to resolve, are the chauvinistic interests of several nations and ensuing historical cultural and other claims to places like e.g. Bratislava, Budweis, Danzig etc. I don't care if it was German and Czechs, Hungarians and Slovaks or Poles and Germans. It's always the same - too many opposing interests and interpretations of events. This is also directly related to the names people choose to use for these places.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I happen to believe you are prone to the Slovak POV. Let me explain: you declare Bratislava Slovak (loosely) as of 1900. I looked it up again and the city had a <b>Czechoslovak</b> population majority in 1930s. It didn't have a Slovak population majority until after the war. I presume you chose to call it Slovak since it was part of Czechoslovakia. If that's the case then the town was Hungarian since roughly the 10th century since it was part of the Hungarian territory. The Slovak population majority then shouldn't matter since it didn't matter to you in the 20th century. In the past 2000 years it was probably less Slovak then anything else - with the exception of the last 50 years of course.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the first republic (<a href="../../../c/s/r/CSR_9dbe.html" title="CSR">CSR</a>) recognized the special status of Bratislava. Hence my hint at the exceptional ethnic tolerance in the interwar Bratislava. The war changed all that of course. Another thing to keep in mind when interpreting the census data is the fact that many people would chose to Germanize, Magyarize or Slavicize depending on the current chauvinistic pressures de jour. I personally know Germans and Hungarians who would chose to say there we Slovak at one time or another.</dd>

Juro - thanks for the demographic details, such as they are - that's very interesting. I would ask, though - how big was the place before the German settlement began in the 13th century? Was it a real town, or just a small settlement? The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bratislava_ad33.html" title="History of Bratislava">History of Bratislava</a> article seems to suggest that it was only in the early 13th century that it became a major settlement. At any rate, it's obviously a complicated situation. May I suggest, though, that for discussions before 1919 in both this article and in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bratislava_ad33.html" title="History of Bratislava">History of Bratislava</a>, we use the name Pressburg to refer to the city? This would make sense in that this is the name commonly used in English, and is not only the German name of a city politically dominated by, and for a while at least, largely inhabited by Germans; but also a close variant of the Slovak name at that time. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 5 July 2005 02:00 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, today the town is known in English as Bratislava even in historic texts, but I am trying to use Pressburg for periods before 1919, although the name was not Pressburg even in German before the 15/16th century, but some other forms were used. Secondly, you should know that historically there are towns de-facto and de-iure. Bratislava was a de-facto town already in Celtic times (i.e, BC) and then again appr. from the 9th century onwards, de-iure from the 13th century onwards (first preserved town charter 1291, earlier charters unknown). <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 5 July 2005 15:12 (UTC)</p>

<p>Juro - I have read a lot of historic texts, and I can't remember too many that refer to the Hungarian Diet meeting in Bratislava (there are a few, I will admit). The city is still normally called Pressburg in historical contexts. I have also seen books that call it Pozsony in the 19th century - I would suggest that this usage is <i>at least</i> as common as use of Bratislava before 1919. As far as <i>de facto</i> towns, I wasn't denying that there was a settlement there prior to the 13th century. I was suggesting that it was a very small settlement, and not of any particular significance. Nothing to do with whether it was a <i>de jure</i> town, although given the size of medieval <i>de jure</i> towns, I'd suggest that anything which was not a <i>de jure</i> town was probably pretty damned small. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 8 July 2005 20:15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for that comical relief! Is that why you are so popular amongst other editors? My suggestion is to keep this in line with other language versions -- they list the local geographic name and put all foreign name alternatives into parenthesis: XXX (German: ZZZ, Polish: YYYY, Latin: WWW). There is no need for adjectives, etymology or POV. Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_cities_with_alternative_names_c059.html" title="List of European cities with alternative names">list of current geographic name alternatives</a>, I'd suggest to adhere to that. Continued use of historical geographic names is not tied or limited to these words becoming English "loan words" (e.g. Prague), that's an argument you were making. <a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJbetak_984b.html" title="User:Jbetak">Jbetak</a> 8 July 2005 20:42 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The official name of Bratislava in 1911 was Pozsony. See: official maps of Austria-Hungary for examples. Nice try, though. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 8 July 2005 20:16 (UTC)</p>
<p>Pressburg is just the English name of Bratislava before 1919, especially given the fact that the official language in the KoH was Hungarian and earlier Latin, not German, and there was a law since around 1895 that all names must be in Hungarian. Also, you can find the form "(hist.) Pressburg" explicitely for example in the Big Muret-Sanders German-English dictionary and if you read any old English texts. If it was not the English name, the entry would be "Pozsony" or even "Pressporok". It is irrelevant that the name is of German origin (you probably think that you have made a "huge" discovery, Nopuzzle...), it is still the English name (because not all, and even most, English geographical names are not of English origin, of course). Also, it is quite frequent that geographical names are taken from other languages than the official language, like in this case. But this all is so obvious that I really do not understand (again, dear, VeryPuzzlestranger) why I have to explain such elementary things here.<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 19:45, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of how "official" the name was, Pressburg was a locally-used name, since there was at least a significant minority of German speakers there. So, English usage just chose one of the local names - and Pressburg was probably easiest to pronounce for English speakers. Again, this doesn't make it an "English name". Do you think "Helsinki" is an "English name" because that's what English speakers use? Of course not. This is all so obvious that I really do not understand why I have to explain such elementary things here. And on another matter, can anyone provide <i>credible</i> documentation for the supposed English variant "Pressborough"? If not, I will continue to remove it. <a href="../../../n/o/p/User%7ENoPuzzleStranger_093e.html" title="User:NoPuzzleStranger">NoPuzzleStranger</a> 20:41, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I see that I am talking to small children here and this is below any level now are you 5-years old or what. It is irrelevant from what the name arose. English name, more precisely we are talking about "in English", always means "name used in the English language". There cannot be a genuine name containing English syllabes for every town in the world. Pressburg was the only name used in the English language, hence it is the English name. Using your "argument" we could say that Cologne, Venice etc. are no English names, because they are French - but they obviously are (also) English names, without any "buts" and "howevers". And as for Pressborough, that is just an old form I have found in one of sevral books some 2 years ago (why should anyone invent something like that??), you will hardly find it on the internet just as most of the other older names (do you have a documentation for the other names??). But since we are (again) in the situation that Nopuzzlestranger decides what will be in the wikipedia, because HE does not understand something and HE does not know or HE cannot find something, and nobody stops him, I am taking no responsibility for this article from now on. I have (fortunately) other things to do. And since I know from past experience that in such discussions NoPuzzleStr always starts to lie and propose infantile arguments just to show that he is right I will just stop discussing here.<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuro_42ae.html" title="User:Juro">Juro</a> 16:05, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has nothing to do with "English syllables". An English name is one that is (a) used in English and (b) is not just any of the locally used names. Thus Cologne, Venice, and Prague are English names, since French is not a local language in any of those places. But Helsinki is not an English name, and Pressburg was not an English name, because those are/were just one of the local names. As to Pressborough, your book may have just based this on a single English source; I doubt it was ever widespread enough to be noteworthy: the full-text archive of the <i>Times</i> of London since 1785 doesn't find a single occurrence of it, using consistently "Pressburg", and in earlier times the spellings even of ordinary words weren't fixed anyway, and it is normal that <i>anything</i> with -burg might be written -burgh or -borough by someone sometimes. <a href="../../../n/o/p/User%7ENoPuzzleStranger_093e.html" title="User:NoPuzzleStranger">NoPuzzleStranger</a> 21:44, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am very sceptical about the claim in the first paragraph that Bratislava is the most densely populated city in Central Europe. If you include the most common use of Central Europe then it would be Germany, Austria, and the former communist countries between those countries and the former Soviet Union. I can think of several cities in the region that would seem to have higher populations densities and the claim has no reference of source.</p>

unless somebody has some proof that Bratislava really is the densest city in Central Europe I would suggest leaving the sentence with that claim out of the article.</p>

<p>I hope you will approve of my corrections to the English. I have plenty of experience in helping Slovaks write articles in elegant English. I am not quite sure what you meant in the second paragraph by "except Slovaks of course". It is still not quite right the way it still stands. Did you mean: "and, of course, Slovaks"? I have put "borough" for "city parts". "City parts " sounds strange in English. It's a direct translation of German "Stadtteil" and we already have the term "district". Hikitsurisan</p>

<p>Secondly, I have looked up articles about other capital cities and what I miss here is the mention of some important events held in Bratislava. Political events, such as Bush-Putin summit should be mentioned, as well as sporting events - as far as I know, Ice Hockey World Championship in 1992 was held in Bratislava/with Prague/, European Figure Skating Championship /2001/, Davis Cup Finals as well as Water Slalom World Cups /in Cunovo - 1999,2003?/ etc. I currently don;t have much time, please do some research and add some info in the article.</p>

<p>Hey, can anyone explain me how could the town be one of the most important places in Hungary and "suddenly" (within XXX years) become the capital city of Slovakia? Can anyone make clear the double identity of Bratislava through history? When was Bratislava more hungarian and when more Slovak?(in the article about Bratislava's history there's not much information) I guess Hungarians and Slovaks are very different (first of all because of the language: a slavic one and let's say un unrelated one) so i guess there can't be a soft transition between cultures (something that could occur maybe between slovaks and czechs or spaniards and portugueses), and that's why it's so hard for me to understand this "history sharing".
