<p>I have made some more changes, enough that (if they stick) I believe that the article will not substantially misinform anyone. I still would like to review Lifton's book, sharpen up my memory on the conclusions he and Schein reached, and then see what can be done to improve the article. I suspect that much of the problem with the original article can be written off to vague definitions of brainwashing that allowed many <b>relatively</b> benign manipulations to be called brainwashing, that were followed by denials by others that amounted to saying that the relatively benign manipulatios did not meet the strict definition of "brainwashing". I may not remember the Schein and Lifton materials well enough to be sure that the article has produced a full description of the hard-ball version of the technique as used by the CCP.</p>
<p>I suppose that one ancillary problem is: does it make a difference whether one is arrested and thrown into a "commune" where brainwashing is practiced, or one enters voluntarily and with full disclosure of the likely consequences and the methodologies to be used. If somebody says that s/he will remake my mind according to his/her prescriptions by the use of classical brainwashing techniques, then if I voluntarily submit to this person because he/she has a doctor of divinity from Cambridge Theological Institution (of Cambridge, MA) &#160;;-) , have I removed from that person the responsibility to behave ethically according to some external standard? Or can s/he henceforth do with me as she or he desires?</p>
<p>Another ancillary ethical question would be whether it is o.k. to use brainwashing techniques to try to rehabilitate prisoners who have been convicted of felonies. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 17:38, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>One of the most prominent advocates of this theory was the controversial <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Singer_e382.html" title="Margaret Singer">Margaret Singer</a> who was discredited, when her psychological theory of 'mind control' was declared "not scientific" by the American Psychological Association <a href="http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/Singer/Evaluation/index2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/Singer/Evaluation/index2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</i></p>
<p>I've removed this claim. The reference not only comes from the Scientology-operated 'new' <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_Awareness_Network_385b.html" title="Cult Awareness Network">Cult Awareness Network</a> -- hardly an unbiased party on the subject -- but a quick search of the reference shows that it never even mentions the American Psychological Association or the words "not scientific". The only parts of the claim it supports is that in CAN's opinion Dr. Singer was controversial and was discredited. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:49, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have reverted Feldspar's removal. The brainwashing controversy is very well documented. I have added a link with a collection of documents available at <a href="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA_Documents.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA_Documents.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA_Documents.htm</a>.

<dd>This is a much better citation, but the fact that changes are still needed is evidenced by the fact that if you go to the only one of those documents which contains the quoted phrase "not scientific", you'll find that although it <i>claims</i> that to be a quote from the <i>Molko</i> brief, it isn't. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:03, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I support the recent reversion made by Antaeus Feldspar. If some business, e.g., a tobacco company, claims that their product does not contain chemical agent X, it is not POV to point out that a chemical analysis would be a way to decide whether their claims are true or the government's claims are true. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 18:53, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Patrick, there is a long list of scholarly articles and books that challenge the brainwashing theories advanced by anti-cultists. The list above is just a series of documents pertaining to Singer. There is a long list of citacions from other books and articles that discredit brainwashing in the context of NRMs and "cults". See below. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 20:38, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is you want a double standard; when there's evidence of wrongdoing, you want each cult to be judged separately; when there's a statement that <i>certain research</i> was found to have been lacking in scientific rigor, you want that to be converted into a blanket statement that the entire notion was found pseudoscientific and that <i>all</i> cults have thus been absolved of the charge.

<dd>Can be left there if you do some research and provide citacions in which these "objective determinations" have been conducted in a scientific manner.

<p>[P0M]: Zappaz, why do you put "objective determinations" into scare quotes? Please avoid rhetorical tricks. Is it is your understanding that objective determinations cannot be made, then say so and explain how you can justify such an extraordinary claim.</p>
<p>[P0M]: I don't follow your reasoning. A statement was made to the effect that when contending <b>claims</b> have been made about some matter, then the claims are just that pending serious research. If you want to say that the scientific research has already been done, well and good, but that doesn't alter the validity of the other sentence. The expectation, if one is going to use research to settle contending (possibily ideologically motivated) claims is that the research should be done. Your reasoning is oddly spiral, i.e., sort of circular. You will not permit an assertion that scientific research is essential to true knowledge until such time as the scientific research is actuall--y done.</p>
<p>[P0M]: To assert that first there must be "research and ... citations [to cases] in which these objective determinations have been conducted in a scientific manner (in what other manner might an objective determination be made in such a case?), and only later can one state that scientific research to settle the question ought to be helpful, has everything going in the wrong direction. That sounds to me like a tobacco company saying, "First prove scientifically that spoking tobacco products is bad for the consumer's health, and only then can you ask the government or some other competent authority to conduct scientific proof." A tobacco company might say that, but I would have to question their motivation for doing so. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 07:54, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally fail to follow your reasoning. The paragraph represented a covert argument that is allegedly used by some religious groups, and, in doing so, it left the encyclopedia giving tacit agreement to (the mere assertion of) their innocence on the more serious charges.

<dd>Do you mean that the first part of the paragraph was wrong and the last sentence was wrong, so the whole thing was wrong? Something may be uncited but true. Then the question should be whether the uncited claim looks interesting enough to get somebody to supply the missing citations. Disapproving of your reasons for chopping things out does not mean that I necessarily approve of what is there. See my somewhat earlier remarks below. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 22:23, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[P0M:] It took me a while, working with the history pages, to see what Zappaz actually did. He removed the whole paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should be noted that some religious groups, especially those of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> origin, openly state that they seek to improve the natural human mind by spiritual exercises. Intense spiritual exercises have an effect on the mind, for example by leading to an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altered_state_of_consciousness.html" title="Altered state of consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a>. These groups do not, however, proclaim that they use coercive techniques to acquire or retain converts. Whether they do so or not is a matter for objective determination in individual cases.</dd>
</dl>
<p>[P0M:] He evidently did so in order to eliminate the final sentence. His argument for removing the paragraph appears to be that he didn't write it and Feldspar didn't write it. That reasoning, in my opinion, is flawed. The content of the paragraph is relevant. People have been accused of doing certain things. They admit to doing some of those things or to doing them in a less intense way. To do so is actually a strong stance to take in a debate: Stipulate to what is true and/or does not hurt your own case, because it is pointless to defend something that doesn't actually need defending. If so-and-so is accused of being a Marxist, a Green, and a spy, there is no reason for him to try to deny the allegation that he is a Marxist or the allegation that he is a Green -- especially if he is indeed a Marxist and a Green. The good debater will say that , yes, it is true what the opposition says on one or two points. They've noticed that I'm a citizen of Tanzania, and that's true. But so what? None of those things make me a spy.</p>
<p>[P0M:] What the groups in question <b>may</b> be trying to do is to admit to lesser "sins" (knowing that they are "legal") in order to create the impression that they are innocent of the more serious charges, i.e., create the impression that they would admit to the more serious charges if they were true.</p>
<p>[P0M:] Probably the whole question of religious groups that are viewed as non-cults and religious groups that are viewed as cults and that also tell people how to lead their lives should be put in a separate article. The important thing in this article is to make clear what brainwashing actually is, not what it is not, and not the details of less manipulative forms of influence and persuasion. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 22:11, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zappaz, I propose re-inserting the paragraph that I wrote. For example, the Hare Krishna and my former group (Sathya Sai Baba) openly state that they want to purify the human mind by sadhana. It is not only my experience but I read it too. It is a fact that does not need attribution. I think it was dr. Reender Kranenborg who wrote it but I do not understand why I need to provide references for such well known facts. It is relevant because it may help to understand phenomena that some anti-cult activists call snapping <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/06/17/235116.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/06/17/235116.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.cultinformation.org.uk/article1_printable.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinformation.org.uk/article1_printable.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:38, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we are going to discuss what brainwashing is not -- with the aim of distinguishing it from things that resemble it fairly clearly, and so not involving us in pointing out that brainwashing is not the teaching and learning of multiplication tables, nasty though that practice is -- then I think the paragraph would be very useful. Being able to cite book and page would be very helpful in avoiding battles conducted in the midst of fog and smoke. What Kranenborg (or whoever it really was) wrote may seem like general knowledge to you, but even though I've been interested in brainwashing for nearly 50 years I know nothing about what you describe. So if it came down to a question of whether to credit the passage or not, then I would definitely want citations, and so would most non-experts. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 23:10, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The James materials will be valuable. There is a great deal in Lifton's work about the differences in the ways people react to Chinese intense brainwashing. It's the "wishy-washy" ones who escaped. They "wishyed" over to the pro-PPC position and then "washeyed" back to the consentual reality of the West as soon as they got out from under information control. The "true believer" type, however, tends to switch from being an adamant "no arguments" Catholic (or whatever) to an adamant PPC believer. It's like a cube. You push it and push it and suddenly what was the bottom becomes a side, and there is no easy way to get it back into its original orientation. You have to push it just as hard to get it to go back as you did to get it to turn in the first place. The other type is more like pushing a bean bag. You push it on one side and the top part of it will move over but the bottom part stays about where it was to begin with, and when you let go it squishes back to about where it was when you started.

If you refer to James-Lange work on the theory of emotions, that may be OK, but I warn you that these theories have been challenged by contemporary social scientist and physiologists (Philip Bard and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Cannon_c660.html" title="Walter Cannon">Walter Cannon</a> for example).

If there is only one interpretation available and if in addition this interpretation is also accepted by other co-believers and if even a suspicion of doubt is explained as a shortage of faith or betrayal to the cause, then, it will be clear, that investigation of reality is not easy.

<dd>I think that Andries has a good point. There is a large range of phenomena that get called "brainwashing." (Which presidential candidate admitted to being "brainwashed" after he repeated some CCP conclusions?) Even within the confines of Chinese practice, the brainwashing that was practiced in Korea was different from the more intense brainwashing applied within their national borders. Brainwashing developed out of Russian show trial "preparation" of prisoners, which in turn owed much to techniques used by the Catholic Church during the Inquisitions. Much of what I saw in my own Presbyterian Sunday School background used elements of coercive persuasion, and in between are the televangelists. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 20:22, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

After all, hope you agree that this is a "loaded" term: By utilizing the term "brainwashing" anti-cultists in the 70s and 80's attempted to ride the wave of the obviously negative connotations of the term, and use that as a weapon of misinformation and propaganda against the new religious movements they opposed. When scientist rejected the theories of brainwashing within the context of "cults" and NRMs, they simply changed the term to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 22:14, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, I think you overlooked the fact that many ex-members sincerely do not understand their own experiences and look for answers and they sometimes end up with simplistic theories such as mind control but to say that they were devised cynically to have strategy against cults, well, that may be unconcsiously part of the reason. I am happy to see that you are somewhat cynical and suspicious of the motives of people if you can apply this attitude to all players in the debate, not just to anti-cult movement but also to leaders of NRMs. The disappointment and the anger of so many once ardent followers, such me of so many NRMs indicates that there is sufficient reason to do so. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:29, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, this is a general problem that I have with your edits in Wikipedia. You seem to welcome NRMs as an enrichment of cultural and religious diverdity but seems to forget or ignore the fact (and this is just a fact) that the lives of people have been ruined by NRMs. You only focus on the persecution and unjustified stigmatization they receive and to depict the people who criticize them as untrustwothy and hate mongers . In some cases there is believe me a good reason for this stigmatization of certain NRMs. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:58, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emerging religions are indeed a societal phenomenon and part of the cultural diversity and development of societies. Your generalization <i>"the lives of people have been ruined by NRMs"</i> can coexist with the opposing statement that <i>"the lives of people have been enriched by NRMs"</i>. My position, supported by years of study and corroborated by many scholars, is that the number of people who's life was "ruined" to use your term, is a tiny minority and that most people are either indifferent or enriched by their experience in NRMs. I agree with you that some NRMs are very destructive, but please note that the anti-cult movement and their proponents have a very distorted view of reality either due to their apostasy, their religious background (mostly evangelical christians), or their ideology and that they tend to crtitique any and all groups that are outside of mainstream religions. Most scholars that study NRMs concur with this. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 20:22, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indifferent because they were never deeply or long involved. Why do you always conveniently forget to mention that? Many people who wake up after long feel they have been harmed. Many people for whom it is just too difficult or too painful to see the evidence do not wake up for obvious reasons. At a certain moment when they are not so devoted then they may look at the evidence and then this may not be traumatic. But you have to understand that there are people, like me, on which the evidence was forced due to circumstances when they were superdevoted and supercommitted. Zappaz, I was fully aware that some people in the anti-cult movements made flimsy, crazy criticisms on NRMs even when I was a follower but that does not mean that ex-members/apostates cannot tell the truth. Why do you think so many post on ex-Jehovah forums. Don't you think that ex-followers feel cheated and angry, at least for some time? What apostates do is consumer protection for spiritual seekers. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:19, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can understand how you feel, according to your situation. Just note that <b>anyone <i>devoting many years sincerily to</i></b> <i>anything</i> and deciding later on that it was a mistake or that felt no longer willing, will have serious issues to deal with. Just ask anyone that went through a painful divorce! That does not mean that marriage is wrong. Just that some marriages do not work.</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, thanks for the best wishes and you too. But there is huge difference with marriage i.e. the relationship resembles a one to many relationship unlike marriage so that makes it meaningful to warn people not to make the same mistake. And there is another difference my former guru requested all devotion and love directed to him, and every act dedicated to him. Spouses do not go that far. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:55, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Zappaz, just a reminder that my former guru was India's most popular godman who lost many followers after 2000, so that indicates that the experience of harm by a cult is not a small minority, though I have to admit that the intensity of my experience is exceptional. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 11:26, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop deleting facts. <i>"The coercive persuasion theory ... is not a meaningful scientific concept"</i> is in the amicus curiae brief from APA. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 22:58, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. So is the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>It might be possible, for example, to define a certain subgroup of persons possessing common traits who are particularly likely to respond favorably. Were experts able to show statistically that members of this subgroup will typically respond to the Church's conversion practices by joining the Church, then it might--under some circumstances--be possible to express a scientific opinion that this complex of stimuli was coercive for this subgroup.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There you have it -- the APA, the authority that <i>you</i> are referencing for your statement that <i>"The coercive persuasion theory ... is not a meaningful scientific concept"</i>, is stating how the coercive persuasion theory <i>could</i> in fact be correct and if so <i>could</i> be scientifically proven with the right investigation. It is therefore a fact -- a fact <i>you keep deleting</i> -- that the APA's judgement of "not a meaningful scientific concept" clearly does not mean 'inherently unscientific' or 'scientifically disproven', as the quote removed from its context in the brief might suggest and as Introvigne's misquote of "not scientific" would also tend to imply.</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, anyone looking at the edits can see that <b>you</b> are the one removing facts. Did I remove one quote? Yes, I did. I removed one of the <b>four</b> quotes that you would put in your favored version on the theme of "Singer's research blows goats". As has already been discussed, it is a quote that easily leads to an incorrect interpretation of the APA's position when it is taken out of context. You seem to forget that I <i>added</i> two quotes from the APA brief to the article in the first place [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brainwashing&amp;diff=8882885&amp;oldid=8876781" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brainwashing&amp;diff=8882885&amp;oldid=8876781" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] -- <b>including</b> the one that you are now whining about my taking out. Would you please explain why I am "deleting facts" by removing redundant quotes (quotes that you yourself made redundant) and why you are not when you are repeatedly removing the information that the APA <i>did not</i> mean coercive persuasion could not be scientific? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:27, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The best way to do things might be to look at: what the most intensive (goal=Manchurian candidate&#160;;-) practices are, what the next level of practices (keep our society XYZist) are, what can be contrived for mid-term projects (keep those POWs under control with the use of fewer men who could otherwise be on the battleground),..., very short-term objectives (force this man to divulge where the VVMD) was buried, etc. One of the interesting things about ordinary police departmeent extraction of confessions is that the police can lie but if the prisoner lies he commits a crime. And prisoners can be threatened with "having the book thrown at them," and blandished with offers of gentler treatment if they will only incriminate someone else. But, having just said that, it appears to me that there may need to be an envelope article that contains brainwashing as a subset. One of the main characteristics of brainwashing has been that it is used to attain ideological ideals (a more successful workers' paradise, for instance), whereas persuasion can be used in nearly all human negotiations. It also interests me that the threat of force is even involved in many superficially reasonable interchanges. (Ever wonder why the Presidents of the U.S. have almost always been tall guys? Shorter people like Harry Truman usually get in by accidennt.) <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 17:48, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Zappaz, I would ask that you stop making decisions without consulting everyone else on archiving the talk page.

<dd>I made the decision based on the fact that the page was 35K. I do not see any reason for asking "permission" when the text is available via a link to the archive.

<dd>Archiving <i>old, closed</i> discussions is common practice. Asking, when they are less than a week old, whether others besides yourself who consider them <i>closed</i>, is common courtesy. "The text is available via a link to the archive" is a cheat; the talk page is where discussion takes place, and moving a discussion from the talk page to the archive is a declaration of "we are not discussing this anymore." If you consult with no one before making that unilateral declaration, it should be obvious what the problem is. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:00, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason for the 36K limit is that some old browsers will choke on articles that are longer than that. Let's let the talk page grow.

<p>Does WIKIPEDIA WORK? Apparently NOT. My first time consulting it... what do I see? A section on Brainwashing which is not only wrong but fraudulent. Sucker that I am, I buy the propaganda - that the consumer of the information can correct the file. Using my own time and resources, I insert historical accuracy, balance and fresh information. The result? Within minutes some lurking buffoon has replaced the original crap word-for-word. Some self absorbed Hackademic? Some political activist? I could care less, but my suspicions are that it is one of the self promoters whose work is linked to the page. Caveat emptor. What irony... some cadre is babysitting his Brainwashing page. My students will not be consulting this "stuff". We don't phuck with other people's minds in Canada. -- <i>This unsigned comment by 24.87.253.152.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>You speak of having students; if you do, I hope you've taught them to think critically about what they read and what they're told, and to not blindly accept something as the truth just because someone tells them it's true. Yet exactly what you're doing here, it seems, is to fulminate and rage and conclude "Wikipedia doesn't work!" from the fact that you came in and made major changes which we did not blindly accept as the truth despite you providing no references, no reason why of the two versions, yours is the more accurate and balanced and credible. I do not necessarily approve of your changes all being reverted, especially with the edit summary "rv (POV)" and no talk page discussion, but I have to wonder why you think that any project like Wikipedia could work the way you seem to suggest it should, where if <b>anyone</b> comes along and says "No, I don't agree with what you have written there; my account of things is <b>the facts</b> and you must accept it as such" it actually is accepted without any question. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a></dd>

<p>HELLO!!! is anyone interested in reality? Wikipedia is becoming a joke with cult members posting ridiculous nonsense here. These folks are frustrated that within the real world no one takes them seriously and thinks that their "references" are losers and "cult apologists" that have sold out to rich cults. Doesn't ANYONE really watch Wikipedia and get this?</p>

<p>by Michael Browning from the Palm Beach Post, March 14, 2003:</p>
<p><i>"Brainwashing" is one of the few Chinese phrases to have made its way directly into English in translation, thanks to the Korean War. Chinese Taoist temples often displayed the two characters "Xi Xin," pronounced "shee shin," meaning "Wash Heart." It was an adjuration to all those entering to purge their hearts of base thoughts [i.e. Chinese Thought Reform] and desires, and rise to a higher spiritual plane.</i></p>
<p><i>The Chinese communists adopted this phrase during political "struggle sessions," in which an erring comrade would be urged by the group to straighten out, fly right, get back in tune with the common goal. The very word for "comrade" in Chinese is tongzhi, meaning "share goal."</i></p>
<p><i>Only one slight change was made: Instead of washing the heart, one was urged to wash the brain, "Xi Nao," purify one's thoughts.</i></p>
<p>Is it worth including? It is the only article I've found that traces the word back that far, but also I have no idea if its conclusions are valid.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We are not to judge if the conclusions are valid. If it is a well referenced POV, and you believe it to be notable enough and of encyclopedic value, feeel free to add it. (also note that it is expected than new topics for discussion are placed at the bottom of the page. Thanks). --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 16:09, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think this is good content to include. It is not true, as the article (used to?) imply that "brainwashing" was a term invented by clueless Western mass media hacks. The Chinese terms was there first. I had not heard about the Daoist temple thing, but it makes good sense and could easily be confirmed. (I'll try to get around to that job shortly.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Was "[i.e. Chinese Thought Reform]" in the original??? It's irrelevant to Daoism or at least greatly misleading. I would replace it with four dots if I were going to quote the whole thing. Better would be to paraphrase the entry and footnote the original.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 17:50, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was in the original, and I have to say I'm confused by it. It's probably a blooper, orginally meant to be placed after "Brainwashing." If I do include the article I'm going to paraphrase it.</p>
<p>OK. I've included it, and removed the references to the word being invented by Western journalists. If I am wrong, I am open to correction.</p>
<p>Please sign your postings. (4 tilde symbols will do it.) I've followed this subject avidly since the time of the Korean War and I've studied Chinese since 1960, and everything my gel-ware has sopped up tells me you are correct. The <i>Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language</i> (and it really is encyclopedic -- on the scale of the Encyclopedia Britanica) has an entry for the term, attributes the practice to the CCP and its government, and gives no indication that it was a Western term. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 20:29, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Patrick, I don't get this. The term brainwashing was invented by Western journalists, but the fact that there is a term in Chinese, that is something different, doesn't it? --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 00:55, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, somebody invented the translation of the Chinese term xi3 nao3 -- which works the same way as xi3 yi1fu (wash clothing). I don't know whether that first person to translate it into English happened to be a reporter who knew Chinese or a Chinese who was helping the reporter and said, "It means 'wash brains'". The point is that the translator stuck with a word-for-word translation. It also means that the Chinese had a very clear idea that there was a powerful technique being used on people before the Western reporters came on the scene. The Western reporters didn't invent something to use to make a big splash in the <i>Readers Digest</i> with.</p>
<p>An English clergyman discovered that honeybees will not build comb so its surface is closer than approximately 1/4 inch from the next ccmb. Big deal, you may think. But the whole commercial honey and pollination business depends on this discovery because knowing that bees will not obstruct any spaces that are a quarter in apart made it possible to make wooden hives with arrangements for honeycombs to be constructed in wooden frames that hang down like hanging file folders <b>and</b> that the beekeeper can remove without having to cut honeycomb apart. That means the beekeeper can get into the hive to inspect it for disease and other anomalous conditions in a way that is safe and efficient for everybody. Now the idea has surely reached China, and I'm sure that the average beekeeper doesn't use the term "bee space" in English whenever he is talking to his new helper or the government bee inspector. They surely have translated it into Chinese. (I don't happen to know the term but I could probably find out on the Chinese Wikipedia.) That <b>doesn't</b> mean that they invented the idea, made it seem that it was their own idea, or anything like that. Everybody who is curious about it can find out where the idea came from and who made the discovery that made a huge industry possible. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:09, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>No problem. I was happy to do it, and it made me wonder whether the article on the beehive had the information. It had the name of the inventor, but not what made it a real invention.

<p>I noticed that Zappaz has offered some misinformation here. The article he links attributed to "Rick Ross" actually is not. It is a Washington Post article archived within the Ross Institute database. <a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/brainwashing/brainwashing39.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/brainwashing/brainwashing39.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>Another point to bring out is the credibility of Dick Anthony. Anthony essentially works for "cults" and controversial groups called "cult-like" as a paid <a href="http://www.cultnews.com/archives/000664.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cultnews.com/archives/000664.html" rel="nofollow">apologist.</a> <a href="http://www.cultnews.com/archives/000007.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultnews.com/archives/000007.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Anyone quoting Anthony should note this for both contextual historical and NPOV purposes.

<p>Revert war due to lack of consensus in regard to commentary added by one editor, regarding the scientific support (or lack thereof) for the brainswashing theories advaced by the anti-cult movement. One editor has added commentary and interpretations, while the other insits in removing commentary and provide citations only, leaving the interpretations to the reader.</p>
<p>Comments by editors below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ditch the brainwashing POV commentary and POV interpretations. Let the reader decide. I am in support of Zappaz' version, not Antaeus Feldspar's cajole. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 13:08, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Revert war. A particular document known as the "Molko brief" is referenced; a compromise text was previously reached, indicating that the brief deemed certain research to be lacking in scientific validation, but did not deem the theory behind the research to be unscientific in nature or deem it to be disproven. Now one of the editors who reached that compromise text is insisting that because he has found a expert who incorrectly asserts that the brief deemed all research on such theories "not scientific" (an interpretation disproven by the brief itself suggesting alternate hypotheses based on the same theory that could yet be tested and would be consistent with the collected evidence) then the other side must provide an expert citation in order to point out that this is not what the brief says. Since when did Wikipedia require a negative to be proved, let alone proven via citation? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a>18:51, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But Lifton's work on the subject was never disputed and not because his research was so obscure. So his research can be stated as facts or do I miss something?

<p>There is an interesting (and hysterical) quotation in the text that needs a citation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1953 <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Welsh_Dulles_e97d.html" title="Allen Welsh Dulles">Allen Welsh Dulles</a>, the CIA director at that time, explained that "the brain under [Communist influence] becomes a phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control."</p>

<p>That's a very useful quotation, but only if it is real. Please supply the needed details.</p>
<p>I've been going back over the text of the article. So far I've seen a few places where unfamiliarity with the whole body of materials may have sort of given thought reform a "pass," but nothing that misrepresents what was going on in the other direction (except for our CIA director's hysterical comment quoted above -- "Go figure!").

<dd>I'll try to check over these materials again and see whether I can insert some citations to Lifton and/or Schein. In many ways, I suspect, they were both basing themselves on the results of many researchers working in an official capacity to try to understand why our troops were turning coat in unprescedented numbers. There is always a problem involved in giving an "objective" account when the individual data points can be matters of interpersonal experience (Former POW John J. Doe affirmed that he had admitted to releasing bio-warfare agents...) but any attempt to characterize the results has to be recognized as somebody's interpretation. Unless there are the the equivalents of holocaust deniers that I have not heard of, I think the general details of what happened were taken down by people who were tasked with finding out what had really happened with the aim of preparing troops better in future warfare, and not with making propaganda. (That's not to say that politicians could not make their own use of these events.) I am not aware of anyone having questioned the research methodology or the basic conclusions. As authors of books that tried to help the American people understand what had happened, both Lifton and Schein were necessarily acting as interpreters of their own and other people's research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for independent checks on their conclusions, check out the book by Father Clifford. I knew him fairly well in Taiwan. He was thoroughly sane (if you discount the fact that he went back to one part of China after all that happened to him), not at all "hysterical" or bombastic. He didn't make propaganda. But the things that he tells his readers about daily life in Chinese prison square with the general accounts provided by the other books.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A further check is available from <i>Prisoners of the Revolution</i> by Allyn and Adele Rickett. If I remember correctly, Allyn Rickett had been in Naval Intelligence before leaving the military and becoming a student of Chinese. When he had an opportunity to go to China to study, he was asked to keep his eyes open and make occasional reports to our government. He admitted as much when he was arrested for spying, and I think he took cognizance of the fact that from the standpoint of the PRC government he was breaking their laws so they had just cause under their system of values to imprison him. He appears not to have been embittered by his treatment, nor was his wife (who presumably knew that her husband was reporting to US intelligence). So I think it is fair to say that their description of their imprisonment was not hostile. All that being said, if you make allowances for the fact that people like Father Clifford were unlikely to have responded to milder pressure it seems clear that they were describing the same regimen.</dd>

<dd>If the studies of Lifton and Schein need to be "characterized" somehow, I think it is important not to make it seem that they might have been two kooks who spent a week in HK interviewing returning detainees and then came up with their own wild-eyed accounts. To controvert what they said it would be necessary to (1) do away with hundreds or thousands of interviews and psychological tests, and (2) attack the reasoning behind conclusions made on any remaining evidence. One of the things that happens with bad science over the course of decades and centuries is that not just one or two contrary voices are heard, but that somebody makes an attack, somebody else checks out the evidence and argument and finds it lacking, another criticism is raised, and gradually the whole original account gets chewed away. As far as I know, that hasn't happened. Robert J. Lifton is highly regarded even today.

<li><i>In a speech before the National Alumni Conference at Princeton University on April 10, 1953, newly appointed CIA director Allen Dulles lectured his audience on "how sinister the battle for men's minds had become in Soviet hand." The human mind, Dulles warned, was a "malleable tool," and the Red Menace had secretly developed "brain perversion techniques." Some of these methods were "so subtle and so abhorrent to our way of life that we have recoiled from facing up to them." Dulles continued, "The minds of selected individuals who are subjected to such treatment ... are deprived of the ability to state their own thoughts. Parrot-like, the individuals so conditioned can merely repeat the thoughts which have been implanted in their minds by suggestion from outside. In effect the brain ... become a phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control."</i><a href="http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/ethel/2000_05_14_ethel-archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/ethel/2000_05_14_ethel-archive.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, quoting <i>Acid Dreams</i> (1985) by Martin A.

<p>O.K., as requested I have revisited this section. I can give citations if people feel that there are doubts about whether Lifton and Schein actually reported these conclusions, but such citations would answer the question of whether the section is accurate or not. The section has a "neutrality" warning on it, and that must be answered in a different way.</p>
<p>There actually is a POV question in regard to this section. I've tried to address it. One point of view says that it is evil to use torture and coercive measures short of torture to take a prisoner's autonomy away from him/her and cause him/her to come into compliance with the values of the state. Another point of view says that it is preferable to use brainwashing on prisoners to cause them to cease being criminals rather than to use simple imprisonment to indulge in "pay back", causing prisoners distress and leading to no other result than recidivism. If I remember correctly, in Yablonsky's book on <i>Synanon</i> the founder of the Synanon organization says that he uses brainwashing and finds it preferable to letting guys OD on heroin. Was that the point of view that someone wanted included? Or is there some other way in which point of view needs to be neutralized?<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:32, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You got your attribution for the third APA quote wrong.... The quote refers to the BSERP <b>rejection of the DIMPAC task force report</b>. Not to the <i>amicus curiae</i>. The DIMPAC was headed by Margaret Singer. The APA rejected its findings. Full text follows (highlights are mine):</p>

The reviews are enclosed for your Information. The Board cautions the Task Force members against using their Past appointment to Imply BSERP or APA support or approval of the positions advocated In the report. BSERP requests that Task Force members not distribute or publicize the report without Indicating that the report was unacceptable to the Board.

<p>Singer-para is important and on the subject.

<dd>Editorializing is a word you'd better not use - does not really sound like wikiquette. And with POV you should be careful, especially in combination with 'who cares' - gives very much the impression of throwing stones when sitting in the glass house.</dd>
<dd>Singer made a contribution in the peer-reviewed Merck's Manual on a similar subject like covered in the DIMPAC report in the same year the DIMPAC report was rejected. This is a documented fact - and it is closely connected with the acceptance of her theories in the psychological community. Removing this because you do not care for her theories and want to keep out, if possible, every hint of acceptance is trying to push your not-neutral point of view in the article.

<p>What does the Stroop effect have to do with brainwashing at all? That's merely a demonstration of our tendancy to process words pretty much automatically. It doesn't make people think green is blue and vice-versa.

<p>I am going to add some materials here which will not match everyone's ideas about brainwashing - the source is the book "Misunderstanding cults" by Zablocki and Robbins, precisely the brainwashing chapters there by Zablocki, Bromley and Kent, all listed in the references. All three are well established experts on the subject, so describing their ideas is definitely no "original research". The book is not available online, so it would need to be bought or borrowed for verification (very recommended for interested people, though "almost every reader will find a chapter that will offend" (cited from preface). <a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 10:34, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A short cite on their ideas and theories will be a good addition. But please do not overwhelm the article. And when you do, please do not be too selective on your choice of cite. I have read the book and it will be too easy to editorialize Zablocki's views. If you cite, then also present Dick Anthony's conflict with Zablocki in regard of the definition of brainwashing and his ideas on the subject. Bromley's assessment of the ideological/political connotations of definitions of brainwashing as used by anti-cult will also be interesting to add. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 13:12, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the Anthony article, I'll be somewhat careful in using it, after reading Zablocki's rather devastating replica to it (not in the book but I found it on Zablocki's homepage) - it would be necessary to add Zablockis comment as well, for NPOV. Bromley is more interesting - and what generally does need mentioning is the different concepts of brainwashing presented in court cases and in scholarly literature (by the same people). The article needs also to be edited under that aspect - there are many views of many people talking about "brainwashing", but this needs to be sorted out as to what definition of brainwashing they are talking about. "ntrovigne says X about brainwashing and Zablocki says Y about brainwashing" does not make sense, if one does not show what Introvigne means by brainwashing and what Zablocki means about brainwashing.</dd>
<dd>Do you have a better idea for the "Other views" subtitle? And for the content there? The section needs a thorough revamp, right now it's just a listing of unconnected statements with no order whatsoever.</dd>

<dd>Let us not make this article a pissing contest between Zablocki and Anthony. Leave that to their home pages. In keeping with WP guidelines, we can describe their viewpoints and leave it at that, together with the viewpoints of many others already in the article. Given the wide difference of opinions I would argue that a bulleted list presenting a concise summary of each viewpoint will be sufficient, prefaced with an explanation along the lines of what you wrote above "there are many definitions of brainwashing, and there is no consensus among scholars" or something similar. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:42, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is in the previous paragraphs "the brainwashing theory espoused lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur", and concluded Finally, after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."

I mean no offense. This whole article seems very naively written. If we are going to speek of this topic from a modern perspective the commonsense time to begin a discussion of governmental mind control is surely to be WW1 not Korea. The British government turned a relatively reluctant community into a motivated anti-german agent. Hitler believed that superior propaganda (mind control) by the British and American governments was a major reason for the German defeat stating that they will be more prepared for the next time. Mind control techniques impressed and were taken up by many other areas of societies around the world and applied to many areas. Simply look at marketing. Now it is very well understood by governments and many people believe it is well used in many seemingly democratic societies today.</p>

<p>The article had said</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The often quoted Fishman Case the court concluded:<br /></i> <i>"At best, the evidence establishes that psychiatrists, psychologists, and sociologists disagree as to whether or not there is agreement regarding the Singer-Ofshe thesis."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a distortion of the case; what the court actually concluded is that Singer/Ofshe's thesis did not have the support of the scientific community and therefore Singer's testimony in a "brainwashing" defense was excluded. thats far different than the POV spin above. If anyone wants to discuss Fisher, they should include an accurate accounting of the case, rather than out of context quoting. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 21:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your text does not contradict the above quote, which I assume is verbatim. Here's a longer quote:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
  "Although the record before the Court is replete with
    declarations, affidavits and letters from reputable psychologists
    and sociologists who concur with the thought reform theories
    propounded by Dr. Singer and Dr. Ofshe, the government has
    submitted an equal number of declarations, affidavits and letters
    from reputable psychologists and sociologists who disagree with
    their theories...A more significant barometer of prevailing views
    within the scientific community is provided by professional
    organizations such as the American Psychological Association
    ("APA") and the American Sociological Association ("ASA").  The
    evidence before the Court, which is detailed below, shows that
    neither the APA nor the ASA has endorsed the views of Dr. Singer
    and Dr. Ofshe on thought reform...At best, the evidence
    establishes that psychiatrists, psychologists and sociologists
    disagree as to whether or not there is agreement regarding the
    Singer-Ofshe thesis. The Court therefore excludes defendants'
    proffered testimony "(U.S. vs. Fishman, 1989).

<dd>The quote as it was left out the real issue--which is that the court rejected Singer as a witness. Thaty was selective and distorted use of quotations out of context. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 22:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>BD, it's "not done" to delete well-sourced material just because in your own personal opinion not enough of the source is presented in the article. What <b><u>you</u></b> have to do is to add such material from the source that you feel should also be in the article -- you don't just delete it and then force others to follow your trail and clean up after you.</dd>

<dd>We did indeed have to "clean up" after you, in restoring deleted segments. This is just wasting time. Don't do it. It will be restored anyway, thus making you upset at the end.</dd>
<dd>If you feel something is out of context, then 1) add the context, or 2) point out in the discussion page what should be done. (2) applies if you have difficulties in writing "good" texts. (2) isn't meant to be an attack, it applies to me too, since I am not an english language speaker and not used to write "good" texts (it takes too long). So sometimes I just point out in the discussion page what should be improved. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 06:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
