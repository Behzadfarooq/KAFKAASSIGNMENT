<p>Hi again. I must take you to task about this statement: "The majority of competition brass bands extant are colliery bands". This is not true and to the best of my knowledge (I have no figures to prove this - I'd bet a pint that you don't have any either!) has never been so. Let's consider 6 top bands alone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Dyke Mills (cotton mill)</li>
<li>Grimethorpe Colliery (OK - I'll give you that one)</li>
<li>Yorkshire Building Society (once Hammond Sauce Works - not a colliery)</li>
<li>Fairey (once Fairey aviation)</li>
<li>Fodens (the truck manufacturer).</li>
<li>Brighouse &amp; Rastrick (unsponsored town band)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these top bands only one is or has ever been a colliery band. Look at www.bandsman.co.uk/bb-links.htm. There is no evidcence that the *majority* of *competition* bands are colliery bands.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<dd>You're quite right (I think the association may be stronger in Scotland than elsewhere), and I confess I added it knowing folks would gasp with horror and fix it&#160;:) I do think the article should cover more than just the bare details of the bands themselves - they're heavily integrated with the societies from which they spring (by contrast there's really no such thing as "string quartet culture"). So we should mention brass bands in Britain are largely a working-class phenomenon, are frequently (?) related to specific works (heh, I didn't know about the sauce works). The list above would make for a fascinating addition - please feel free to integrate it and to tone down my colliery fixation as needed. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 16:53, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "United States" section of this article is getting muddled. In particular, the second paragraph is mixing up discussion of "British style" brass bands in the U.S. with more generic-style brass bands. If it would help, I can take a shot at editing the second paragraph to clarify. However, as a non-American, it might be better if someone in the U.S. did it.&#160;:) Also, note that NABBA is mentioned in both the first and second paragraphs. I suggest the reference in the second paragraph can be safely removed. --<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBCRCornet_1867.html" title="User:BCRCornet">BCRCornet</a> 21:20, 2004 Oct 18 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, certainly, if you think you can improve the article, please do. As the title of the article is "Brass band" rather than something like "British style brass bands", I think it would be assumed that discussion is about brass bands in general except where some subset is specifically mentioned.

<p>I guess I must have caused that redundancy (NABBA). Sorry about that -- I'm new at this. How I missed it in the first place is beyond me! Anyway, I agree. Who cares if you're not American? If you feel comfortable making adjustments, go for it. I do believe that at some point, there needs to be a distinction made between "generic" brass bands and British-style bands, perhaps in the introductory section -- or perhaps as an entire sub-definition. One is like saying "I'm wearing tennis shoes;" the other is like saying "I wear the Nike X-99 Skywalkers, size 12W." As a brass bandsman, I believe that distinction is an important one. Do you agree?

<p>The reference to Hannaford Street Silver Band is reasonable, as a professional exception to the "recreational, amateur, community bands" statement.

<dd>text said "one of two"; as I know of well over a dozen professional brass bands in New Orleans alone, this seems wrong or is some very specific and narrow definition that needs explanation</dd>

<p>User:Altermoor replied:</p>
<dl>
<dd>fair enough... A brass band is a very specific music ensemble, comprised of the instrumentation shown above (under United Kingdom), so by those rules, RCBB is one of two full-time professional brass bands in the world -- the other is in Japan, (Osaka, I believe); still your phrase is simpler, and more to- the-point, so no argument here. But calling "just any" group with brass instruments might be over-simplifying. (I hope I've formatted this response correctly -- I'm new to this</dd>

<p>There seems to be some conflict here between people who want to use a broad and a specific narrow definition of "Brass band" on this page. I would tend to want the article to discuss the broader definition; if there is a desire to have discussion limited to a narrower definition, I'd suggest that be either a separate article or a clearly marked subsection of this article.</p>
<p>Living in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, what is commonly called a "brass band" is certainly rather idiosyncratic compared to other places (although I have heard good New Orleans style brass bands from such places as Ohio, Denmark, Japan, etc... perhaps an article on "New Orleans brass bands" could be a future topic). However I know many people from various places who use "brass band" in a broad context to include the British type, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Philip_Sousa_0530.html" title="John Philip Sousa">John Philip Sousa</a> and U.S. Marine Corps types, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Brass_9dac.html" title="Canadian Brass">Canadian Brass</a>, New Orleans style, etc. I think the narrow definition is not close enough to universal in usage that the article should be restricted to that.</p>
<p>Other thoughts? Cheers, -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 20:20, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>To Infrogmation: I tend to agree with you. A broad definition should have been used here, given that Wikipedia is an "encyclopedia". I was taken aback when I saw that someone had deleted the entire "United States" section, and I was looking to see if someone else would restore it. I would qualify my comment by adding that throughout the article, in the various sections and subsections, it always be made clear which "flavor" of brass band was being described.</p>
<p>However, upon reflecting on how the introductory section reads (clearly, it describes the British-style brass band), it may be better to rename the existing article to something like "Brass band - British-style", leaving it the way it is now, and starting a separate article for "Brass band" to describe the broader generic brass bands you mentioned. The two articles would cross-reference each other. --<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBCRCornet_1867.html" title="User:BCRCornet">BCRCornet</a> 18:28, 2004 Nov 22 (UTC) from Canada</p>

<dd>The wholesale removal of the United States section was IMO inappropriate, and I've put it back. If we go with two separate articles, what are thoughts about how to divide up (and expand on) the info? -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 20:51, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To Infrogmation: to expand on what I wrote above - rename the existing article to something narrower, e.g., "Brass band (British tradition)", edit the "United States" section to make it relevant only to how British brass bands are implemented in the U.S., start a new article for "Brass band", move most of the current "United States" paragraph to it, cross-refer the two "Brass band" articles, and move on from there. --<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBCRCornet_1867.html" title="User:BCRCornet">BCRCornet</a> 21:15, 2004 Nov 22 (UTC) from Canada</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) Is it agreed we should split into two artices, one on the more general and the other on the more narrow UK definition of "brass band"? Does anyone object?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) What should the title of the new article be? "Brass band (British tradition)" as suggested above? Other suggestions? -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 05:11, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>As to point #1, I agree that it should be split into two seperate categories. However, some care should be taken to avoid what a layman might call a "brass band." A lot of people call any group seen marching down the street a brass band, when in fact, in the United States, it is far more often a wind band (with the inclusion of woodwinds). Additionally, I believe I remember a reference to the Canadian Brass as a brass band; and while, strictly speaking, Canadian Brass is a "band of brass musicians," they are not really a brass band -- they are more specifically, a brass quintet -- a chamber music ensemble.</p>
<p>About point #2, I suggest "British Brass Band." Or, perhaps, it is better to put the qualifying word after? I've always refered to these bands as such, and I don't think you'll find much disagreement on that point. - Altermoor</p>

<p>Ok, I might have been a bit too bold with that last edit, sorry - feel free to revert it. The first thing I noticed about this article was that the instrumentation was put into the UK section and it seemed a bit messy. I moved this to the top and added the specifics about band from different countries underneath. I also added a sub-section of 'Competitions' to the UK section as to me, at least, it seemed to need a division in there.

<dd>Done. I'm still not happy with the content though. It's not really an encyclopaedic entry about brass bands in Switzerland, just a link to one band in that country. Also, the statement "the most successful brass band in Switzerland" is uncited. I've added the "complete rewrite" cleanup tag, which I deemed the most appropriate.</dd>

<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>Great article about the British tradition of Brass Banding, but shouldn't the title reflect that?</p>
<p>I see there's been discussion on this "back in the days", but let's finally do it if we're going to do it.</p>
<p>Can we split this into two articles - one on brass bands generally and one on British brass bands?</p>

<p>(I noticed that "what is a brass ensemble" was being offered to be merged with this article) as a brass player, I am rather strongly opinionated about brass divisions. I would consider a 'brass band' to be a british-style colliers' band. Things such as the Canadian Brass should be referred to by what they are (e.g. quintet, like them; octet; etc.). Once you get above 10-12 pieces, and still have only brass and necessary percussion, I believe it should be referred to as a Brass Ensemble or a large Brass Ensemble, because it does not fit the category of a colliers' band due to the concert repertoire. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.219.211.133_b000.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.219.211.133">65.219.211.133</a> (talk) 01:56, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
