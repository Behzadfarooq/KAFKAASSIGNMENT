<p>Thank you for both letting me know that the issue had not been resolved on the article that I protected, and for your comments there. I think that it is just true now that it has become common practice to accompany "List of x" articles with galleries of images. Combined with that is an increasing trend towards reliance on unfreely-licensed images, and, most remarkably of all perhaps, an unwiki-like resistance to their removal. I suggest that there really needs to be some sort of cultural shift back to the idea that free, reusable content is better, and anything that makes us less free and reusable is moving away from our goal. I'm not sure how to accomplish that, however. Coming up with more processes and longer, more specific guidelines does seem to have kept things better organised, for what that's worth. There would never be any community consensus for a ban of unfree content to decorate lists, but I think somebody needs to have a conversation about the idea, regardless. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 16:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been thinking about the conversation that we begun, but I notice that you are currently involved in some other conversations about Wikipedia's "fair use" practices. It is not clear to me that trying to have a conversation about it as administrators and free culture advocates is going to be easy to separate out from those conversations in which people seem to be expecting you to be wearing your counsel hat. Given that, I'll just note that I'd like to return to the specific issue about making our "list of x" articles more strictly freely-licensed and reusable, but I wonder if it might make sense to wait for a bit. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 16:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I nominated these images for removal because as commissioned works or works for hire, they are not created by federal employees and therefore not PD under the rationale that they are "works of the United States government". However, the opposing disputant wants a "copyright attorney" to weigh in on the issue before we go on a "deletion rampage".

<dd>Do not get me wrong, I am for free images under GPL. But much of the edits I do, happen in the gaming article space, and as such getting "free" images of screenshots from games is near imposible without breaking some sort of copyright (if the game itself is not GPL ofcourse). As I stated on the talk page of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Virtual_Boy_games_88b8.html" title="List of Virtual Boy games">List of Virtual Boy games</a> Wikipedia has somewhat cornered itself when adding a policy which removes the right to use fair use images (as in screenshots taken from games) along side the fact that one can not ask Nintendo - for example - for permission to use their images under the fair use banner. I would really like to get this resolved for both Wikipedia and its editors. Impossible? Maybe. But that shouldn't dither us from trying. A policy with let's users ask the developers/owners for permission, but also keeping the image away from the GPL tag at the same time could work. But that would require that the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> policy be changed somewhat. I am sorry if I am not making any sense. If some of my points are unclear please ask me what I ment.

<dd>Please point me to your sources for these policies. The issue of "permission" in accordance with "fair use" is not quite making sense. The point of US-based fair use is that you don't *have* to ask permission - fair use is permissive without the approval of the author/owner. If you do have explicit permission for use, the question is then under what license, and that requires compatibility with the GFDL (GPL is the General Public License, i.e., software). That's where I'm not following. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> wouldn't necessarily conflict, so I need help with where you are getting these arguments.

The image which was used as the main one of the console was wrong, and it was changed to a promo picture by Sony that was uploading under fair use. This image was removed stating "Fair use isn't allowed as long as a free image exsists." even if the free image was wrong they kept insisting the free be used. I then contacted Sony PR and asked them if I was allowed to use the image on Wikipedia, they said yes, I could. When I told them this, they stated that "Original research isn't allowed" and they went with the free image. This isn't a problem anymore seeing as a free image has been found that shows the "new" system. Now when it comes to screenshots, these can't be "free" in the same sense, seeing as they can not be take with a camera (well they can, but that would look crap), am I for example allowed to ask the developer for permission to use the images on WP? And I highly doubt they would release the images under GPL.

<p>Hello Mr. Patrick, congratulations on your new position! I was reading your FAQ, and there was one issue that it seems you (perhaps purposely) avoided. Do you think you'd be available to answer the occasional legal question? I can see how it could quickly become overwhelming, but I'm just curious what you think you might be willing to do. For example, a user has proposed a guideline on <a href="../../../m/u/s/Wikipedia%7EMusic_samples_3c08.html" title="Wikipedia:Music samples">music samples</a>, and few of the users discussing it are familiar with law (myself included). Do you see yourself answering the occasional legal question, or is this something you'd like to stay away from? ~<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696">MDD</a><a href="../../../m/d/d/User_talk%7EMdd4696_9dbb.html" title="User talk:Mdd4696">46</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mdd4696_369b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mdd4696">96</a> 16:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have direct responsibility for the legal affairs of the Foundation; that does not mean I have any direct authority over the community. That said, I have reasonable expectations that major policy questions will need to be reviewed and such, but you are correct, I do not have the task of answering every question of any legal relevance of anything anyone on any project could dream up in my portfolio. So, my role is (a) keep WMF out of trouble, (b) comply with what needs complying with, (c) review new transactions and relationships for legal issues, (d) advise the Board, (e) manage pro bono counsel efforts, (f) anything else I missed off the cuff.

<p>I was wondering if you'd be willing to help put together some simple materials on Wikipedia's relationship to the fair use clause? Basically I'm happy to try and write it up as I understand it and then send it to you for comments/critique/corrections/etc.? This could be done off-wiki if there are any liability issues. My basic desire is to have something simple to point confused users to so that they can at least have the basic knowledge of the law and our policy in order to discuss these things more sensibly.

<p>I was hoping I could get your take on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> as it applies to images used in the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlson_Twins_a8f6.html" title="Carlson Twins">Carlson Twins</a> article. So far, two images have been deleted based on their not having a sufficient rationale for fair use. I recently posted a message on the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarlson_Twins_5ac6.html" title="Talk:Carlson Twins">article's talk page</a>, to which you kindly replied. I wanted to get an understanding of how these images fell outside of fair use, without further stirring the pot back in the talk page. I see both images as having met the test to be considered fair use. That said, I've never graduated from any college that didn't have <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_college.html" title="Community college">Community</a> in front of it,&#160;:-) and you hold a law degree from a presigious institution, so, going against the mob mentality of the project, I'll defer to the judgment of an attorney over my lay opinion. Here's what I asked:</p>
<dl>
<dd>From my take on events, it seems like a misunderstanding occurs in how <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyrighted</a> materials are treated under U.S. law. There is an established <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> exemption to normal copyright protections, as contained in 17 USC § 107. For example, I can include a photo illustrative of the subject I am discussing, without needing the permission of the copyright holder. The particular fair use exemptions in this case would be:
<ol>
<li>The use of the image is for non-profit educational purposes, with no commercial gain.</li>
<li>The image has already been extensively published, to the extent that inclusion in an encyclopedia article has no effect on any right of first use or right not to publish asserted by its copyright holder(s).</li>
<li>The image represents a modest and insubstantial portion of an entire portfolio of similar works featuring the same subject, and is merely an illustrative element in an article that draws its infomation primarily from other sources. Thus, it is neither a substantial portion of the original body of work, nor is it a substantial portion of the derivative work.</li>
<li>The image's inclusion in an encyclopedia article represents an infinitessimal diminution of its value, if any diminution has occurred at all.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>This is, as I understand the law, a fair use of the image. I understand that the Foundation's view is different, and I'd like to be able to get some perspective on this. Would someone be willing to explain why this use of the image is seen as a copyright infringement? --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 18:58, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have considered the idea that even if this is fair use, it may still be wiser to delete than to fight with the copyright holder, but I'm really concerned about the images' being claimed as <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7Ecopyvio_af1e.html" title="WP:copyvio">WP:copyvio</a>'s when my best understanding is that the images use can be supported as fair use.

<p>We share the same last and first names - I was named after Confederate General Patrick Cleburne and for a time many years ago while working for Lykes Electronics in preparation for starting school at St. Pete JC I rented a very nice and large apartment from one of the Patrick families that live here in Tampa.</p>
<p>As General Counsel you may be interested in the following concern since many participants in some of the Wikimedia projects are confused as to the legal position of the Wikimedia Foundation in terms of its own accountability:</p>
<p>"...the State of Florida does not derive any sales tax revenue from the Wikipedia. Consequently the people of the State of Florida expect a little something in return for their kind generosity of granting a charter to the Wikimedia Foundation to allow it to operate world wide and solicit tax free donations from out of the State. Such beneficial compensation could be in the form of providing reference material or serving in some educational capacity for the citizens of the State. In absence of this the people of the State of Florida might prefer that the Wikipedia find some way to pay taxes instead of just being a community that receives tax free donations which the donator can then use to further indirectly reduce benefits to the State by using their financial contribution as the basis for Federal income tax deductions. In other words the people and the State of Florida may not like the idea of an organization living off of them unless the organization is going to make a contribution to the State in one form or the other. The State is already overburdened by educational institutions and prisons and prison inmates who likewise pay no taxes and cause financial losses without providing any financial gain. Perhaps you need to be thinking in terms of the fact that the Wikimedia Foundation which includes the Wikipedia Project is obligant to the State of Florida and its tax paying citizens and not the other way around." [See: <a href="../../../e/t/a/Etatism.html" title="Etatism">Etatism</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirigisme.html" title="Dirigisme">Dirigisme</a> in regard to the basis for such clarification as to the relation the State of Florida and the Wikimedia Foundation have to each other.]</p>

<li>On my RFA (now closed with no consensus), you expressed concern over my stated views regarding fair use. I replied:
<div style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; background-color: #fff; margin: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em; padding: .2em;">I very much appreciate your comments. I never intended to act in contravention of Wikipedia policy regarding fair use, even if I disagreed with it; given Gmaxwell's reasoning here, I'm not sure I <i>do</i> disagree with it. While it may be academic at this point with regard to directly handling image deletion, I still do involve myself on copyright pages regularly, so: do you think the statement "fair-use images should never be used if a free image would be possible unless their use is absolutely necessary; if a free image is impossible, or a fair-use image is absolutely necessary, fair-use images are acceptable provided we stay well within the bounds of the law" is a reasonable summary of what fair-use policy is or should be? —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 06:18, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</div>
Since the RFA is now closed, I would appreciate it if you would respond here.</li>
<li>A while ago I came across a Florida legal case where the judge explicitly declared that Florida's public-records laws prohibited anyone from claiming copyright on most works of the state. I summarized the outcome on {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-FLGov_1eeb.html" title="Template:PD-FLGov">PD-FLGov</a>}} (making use of exact wording where possible). Since there was a lot of confusion about {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-CAGov_ae5b.html" title="Template:PD-CAGov">PD-CAGov</a>}}, and you're a Florida lawyer, I figured it would be a good idea to ask you to glance it over and see if you think it's legit.</li>

I'm positive that would be <i>well</i> within their mission, but even so, there's no way to tell whether the bureaucracy will part with the funds. On the other hand, the whole of the Wikimedia Foundation is miniscule compared to a lot of esoteric projects they routinely do to serve populations not even a hundredth of a percent of the number of people served by Wikipedia each day.</p>

<p>There is a discussion here[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#What_is_the_policy_on_this.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#What_is_the_policy_on_this.3F" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] which began as a question of what is "appropriate" but it shifted to a debate about what is legal. While the article in question is very minor, even silly, the questions being raised (and the actions being taken) are more serious. While "what is appropriate?" is always a matter of opinion, "what is legal?" should not be. I know you don't usually comment at the Village Pump, but given your professional background and status in the community it seems that a few words from you could easily resolve this issue. I realize you've probably got bigger fish to fry, but if you could take just a few minutes for this it would go a long way towards clarificatoin for all of us.

<p>Note: While a consensus to use Linkimage has been achieved on <i>this specific topic</i>, there is ongoing uncertainty about Wikipedia's legal responsibility/potential liability in this area. Any clarification from you will certainly go a long way towards preventing future misunderstandings on related topics; even a link or pointer would be useful if you haven't the time for a lengthy reply. Personally, I don't really care what the answer is, I'm more concerned with having the "right" answer on a legal topic.

Since you're involved, I would guess that there is more to the story than I have in front of me, and I certainly will trust your judgement on the matter.

<p>Brad, I've noticed that the images Image:GOJ 03.jpg, Image:GOJ 07.jpg, Image:GOJ 08.jpg and Image:GOJ BOOKTWO.jpg are tagged with {{<a href="../../../l/i/m/Template%7ELimited_license_4ca3.html" title="Template:Limited license">Limited license</a>}}. I also note that on each of these images there was a notice to contact you prior to taking any action on these images.</p>
<p>The licensing on these images is incompatible with Jimbo's decree regarding "used with permission" images, and its following policy at WP:CSD I3. The last of these images could be tagged with {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBookcover_74f4.html" title="Template:Bookcover">bookcover</a>}}. The other three I am uncertain we can use under this policy. I'd also like to note that these images are not used anywhere on Wikipedia.</p>
