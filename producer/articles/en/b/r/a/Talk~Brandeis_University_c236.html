<p>Question: Why did Alright(?) remove Dessima Williams from the notable professors and staff listing? It would seem to me that the Grenadian Ambassador to the US, when the US invaded the country would be of note. Moreover, how many other Ambassadors to the United Nations are instructors at the University? It also seems to me that at least 10 other names on the list don't yet have his or her own webpage. I'm not gonna re-add her to the list, but it does seem arbitrary to remove her.</p>
<p>A recent edit by an anonymous user removed a claim that Brandeis University is "highly regarded academically" because, as the editor put it, "Brandeis isn't Harvard." I don't believe the claim was that Brandeis University is Harvard; Brandeis was founded because, at the time, Harvard discriminated against Jewish applicants.</p>
<p>Brandeis is academically highly regarded. You may pick up your favorite listing of schools (US News, Peterson's, etc) to find Brandeis highly ranked. It is not Harvard, but then, neither is MIT.</p>
<p>Additionally, Brandeis does have excellent research programs within the fields of Biology, Computer Science, and Physics. I did not say that Brandeis is universally strong in these areas, but that it has world-class research within each of these departments. I'll list the labs and researchers that I am personally familiar with: <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Pustejovsky_fbc3.html" title="James Pustejovsky">James Pustejovsky</a> and Jordan Pollack in the Computer Science department, Larry Abbott, Eve Marder, and Michael Rosbach in the Biology department.</p>

<dd>This description is not coming from Brandeis, and I don't think there would be consensus that, say, Slippery Rock State or (pick your favorite low-ranked school) would see much defense here. Brandeis, however, is a strong school, and in particular is a strong and new (~55 years old) one.

<p>SAWIT-- I hope I didn't step on anyone's toes, but I've changed the heading to "Notable Current and Former Faculty and Staff." Though a mouthful, the term "faculty" constitutes an important recognition of collegiality and accomplishment. I also added Philip Rahv to the list, since his admission is baffling. Rahv founded <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partisan_Review_1bf0.html" title="Partisan Review">Partisan Review</a> and was at the center of an intellectual scene that set the standards for debate over culture and politics during the Cold War. As such he is also an essential figure in the history of Jewish intellectuals in America.</p>
<p>I can't resist adding a more personal look at the school, as I came out of the graduate CS program there. Also, I came from a school that was largely Brandeis's opposite: big, public, and a notable tech school (not MIT notable - but enough that people sometimes have asked - Why did you go to Brandeis?). James P is definitely intelligent, and also seems a bit sad and melancholy - but he does work on something that even he knows will most likely see no huge breakthoughs anytime soon. Jordan Pollack is scatterbrained, and has many crazy ideas, a lot of which seem to go nowhere - you sometimes get the feeling of a one-hit wonder. He also seems a little discontented, but seems more stubbornly committed to the idea that "there *is* an answer, or at least perhaps a well-defined question in the field A-Life". Cherniack is nice, but seems a little full of himself. He is one of the more prepared teachers, but I don't think he realizes at other schools this is often normal, not exceptional. Marty Cohn was a grumpy son of... but intelligent, and you did learn in his class. Overall, it was fun, but I don't think it would be worth the money for the education. My experience as a whole at the school, maybe, but I did make most of my friends in Heller &amp; IBS, so if you just stick to Comp Sci, and are looking for a really good education, I might stay away.</p>

<p>Just because a school is not regarded AS highly in academics as Harvard doesn't mean it's Tijuana Tech. Being a popular Ivy League safety school ain't all that bad and it doesn't mean we're a bunch of dumbasses. I highly disliked nearly all aspects of Brandeis EXCEPT for the one that most of us ultimately (well, presumably) pursue higher education for - quality of education. I genuinely feel the quality of faculty and education outshines what I could have gotten at other institutions, public or private, cheaper or not.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a glaring omission - Brandeis' Heller School and graduate program in Theater are DEFINITELY highly regarded. I think they're the only two graduate programs that make it onto the USNews best grad school list (which is a far more accurate representation of reputation - how highly its REGARDED by peers - than actual quality. But that's for another wiki entry). Since pursuing a career in international/community development, there have been multiple occasions where I was told, "Oh you went to Brandeis? They have an excellent social work school!" or "Their social policy school is top-ranked in the nation!" Anyone who works for an NGO or social service nonprofit - including those not in the US - will likely be familiar with it.</p>

<p>...Maybe some of you will jump down my throat for doing this but I have to agree with whoever said they scratched their head when reading the list of supposedly "notable" alumni. It's a great achievement but I didn't think being a dean or being XYZ Professor of English was really "notable", at least compared to those who have, say, won awards I have heard of (Nobels, Pulitzers, etc.) - on which note, I am SHOCKED that Gina Turrigiano wasn't on the list of notable faculty. Those MacArthur Genius awards are extremely competitive. And no, I never had her as a professor, so I'm not nearly as biased as the person who wrote the original article and decided to stick himself under the notable alumni section.&#160;;)</p>
<p>Obviously we'll have to debate what "notable" means - I personally think being a high-ranking or high-achieving professor doesn't cut it, because then we'd have to add most Brandeis faculty in there. And dudes, if you're gonna put Ben Brandzel up as notable alumni, then my name ought to be on this too. Brandeis alumni make great achievements but we can't ALL be on this list!</p>

<p>You've got to be blind (or a Brandeis admin) to make the blanket statement that frats and sororities simply do not exist on campus, because they sure as hell do - they're just not OFFICIALLY funded. In the past, fraternity members would draft a proposal for a non-Greek club, the Allocations Board would approve, and then they would get funding from the Student Activities Fee pool like any other club. Of course no one knew that they were essentially funneling the funds to buy liquor for their parties. Most of them, however, just got their funding from the pockets of their members. So really, that statement ought to be changed to maintain accuracy - to say there are none on campus is practically lying.</p>
<p>To say that there are none on campus is absolutly correct. To prove otherwise, show me a campus map, and point out the frat houses please?</p>
<hr />
<p>Since when do fraternities need to be in actual frat houses? They're just social clubs. If you're using designated physical space exclusive to that club as criteria for existence on campus, then a huge chunk of Brandeis' supposed 200-plus clubs would, according to you, have no on-campus presence. I attended two on-campus frat "parties" (more like open bars but the suites were PACKED) that were both busted by Alwina. Phi Psi, AEpi, SDT, and ZBT are the most active. Haven't you seen them doing their rushing/initiation whatchamacallit on campus? I just don't see how you can attend school there as an undergraduate and not realize that there ARE frats on campus, they just happen to be a flimsy underground network.</p>
<p>At the very least that statement needs to be reworded because it makes it sound like they completely don't exist at all. What you wrote is what Brandeis told me in their official brochures and, boy, was I in for a surprise when I actually arrived there as a freshman.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok I just deleted it, fair enough?</p>
<hr />
<p>Fair enough. P.S. "I just don't see how you can attend school there as an undergraduate and not realize that there ARE frats on campus"&#160;: The reason for this is that the last time I was an undergraduate there was 1984. At that time there were absolutely no fraternities (underground or otherwise), and quite frankly this was quite an appealing feature of the school.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's true that there are frats that a few Brandeis students belong to. However, they have little or no effect on student life for those who don't belong to them. Their parties are typically unpopular and all off campus. They are basically social groups with hazing and matching sweaters.</p>

<p>I think that going forward, for an alumnus or faculty member to be considered "notable" they would at a minimum need to have their own (non-stub) Wikipedia article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the above comment is just sad. Wikipedia? How about published notable papers in their field? How many other published papers referenced one of their papers - in a non-critical tone? But no, Wikipedia...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That may be resonable criteria for notablility in the academic community, but for a general-interest reference source such as Wikipedia, I think that is a very reasonable standard.<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 11:48, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry but your ignorance is no excuse for not putting in notable faculty like Allen Grossman, a MacArthur winner and world-famous poet, who's certainly a lot more notable than Campbell, or Paul Solman, founder of the Real Paper, editor of Mother Jones, major correspondent on the Jim Lehrer News Hour. The whole idea of wikipedia is the branching that it makes possible. On your showing nothing could ever get on wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If Allen Grossman (a former professor of mine, I might add) is so notable, write a Wikipedia article for him. It's pretty embarassing that Brandeis' "notable alumi/faculty" listing pretty much reads like a who's who of unknowns.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
When did the criterion get to be "so notable"? What does "so" mean? When did someone editing an entry sign on to write another one? Especially when people start feeling they can delete the people they don't know or haven't heard of. Mary Campbell (it seems) writes an article on herself, so she stays on the list, but Grossman who is on everyone's short list of major poets and critics, and a MacArthur genius honoree is deleted. As to reading like "a who's who of unknowns," well if you check you'll find that it reads like the real "Who's Who," which has articles on the people you deleted. Which makes relevant the following sentences from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a>&#160;: "Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line)." The people you deleted meet that criterion, in spades, whether someone has bothered to write an article on them yet or not.</p>
<p>You're embarrassed for Brandeis? But the Brandeis entry isn't supposed to be advertising for Brandeis. Or who are you embarrassed for?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let me put it another way. By including somebody in a list of "notable" anything, you are making a statement that they have distinguished themselves above potentially thousands of others. All I'm saying is, if this is true than just putting them on a list is not particulary informative. Write an article and provide some facts. If Allen Grossman is on "everyone's short list of major poets." Why is he not in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_poets_from_the_United_States_fc36.html" title="List of poets from the United States">List of poets from the United States</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_language_poets_3e81.html" title="List of English language poets">List of English language poets</a> lists? Each of these lists have hundreds of entries, and no Allen Grossman. It seems that he is only "notable" when discussed in the context of Brandeis University, which is to say not very notable at all. Of course, not knowing much about poetry, I (as well as the compilers of the aforementioned lists) could be wrong, in which case a simple article enumerating Grossman's accomplishments would take care of this.</dd>
<dd>As far as the "embarassing" remark goes, poor choice of words on my part. Let's just say it looks "silly" for any list of notable people in Wikipedia to be filled with names which have no articles to back up the claim to notability.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sigh. He's not on the list because, it seems obvious, he didn't put himself on the list. I do know a lot about poetry, and the list of notable American poets is not a good list. It's famous dead people and living people who are wikipedia-competent. No, he's not notable only when it comes to Brandeis. Check out for example the list in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Bloom_486b.html" title="Harold Bloom">Harold Bloom</a>'s book The Western Canon of the most important writers now alive. (I assume you'll recognize Bloom's name.) That's one obvious place you'll find Grossman. Note that neither <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorie_Graham_bc5e.html" title="Jorie Graham">Jorie Graham</a>, profiled everywhere, certainly considered one of the top ten living American poets (though not by me), nor <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Cole_3e99.html" title="Henri Cole">Henri Cole</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Doty_a21a.html" title="Mark Doty">Mark Doty</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Wright_f63f.html" title="Jay Wright">Jay Wright</a> (who all taught at Brandeis) nor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_Aiken_19df.html" title="Conrad Aiken">Conrad Aiken</a> nor <a href="../../../a/2E/r/A.R._Ammons_7d38.html" title="A.R. Ammons">A.R. Ammons</a> nor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hollander_a712.html" title="John Hollander">John Hollander</a> nor <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Johnson_dcba.html" title="Dennis Johnson">Dennis Johnson</a> are on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_poets_from_the_United_States_fc36.html" title="List of poets from the United States">List of poets from the United States</a>. Nor is <a href="../../../o/l/g/Olga_Broumas_9f81.html" title="Olga Broumas">Olga Broumas</a>. I think the fact that you don't know means you should defer to people who do. Like, in this case, me. You may say that the whole of Wikipedia trumps my knowledge. But what you need to know is that there are plenty of people who are internet-savvy who are on the list, and plenty of extremely famous people on the list, and then plenty of people who are extremely well-known but not internet-savvy who are not. Graham and Grossman are in that last category.</dd>

<p>Underneath every edit box it links to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a> which says that 1) Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources. 2. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor. 3. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it. At a quick check, of the first twenty-five names on the list, only five met the requirements of policy.</p>
<p>I don't think we need to worry about notability just yet, let's start by worrying about verifiability.</p>

<p>I have suggested that VoiceMale be merged into this article since, alone, it doesn't seem to meet the notability requirements for an article.

<dd>I'd have to disagree. Just because the Brandeis University page doesn't list something doesn't automatically make it un-notable; it might mean we need to expand the Brandeis page. For a parallel structure, the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a> page lists many more a cappella groups than just <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a>, not all of whom are world-famous; this page could list all the various a cappella groups, and if there is enough interest to flesh out the individual groups, then let those pages live or die on their own. VoiceMale editors, you do need to spiff up that page, though... In any case, don't merge; either kill the VoiceMale page, or let it stand on its own. -- <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetahacker_455d.html" title="User:Metahacker">Metahacker</a> 22:43, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe the general standard on Wikipedia is that if a person or group isn't notable enough on its/his/her own, then it must first be seen if there is another article where the information is useful, otherwise it should be deleted. I don't believe the group Voicemale has stated its notability well enough, but within Brandeis University, I'm sure it serves an important role for many students. As you said, the <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale.html" title="Yale">Yale</a> page lists many groups on that page, but only the notable one has its own page. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 07:41, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's one thing to mention that Brandeis has a vocal group called VoiceMale on the main Brandeis page, it's quite another thing to name group members, enumerate albums etc. If anything needs to be said about VoiceMale beyond the fact that it exists, that should be put on a seperate VoiceMale page. What it comes down to is a choice between cluttering up the main Brandeis article with so much crud that it becomes unreadable, or giving VoiceMale its own page, I think the choice is clear. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 12:26, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well yes, I think the point of a merge is to take what's important to the page it will be merged into and leave all the rest behind. Does anybody know enough about Brandeis to add this group in a section onto the Brandeis page?

<dl>
<dd>Not quite. I think "what's important" is relative to the page it's on. For a Brandeis University page, "what's important" about VoiceMale is pretty much limited to the fact that it exists. For a VoiceMale page, "what's important" takes on a very different meaning and can include lots of detail that should not be deleted. This is the status-quo and I think it's best left as is. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 21:50, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is not true. The status quo on Wikipedia is to delete nn-articles and bring over any necessary information onto an article that might need it. Many student groups have their own pages created only to be merged into the University's page. Your error in logic comes when you assume that VoiceMale deserves its own page which you haven't justified. If you do, then I would be very willing to pull my suggestion for a move. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 06:30, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not willing to take the responsibility of deciding if VoiceMale deserves its own page or not. However, I'm pretty emphatic that bringing the details of VoiceMale (or any group, publication, etc.) into the main university article constitutes clutter which is best left to a seperate article.

<p>As a Brandeis student, I would be <b>appalled</b> if VoiceMale- a group which <i>does not deserve a Wiki article on its own merits</i>, were merged into the Brandeis U. article. If that's the case, then why not make a Wikipage for all 300+ groups on campus, including all <b>dozen</b> a cappella troupes, and then put them all on the Brandeis main page? I have nothing against VoiceMale (I've heard them sing only once in my three years at this school, and they were fine), but an individual (non-notable) college a cappella troupe does not need its own Wiki, much less does it need to be on the page of said troupe's college. In addition, the article on VoiceMale is terribly biased and poorly written. It's somewhat a disgrace to the wonderful school that I attend. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 06:01, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was a disambiguation paragraph in the middle of the article.

<dd>It's not a disambiguation paragraph. It's simply there to point out the fact that another university named one of their schools with a similar name. I agree, I don't think anybody is getting the schools confused.

<dd>It belongs in the Louis Brandeis article, then, not the Brandeis U article. Louisville didn't name its law school after Brandeis because of the Waltham institution.

In other, similar, lists been astonished at how often I've clicked on a blue-linked name in such a list only to find that the linked article gave no source for the person's being an alumnus... and how often the linked article <i>doesn't even mention</i> the school. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:59, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Are you going to settle for nothing less than a digitally-signed scanned image of their diploma? Don't you think that some people's Brandeis affiliation is self-evident? (e.g. Mitch Albom). Also, why are you limiting this exercise to alumni?

After writing some stuff about it, I happened to look at the rest of the article, and said "yeesh." I decided to clean up one section of it. I don't have a great appetite for the job, but I do hate these long lists of unsourced items, and I do try to deal with them when I run across them in an article I happen to be working on.</dd>

<dd>6) You say it "self-evident" that Mitch Albom is a Brandeis alum. Not to me. Now that I'm looking at the article, I'm guessing that's because I haven't read <a href="../../../t/u/e/Tuesdays_with_Morrie_b75b.html" title="Tuesdays with Morrie">Tuesdays with Morrie</a>. But what's the big problem here? Assuming that the book is non-fiction, and assuming he says somewhere that he went to Brandeis, well, gee, look it up and put in a citation. And, why didn't the person who listed him put it in in the first place? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:36, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think it's "self evident" that Albom is a Brandeis alum because the primary basis of his notoriety is that he went to Brandeis (which makes him pretty much unique in the list).</dd>
<dd>I'm just finding it a bit odd that you chose to: 1. Add a "Origins of Brandeis" section that focuses almost exclusively on the negative aspects of its founding. Anybody who knows anything about the university's history will tell you that you can't write about the history of Brandeis without discussing Abe Sachar, but since you only want to focus on the negative aspects you chose to leave him out. 2. You intend to gut the listing of alumni in a fashion that has not been applied to any other university (can you name one single university article on Wikipedia where every alumni listed has a citation?). You seem to have a problem with Brandeis, and for whatever reason that is, is your business, but I think your POV is starting to creep into your actions.
<dl>
<dd>That hurts. You mistake my point of view. Greatly. I indeed did not write, nor did I intend to write a balanced or complete picture of Brandeis' origins. What I wrote could be <i>a part of</i> a history section, which the article lacks. Prehistory, if you will. I ran across the Einstein thing, and aimed to describe <i>that particular incident</i> and my curiosity indeed sort of ran away with me and by the time I had marshalled what seemed to be the relevant facts I had six paragraphs. Probably too many. But I hope you'll notice that I cited <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abram_L._Sachar_6cf2.html" title="Abram L. Sachar">Abram L. Sachar</a>'s book, <i>Brandeis University: A Host at Last,</i> four times.</dd>
<dd>You challenge me to "name one single university article on Wikipedia where every alumni listed has a citation." I present <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babson_College&amp;diff=39000548&amp;oldid=38074370" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babson_College&amp;diff=39000548&amp;oldid=38074370" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> as evidence that I'm not singling out Brandeis, and <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babson_College_c430.html#Notable_alumni" title="Babson College">Babson College</a> as an example of an article in which every alumni listed <b>does</b> have a citation. Yes, it's easier for Babson because Babson has fewer notable alumni than Brandeis. I've never removed any entry as unsourced where anyone has provided <i>any</i> halfway reasonable source. I've sourced a dozen of the Brandeis entries myself, mostly by following up the references in other articles but also by doing my own searches. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:17, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if it hurts, but I don't know you and all I have to go on is your actions, which appear to be those of someone who has an axe to grind with Brandeis. Why don't you change the title of your section to something like "Brandeis and Einstein." I would think that calling what you wrote "Origins of Brandeis" is quite misleading, as there is MUCH more to the story than what you chose to include.</dd>
<dd>As far as the alumni issue goes, I stand by my statement that you are holding Brandeis to a different standard (the Babson example doesn't cut it for me) than other universities. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 13:11, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added a criticism of Brandeis at the end of the Einstein article, the points are factual and the controversy interesting and to some extent go to the heart of what Brandeis is all about as a university, look forward to further edits to this section.Incorrect 06:37, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I reorganized that section. It certainly doesn't belong in "the Einstein incident." This is <b>not</b>, I repeat <b>not</b> supposed to be a "criticism of Brandeis" section. I think the recent incidents deserve mention but I tried to wordsmith them a bit. Matt Brown did not actually advocate a quota in so many words, but he did name a specific percentage (30%) and he did advocate jiggering policy to encourage more non-Jewish and less Jewish enrollment. This was, of course, <b>precisely</b> what Yale and Princeton did in the 1920s. Harvard's then-president Lowell created a furor by being more open about what he was doing. Brown's rationale was (shockingly, to me) similar to Lowell's stated rationale--Lowell maintained and probably believed that the Jewish quota was a way of reducing anti-Semitism. I'd like to say something about in the article about Brown "shocking many" and about the obvious irony of proposing a Jewish quota at a university that was often described in the fifties as a "Jewish-sponsored non-quota university" but won't do so until I can find a suitable source citation.</dd>
<dd>Really, though, I think Matt Brown is just testing the boundaries and shocking his elders and it will probably die down and be forgotten in a few months... don't you? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:18, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do what you think best. <b>I</b> wouldn't have any issue with snipping this item and moving it to Talk. I think it's a bit of recent news that made a ripple today but probably won't a year from now... unless of course it turns out to be a leading indicator of some big change in direction. If one were to imagine a fairly complete "history of Brandeis" section, a discussion of Evelyn Handler's tenure would be appropriate. But I've been sufficiently stung by Alight's criticism that <b>I'm</b> not going to be the one to tackle that, certainly not right now. The history of Brandeis section should not be a puff piece limited to things that might appear in a Brandeis admission brochure, but it should not be a disguised "criticism of Brandeis" section, either.</dd>

<dd>The seal was never changed; it may have been discussed, but always had the Hebrew. The big change was the addition of pork and shellfish to one cafeteria (it was still absent from the cafeteria with the strictly kosher food), and the change in the calendar so that days off for Jewish holidays said "No university exercises" instead of "Sh'mini Atzeret." The campus does seem less Jewish now -- it was about 70% when I was there in the late 1980s, and is described as 50% now. -- FRCP11 14:48, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, here is the deal on the seal (from somebody (me) who was actually there when it all went down): Brandeis has never actually changed the university seal in any significant way. However, during the mid/late '80s they had a "logo" which was widely used and the "official" seal was pretty much kept under wraps. The logo was a stylized version of the three flames on the seal and had no wording (Hebrew or otherwise). The big controversy was that supposedly the university was using the logo in place of the seal as a way to keep the Hebrew letters off of marketing materials, etc. As far as I know, the logo has not been used in years (I can't find an example of it on-line). <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 17:49, 25 May 2006 (UTC) (Brandeis '84)</dd>

<dd>Interesting. A Boston Globe story, August 2 1990, Metro, p. 1, about Handler's resignation says "Then, in an attempt to make Brandeis more inviting to non-Jewish students, Handler moved to remove Hebrew letters from the university seal, curtail observance of Jewish holidays and provide nonkosher dishes such as shrimp and pork in the dining halls. The university's Jewish community was outraged. Handler and the founding president, Abram L. Sachar, clashed over the "de- Judaization" of the school, one of several times the two crossed swords." The subtleties you mention could easily have been missed by the reporter. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:52, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Read the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. Citing sources is not "a problem." And, yes, whenever you check a list like this in detail, there is always a small but significant fraction of entries like this do not check out. In fact, I've seen cases of apparent circularity, in which an item was added to a list, someone saw the item on the list and added it to the article, so that the article and the list appeared to be supporting each other but neither cited a source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A few years ago the verifiability policy was mostly honored in the breach. Following l'affaire Seigenthaler this is changing. If you see an aesthetic problem with the current "ref" mechanism, discuss it in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28technical%29_e812.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)">Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)</a>. I'd like to see some system of references that is less intrusive than this one. Say, a user-controllable switch that would lightly color the portions of an article that are referenced, so you didn't have to have little superscripts spoiling the line spacing. But the current mechanism is far, far better than what we had a year ago.<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is a stilted reading of WP:V. If the original Wikipedia article mentions Brandeis, it's alright for this page to mention it, too, without a footnote. Your original justification for this -- "Babson does it, too" -- is a bit misleading, since <i>you</i> were the one who interlaced footnotes into the Babson article.

<p>(Resetting margin) FRCP11, here is a list of some things in which I think we are in agreement. Can you confirm my understanding?</p>
<p>1) The lists of faculty and alumni in this article are now quite long, and should be broken out into a separate List of Brandeis people (in a manner similar to many other universities, e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Tulane_University_people_8b38.html" title="List of Tulane University people">List of Tulane University people</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Monash_University_people_47e2.html" title="List of Monash University people">List of Monash University people</a>...)</p>
<p>2) The statement that "X is an alumnus of Y" is almost never controversial. Such statements are almost always entered in good faith. In the case where X is a bluelink (to a well-established article) the chances are negligible that the entry is a prank, and the chances that it is accurate are high.</p>
<p>3) Judgement needs to be used in applying policy. It is possible to use valid policy selectively in a bad-faith manner. It is appropriate to challenge any appearance of non-neutrality.</p>
<p>4) The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a> <i>as written</i> does not contain anything limiting it to controversial statements or to important statements.</p>
<p>5) In many cases it does not take much work to verify that X is an alumnus of Y.</p>

<p>-Why is being a selectman of a town not a notable thing? -Igor</p>

<dd>It's a question of context. Being a selectmen is perhaps notable for your town or family but it's a bit of a stretch to consider that accomplishment "notable" in the context of the thousands of Brandeis alumni. Using that standard, every alumnus who's ever had a book or magazine article published, served on a school board or been interviewed on TV could be listed as "notable." The person in question is no more notable than I am (which is to say, not notable at all). <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 22:20, 16 June 2006 (UTC) (Brandeis '84)</dd>

<p>Un-logged-in users keep removing the quotation "a 30 percent-Jewish student body should be fine."</p>
<p>If the incident is to be mentioned at all, I think it's very important to keep this in, for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, it is Brown's own words (not an interpretation of his words).</p>
<p>Second, this quotation is the essence of the article's shock value, both because the percentage named is such a sharp reduction from the present composition, and because, while we must not put the words "Brandeis should have a Jewish quota" into his mouth, since he never said them, we can and should allow the reader to decide whether he said something amounting to that.</p>
<p>If (as I assume) Brown was not speaking for the student body, and if it is important to establish this, fine. However, the comment that "Few current students wrote letters to the editor of The Justice, implying that many weren't moved by his views" is inappropriate. First, it is vague. <i>How many</i> students wrote letters? Did the editor of the Justice say how many were received? Second, even if it is "a few," it is hard to know how to interpret this, and in any case we can't put someone's personal interpretation in the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:04, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but shock value is ALL it has. I think you should recuse yourself from this issue.

<p>I think either (1) Hefner should be moved to "business" because she is, after all, a CEO and Chairwoman, or both Asper and Olafson should be moved to media, because, after all, Asper is CEO of "one of Canada's largest international <b>media</b> companies" and Olafson is VP at "Time Warner Digital <b>Media</b>." I would personally prefer for Hefner to be moved to "business," but either one is acceptable.</p>

<p>Since Nathan Cohen is indeed notable, I think there needs to be a Wikipedia article to eliminate the "red link". This would apply to any other "red link" notables as well. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 13:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In almost any other context, I'd completely agree with you. However, when compiling a list of "notables" there has to be SOME criteria for notability. I think that the assumption that if someone is notable, than someone else would have taken a few minutes to write a Wikipedia bio article is valid. Clearly many of these "red link" people are notable, so they should not be deleted from the list, but instead get an article (however stubby).<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlight_cc46.html" title="User:Alight">Alight</a> 01:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
