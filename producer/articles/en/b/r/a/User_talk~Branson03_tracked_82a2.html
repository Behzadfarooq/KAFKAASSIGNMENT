<dd>No, that's a discussion of whether the moon rocks were hoaxed or not. What was in here before an edit was swept it away was independent analysis of the moon rocks.

<p>I think that this page is a good idea. If it is presented solely as observations and tracking, then it is a logical sub page of Apollo. However, given this new title, it is now necessary that all information related to the hoax be removed: Without the word "evidence" in the title, there is no connection to the hoax at all (I don't understand why gravitor never responded to my proposal to just rename the page to "Independent observations of the Apollo Moon landings", or something similar). In particular, we need to delete the section "Tracking of landings (unmanned or human)" and "Future plans that may generate evidence". I will help out with this after the merge proposal closes on that page (I'm giving it five more days). We should also decide if this is going to be a list, or an article. In any case, irregardless of the merge decision, I'll try to help out here. Gravitor's comment about the Moon rock section is a red herring: It has nothing to do with the scope of this new article, and I have not problem not including it. Based on his behavior that is documented at his RfC, I can only conclude that he is trying to sabotage this idea by bringing up this pointless non-argument. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 10:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thing, you might just want to create this article after removing the hoax references. This would give support to the orginal merge proposal with the hoax article, as there would be "nothing to merge" (I already merged the largest section.). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 10:28, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind, I just Copy&amp;Pasted the article, then look for things that didn't fit the title. I'm sure I missed some. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranson03_ab4e.html" title="User:Branson03">Branson03</a> 15:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>, Are references 11 and 12 the same, so can we lose the second occurrence? Is it worth dropping the second one? Would it be useful to kick off with the Australian TV bit, as (my reading is) it covered all the missions. All the other bits are mission specific. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 18:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC) I've done as I suggested above, hope you don't mind me messing with your userspace Branson. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 14:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that before we get too far ahead of this, it would be useful to clarify the scope of the article. I am worried that this is looking like an attempt to remove and delete evidence. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 06:38, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, "evidence" has not been deleted, it remains in the corpus of Wikipedia, just in a less controversial and contentious way is how I see it. The moon rocks stuff is still around, and everything else on this page is an observation. Nothing has been lost. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeG_3209.html" title="User:LeeG">LeeG</a> 14:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that is the intention of this page - the evidence relating to the moon rocks does appear to disappear from this page, with no solid plan about where to put it - I am worried this is another 'hide the evidence' attempt. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 16:22, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the title Independent Study and Observation of Apollo Missions avoids this - what do you think? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 16:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Remeber, this article will be its own. It will be created even when the evidence article is in existence. There still will be time to deal with the evidence article. The only question is what to name it. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranson03_ab4e.html" title="User:Branson03">Branson03</a> 16:43, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well not quite, what will happen is that someone with a n agenda will take your initiative, and use it to delete material from the evidence page, and then move to delete it. I am not convinced that this is a good idea. What do you think of my suggestion as a rename? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 16:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Try discussing a page move on the Talk page for independent evidence and see what other people think. I'm not trying to deleted evidence, I made a suggestion the was supported by people on both sides of the edit war. If you want to make a suggestion on what to do, you have to go ahead and do it.</dd>

<p>The would be on the hoax page (or another page it would fit). Nothing will be lost, only split into two articles. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranson03_ab4e.html" title="User:Branson03">Branson03</a> 18:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're back to the bizarre idea that the only reason for evidence is the hoax, which I thought we had got rid of. None of the evidence was collected in response to the hoax, none of the people presenting it are presenting it in the context of the hoax - one of the people who is collating is made a one-line throw away about the hoax, and yet you want the defining narrative for all of these people who collected evidence a decade before the hoax even emerged to be the hoax? I just don't understand why you keep pushing this weird idea that is not supported by any evidence. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 21:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then why do you need to keep evidence that isn't tracking/observation? What evidence is not related to the new article besides moon rocks, future plans and moon landings. Why do you need evidence of the moon landings if it doesn't have to do with the hoax? As you said this was collected before the hoax idea came up, So no one then needed evidence, because they all knew it happened. Did they post on the source "Hey we got evidence that nasa put a man on the moon, even though we already know they did", or "We saw/tracked the apollo (#) mission"? And Gravitor, the merge with the hoax is still open, so it could merge with the hoax (so the idea isn't gone yet). Or I could suggest merging the rest into 3-4 different articles, but it was you who said you wanted to keep it together (not split it into 3-4 articles). <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranson03_ab4e.html" title="User:Branson03">Branson03</a> 22:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Why don't you split <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Apollo_b4b9.html" title="Project Apollo">Project Apollo</a> into issues of engineering, moon rocks, personnel etc, and then delete that article? No? Really? Can you really suggest that no one collected evidence before the hoax ideas? If so, where did it all come from? Perhaps you want to make the case that it's all a huge conspiracy? That the folks who observed the orbiters, and have measure the rocks are all in a huge pact to deceive the world? If not, then please don't continue to try to disrupt this legitimate article. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravitor_66a7.html" title="User:Gravitor">Gravitor</a> 08:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
