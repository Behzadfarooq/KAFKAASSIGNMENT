<p><b>Brass Bonanza</b>, also known as the "Hartford Whalers Victory March" was adopted by the <b><a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartford_Whalers_f6a5.html" title="Hartford Whalers">Hartford Whalers</a></b> as their theme song during their tenure in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Hockey_Association_fb62.html" title="World Hockey Association">World Hockey Association</a>, and remained so through their years in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>. It was originally written by Jack Say.</p>
<p>Full versions, game-time versions and ringtones of the song are readily available at <a href="http://www.brassbonanza.com" class="external text" title="http://www.brassbonanza.com" rel="nofollow">BrassBonanza.com</a>, a fansite devoted to the Whalers and the Bonanza.</p>

<p>Jack Say, an aspiring musician, sold a piece of music to a record library and moved to Austria. Former Whalers official George Ducharme came across the piece. According to Ducharme: "It was one of those lucky things," he recalls. "The song was handed to us - arranged and orchestrated - in 1975–1976 and we didn't have to do a thing... "During the second season the team was in Hartford (1975–1976), I began to notice that there was something missing in the atmosphere in the building. We needed something, like a theme song, to add to the excitement when a goal was scored. But coming up with the right song was a different matter," he said. "I had the record at home for a couple of weeks," Ducharme said, "but never played it. Then, one Sunday, we had company over and one of the guests played the record for fun. When I heard the song I knew immediately it was perfect for us." He used it as a "bridge" on a 1976 Whalers highlights LP - the song became a hit, and stuck with the team from then on.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Jacobs of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartford_Courant_c5ec.html" title="Hartford Courant">Hartford Courant</a>, "<a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordie_Howe_0dc3.html" title="Gordie Howe">Gordie Howe</a> once began humming Brass Bonanza in my ear. He said he loved to hear it as a visiting player for the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Aeros_%28WHA%29_d8d1.html" title="Houston Aeros (WHA)">Houston Aeros</a>, but hearing it every night with the Whalers "began to drive me nuts.""</p>

<ul>
<li>Brass Bonanza was played in its entirety minutes before game time of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina_Hurricanes_b4d8.html" title="Carolina Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> second round playoff opener at home against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_Devils_e3e5.html" title="New Jersey Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_6.html" title="May 6">May 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> as the video board showed fans in Whalers jerseys who came to the game.

I can't get it out of my head." David Shoalts, the writer of the article, followed this by saying "This drew a laugh at the Oilers press conference yesterday from those who were around before the Whalers moved here. Almost all of them remember one of the most distinctive, if maddening, bits of music in NHL history."</li>
<li>The song is currently played by the nationally-renowned <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Connecticut_3a36.html" title="University of Connecticut">University of Connecticut</a> Pep Band and Marching Band.
