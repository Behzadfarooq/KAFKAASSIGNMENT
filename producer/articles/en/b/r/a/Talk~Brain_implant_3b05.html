<p>I have read a lot of stories about people that actually believe that they have such an implant (although they have not of course) and are being controlled by other people.

<dd>Sorry, I just found your comment concerning "cyborgs". Let me reply to that. I think the fears are somehow connected though it is right, as you state, that the brain implants that are mostly used don't scare people that much. There are other implants, some of which discussed in the article, which are for <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>, etc. and are feared much the same way as people fear cyborgs. But maybe the paragraph is too blatant.

<p>In the third paragraph there is a link to an article:</p>
<p>"electronic-based neuron transistors for leeches ([5]), control of the movements of rats, etc."</p>
<p>How relevant is that article referred to by [5] to the discussion?

<p>However, prosthesis only refers to the replacement of a *missing* body part, whereas brain implants can refer to either corrective replacements or replacements meant for improvement of a healthy part of the brain. I'm aware that science hasn't quite gotten to that point yet, but still... In the fiction part there's plenty of non-prosthetic brain implants. "Neural prosthesis" is a more popular term than neuroprosthesis anyway. I suggest keeping "Brain Implant" as a page on its own and either linking "Neuroprosthesis" to it or making a separate page for it dealing with just neuro*prosthetics*. -Luuknam</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've seen prosthesis used to refer to any device used to augment human abilities. Usage for replacement limbs is the usage most widely known, but, when prosthetics is under discussion, I've seen even a notepad be referred to as a memory prosthesis. The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language defines prosthetics as "The branch of medicine or surgery that deals with the production and application of <i>artificial</i> body parts [not replacement-Nectarflowed]."<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=prosthetics" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=prosthetics" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> So it does seem like this term can be used for both therapeutic applications as well as future enhancement applications.
<dl>
<dd>I used Merriam Websters, and that one said prostheses were replacements for missing body parts. That's also the context I've always heard it used in.<a href="../../../l/u/u/User%7ELuuknam_b8a5.html" title="User:Luuknam">Luuknam</a></dd>

<dd>A <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_test.html" title="Google test">google test</a> of Neuroprosthetics returns 2300 results, and "Neural prosthetics" returns 1100 results (searching in quotes searchs for the words as a phrase). It should, though, be mentioned that "Neural prosthesis" returns more results than Neuroprosthesis, so there is variance between the different word forms, and both are in professional use (for example <a href="https://www.masimax.com/neuralinterfaces2004/" class="external text" title="https://www.masimax.com/neuralinterfaces2004/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Another term is 'neural interface,' but, in conclusion, I think 'neuroprosthetics' emphasizes that the field is within neuroscience and medicine.

<dd>I don't think a merge is warranted. The brain is only a part of the nervous system. Neuroprosthetics is the more general term, merge <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_implant.html" title="Brain implant">brain implant</a> into there if anywhere. I see nothing wrong with seperate articles; indepth discussion of brain implants(sci-fi, research, futurists) would likely become so large as to drown out the more practical tone of neuroprosthetics(sensory prosthetics, field overview). Also, a brain-computer interface is a non-trivial(ie long article) component of any of these prosthetics. Merging all of these articles together would create a monstrously large page. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntangir_86a8.html" title="User:Intangir">Intangir</a> 20:52, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neuro is not clearer than "brain". C. Elegans neurons can be described by the word "neuro", but "brain" implies a higher evolutionary state. Telencephelon implants would be even better! Brain implants are also not a subset of neural prosthetics. Deep brain stimulation, for example, uses brain implants, but has no prosthetic role. With respect to brain-computer interfaces, all the limiting work currently is having brain implants that work well enough, and understanding the brain well enough to couple it to an external device. The external device, in this case a computer, is the "solved" part of the problem. Also, brain-computer interfaces may be done non-invasively using EEG or MEG technology. It may not work so well, but it is a clear demonstration that brain implants are a distinct entity from brain-computer interfaces. --Animalresearcher 17:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there is some overlap between these two articles. It might be useful if we define the scope of these two articles more clearly and move around some of the information. It is my opinion, and correct me here if I am wrong, that a brain-computer interface is about establishing a communication interface (incoming, outgoing or both) while a brain implant refers to more to a specific type of technology that is inserted into the brain (be it communicating or not, for example, it could be a specific piece of biological tissue that is inserted such as fetal tissue to treat a degenerative disease.) If this distinction is accepted then we could rearrange both articles in this fashion. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 02:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've attempted to clarify the difference between brain implants and BCI (I'd say brain implants are a subset of BCI research). I've also repaired some broken links and attempted to improve the material concerning Jose Delgado after reading a well-researched <a href="http://www.mesolimbic.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.mesolimbic.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf" rel="nofollow">Scientific American</a> article on the topic. I also wonder that there's too much focus on the CIA's 'contribution' to the brain implants and neuro-prosthetics pages, especially in light of recent advances that have been carried out for therapeutic reasons.

<p>I suggest we merge this page with the brain computer interface (BCI) page because brain implants are a subset of this research. Brain implants and non-invasive imaging/EEG type techniques seem to be the two main thrusts of BCI research so there's plenty of scope for duplication between this and the BCI page. The BCI page also has a far larger amount of up-to-date content although I'd say there's scope to make the language more user friendly and improve the formatting. There's also plenty of material in this page that's of dubious provenance.
