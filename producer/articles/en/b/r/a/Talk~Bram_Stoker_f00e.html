<p>Is an academic analysis of Dracula's very obscure supposedly homoerotic themes sufficient evidence to label Stoker as a homosexual or bisexual? Is there any biographical evidence? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 05:05, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Given that Dracula is a monsterus villain it might just as well be used to support the theory that Stoker was homophobic (not that I think he was either mind you) -Adventuresofthestarkiller 03:53, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have removed the paragraph dealing with Schaffer's homoerotic interpretation of <i>Dracula</i>. This is a controversial interpretation of the work from a literary perspective and even more questionable as a commentary on Stoker's life. As it was the only reference to literary interpretation in the article I don't think its inclusion was consistent with NPOV. This material would be better suited to the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dracula.html" title="Dracula">Dracula</a> entry.</p>
<p>I think this article in general dwells overmuch on <i>Dracula</i>, so I hope someone who knows more about Stoker's life and other works can make additions to those areas. <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECKarnstein_6dd0.html" title="User:CKarnstein">CKarnstein</a> 20:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have yet to read a biography (credible or otherwise) that suggested he was homosexual. It would seem unlikely given there isn't any evidence outside of a modern, controversial interpretation of Dracula. His marriage to Florence and the fathering of a child would further militate against the possibility.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Besides the homoerotic literary interpretation of <i>Dracula</i>, some see it subconscious in Stoker's hero worship of the poet <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Whitman_fc20.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> (whom Stoker thanked for the love and sympathy given him "in common with my kind") and the actor <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Irving_d186.html" title="Henry Irving">Henry Irving</a>. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 07:28, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Certainly, it's not unusual to write a letter of admiration to a writer one likes. It's that "in common with my kind" that has people wondering what he was saying to Whitman. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are reading way to much into that phase. Too often we let 21st-century views interpret 19th-century concepts. "My kind" could have been anything - a man, a student, a poetry lover, et al. — 63.167.159.217 12:53, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was added by an anon user who was doing the same for other people on Wikipedia from the same church. I imagine the anon user personally is affiliated with the Church in some way and happens to know this bit of trivia. The problem is it leaves a lot of unanswered questions - was he religious, or did he go occasionally on holidays - is this significant or not? What exactly is Stokers religious background? If you are going to mention it then it needs to be clarified, otherwise it can leave the impression that he was a pious church-going person when he really wasn't (I don't know). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 13:08, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree that mentioning his church membership, and the particular church he attended, implies that he was "a pious church-going person". It is not necessary to go into making judgements about how often he went to church (that information is probably not available), and how personally religious he was (probably no one's business). For an Irishman in the 19th century, one's church affiliation in itself was a social indicator. My only quibble with including the information about his church membership is that it should be placed less awkwardly within the present article. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 16:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Many facts lead to implications. We can't go around removing facts because we aren't sure what inferences might be drawn from them. As for this fact, the religion of a subject is undoubtedly relevant in a biography. If there is more info to add about his religious beliefs then we should add it, but we shouldn't erase all mention because we don't know if it's comprehensive. I agree with Walloon that it could be placed less awkwardly. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because they were stoutly Church of Ireland, Stoker and his family were eligible for a wide range of sectarian advantages, but they were by no means members of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Ascendancy_791b.html" title="Protestant Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a>, or even the true bourgeoisie, to whom their professional-management aspirations must have seemed decidedly arriviste.</dd>

<p>I read somewhere that he was in Golden Dawn, or into Thelema or some other mystic/occult society like those. Anyone know if is true? It would be worth documenting if it's factual.

<dd>It was widley rumored — but never substantiated — that Stoker was a member of the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn_7912.html" title="Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a>, a secret society that practiced ritual magic, founded in 1888 by a London coroner and prominent <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian.html" title="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> Freemason named William Wynn Westcott. . . . According to R. A. Gilbert, historian of the Golden Dawn, Stoker was an outside observer with a number of close friends who were members, and he might have learned about the rituals if they broke the oath of secrecy.</dd>

<p>Hi all, I'm the co-founder and editor of a free on-line journal devoted to Gothic and horror studies. (The Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror Studies) I've been stupid enough to start adding links to relevant pages without realising I was getting messages telling me to stop! I have only added links to pages that were relevant but now I'm wondering should I remove some or should I go to each page's discussion section and post a request to add a link? I'd be grateful if someone could advise. Many thanks.IrishGothicJournal 16:52, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your link look perfectly OK to me. I've had a look at the Irish Gothic site and it is clearly academic in intention and practice - with stuff by respected Eng lit profs and doctors. It's not a pay site, or a promotional site or a shopping site or a restricted membership site, therefore I have no idea why it is being treated as spam. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin4C_4870.html" title="User:Colin4C">Colin4C</a> 18:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
