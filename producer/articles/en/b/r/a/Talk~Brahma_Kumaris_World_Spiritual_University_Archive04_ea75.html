<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request to shorten the PBK section and start their own page</span></h2>
<p>I have a request to shorten the PBK section and start their own page. The current entry is rather long and we could add more <b>Bibliography/References</b> to the article if we had more space available. I am not asking that they be deleted...only shortened and the full entry moved to their page with more room to expand on it there. This would also allow for photos to be added which would make the article more engaging. PEACETalkAbout 17:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>As far as I understand the PBKs have such a problem with BK members the leadership of the BKWSU shutting down their websites, going out of there way to discredit and persecute them that that they cant be bothered to develop it. It is a tense scene out in India between the two parties. They are no way as rich as the BKWSU.</dd>

<dd>BTW, as a matter of form new comments go at the bottom and the order is not changed otherwsie they might be missed.</dd>

<p>Your attempted analysis of my motives is both innacurate and not relevant.</p>
<p>Given your initial response, my prediction is that I would find dialogue with you unenjoayble and unproductive, so I leave the issue for someone else to tackle. I'll check back from time to time and see how well your defense of the page as it stands is holding up! <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 10:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Searchin Man complaint</span></h2>
<p>The email which I posted above dated August 21, 2006 has been modified. It now reads as if I was invited to post back at the forum, <a href="http://brahmakumaris.info/bb/" class="external text" title="http://brahmakumaris.info/bb/" rel="nofollow">brahmakumaris.info</a>. I have been trying to log on into the site several times since I was banned, ...I would like to share my lyrics too..but unfortunately it is another false statement. BTW, are you going to buy the .mobi TLD&#160;? Better hurry up...</p>
<p>So now everyone knows my name, former work place (sorry I cannot use the University computers to post,I have another job) Did you enjoy the USF site? but that is not malicious, you just made a simple google search to find out more about me...Well, <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> look forward to posting again in the site.. another lie from you will really discredit you....</p>

<dd>Dear,Avyakt7 aka Riveros11</dd>
<dd>64.156.25.3 Oh, are you Searchin man too?,</dd>
<dd>I will write the Admin one last time since you seem to miss the interaction and perhaps it will keep your duality in check by being just Avyakt7 there. Community seems to be a deep loss to those in transition. As stated before, please use this page only for article issues and not forum issues. I did provide the official BK forum link for you. Did you join? I hope that you get others support to allow for your timely return. In the mean time keep churning and play nice. PeaceTalkAbout 23:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Bud, looks like there's sockpuppets galore operating on this discussion. Where about are you posting the complaint to the wiki admin Talkabout? Don't forget to get <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a>=Brahmakumaris.info checked as well, I'm absolutely certain you will have much more luck with I.P resolution there.

<dd>Yup, ignore God making all those 1976 <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_the_World_07b4.html" title="End of the World">End of the World</a> predictions, the senior sisters covering up the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abuse.html" title="Child abuse">child abuse</a>, keep up the <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks guys - and don't whatever you do ask to see the un-editing copies of the Murlis. Especially, those between 1969 and 1976. This is all becoming very good factual account of the real face of the BKWSU today.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But tell me, are you going to meet God, the Supreme Soul, possessing and speaking through the old India lady Gulzar this "Double Foreigner" season at Mount Abu&#160;? I am wondering if we need to correct the stuff about God Shiva possessing and being channelled through Gulzar as it says, <b>"Should Shiva Baba enter the body of a pure virgin? But there is no such rule. After all Father, how can He mount a virgin?"</b> in the Murli dated 15 October 1969. Can you check this please? Does that means that it is NOT God that is possessing Gulzar and speaking the Avyakt Murlis? If it is not, who is it that all the BK Raja Yogis are going to meet and having yoga with?</dd>

<dd>2.I am already a member of that site you sent me, which is a BK site. "Ex-I" is acting maliciously by disclosing my full personal information. He is not the only computer person around and I could get his full name,and other information which he is trying to protect...., but I will not (You can breathe deepely now, .244.) How about Godaddy.com? for kicks... <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> play nice, my friend. This is related with the article in question, because it shows that .244 is abusing this site and going against some of the wikipedia rules and regulations. All I have done is to find out that <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> and Ex-I are the same person and that he stated untrue statements to BK Simon. Oh, Btw, I didn't do a google search to get that.</dd>

He bragged about all along that "I run away" from his site. He is not giving me the chance to post there again because it is not convenient for him. As far as wikipedia, anyone could post here and make any changes. Changing IP addresses is not a problem.</dd>

<dd>4. Just for the record, I am not "Searchin man," and I will not lie about this. I am a Brahmin soul and I have no interest in anything else but to see an accurate article about the Brahma Kumaris in Wikipedia. As it stands right now, there is a lot to be worked on. That's all PeaceTalkAbout, waiting to hear from "that" admin... oh, yeah.. He knows my email (as everyone else now)so he can reach me via email to avoid any further delays.</dd>

<dd>One point that I do believe needs to be corrected is the founder's proper occupation. I will gather the information one posted as I have verified this with several sources now and it would appear that it needs to be corrected. This was posted in along with some that are arbitrary (well semantics). The following was submitted by 88.110.105.125&#160;:<b>Formed in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindh.html" title="Sindh">Sindh</a>, now <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, during 1937 by wealthy diamond merchant, Dada Lekraj, whose customers included royalty. He was a devout Hindu and had 12 gurus. After many years of devotion Dada Lekraj</b>. My sources confirm that this indeed was the case and as in any business, not all jewelers can trade in diamonds, only a select few. This distinction is also warranted as it also shows that he was from a wealthy family in say contrast with <b>Jesus</b>. <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindh.html" title="Sindh">Sindh</a>, being the upper business class and influential in society.</dd>

<dd>As to the OZ site well I would have to agree that the most intellectual thing posted there is the <b>Thought for the Day</b>. So, hopefully some of the other active BKs will pledge for you, so that you can return to the info site. By playing nice I am only noting that the PBKs under Arjun seem to get along wonderfully and so I do believe you too can get along in the sand box of the forum. So, place all bad thoughts away as a <b>Brahmin</b> soul and with good thoughts all Brahmins will get along.</dd>

Talkabout! Good of you to take the time out to communicate Bud. Why up to now you’d been dismissing me right out of hand as a nasty sock puppet. Glad to see the change of heart. Sorry Bud, no idea what your saying here. -. “<i>I would like to point out I did varify on thing and yes it would appear to be true albeit not in the best wording...as one could conjure many things from said words</i>.” - Please clarify for me.</p>
<p>Got to say Bud, finding it very difficult to see you as a self confessed ‘monitor of this article for vandalism’. Certainly your vigilance don’t extent to this discussion page, or you’d surely be more up for complaining to the Wiki Admin?</p>
<p>Seems like it has to take a part-timer like myself to drop in once in a while to catch <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> in the act of pruning and modifying what other contributors have said, to what he would prefer them to have said. Let me tell you Bud, this sort of behaviour may go down just a treat on his own brahmakumaris.info forum but it has no place whatsoever on a Wiki discussion page.</p>
<p>And yet Talkabout Bud, it can get worse! Naturally I restore the discussion to it’s original condition, where upon <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> reverts it to his version and then uses my own Talk page as a forum to publicly disclose personal information on Avyakt7 Riveros11 and then he really lays it on rich by attempting to further threaten me if I ‘don’t play by the Wiki rules’. I mean that last statement alone just kills me Bud. What sort of rules has the guy been reading!</p>
<p>And then ofcourse don’t forget the sock puppetry. - <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> aka BrahmaKumaris.info. Again something people are seemingly prepared to put up with on the BrahmaKumaris.info forum, but the disciplining of those who hide behind multiple identities on a wiki page is something I <b>do</b> know you will strongly agree with me on? Awaiting your comment Bud</p>

<dd><b>What I raised on <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESearchin_man_e1aa.html" title="User:Searchin man">searchin man</a> discussion page, here; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Searchin_man" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Searchin_man" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Searchin_man</a> was the following. I am still waiting for either of them to refure any of these core BKWSU facts and beliefs and say, no, they are not true</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>why the BKWSU were at pains to cover up the Child Sex Abuse ring operating in at least two of Indian centers, including the headquarters of Madhuban, that sexually abused a number of young girls?</li>
<li>why the pedophiles that committed these crimes were not reported to the police and brought to justice as, say, the Roman Catholic has finally starting to do?</li>
<li>why they were allowed to remain in their positions for several years despite the problems being known?</li>
<li>why they attempt to re-write the BKWSU sex abuse incident as a mere allegation rather than an actual incident and blame it on the child?</li>
<li>why the BKWSU took great pains at a teachers training session in the Oxford Global Retreat Centre to attempt to cover up any connection between child sex abuse and the BKWSU - WITHOUT INFORMING THE BKWSU RAJA YOGA TEACHERS THAT SEXUAL ABUSE HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE? Noting that the BKWSU even wrote this down on the handouts.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I pointed out that Avyakt7 <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">Riveros11</a> believes and teaches - which is what the BKWSU behind the facade is really all about - that;
<ul>
<li>dinosaurs lived 2,500 years ago,</li>
<li>that evolution is a constantly repeating and identical 5,000 year cycle (which God used to teach it was going to be all over in 1975/76)</li>
<li>in less than 30 years we will be making babies without having sex, indeed that baby Krishna must be on his way any day now</li>
<li>that 6 Billion are going to die during a Nuclear Holocaust to make way for their heaven on earth (although God used to teach there were only 5 Billion human souls)</li>
<li>God possesses a little old Indian lady to meet his superior Brahmin caste only,</li>
<li>everyone else on the planet are Shudras.</li>
<li>I am surprised that they wanted to bring all this stuff up on this discussion page. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 02:05, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>You know Bud, I had harboured the faint hope I might hear from Talkabout, but seems like the ubiquitous 195.82.106.244 will have to do. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a>', I don’t quite recall asking you to throw ever more of your queries about the BK on my Talk page any more than the abuse that accompanied them, and I certainly didn’t ask for them to be regurgitated here.</dd>
<dd>In any event I am not a BK, but I <b>am</b> someone who has taken a pile of spiritual benefit through association with the BK. I would also say that I’ve found spiritual insight elsewhere too including mainstream Christianity. However this has usually not been without the subtle underhand pressure to ‘convert’. Something that refreshingly, I have never experienced with the BK. You can come and go at will, take what you want, leave what you don’t.</dd>
<dd>You seem to believe that it is essential that the every detail of the BK philosophy remains entirely consistent with what it was as you experienced it first hand, which from your postings on the brahmakumaris.info forum, I reckon is at least 20 years ago. Where as I believe group spirituality as with an individuals’ spirituality should be allowed space to evolve.</dd>
<dd>The reason I have entered this discussion is because currently you alone, are responsible for almost all the content of the wiki listing on the BK. As many others have commented before me, I do not at all consider this a remotely satisfactory state of affairs, as your views are so jaundiced and the methods you use to ensure their total dominance are so deceitful, that quite frankly Bud, I would give my support to <b>anyone</b> that attempts to challenge you with a more reasonable and balanced stance.</dd>
<dd>Currently if anyone attempts more than the most trivial change to the wiki entry it immediately gets pulled down and the ‘perpetrator’ (unless of course it’s <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a>') is invited to discuss before making changes. When I first checked in around the end of August, the <i>‘Some inaccuracies in the article’</i> section was well under way.</dd>
<dd>It came to an abrupt closure when 89.240.134.193/84.13.205.142 had his NPOV warning and citation request pulled down within hours if not minutes. His final posting in the discussion was then deleted by <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a>, only to be restored by myself a month later, and even that only after an abusive and threatening encounter with <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a>.</dd>
<dd>And just finally I notice <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> has just added some references under ‘<i>OM Mandali banned by Hindu pressure during Partition’</i>. Am I to assume this is a belated counter to bkSimonb’s argument that that community moved to India at the request of relatives?</dd>
<dd>Whatever the case it is a <b>complete</b> misinterpretation of what the references actually say. In fact, they wholly support Simon’s point that the resistance and court injunctions against Om Mandali occurred shortly after the Yagya relocated to Karachi in 1937, not in 1950.</dd>
<dd>Talkabout it’s gone all <i>Silentabout</i> your end, but I’m asking you again Buddy, surely you can see clearly now that <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> is utterly unsuited to any further involvement in the editing of this Wikipedia article?</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Fist point</b>, "89.240.134.193/84.13.205.142 had his NPOV warning and citation request" This was pulled by me as the Bibliography/References are available and was simply not warranted.</li>
<li><b>Second point</b>, it would appear that this page is harder to work on than say the Iraq War page due to the personalisation for the purpose of discouraging folks to participate. See, one can discuss a point without arguing the <b>point</b>.</li>
<li><b>Third Point</b>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> is not vandalising the discussion page. If you check you will see he is a little <b>detail oriented</b> on the wiki process, which I some times fall outside the lines and disregard. He wants it to look just right as per the wiki rules. Must be some left over post BK thing. No wonder this individual followed and continues to understand the BK philosophy. So, if I don't add enough&#160;:::: I later see it has been corrected.</li>
<li><b>Fourth point</b>, the article has had input and is checked by many recent ExBKs including Mr.Green, and others. Please don't make it seem as though it is just a few, as many have contributed to this page.</li>
<li>'<i>Fifth point<b>, I am personally thinking that perhaps you should keep the personal</b> song and dance between you and <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> on your discussion pages</i> and duel it out there. I take the time to contribute to other pages and see my time not spent wisely when I have to monitor this type of thing:” I won't argue the point, just tell <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> to leave the sand box...(paraphrasing here)". This is your intent, is it not?</li>
<li><b>Six point</b>, as pointed out by you; you are a part-timer and not one that followed the BK teachings in ernest. So, I would have to review points argued and check them, then side with the correct point. I do corrections and I have had to make my PEACE upon learning when siding too quickly with another and later having to eat my hat for doing so. Today I am not as quick.</li>
<li><b>Seven Point</b>, the personal <b>Attacks</b> and I have come to that conclusion are without merit. It would be the Old Poisoning the Well in logic and it doesn't bode well here. If you want to go toe to toe on points here than do so, without carrying on about the forums etc. Forums and site issues must be argued there. Please join one and start a thread there. You may even engage say "AndyH" if you are so lucky. One can dream.</li>
<li><b>Eigth point</b>, I actually have great admiration for Avyakt7 <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">Riveros11</a> in that he is a <b>thinker</b> and is trying in all ernest to validate the cycle and put others questions to rest. This is more than I have seen from others that simply accept and go argue incessantly without trying to using logic, just dogma. I can appreciate that he has even developed a theory albeit with no science to prove it, but impressive!</li>
<li><b>Ninth point</b>, let us get back to the discussion that would lead us to an outcome and drop all the non sequiturs.TalkAbout AKA <i>SilentAbout</i> <b>:)</b> PEACE <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkAbout_6f36.html" title="User:TalkAbout">TalkAbout</a> 16:26, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(b) Ah interesting, so there is a behind the scenes ex-bk proof reading team? And by Mr Green, would that be user <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen108_7f29.html" title="User:Green108">Green108</a> on the discussion page archive?

<dd>Nice of you to reply point by point. I do thank you for the change in tone as I rather enjoy logical discussions. The light hearted approach is refreshing as in any discussion it helps to laugh; especially when we find out we are wrong! I will do the research and provide a reply. Here is a bit of homework for you since you know BkSimon, which Imam gave said edict which he mentioned. This may provide some opening in the point of discussion he so wished to open and I imagine he has been busy as he hasn’t returned.</dd>

See, I receive no favors there, so I am in neutral territory and to answer the question yes I do rely on research or other sources but like the jailed reporters I will not reveal my sources. The point which you did not address but requested earlier, is the Murli point….correct but the word usage of “Mounting a Virgin” in modern day language could be misunderstood.

<dd>There is the story of a builder, with whom no one raised a question. One day the man set out to build a very large building and kept saying Right, the crew repeated Right and the final crew member told the builder Right! Well, at the end of the day they found themselves inside a circle…not a square (no door to be found) and unable to get out. Finally they raised a question, discussed their problem, compromised and one stood on another and hoisted the third man out. The moral here is, if we agreed upon every thing from a BK point of view we too would find ourselves in a circle (Advertisement/Self Promotion) and unable to tell truth from belief. I have respect for an individuals beliefs but hold more dear the idea of the Right to Information.</dd>

<dd><b>Point of information before I respond</b>; you state "publicly exposing my friends and family". I only mentioned Luis Riveros use of his workplace computers to promote the religious cult he is a member of which is against the University of South Florida's regulations. Is he - because it was not "they" as you state - your <b>friend</b> or your <b>family</b>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The thing about the <b>objective facts</b> of history is that they do not change whether they are last week or 100 years ago. As someone that has sat down and read years worth of Jagdish Chander's works, which I am pretty sure you have not, to call him a "historian" is laughable. He was the Vishwa Vidyala's publicist. Adi Dev is PR.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Jagdish Chander was a historian, why ever did he write out of history - and Adi Dev - the failed 1976 End of the World/Destruction prediction? Lekhraj Kirpalani's attempt to give away all the money in the Yagya to the Government of India if the predictions did fail etc? Why did Jagdish Chander engage in the re-writing of Gyan [BKWSU's Knowledge] and the Yagya's history from that date along with the other Seniors including the re-editing of the Murlis (God's Words)? Did you ever go to Morning Class? If you doubt any of these facts, go back to Waddy and check them out. She is perfect aware of them and the re-writing.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And, lastly, before you go ahead call everybody "Bud", Bud, get to grips with whether you are talking to a man or a woman. Frankly, I am finding your sexually patronizing, body-consciousness fixation with me a little offensive, in the same manner as a pestering drunk at a bar.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Corporeal Founder's occupation and Lekhraj’s business partner, Sevak Ram,</span></h2>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>well, thank goodness someone can actually ask intelligent questions about factual content instead of continuing on the unsubstantiated slur against me.</p>
<p>With regards to the corporeal founder's occupation, here is a picture of the actually premises in Calcutta that Lekhraj Kirpalani did business from;</p>

<p>I am not so sure about all of the hyperbole. It does not really look that big or glamorous a location [ and it is only one unit in the block not even ground floor]. FYI, Sindh is a geographic area not caste. Sindhis are only Hindis that live in the Sindh/Pakistan and of any caste. He and they are not upper class, the Bhaiband were merchants, which makes them 3rd class [although the caste sysem is more complex than the 4 castes the BKs make believe], had a reputation from being misogynistic and debauched, and were into money primarily. I have citations. There is a old Gujerati saying that, "if you are walking along a road and meet a <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra.html" title="Cobra">Cobra</a> snake and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhi.html" title="Sindhi">Sindhi</a>, kill the Sindhi first". If it is a big issue and has to change, we need to get to primary sources and not just BKWSU PR. I bet most BK don't know half of what is up there.</p>
<p>Lekhraj may have been atypically religious but the fact is he was a business man and not a out of a religious caste. It appears that he was also self-made and not out of a rich family. It might be important to say that he was not not poor or ordinary because the Murlis say the chariot of God was. This is a controversial issue that the PBKs will raise at some point. The predictions suggest that Lekhraj was not the first nor the final medium of Shiva and the BKWSU have written out of history Lekhraj’s business partner, Sevak Ram who also played a part in the founding of the Yagya.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we get to actual figures of his wealth and size of estate? The BKWSU are quiet on that front. It could be public record and family of his still alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I think it is such a non-issue. What is so bad about being in business? It is the fact. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 01:49, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>First point</b>, the HP Shack is not called a shack albeit it isn't a full garage. It is called a garage, many have seen the photo and realise that it may very well be impossible to park a car there but it is still called garage. My point being is that in those times that may well have been an illustrious business location for the founder. After all the term location, location is termed by the position and the money/business one can make in said location.</dd>
<dd><b>Second Point</b>, his daughter wore a sari once and discarded it off to the servants. This was a story told in the early days by the Elder Brothers and thus illustrates his wealth. A sari being six yards long and if made of the finest silk could pass through a ring without any effort.</dd>
<dd><b>Third point</b>, not every jeweler can trade in diamonds....please check this. I do believe it has merit, the photos do show that he was very well groomed and not your average business man.</dd>

<dd>We are talking about India around the turn of the 19th/20th Century. I have no idea if they had a Diamond Bourse in Calcutta or any business regulations whatsoever. Calcutta was only one outlet, where else did he trade from? I think it is a non-issue. Lekhraj was a businessman and so that sticks. Personally, I think a proper biography would be very interesting but, in my opinion, the BKWSU are just too busy re-writing him as a dead saint or guru to want to bother document the human aspect, his relationship with Sevak Ram and Sevak's part in the evolution of the organization etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example, why all those angelic pictures of Lekhraj despite Shiva's Murlis saying "no pictures"&#160;? Its a contradiction of their faith.

<p>So, perhaps we need to drop this and go on to the questions/discussions at hand. Oh, Avyakt7 I just want to say that if we cool it for a bit, things will get back to some semblance of reason here.

<p>Here is my second warning to you and thus , I will add the required tag "np3" Please do not make personal attacks on other people. Wikipedia has a policy against <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attacks</a>. In some cases, users who engage in personal attacks may be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> from editing by administrators or <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">banned</a> by the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">arbitration committee</a>.

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki</a> /WP:NPA#Consequences “Posting a link to an external source that fits the commonly-accepted threshold for a personal attack, in a manner that incorporates the substance of that attack into Wikipedia discussion.” I do not appreciate either that you suggest that I could have written an article about Hitler. I will follow the steps that are stipulated in Wikipedia about this matter.</p>
<p>You have also changed the original title posted by TalkAbout. It was “UN intervention for <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a>.”</p>

<dd><b>Yes, that is correct. I checked and there was no intervention on behalf of the United Nations - and it was an attempt at personal Mediation - and so I corrected that.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, this also raises the issue of BKWSU own exaggerated connection with the United Nations - of which the United Nations has cautioned the BKWSU - and that is an issue that we ought to investigate with proper citations at a later date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you read above, you will see that I clearly did not "suggest that I could have written an article about Hitler", I stated accurately that someone using the same IP address as you contributed the article on Adolf Hitler. As it is an educational facility that you work in, I suggested that you raise the serious misuse of IT equipment to the faculty members.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it is a personal attack, would that also not mean that what you started and are continuing to doing is also an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack designed to discredit any critical revellations based on citation, e.g. references to your own comments on "the bombs are ready ... they will be used" etc?</dd>

<dd>I think that it is fairly clear to onlookers that where you are coming from and what you are attempting to do. Your belief in a 5,000 year Cycle of time and "Destruction" as defined by the BKWSU. You start and continue an attack and then accuse another's defense to that attack using legalistic argument targetting the individual to distract for the internal reports they are leaking. It is very common cultic behavior and I caution you to refer back to your Senior Sisters for Shrimat before proceeing with this matter because ultimately it will only reflect badly on the organization, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology#Controversy_and_criticism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology#Controversy_and_criticism" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

I know you can edit things out whenever you wish.. Do I need to ask you for permission to do the same?</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> expressed that he didn’t have no affiliation with BKinfo. I am certain that that is not true. I have substantial evidence for this. Do you want me to disclose it? This information is relevant to this wikipedia article, since it demonstrates that <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> is not a “non-biased” editor and thus, 244 is not qualified to write about Brahma Kumaris in an impartial manner. I needed to disclose that information here because is relevant to this article.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> discloses my real full name here and in another user talk page, threatens to contact the faculty at USF (my previous employer), searches and publishes about my personal information which is non relevant to this article.

<dd>Look if you want to continue this, I imagine I can not stop you. As far as to any membership in a forum being a reason for disqualifying him/her from participating in activities on wikipedia I would like to point out the following. No individual is to be singled out...sussed out as a means to discredit his/her participation on a wiki. They could very well be members of the Gay BK forum and it wouldn’t make a grand difference here. Discuss the points here, point by point. Forum issues take to the forum, go to the OZ forum, go to the infogami blog.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>From my point, I see there is no real open space for discussion in the OZ forum run by the BKs which you are a member of.</li>
<li>I don't see your theory up there (OZ forum), nor it being discussed by other members.</li>
<li>It appears to me that other active BKs are doing well and good in the BKinfo forum. It serves not only XBKs, but PBKs, active BKs , folks seeking spiritual discussions and NBKs (folks just wanting information, including journalists).</li>
<li>So, if they have a wide array of folks, why the problems? I did put in a second request to have you approved, but I will send in another asking it to be withdrawn given your goal, which would be to have individuals banned from wikipedia.</li>
<li>I see that the problems on the forum and Here started when you began to pick/squabble with other members on both venues.</li>
<li>I see that despite the fact that you bit off more than you can chew, you are still dead set on this (personalising things).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Do you think it would be fair to remove yours but leave his/hers up? Will you refrain from further activities to <b>EXPOSE</b> others. This is going the way of scientology in my view. I don't think threatening exposure, attacking the person rather than the substance/points merits well from a scholarly point of view and <b>it is destructive to the process of communication/participation and good will.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have the highest respect for people following their spiritual beliefs, having gone down that road myself and this process is to place the facts out there and let the individual decide on the path they are taking or if they want to continue on such path. Is also an information source for people on a global level that seek information on said organization. You shouldn't fear information, you shouldn't be fearful of the tenets being in the open, nor the practices. The higher road would be for example: <b>Yes, we do belief we will be deities and yes we believe X and Y.</b> Rather than trying to hide the sun with your thumb. <i>Suppression of information is not wise nor a scholarly path.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>I will ask you these three questions directly:</b></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Do you believe you will be a deity?</li>
<li>Do you believe you are superior to others here on this planet because you are a Brahmin Soul?</li>
<li>Do you believe God speaks/is channeled via Dadi Gulzar in Mt. Abu?</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">First Warning and answer</span></h2>
<p>1.Points: It should be no doubt now that user 195.82.106.244 is clearly and undoubtedly involved with a forum which is antagonistic to Brahma Kumaris, thus this article for which he or she is the main contributor and is clearly biased. Please demonstrate that user .244 the main author of this BK page is not affiliated with BKINFO. Because if HE IS: Then as the NPOV tags show: a)This article is bias. Please demonstrate the opposite. b)This article is using plenty of "weasel words" such as: "B.K.s believe that their god " Shiva Baba ","mediumistic female followers known as " Sandeshputris " or trance messengers helped add to their spiritual knowledge through psychic visions and allegedly direct contact with God.", "The version made more vague and palatable to Westerners is found here." This just an small sample on the first paragraph.The use of these words are non-scholar and bias; inappropriate for an on-line encyclopedia.</p>
<p>c)The article about BK does not comply with VERIFIABILITY according to WIKIPEDIA rules: "Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources. Articles should cite these sources whenever possible." Please show the citations. DO not use BK literature for this, since it does not fit this requirement: ("We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a reliable publisher. See Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Verifiability") and (Use sources who have postgraduate degrees or demonstrable published expertise in the field they are discussing. The more reputable ones are affiliated with academic institutions. The most reputable have written textbooks in their field: these authors can be expected to have a broad, authoritative grasp of their subject. In general, higher education textbooks are frequently revised and try to be authoritative.) Please demonstrate this in your article use these kind of citations rather than websites which do not follow this requirement. In your article to put something like: "Use of Violence: The sight of heavy stick wielding BK “brothers” is a common sight at large BK events. Police reports exist of said BKs kidnapping PBKs in cars, removing them to a distant location and “beating them black and blue”. In one incident, PBKs were beaten so “mercilessly” that they had to be admitted in hospital. In others even elderly women were manhandled. As similar events have taken place across India from Karnatak to Haryana. Police complaints were been filled, the BKs in one incident plea-bargaining in response..." and to put a link to a BKINFO site violates this rule, you are not using reliable sources as defined by WIKIPEDIA and it is obviously malicious.</p>
<p>These are just examples. Please respond to them. By taking the NPOV tag off the article, you are not following WIKIPEDIA rules. This is a warning to you. It will be followed up with WIkipedia admins if you don't stop this vandalism.</p>

<p>OK Brahmin soul...I will <b>State</b> your case. Frankly, the OZ forum site was useless to me. No thinkers or perhaps not allowed to think. Now, as I concentrate here on what wisdom I shall plead for you, I first want an agreement that you will behave....as far as I can see <b>Brother</b> this is not <b>Deity</b> behavior by any means. I have great respect for BKsimon and others. I guess you have noted that even some heavy hitters from the BK World have joined.

<p>Talkabout, I'm afraid it is you who is not addressing the discussion - see 'Searchin Man Complaint' section. This article is clearly under the control of a vandal and sockpuppeteer.

<p>Dear Talkabout,</p>
<pre>
This is Avyakt7. Please have .244 address all issues regarding the Brahma Kumaris talk page.
It is clear now that  user .244 has been misrepresenting facts.
<b>Please do not try to go around this issue.'</b><i> This is very important.</i>
If you continue taking the NPOV tag off the article you will be setting an example of vandalism.
Yourself and .244 are not the only ones who can edit this page. An NPOV warning is not even changing
the contents of the biased Brahma Kumaris article, it is just stating that some of us do not agree
with it and that we would like to reach a consensus about it. Enough proof has been given.

Please check out this Wikipedia official policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a></p>
<p>Please note:” This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying.”</p>
<p>Your actions and ways clearly fit the above.</p>
<p>User <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> is the main editor of this article which refers to Brahma Kumaris. User 195.82.106.244 is against this institution (Brahma Kumaris.)</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicion that <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> also posts as “Ex-L” in another forum, namely brahmakumaris.info. Ex-L, and most of the others on the forum including the administrator who write the news articles, are clearly against Brahma Kumaris as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, user <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> should not be allowed to have “sole proprietorship” of this article, as he or she appears to be trying very hard to maintain, which in fact is hurting the Brahma Kumaris institutional image.</p>
<p><b>User <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> has denied in this page any involvement with the Brahmakumaris.info (BKINFO) site. However, consider this: (Evidence from circumstancial to strong</b>)</p>
<p>1)The writing style of “Ex-L” and compare it with <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> writing style.</p>
<p>2)There is an email which was sent by BKINFO to Brahma Kumaris centers requesting for copies of the organization “scriptures” (Murlis). The email header is below: <b>Please note the source of it. (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a></b></p>

<p><b>My point is: It should be no doubt now that user <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> is clearly and undoubtedly involved with a forum which is antagonistic to Brahma Kumaris, thus this article for which he or she is the main contributor and is clearly biased.</b></p>
<p>These are the facts as I see them.</p>
<p>THEREFORE, after reading Wikipedia standards: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial#Neutral_language" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial#Neutral_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_tutorial#Neutral_language</a></p>

<p>"When all NPOV-related issues detailed on the talk page have been handled, the template should be removed from the article or category page. In most cases, however, the least cumbersome way of handling NPOV concerns would be to improve the article or the category description, so that it is no longer POV."</p>
<p>Thus: Please take a look at this link:</p>

  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view</a>

</pre>
<p>AND the article is discussed here by consensus to dismiss the tags below, NPOV tags need to be placed in this article. NPOV tags will be placed in the Brahma Kumaris article which I will revert back as many times as necessary if changed until further proof is shown in this talk page. This is necessary in order not to mislead readers by making them believe that this is in fact an accurate description of Brahma Kumaris. The following tags are appropriate for this article:</p>
<ul>

<p>User .244 has not observed wikipedia standards. These are the points which user <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> has been neglecting:</p>
<pre>
   * Biased or selective representation of sources, eg:
         o Explaining why evidence supports one view, but under-representing (even deleting) opposing views in order to make an opinion appear more accepted/rejected than it really is.
         o Making one's own opinion look superior by omitting points against it, comparing it instead with low quality arguments for other POV's (strawman tactics), or not presenting the other as best it can be.
         o Finding fault with some opposing evidence (usually the easiest to attack, and often not a neutral assessment), and using that (again as a strawman) to dismiss or ignore other (often stronger) evidence.
         o Selectively citing a source or ignoring important caveats and limitations, in order to make a source appear to support a view or conclusion that is more extreme than the plain reading of the source implies. (Ie, trying to make a source say more than it actually says)
   * Variable or double standards, eg:
         o Citing lower quality evidence for one side but rejecting credible opposing evidence as inadequate.
         o Minimizing, trivializing or ignoring other citations that call one's opinion into question or that support alternative views.
   * Editing as if one given opinion is "right" and therefore other opinions either have no substance, or nothing to defend themselves with, and using this as a reason to under-represent it:
         o Generalizing an opinion held by "some" or "many" as if it is held by "all" (or "all credible") sources, while treating an opposing view as not being held by anyone credible.
         o Ignoring an opposing view, question or discussion point on the basis that those upholding it are claimed to be misinformed.
         o Not allowing one view to "speak for itself", or refactoring its "world-view" into the words of its detractors.
         o Ignoring or deleting views, research or information from sources which would usually be considered credible and verifiable in Wikipedia terms. (This may be done on spurious grounds such as not being "valid enough")
         o Concealing or misrepresenting (or non-neutrally representing) relevant information about sources or sources' credentials that is needed to judge their value.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverting NPOV warning</span></h2>
<p>Please note that an NPOV warning means that the neutrality of the article is disputed and is not a statement as to whether the article is or isn't neutral in itself. It is very clear from this discussion page that there is a dispute about the neutrality of the article and it is therefore inappropriate to remove the warning box from the article. The box should remain until all sides reach a consensus or a decision is made through arbitration. Any attempt to tamper with the box otherwise is an act of vandalism.</p>

<dd>Here is my reply.</dd>
<dd>I do not want to know, how you gained access to the site. I am only interested in discussion of the points, not any thing else. I don't have personal issues with you but I have tried to be of help to no end. Now, I won't reveal the back workings here, but I think from an academic point this approach is not wise. I do think it is of no point to discuss private matters in public, but I think you get the gist. Please do not contact me via e-mail to try and suss out who I know or what my interest is.</dd>
<dd>Since you are using multiple IPPs and I can't trust even with whom I am having discussions with...<i>duality moment here</i>. As to being insulted, please give a good explanation of what is going on here. The attempt to erase the facts, choosing to continue in arguments rather than discuss the points. I have had a better time in discussions of medicine than here. I don't want to waste my time in engaging in attacks of the person rather than the issues. So, unless you are going to take up a point to discuss (other than individuals) than I have no further communication. <b>The idea of the technology team being based in FLORIDA is not lost on me.</b> I am willing to state the following:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Do you believe you will be a deity? <b>No, I do not.</b></li>
<li>Do you believe you are superior to others here on this planet because you are a Brahmin Soul? <b>No, I don't see my self as superior to others.</b></li>
<li>Do you believe God speaks/is channeled via Dadi Gulzar in Mt. Abu? <b>No, I do not, I think the PBKs are onto some thing, in that GOD can be found in your own room.</b> See, not hard at all to do! As, to trying to have me <b>BLOCKED</b> when the TEAM is in working to place NPOVs yet admitting that they are not questioning the validity...is too transparent. I will start meditating and ask that some force of Eternal Peace come upon this approach soon. <b>As I have stated in the past, if after someone has the facts and chooses the PATH, I have nothing but respect for them and give them my full blessings/good thoughts/Be honored in that they are true to their quest.</b> My background you see is in the freedom and access to information....that is the only GRAND motivating factor here. <b>Be true to your beliefs!</b> PEACE/LOVE/PEACE <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkAbout_6f36.html" title="User:TalkAbout">TalkAbout</a> 00:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I <i>am</i> a long-time Wikipedian, and an admin, and I want this page to move toward an acceptable encyclopedia article. The reasons for the NPOV and other tags must be delineated, no matter how blindingly obvious someone might think the reasons are. Those issues must then be addressed, either by proper citations, or by removing unsubstantiated claims from the article. The real-world identity or beliefs of <i>any</i> of the contributors to this article are completely irrelevant. This discussion/talk page is <b>not</b> the appropriate place to discuss those questions. <b>Use this page to discuss the encyclopedia article only.</b> –<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">RHolton</a><a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERholton_ce4f.html" title="User talk:Rholton"><b><font size="3">≡</font></b></a>– 01:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have restored the POV tag to the article. Do not remove it until things have been resolved. The other tags may also be restored if specific reasons are shown--but in general, one tag at a time seems sufficient. –<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">RHolton</a><a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERholton_ce4f.html" title="User talk:Rholton"><b><font size="3">≡</font></b></a>– 02:34, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RHolton, thanks for dropping by and I really appreciate you restoring the NPOV tag. It’s a small step towards fairness, but if it survives the night then it will be a significant one, as it will easily be the most substantial edit to do so other than that made by 244 or Talkabout, since I’ve been looking in.</dd>
<dd>I am not best placed to discuss the article content. I am not a member of the BK nor an ex member. However, my support for the NPOV was because others who were qualified to contest the articles content and attempted to do so, where either stonewalled by proven sockpuppets or had their comments removed from the discussion section and their citation requests pulled down. I have supplied detailed links of examples of where I saw this happening, in a 9 point reply to the user Talkabout in the <i>Searchin Man complaint</i> section of the Sept – Oct 2006 discussion archive. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESearchin_man_e1aa.html" title="User:Searchin man">searchin man</a> 03:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
