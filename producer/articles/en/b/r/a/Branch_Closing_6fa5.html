<p><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Halpert_7075.html" title="Jim Halpert">Jim</a> is using the Stamford fax machine as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Filippelli_2b56.html" title="Karen Filippelli">Karen</a> arrives for the day and she questions it. Jim says it is hard to explain. In a talking head, he explains that he occasionally faxes Dwight messages from "his future self" on <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Schrute_b170.html" title="Dwight Schrute">Dwight Schrute</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stationery.html" title="Stationery">stationery</a>, stolen before Jim transferred. In <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scranton%2C_Pennsylvania_1cf0.html" title="Scranton, Pennsylvania">Scranton</a>, Dwight gets a fax saying that someone is going to poison the coffee at 8 A.M. Dwight looks up to see <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Hudson_ef25.html" title="Stanley Hudson">Stanley</a> emerge from the breakroom about to take a sip of coffee. Dwight sprints to him and knocks the mug from Stanley's hand, saying that he will thank him later.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Levinson_ef6a.html" title="Jan Levinson">Jan Levinson</a> enters <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Scott_%28The_Office%29_8fd8.html" title="Michael Scott (The Office)">Michael</a>'s office. He mentions he loves to start the morning with "a hearty bowl of Jan" and sings "call me Levinson in the morning" to the tune of "<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_of_the_Morning_e9b6.html" title="Angel of the Morning">Angel of the Morning</a>". Jan informs Michael that the board has voted to close the Scranton branch, adding that the board has asked her to thank Michael for his years of service. She then informs Michael that a small number of people will be transferred to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamford%2C_Connecticut_47b1.html" title="Stamford, Connecticut">Stamford</a> while the rest will receive severance packages. Michael asks if he is a "small number person" or "severance" person. Jan replies that they have not made final decision on personnel yet, but quietly adds that he will be a severance person. Michael gets extremely emotional over this news, as the rest of the office stares through his window, wondering what Jan has told him. In an interview, Dwight indicates his close friendship with Michael enables him to read his mood like a book. He envisions the current title of Michael's book to be <i>Something Weird Is Going On: What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story</i>, by Michael Scott with Dwight Schrute.</p>
<p>Michael hints to the office and then breaks the news prematurely and angrily, going so far as to label <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toby_Flenderson_984c.html" title="Toby Flenderson">Toby</a> a "traitor" when Toby reveals Jan told him minutes before Michael. Stanley says that he could not be happier, as he plans to retire and use his severance package to travel with his wife. <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Howard_%28The_Office%29_d40f.html" title="Ryan Howard (The Office)">Ryan</a> says that it makes perfect sense that it happens today, since he has just received a box of a thousand business cards with this office address and phone number. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Martin_3edb.html" title="Angela Martin">Angela</a> states that in her mind, everyone is to blame for this. <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Kapoor_b8d1.html" title="Kelly Kapoor">Kelly</a> says that if she stays and Ryan loses his job, she would kill herself, like <i><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare%27s_Romeo_%2B_Juliet_84e9.html" title="William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>. She then clarifies her actions would emulate the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claire_Danes_81e9.html" title="Claire Danes">Claire Danes</a> version of the Shakespeare classic.</p>
<p>Jim thinks that it would be weird to see Scranton disappear since he always knew that Scranton would close someday, but he just figured it would be for reason like Michael selling the building off for some magic beans. <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pam_Beesly_5f84.html" title="Pam Beesly">Pam</a> thinks it is a blessing in disguise—actually not even in disguise—since she sometimes answers the phone at home with "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam" and now she does not have to do that anymore. <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Anderson_%28The_Office_character%29_2a32.html" title="Roy Anderson (The Office character)">Roy</a> says he is not sure about working there if Pam is not going to be there. He says <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella_%28band%29.html" title="Cinderella (band)">Cinderella</a>'s "Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)", pretty much says what he is feeling better than he could, "in words". Ryan tells Kelly that it would not work out since they will be working separately. With the camera on him, he shows joy in how this is working out perfectly for him since he got his experience, will get a great recommendation letter from Michael and minus Kelly.</p>
<p>Michael and Dwight plan to confront the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_financial_officer.html" title="Chief financial officer">CFO</a> at the New York office to get him to change his mind. Michael finds out in the drive that Dwight has the CFO's address on his cell phone for the Christmas card list and questions why since Dwight has never met him. Dwight replies that they will now have something to talk about when he does. They end up sitting outside the CFO's house when they are informed by the CFO's secretary that he is out of the office for the day. Michael and Dwight rehearse what Michael is going to say to the CFO while they wait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jan informs <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_from_The_Office_%28US%29_6677.html#Josh_Porter" title="Characters from The Office (US)">Josh</a> that he will be taking over Dunder-Mifflin Northeast, which will be all of the offices north of Stamford. However, Josh reveals that he has leveraged his new position into senior management at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staples%2C_Inc._56fa.html" title="Staples, Inc.">Staples</a>. Jim comments to the camera, "say what you would about Michael Scott, but he would never do that."</p>
<p>Jan tells Jim that the situation changes to Stamford closing and Scranton absorbing the other branch and offers him the #2 man job at the new Northeast branch. Jim says he is unsure, as he has unresolved personal issues at the Scranton branch (which Jan assumes are due to Michael). Karen says that if asked, she would go to Scranton, and asks Jim if he will take the job at Scranton. He answers that he does not know yet, but recommends that she quit Dunder Mifflin and move to New York. As for <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Bernard_8eee.html" title="Andy Bernard">Andy</a>, he creates a mess in the break room when the situation changes to Stamford closing. Near the end of the episode, Jim reverses course, saying that he will accept the job in Scranton, and tells Karen that she should go there if offered a job. Karen then says to the camera that she is glad he said it, because even though she does not think he is into her, she is kind of into him.</p>
<p>Back in Scranton, Jan drops by to reveal to the rest of the staff of the reverse change. With the exception of Stanley, the office is relieved that their jobs are safe and goes to celebrate, with employees questioning whether Michael did anything. Instead of joining, Pam questions Jan if anyone from Stamford will be coming back to Scranton.</p>
<p>Michael and Dwight wait outside the house in the car and Dwight reveals that one of his favorite moment at Scranton is Michael taking him to the hospital and telling Dwight he cared. Pam receives a rumor that Jim is coming back to Scranton and she now thinks that staying is a good thing since she doesn't have to find a new job and there is no new adjustment.</p>
<p>Late in the evening, Dwight checks his <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voicemail.html" title="Voicemail">voicemail</a> informing them the branch survived. The pair joyously bump chests, believing they saved the day, but unsure how they did so.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode, Toby said that he made plans for <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costa_Rica_e226.html" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>. Saying that he was dreaming of selling his house, moving, and learning how to <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfing.html" title="Surfing">surf</a>, until Jan tells everyone that the branch is not closing. He says, "Costa Rica will still be there... when I'm 65.".</p>

<p>In subplots, Meredith seeks a potential paramour based on a deal she once made to get physical with a coworker on the final day of employ, and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creed_Bratton_%28The_Office_character%29_b89c.html" title="Creed Bratton (The Office character)">Creed</a> sells the electronics and furniture from his area of the office.</p>
<p>Meredith first believes that she makes the future sexual liaison pact with Michael, but he says it is not so. Toby is equally unhelpful on the matter. Finally, Gary Trundle, Meredith's former coworker from another branch's warehouse, calls to remind her of a deal he had made with her long ago. Meredith plans a rendezvous at her place in 20 minutes. She confirms the closing to Gary even though she knows that the decision to close has been reversed.</p>
<p>Dwight searches through the CFO's garbage outside his home, learning that he is rich (as he has a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite_television.html" title="Satellite television">satellite TV</a> <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28payment%29.html" title="Bill (payment)">bill</a>) and drinks <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, "possibly to disguise the smell of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>".</p>
<p>Pam's line about the closing being a blessing has been changed from her being able to no longer answer her home phone like she does the office phone to her fantasy about quitting.</p>
<p>Jim's line about his theory that Scranton would close "because Michael sold the building for magic beans" is changed to an awkward high school reunion that ends up with everyone moving in with him.</p>
<p>Andy asks Jim what he's going to do if he should get laid off. When Jim asks Andy, he says that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell</a> has a great alumni network and he might go back there to teach. Jim then asks where he went to college, mocking Andy's frequent reference to his alma mater.</p>
<p>In an extended scene, we find out that Ryan and Kelly's relationship may be more than it seems. Kelly appears to have a strange power over Ryan. He claims he "can't explain" the attraction and why they remain together.</p>
<p>Creed takes pictures of office property on his desk and advertises the items online. He makes several deals throughout the day and ultimately earns $1,200 selling Dunder-Mifflin property from a branch now scheduled to remain open.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is only one Sal's Pizza in Scranton and their order menu is posted in the office kitchen, which would indicate the office is (somewhat) close to 505 Linden St.</li>
<li>During Michael's talking head segments, which feature him angry at the changes, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Carell_fd22.html" title="Steve Carell">Steve Carell</a> does not blink.</li>
<li>Michael mentions the movie "Kingpin" when he and Dwight first approach the front door of the CFO's house. In the movie, an older Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) lives in a run-down Scranton apartment. The movie portrays Scranton rather insultingly, making it interesting that Michael apparently enjoys the movie.</li>
<li>When Kevin tells Pam that they are going to Poor Richard's, he mentions that Creed will be buying shots. This is most likely because Creed had just made $1200 selling electronics from the office, however, the original cut of the episode does not show that plot line and causes the statement to be slightly out of context.</li>
<li>Shortly before the episode's airing, castmember <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Fischer_4f04.html" title="Jenna Fischer">Jenna Fischer</a> described the episode as "the best one we've ever done. I'm not kidding."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Angela doesn't want to go to "all the way to Dunmore" to have lunch at Cugino's. The real Cugino's is indeed in Dunmore, but that's only five minutes' drive from downtown Scranton. Angela was just being Angela</li>
