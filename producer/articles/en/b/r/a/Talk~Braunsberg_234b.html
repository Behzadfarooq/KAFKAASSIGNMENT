	    <p>Removed the incorrect Latin place-names and the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Ermland state government for the bishopric of Ermland of September 22, 1526 (<i>Ermland Landtsordnung des Bischoffthums Ermland</i>) was re-recorded at Braunsberg in 1711 under&#160;:addition to the Culm Laws (<i>Appendix zum Jus Culmense correct</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The laws of the dukedom of Prussia ,on which the land is founded and which are still current today, 1616 (<i>Privilegia der Staende dess Hertzogthumbs Preussen darauft das Landt fundiert und biss itzo veruhen 1616, Brunsbergiae</i>) were published in Braunsberg in 1616.</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, these are not in any form of acceptable English, and second, they add nothing of value to the article. These paragraphs have been replaced by a summary sentence. It should be noted that, unless the author can show that these were done in Braunsberg and only in Braunsberg, there is a very good chance that these laws, codices, regulations, whatever -- especially for Prussia, were also recorded and published in other towns. Because of this, a special mention for Braunsberg is not warranted.<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Der Name der Stadt setzt sich aus den Wörtern "Brussi" und "birge" zusammen und bedeutet "preußische Burg".</p>

<dd>Wirklich? Können Sie bitte uns zeigen (beweisen?), Ihre Quellen für diese Informationen? Es gibt hier viele Leute (wie Sie wahrsceinlich schon wissen), die ungeforscht Argumente fortsetzen: es wäre hilfsvoll wenn man wissen können, aus welchen Quellen oder bzw. Urkunden Ihre Erklärung dieses Namens herauskommt! Bitte entschuldigen Sie mein schlechtes Deutsch -- ich mach's einfach für Spass und ein bisschen Übung! <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>Removed incorrectly assumed Lating names again. Fr. user:H.J., these are NOT the Latin names. Period. They are Latinizations of other names. If they <i>were</i> Latin, they wouldn't be in the Genitive form.</p>
<p>Removed all of the Garbage taken from the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> article on Ermeland. It doesn't belong there. unfortunately, there is much that makes no sense, because Frau user:H.J. did not make clear which archbishops and bishops came from where. it is also unclear why, if Braunsberg remained Prussian, there are fights and disputes WITH the Prussians. <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a> --- Was Braunsberg in Prussia in 1924 or already part of Poland? --rmhermen</p>

<p>I'm not sure. erg. I just know that the article didn't work as cribbed.<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>

<p>Answer to <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a>&#160;: Braunsberg in 1924 was in the Deutsche Reich (Germany, Weimarer Republic) and in the province of Ostpreussen (East Prussia). Once again, the outside link to a map of 1600 is [<a href="http://wwwtest.library.ucla.edu/libraries/mgi/maps/blaeu/prvssia.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://wwwtest.library.ucla.edu/libraries/mgi/maps/blaeu/prvssia.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] On the top section of the map you can follow along the Baltic Sea coast and locate the following cities (spelled in the style of that time): Danzig, Marienburg, Elbing, Mulhausen, Frauenburg, Braunsberg, (Samland) Koenigsberg. The so-called Polish Corridor was draws just left of Elbing. Braunsberg is almost at the Soviet Union/Russia border of the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliningrad_Oblast_0c1c.html" title="Kaliningrad Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a> user:H.J.</p>
<hr />
<p>As you can see in the history of Braunsberg some people consider facts 'crap' and 'garbage' and delete it, only to not be able to answer a simple basic question as yours.</p>
<p>Following I am posting the complete entrance on Braunsberg (which was deleted) for those persons, who are interested in the facts&#160;:</p>
<p><i>Braunsberg (earlier Brunsberg, Latin: Brunsbergae), a city in eastern Prussia, in the bishopric of Ermeland (Latin: Varmia, Warmia), was named after Saint (Brun) Bruno of Querfurt. It is near Frauenburg? and both cities are situated half ways between Danzig and Koenigsberg at the Baltic Sea. It was taken in 1945 and is since then called Braniewo in Poland.</i></p>
<p>As it was the case with all cities and towns founded, there were previous settlements already, because of favorable locations, near water, at a trade route, etc. This was also the case with Braunsberg, which was already a settlement of Prussians, one of the earlier recorded names was Brus and it remained a settlement of Prussians. In 1249 Johannes Fleming, son of a Luebeck councilman (Ratsherr) founded Braunsberg. Bishop Anselm gave it Luebeck city charter in 1254.</p>
<p>The first archbishop of Prussia Albert of Sauerbeer from Cologne, became archbishop, after he was already archbishop of Armagh, Irland. The Ermland diocese included all of Old Prussian lands, Warmia, Natangen, Barten, Galindia,the northern half of Pomesania and southern half Nadrauen and Sudauen. Archbishop Albert chose Riga as his seat. Riga was in Livonia and stood under the protection of Visby. Bishop Anselm of Meissen was consecrated by papal legate in 1251. The bishop was given one third of his territory as personal property to be ruled by him as secular ruler and prince of the Holy Roman Empire. It was confirmed by emperor Charles IV. In 1260 bishop Anselm founded a chapter attached to the cathedrale of [St. Andreas]? at Braunsberg. This chapter had the right to elect the bishop. Braunsberg was destroyed by Prussians , who fought for thirty years against take-over of their land by the papal legates. The next bishop Heinrich I (1278-1300) had to transfer the chapter from Braunsberg to Frauenburg?. It remained in Frauenburg until the 20st century.</p>
<p>1296 a Franciscan abbey was built. 1342 a Neustadt Braunsberg was added. The bishop of Ermland , prince of the empire, Silvio de Piccolomini (Aenaus Silvius) was bishop of Ermland for one year, until he became pope [Pius II]?.</p>
<p>The bishops of Ermland continued the struggle to keep their land independed , particularly during the Reformation, when Ermland remained Catholic as one of the few Prussian lands. In 1512 bishop [Lucas Watzenrode]? obtained from pope Julius II a release of the diocese from the connection to Riga and Ermland was declared an excempt diocese. The bishop resided in Heilsberg?. Bishop Watzenrode reorganized the school at Frauenberg with exellent teachers, one of them his nephew Nicolaus Koppernigk. He published the Breviary (Nuremberg 1494) and the Missal (Strasburg 1497). To keep the diocese and land from turning Protestant and secularisation the bishops held various synods to carry out the decisions of the Council of Trent and had yearly visitations. In 1565 they founded a Jesuit College at Braunsberg.</p>
<p>The Ermland state government for the bishopric of Ermland of September 22, 1526 (Ermland Landtsordnung des Bischoffthums Ermland) was re-recorded at Braunsberg in 1711 under&#160;:addition to the Culm Laws (Appendix zum Jus Culmense correct).</p>
<p>In 1571 the congragation of St.Catherine? was founded in Braunsberg by [Regina Protmann]?.</p>
<p>The laws of the dukedom of Prussia ,on which the land is founded and which are still current today, 1616 (Privilegia der Staende dess Hertzogthumbs Preussen darauft das Landt fundiert und biss itzo veruhen 1616, Brunsbergiae) were published in Braunsberg in 1616.</p>
<p>The first church songbook named heavenly sounds of the harp Himmlischer Harffenklangk was printed in Ermland in 1629 by Simon Berent, born around 1585, who had been travel companion of the Radziwill? princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Berent saw to it that the Jesuit college was re-openend after the destruction by the Swedes. He also set the famous German christmas song Es ist ein Ros entsprungen to music.</p>
<p>In 1712 Peter Rosenbuechler ( + 1719) received the privilege to run a book printing business , patented as Bibliopola Brunsbergensis. This privilege of being the only book printing company in Braunsberg was held until in 1772 Ermland was governed by the State of Prussia.</p>
<p><br />
Michael Schorn (born 1719) was the prince bishopric postmaster general of Ermland until 1772.</p>
<p>Next to Koenigsberg Braunsberg was the leading academic schooling center of Prussia. In 1912 the Jesuit college became the Staatliche Akademie Braunsberg.</p>
<p>In 1924 [Rainer Barzel]?, later Bundestagspresident of the Bundesrepublik? of Germany, was born in Braunsberg, Prussia.</p>

<hr />
<p>From what year is that article in Catholic Encyclopedia?</p>
<p>I mean, does it come from the time, when Poland was still under Partitions and the Partitioning Powers were spreading all kinds of myths and legends, justifying their presence on Polish Lands (like<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warmia.html" title="Warmia">Warmia</a>, all over the world?</p>
<p>Quote: "<i>Braunsberg (earlier Brunsberg, Latin: Brunsbergae), a city in eastern Prussia"</i> As far, as I know, there is no such city as Braunsberg and no such country, or province, as Prussia. Shouldn't we update articles, that use over 50 years old publications, as source?</p>

<p>Answer to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Cadet_c05d.html" title="Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> The Cath. Encycl. is dated 1999/2000. G. Hermanowski's book is from 1996.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks, I'll look into this.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe, that the Catholic encyclopedia publishes such outdated information.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Cadet_c05d.html" title="Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Some info is never outdated. The catholic encycl. is not new. Their current publishing shows articles from around 1910, based on older original records. Just as any other historical book is based on earlier recordings and records. Wiki shows articles from earlier encyclopedias, some before 1900. user:H.J.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tell me more about this Hermanowski's book, please. I'll gladly check it out. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Cadet_c05d.html" title="Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a></p>
<hr />
<p>217.168.172.xxx! I thought we were not supposed to use umlauts and other non-english letters in WIKI. Has something change with that rule? 'Cause I would be more than happy to put all the Óó, Ęę, Ąą, Ćć, Łł, Ńń, Śś, Źź, Żż to every misspelled Polish name like Gdansk (Gdańsk), Wroclaw (Wrocław), Lodz (Łódź), Wladyslaw (Władysław), Torun (Toruń), Goldap (Gołdap), Wisniowiecki (Wiśniowiecki) etc.</p>
