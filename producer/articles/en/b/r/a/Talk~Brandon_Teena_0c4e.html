<dd>Mr. Teena’s killer, death-row inmate John Lotter, claims that another man convicted in the crime, Marvin T. Nissen, actually murdered Teena, 21, and two witnesses, Lisa Lambert, 24, and Philip DeVine, 22, on New Year's Eve 1993 at a farm house in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richardson_County%2C_Nebraska_0661.html" title="Richardson County, Nebraska">Richardson County, Nebraska</a>. Lotter's attorney, Jerry Soucie, asked the <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska_Supreme_Court_eeb5.html" title="Nebraska Supreme Court">Nebraska Supreme Court</a> to order <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_test_37e1.html" title="DNA test">DNA testing</a> on gloves that Nissen wore the night of the killings. Richardson County District Judge Daniel Bryan denied a similar request at an earlier trial. Nissen has testified that he stabbed the young transgender man, but he said it was Lotter who shot Brandon Teena. Nissen traded testimony for a life sentence.</dd>

<dd>Unless you insist on having a look into people's underwear before you decide whether you address them or speak about them as male or female, they do not. Gender identity and/or gender role determine that, not genitals. Brandon lived as a man, identified as a man, therefore the male pronoun is the only appropriate one, and using the female one is nothing but trans-bashing, not better than that of the people who raped and murdered him. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 19:55, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Brandon was biologically female. Mainstream news reports refer to her as <b>her</b> and <b>she</b>. Only GLBT advocacy websites refer to her as him. Wikipedia is not a GLBT advocacy website. I can say I'm a Martian but it doesn't make it so. If you really think calling her <b>she</b> is as bad as raping and murdering someone, then I think you really need to take some medication. If you accuse me of being no better than the people who raped and murdered her, you are not only being extremely offensive, but you are also trivialising her death for propaganda purposes. - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed"><small>XED</small></a>.<a href="../../../x/e/d/User_talk%7EXed_4a5e.html" title="User talk:Xed"><small>talk</small></a> 10:11, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is not an issue of propaganda. It is a matter of respecting Brandon for the choices he has made and respecting his self-identification, and it is this respect to our subject matter that is reflected in Wikipedia guidelines and policy (See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28identity%29_da8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/y/Wikipedia%7EStyle_guide_35fc.html#Identity" title="Wikipedia:Style guide">Wikipedia:Style_guide#Identity</a>).</dd>
<dd>Just because the "mainstream news" may use inaccurate and pronouns found offensive by the trans* community (coincidentally see the above cut from an <i>AP</i> article, which says "he stabbed the young transgender <b>man</b>"), doesn't mean Wikipedia should either. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 14:10, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not interested in 'guidelines' which have been made up on the spot by propagandists. You may think calling a biological woman <b>she</b> is the same as raping and murdering someone - but I don't - <a href="../../../x/e/d/User%7EXed_07b7.html" title="User:Xed"><small>XED</small></a>.<a href="../../../x/e/d/User_talk%7EXed_4a5e.html" title="User talk:Xed"><small>talk</small></a> 16:03, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I personally didn't say that, so don't try and muddy the waters here. Let us examine your weak argument that biology should determine pronouns instead.
<ul>
<li>Say a man has had an accident and has had to have his genitals removed, but he still presents as a man and lives as a man - would you then use female pronouns for him?</li>
<li>Say a man has had a chromosomal problem and has XX chromosomes instead of XY (this has happened), but still presents and lives as a man - would you then use female pronouns for him?</li>
<li>Say a woman has had <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia.html" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia">congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a> and has excessive testosterone, but still presents and lives as a woman - would you then use male pronous for him?</li>
<li>Say a baby is born <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersex.html" title="Intersex">intersexed</a>. What pronouns would you use, based on that child's genitals?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>To say that biology should strictly determine pronouns becomes a very hurtful insult for the first three people. If you present and live as a man, you would be insulted if I were to use female pronous to describe you, or vice versa. To say that biology should strictly determine pronouns becomes an impossible question to resolve for the fourth person.</dd>
<dd>However, observe the common thread between the first three people here. If we were to use male pronouns for the first two persons and female pronouns for the third, we are respecting their self-identification and we are respecting these people. Trans* people are not less deserving of respect, and thus we should respect their self-identification also. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 23:25, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are mistaken. I had already outlined why using birth pronouns to describe transgender people is inaccurate in the above argument (which you have not spoken to at all in your response); the issue here is about basic respect of a person. Think about changing all the instances of "black" to "Negro" or "coloured" on an article about a black man, or pronouns for even a nontransgendered man to "she". Is that NPOV? Is that behaviour reflected in Wikipedia policy? <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 08:55, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my view we should use he.

<dd>It is necessary that Brandon Teena be described as a 'he', for that very reason. Brandon Teena's gender identity was a pre-operative male transsexual, a 'he'. His surgical, genital, therapeutic, or genetic status is irrelevant. Calling Teena by female pronouns will cause far more confusion than it will solve, both about Mr. Teena's gender identity, and the concept of gender identity in general. That would cause a negative effect greater than just a slight to Mr. Teena's memory - it would perpetuate misunderstanding, a primary no-no of the wikipedia. Just my 2¢. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 02:51, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Responding to the RfC: I agree that if he self-identified as male and lived as a man, he should be referred to as "he." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 02:56, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The manual of style is clear on this: Brandon should be referred to as "he".

<p>Walks like a duck, talks like duck....Brandon Teena was male in looks, behavior and psychology. The only ones who say him as female while he was alive were his rapist/killers. The pronouns should stay masculine, unless Raul654, Xed, and Susvolans want to argue that the article should be renamed Teena Renae Brandon. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">BlankVerse</a> 11:56, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Opinions are as varied as people - but the fact is Brandon was a 'he'. It's not necessary to accomodate some people's 'moral' sensitivities re: gender to put them at ease in this article - it's necessary to be factual.

<p>You <b>ALWAYS</b> refer to a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgendered.html" title="Transgendered">transgendered</a> person by the pronouns of their <b>gender identity</b>. This is <b>not</b> debatable.

<dd>How on earth do any of us know anyone's gender? Do we demand to see their genitalia? Of course not. They tell us (either directly or indirectly), and polite, reasonable people do not need any more than that. If Brandon Teena says he is a man, and especially if he is consistant in that, there is nothing more to say about the matter. This is not "political theory" -- it is well-established and conventional practice. 38.2.108.125 21:50, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Merriam-Webster, man is defined as: <i>an individual human; especially&#160;: an adult male human</i>, and male is defined as: <i>an individual that produces small usually motile gametes (as spermatozoa or spermatozoids) which fertilize the eggs of a female</i>. Woman is defined: <i>an adult female person</i>, and female as: <i>of, relating to, or being the sex that bears young or produces eggs</i>. She never produced any spermatozoa, and if she never had sexual reassignment surgery, as the article states, she produced eggs, and therefore the Merriam-Webster Dictionary would label her as a woman. I think in maintaining Wikipedia's neutral policy, a dictionary definition must be used whenever possible.</p>

<p>I don't know how to properly post to this page, however I think something very important is being overlooked in the pronoun usage... I came to this article from a different website that wasn't very clear on the Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon case. I just want to say to all those insisting on the male pronoun... how long do you think it took me to figure out whether or not this born-female person was actually born-female? A good five minutes of crawling the page! She was a woman, she wanted to be identified as a man. All respect to the person here, it's difficult to follow otherwise. Also, to the user that stated using the female pronoun being even remotely close to actually raping and killing of this 'person': way to go. No really, I've never seen a more ridiculous line of logic. I'd say that writing that in was about as bad as ordering a platoon of rifleman to gun down a family with 8 kids. Sarcasm, by the way.</p>

<p>The point is already made regarding the surgical status of Brandon Teena. Moreover, it is inaccurate to say "transgender, rather than transsexual".

<p>I went and did this earlier today. Part of it was edited based on the bolding of Brandon's birth name. I can understand why that would be upsetting, as a transwoman myself I fully understand that it would suck to see my former name there and in bold. So, I definitely don't have an objection to Dysprosia's edit. I'm just wondering if it not being bolded in anyway violates a Wikipedia standard. Which was of course why the opening paragraph was changed initially. Taking for example the Gwen Araujo article, linked directly from this one, which bolds her male name. I guess I just need to figure out which way is more proper and standards directed?

<dd>It shouldn't contradict standards, only synonyms of the article title should be in bold.

<hr />
<p>I'm putting an NPOV tag on this because the pronouns being used are reflective of a certain POV regarding transgendered people. Although the author obviously believes that self-identification of gender should be reflected in an objective identification of gender, this is not necessarily the case. Biologically, Brandon Teena was female. Whether gender should be considered wholly independent of sex, and whether gender is entirely a matter of social convention or self-idenfication (or conversely a matter of objective classification) are issues on which reasonable people could debate. However this article seems to assume that self-identification of gender should translate into objective terminology.</p>
<p>I think that the article should be corrected by using alternate pronouns ("he/she", "s/he", "him/her", etc.). I would have done so myself, but I thought the point should be discussed before taking unilateral action.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nicky Scarfo</p>

<dd>The Wikipedia manual of style indicates the use of self-identification to be proper, so that's what should be here.

<p>Okey-doke, I was unaware of all that, but I must say that I disagree with the rule. It presumes self-identification automatically grants objective nomenclature. So if I became a famous writer (famous enough to have a Wikipedia article written about me), and I suddenly declare that I am Napoleon Bonaparte and have done everything Napoleon did, then the author has to refer to me as if I'm Napoleon for the rest of the article? Or if George Bush suddenly exclaims he is a black man, would the author have to write "In an effort to get in touch with his African-American roots, Bush watched 'Barbershop'"? This rule makes no sense-- it is dictated by the conventions of whoever wrote the rule but prematurely stamps out any debate on objective classification which may be in question. Effectively, it resolves a clearly unresolved issue regarding objective biological classification of gender vs. self-identification of gender. To say nothing of the idea of general idea gender as a social construct, which could be used to argue for either objective or self-idenitifcation. In short, this rule is complete bullshit and only reflects the bias of the person who wrote it.</p>

<dd>Sorry, but declaring oneself to be Napoleon and declaring oneself to be of the male gender are not the same.

<dd>What Ryan said. The policy also allows us to respect the subject matter that we discuss, which is important for neutrality.

<p>Ryan, declaring oneself to be Napoleon and declaring oneself to be of the male gender are NOT the same, you are correct, however, the rule, as currently written would make no distinction between them-- <i>"Where known, use terminology that subjects use for themselves (self-identification). This can mean using the term an individual uses for himself/herself, or using the term a group most widely uses for itself. This includes referring to transgender individuals according to the name and pronoun they use to identify themselves."</i> It is a blanket rule, which I suspect was written to cover this specific subject, and then extrapolated therefrom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one here has yet addressed the fact that the issue of whether self-identification of gender automatically translates into objective classification of gender is far from a settled manner. This rule settles the issue decidedly on one side of the debate, and therefore, is itself a violation of the neutrality principle. I know people here probably think I'm advocating AGAINST self-identification as the sole objective criteria of classification and identification of gender. This is not the case. Formally, I have no opinion on the matter. Furthermore, I believe society should be wholly inclusive of people regardless of sexual orientation or gender identification. That does not prevent me from thinking that the issue of whether the objective classification and nomenclature of gender is based solely on self-identification or not is a subject upon which rational people can disagree. I take no position on the matter other than to say I think a rule which presupposes an objective conclusion of an as-yet inconclusive matter is bullshit. I think the rule was not created in the interest of objective and neutral writing, but to satisfy the presuppositions and opinions of the rule's author(s).</p>

<dd>On the other hand, calling Brandon "she," or even using s/he throughout, as was suggested above, would also be promoting a particular point of view, arguably ones that are more biased. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 07:09, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very true, Exploding Boy. However, I believe use of s/he throughout would be the least of the three evils, as it promotes an ambivalent, rather than determinate, point of view on a subject which is indeterminate.</p>
<p>On another point, I just wanted to say that I recently read the excellent Wikipedia articles regarding transgender and transexuality. The articles are good because they treat the issue with the complexity, depth and neutral POV that these subjects deserve. Which makes this simplistic and biased rule that equates self-identity with objective classification all the more frustrating.</p>

<dd>"S/he" is used to describe unknowns. Brandon Teena is not an unknown, and to use "s/he" to refer to a person whose gender identity is clearly known is no better in my opinion than referring to him as an "it," which is blatantly offensive. Furthermore, there is absolutely no way to avoid bias in anything we write. To call him a "he" is biased toward transgender advocacy groups, whereas "she," "it," and "s/he" are biased toward people who deny a transsexual's right to self-identify. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalsetto_bd68.html" title="User:Falsetto">Falsetto</a></dd>

<dd>The fact that we have a self-identification policy implies a sense of objectivity, since Wikipedia does not itself take a point of view in choosing pronouns for its subjects, but instead chooses pronouns that reflects the pronouns that the subjects choose for themselves. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 11:55, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is also culturally appropriate to refer to someone by the gender they lived by since English speakers use the pronoun that the person appears to warrant, not from the gender they actually are. If I see someone who looks like a man, I refer to that person as him. If they then tell me, "No, I'm female," I feel embarassed and I use she. If they never say anything about it, I go one using he because there's really no reason not to. On another note, we refer to Brandon as Brandon, rather than Teena, because that's the name he used. It is similar to how Mark Twain's article and talk page makes mention of his birth name but does not make a point of calling him by it throughout the article. - <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzain_cd43.html" title="User:Kuzain">Kuzain</a> 19:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So if somebody has a criminal past, that somehow <i>negates</i> or <i>lessens</i> the impact of being killed for reasons which had nothing to do with criminality? I'd advise you to be careful in how you phrase any additions relating to his criminal record. Not because I'm trying to whitewash him or anything; if the material is verifiable and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> then that won't be a problem. But if you try to portray it as though his criminal record somehow <i>mitigates</i> the circumstances of his death, then the material <i>will</i> have to be reviewed or excluded on neutrality grounds. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:12, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree Bearcat, sorry I was a tad hostile in my initial statement. If I post anything it will state that she had criminal record and what her record was. I think we all know from various sources the things she did, I'd just like to take a little more time and hopefully actually get a source to her actual criminal record. I believe I've read that she forged a check/checks in the group of people she was hanging around that included her murderers. She was also known to be manipulative. That is as relevant to her murder as much as the 'hate crime' aspect. She pushed the wrong buttons in other words. I'm open to suggestions on how I can state that, IF it proves true after research, in a NPOV way. I'm pretty sure the facts show that she was not a 'babe in the woods', and at the very least her manipulative nature was a factor in the tragic events that followed. To exclude this information makes an article about Brandon Teena incomplete.</p>
<p>I'll post whatever I'd like to add here before I change the article. I'm new to joining the editing process at WIKI, so any tips on how to include links and things like that would be helpful.</p>
<p>PS: I call Brandon she in discussion because I feel that's the proper way to refer to her. Any criminal records/convictions will also list her actual gender. I will however respect the format of the article and use male pronoun if I contribute to the article. Nanaharas 17:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Roll your eyes all you want Bearcat, your bias towards Brandon is now clear. This is not a matter of coming out to "every single person you meet". The deception and manipulation became factors,again by definition, when Brandon entered intimate relationships and did not reveal the entire truth. As I pointed out, that ultimately was the catalyst that ended in the death of three people. Even if she hadn't been so unfortunate as to meet up with scum like her rapist and killers, that deception would still most likely have led to someone being hurt emotionally. I suppose in your rolling eyes Brandon's disrespect to others is 'OK', but how dare anyone call her a she, eh?</dd>

<p>Granted, I haven't thoroughly read every single comment on this page regarding the pronoun usage, but I did notice one glaring problem: the confusion of <b>gender</b> and <b>sex</b>. <b>Sex</b> is the <i>biological</i> traits of a person, including primary (present at birth, ie, genitals) and secondary (those developed later, such as facial/body hair, breasts) sex characteristics. <b>Gender</b> is the <i>socially</i> created expectations based upon these characteristics. This is the standard difference between the two, taught regardless of GLBTQIA feelings. I learned this in a biology class (high school) and a sociology class (college), so that shows it is more than one field's view. In the instance of transgender people, and in this case, Mr. Teena specifically, one may be a female in sex, but male in gender (or vice versa, obviously). Gender is about how an individual perceives him/herself and how s/he wishes others to perceive him/her. Mr. Teena identified as a man, and while he may not have been male at the time of his death, his gender was decidedly open and he should therefore be referred to using masculine pronouns. Pronouns are a socially-defined concept, and since gender is a social and not a biological concept, one's gender defines (or at least should, when used properly) which pronouns are used. As history and cultural differences have shown, the outward signs of male or female drastically change, and are indications that outward appearance is not a reliable indicator of gender or sex. <a href="../../../e/c/u/User%7EEcurran_8ef1.html" title="User:Ecurran">Ecurran</a> 03:26, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly agree, but not everyone else does. Beyond the specific point of referring to the article subject 1) as Brandon Teena rather than Teena Brandon and 2) using male and not female pronouns, some editors don't accept that the sex and gender of one person can be different from each other. Using that approach, BT's physical sex would determine the use of the female pronoun. Name use is less contentious, I suppose, because I haven't seen anyone arguing to move <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Ali_9e91.html" title="Muhammad Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassius_Clay_89de.html" title="Cassius Clay">Cassius Clay</a>. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 10:07, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brandon was decidedly NOT open about her "identification". For those who haven't paid attention, that <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a> was the catalyst to the entire chain of events that led to her downfall. That can be verified by court records alone. Teena was dishonest about her "identity", that is NOT being "open".

<dd>I'm sorry, I may have been unclear; I meant that Mr. Teena was open as a male, as in, he portrayed himself as a male. I did not mean to imply anything about allegedly deceiving people in regards to the status of his genitals. That, I don't blame him for not being "open" about. I don't inform people about the status of mine, but I portray myself as female, and therefore am "open" about it. <a href="../../../e/c/u/User%7EEcurran_8ef1.html" title="User:Ecurran">Ecurran</a> 08:38, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Using the male pronoun might imply a bias in favor of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> movement/identification, but using the female pronoun <i>certainly</i> implies a bias <i>against</i> it -- a unilateral ruling that Brandon Teena's self-identification as a man trapped in a female body is immaterial.</dd>
<dd>As a side-note, I'm inclined to take your comments about BT being the "catalyst" to his own "downfall" as victim-blaming. You can rant all you like about BT's femininity being "fact" as you're, of course, entitled to your own opinion, and you can choose to refer to BT by the female pronoun, or by the birth name, or as "Ms. Brandon" or whatever you please. You can also go argue against the policy of self-identification terminology (wherever it is; I've lost the link). But you can't edit this article against policy. It will be reverted.</dd>
<dd>For the record, I'm responding to Nanaharas here because I think this discussion belongs better under the "Gender vs. Sex" header. As far as I'm concerned, until the self-identification policy changes this debate is over.

<dd>RE:Ecurran: Regarding your perception and updated POV regarding 'open';Just because Brandon dressed and acted as a male does not mean she was 'open'. She was still 'in the closet' by common definition. Being 'open' would be known as 'out of the closet' or 'coming out'. If you don't inform people of your status you are not 'open'.

<p>The emotional arguments as to pronoun usage above are understandable, but unsupported. Sex is a biological condition determined at the chromosomal (molecular) level. Briefly put, in humans (intersex variations aside) this means an xx karyotype for a female, xy for a male. Gender describes the physiological characteristics which identify (or distinguish) an organism's reproductive role. None of this is self-selected, though gender can be disguised through grooming, dress, hormone ingestion and under the knife. Brandon Teena was a female, although she attempted to self identify as a male (and presumably had every right to do this so long as she didn't gain unfair advantage through fraud or misrepresentation). In strictly cultural terms there is little argument against Brandon superficially self-identifying as a "he," but in objective, encyclopedic terms, she was a she. Even after so-called "trans-gender" surgery, she still would have been a biological female. However, given WP policy which stresses editorial consensus and (helpfully) strongly discourages edit warring, there's no reason to waste time asserting the notion she should be referred to as such in the article. As for her being a lesbian, as a female attracted exclusively to other females, Brandon was a lesbian who affected superficial male grooming and dress but retained observably female characteristics. How she chose to express her lesbianism is irrelevent (and again, her right). Her murder was a horrific crime and a tragedy. Never mind her criminal record, never mind how she misled some of the people who cared about her. She was given little chance (or time) to find happiness in her own way. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 20:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>2. Gwen Gale, if what really bothers you about the article is that there aren't individual references tagged to each sentence, leading to sources confirming it, you can ammend that by using the <i>existing</i> external links section to add a detailed references section to the article. Adding {{fact}} after every contentious sentence isn't helpful, because it makes it look like there's no backing whatsoever for Brandon Teena's self-identification as a transman, when that fact appears in almost every account of the murder, at least every account I've seen.</dd>
<dd>If you think certain sentences can be better-structured grammatically, by all means, attempt to rephrase them (preferably all in a single large edit), and add a <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">footnote</a> reference as suggested in the Wikipedia style manuals. A good-faith edit utilizing <i>existing sources listed in the article</i> (or adding new ones like this <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/1.html" rel="nofollow">crimelibrary.com</a> article) would improve this article much more than tagging. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 09:36, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is lacking in context and background regarding Brandon's life. For example, there is nothing about her rejection by the military, nor her arrest for check forgery, the publicising of which led directly to her so called "friends" learning she wasn't a boy raping then subsequently murdering her and two others. The article also gives not a hint that she was in the habit of carefully witholding that information from people (including the females she dated). <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 20:10, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Transgender status is defined by the <i>existence</i> of a difference between one's biological sex and their gender identity, <i>not</i> by whether they've completed the process of surgical reassignment. And transgender people are referred to by the pronouns of their gender <i>identity</i>. This does not require sources; it's the <i>only</i> correct usage for transgender people — that some mainstream media don't understand that doesn't make it any less true, and it doesn't constitute a valid reason for <i>Wikipedia</i> to disregard correct usage. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:49, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gwen, the source you're looking for is <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28identity%29_da8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)</a>. There's no point in looking for an <i>outside</i> source because the English language has no central authority, no universally agreed-upon rule book to check. In the absence of such an authority, we have to play by the rules of the system we're in, in this case Wikipedia. We're here on their dime. When in Rome, we have to do as Rome does -- and if a rule is wrong, then our argument is with the <i>rule</i>, not with its enforcers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Conversely... Bearcat, don't you think that rule is a little hard to find? I was curious about the pronoun use here too, so I checked some of the natural places like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">Transgender</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_transgender-related_topics.html" title="List of transgender-related topics">List of transgender-related topics</a>, but they said nothing about it. I had to find that link on a talk page. I can see not addressing pronoun usage here, but surely it should be addressed in the main <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">Transgender</a> article at least. ~ <a href="../../../c/z/e/User%7ECZeke_87e0.html" title="User:CZeke">CZeke</a> 01:08, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This isn't the first time this argument was held. Now that you mention it, I can see that the self-identification rule was cited and linked explicitly in several past discussions, but apparently not in this one. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 14:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia cannot ever be cited as a source for articles. What I respectfully believe is needed here is appropriate support from: a) scholarly, peer reviewed journals and/or b) evidence that this usage is widely evident or supported in news coverage and editorial discussion of this topic in secondary sources. As an aside, this editor has zero issue with, in principle, Brandon Teena or any other female self-identifying as a male. What I would like to establish is whether this hopefully objective, ostensibly encyclopedic and NPoV article about Brandon Teena can cite meaningful support for the casual use of these pronouns when referring to a biological female who, moreover, had undergone zero medical treatment for gender-re-assignment before being tragically and horrifically raped and then murdered (along with two others). <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 16:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For one thing, Wikipedia <i>usage rules</i> and <i>conventions</i> most certainly <i>can</i> be cited in a <i>usage</i> dispute. For another, appealing to mainstream media usage is problematic in cases where mainstream media usage can be <i>wrong</i> — it's not about whether the usage is <i>common</i>; it's about the fact that the usage is <i>correct</i>. A transgender person is not any less transgender just because they haven't had <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_reassignment_surgery.html" title="Sex reassignment surgery">sex reassignment surgery</a> yet — transgender status is defined by the <i>existence</i> of a disparity between a person's birth sex and their internal gender identity, <i>regardless</i> of how far along in the process they are. There simply isn't an issue to be <i>had</i> here, unless one completely ignores Wikipedia's policies of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28identity%29_da8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)">naming conventions</a> and respect for the article topics. You simply can't <i>get</i> to the position that the pronoun usage is even a matter of <i>debate</i> unless you start from the notion that either transgender is fundamentally an invalid identity in the first place, or Brandon Teena himself was lying about it. And either one of those is an unacceptably biased position to take in a neutral analysis of the topic. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see anyone arguing that WP is to be used as a source. And the policy (not source, policy) on proper use of pronouns is based on self-identification, not medical treatment. Scholarly, peer-reviewed journals are not required to determine proper pronoun usage. If peer-reviewed journals can help to improve the article then bring them on - but the pronoun usage will be unaffected. It's policy and it's proper. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 19:50, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I could not find a citation for the basing of the song <i>Girls Don't Cry</i> on Brandon Teena, and PSBs' website is flash-oriented, so I didn't even bother looking there because it can't be direct-linked.

<p>Noticing the recent flurry of activity on the article, I still don't see any scholarly citations supporting the use of pronouns reflected in this article. I recognize that some editors who are watching this page have very strong opinions about the appropriate gender of pronouns to implement here but opinions alone, no matter how strongly asserted, are nothing more than original research, which according to WP policy is not acceptable for article content. Moreover, WP policy regarding self-identification seems strictly limited to the user space. Am I missing seeing the citations which support this usage? I need help here: Since I am unaware of any shred of evidence that there is scholarly, peer-reviewed support for this usage, please accept this as a respectful request for acceptable citations (even from DSM) which would support the use of applying male pronouns to the murder victim described in this article.

<p>It seems there are differing opinions of the proper pronoun for Brandon Teena. Though these are opinions (and therefore objective), many of the people on the talk page continually consider themselves to be absolutely accurate. According to the "ethical" definition, Brandon Teena should be called a man and therefore referred to as a "he" but according to the "scientific" definition of a man Teena should be referred to as a she, especially considering Brandon Teena does not match any of the qualifications (which would make the gender ambiguous) specified by Dysprosia (and therefore has no medical defintion as a man). I'm not supportive of either side of the debate; I merely care about the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia that is clearly not being met here. Wikipedia is not here to discuss "feelings" and while it may be socially and morally unacceptable to address a transgendered person as anything other than what they wish to be adressed as, it is still necessary to remain entirely objective, and feelings are certainly difficult to objectively discuss.(71.234.63.192 22:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>The support provided in the past was from highly specialized advocacy sites. I'm not fighting WP policy at all. Please stick to the topic. I'm asking for a scholarly citation supporting the article's implicit assertion that Brandon Teena self-identified with male personal pronouns. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 06:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if what Ryan said was wrong, this is a biographical article, and a "scholarly citation" is not required to prove an issues of fact - something such as a newspaper article will do just fine. Brandon Teena was very widely referred to as "he" in the press at that time, because, like Wikipedia, the vast majority of the reputable press has similar points in their manuals of style. Thus we do similarly. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 06:55, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>All I've seen here have been references on advocacy sites. Could you please point me to some newspaper or wire articles which support your statement <i>Brandon Teena was very widely referred to as "he" in the press at that time</i>. I would also appreciate seeing a few citations supporting your assertion that <i>like Wikipedia, the vast majority of the reputable press has similar points in their manuals of style</i>.

<dd>'Self-identification' is the standard on Wikipedia, not 'scholarly and specific proof an individual used certain specific pronouns'. Personally I find it incredible that you can accept that Brandon Teena used a male name and identified as male and DIDN'T use male pronouns. I think you'd need to prove your POV, not demand speciifc scholarly proof about the specific question of pronoun usage. -- 07:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop trying to deflect this discussion away from the requested citaions which so far, don't seem to be forthcoming. Only for clarity, I'll repeat my request. I would like citations (for the first they don't even have to be scholarly, multiple mainstream press and wire publications will do) supporting the following two assertions:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Brandon Teena was very widely referred to as "he" in the press at that time</i></li>
<li><i>like Wikipedia, the vast majority of the reputable press has similar points in their manuals of style</i></li>

<dd>Not gonna happen, least not from me. Citations for those assertions (what the press does) are not required to validate the current policy of using a transgendered person's self-identification as the deciding factor regarding pronouns. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 07:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Following that, I take it you reject <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a>'s use of the press as a posible means of support for the use of these pronouns? Likewise her assertion that the manuals of style used by these organizations would support this use?

<dd>That's cool. Given that you're citing WP policy regarding self-identification, please provide a scholarly citation supporting the article's implicit assertion that Brandon Teena self-identified with male personal pronouns. Alternately (and reasonably put) I think a scholarly citation supporting an assertion that Brandon consistently identified as a "transgendered male" will do. I understand how potentially sensitive this discussion is. My only concern is encyclopedic and my support of WP policy is a given. Meanwhile I've only ever seen unsupported assertions along these lines on advocacy sites and personal webpages. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 07:57, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>So far, the use of male personal pronouns on the article appears to be unsupported, but retained in the article only by aggressive baiting and other threatening edits by two or more users. There may indeed be scholarly support for the use of male personal pronouns in this article, but it's not cited. Never mind you guys are calling me a troll and a transphobe or whatever, I utterly understand how you might misinterpret my questions and requests concerning such a sensitive and emotional topic. I support Wikipedia policy and accordingly would like to see some acceptable citations backing up these assertions. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 08:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I said, here's one from the BBC: "But Brandon's mother JoAnn is campaigning for justice for her child, who was born Teena Brandon but <b>flipped her names when she started living as a boy."</b> and <b>"Brandon, 21, had lived as a boy for several years, strapping her breasts down, wearing men's clothes and padding her underwear with socks. She was also dating a woman, Lana Tisdale, who initially believed she was a boy but remained with her when she discovered the truth. Six days before she died Brandon was attacked and raped by Lotter and Nissen, who had recently found out she was actually a girl."</b> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3219591.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3219591.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Brandon Teena was living as a man when he was murdered.

<dd><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a>, thanks for that. It's a start. My first concern is that this news article doesn't refer to Brandon with male personal pronouns (it refers to Brandon as "she"). If anything, I think this supports changing the pronoun usage in the Wikipedia article (although I'm aware you choose to derive support strictly through your interpretation of the self-identification element of WP policy and I respect that).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, there may indeed be scholarly support for the assertion that Brandon self identified as a male transexual but while this BBC article uses the phrase "lived as a boy," while similar, that's not the same thing as "male transexual," nor is the BBC article a scholarly, peer reviewed journal. I know this seems to annoy you and I'm not happy about being a part of that. Meanwhile, I think the BBC article you've cited wholly supports changing the implementation of personal pronouns in the article. I would add that it at least supports the notion that such a change would not be considered vandalism and that the use of that term in revert headers is inappropriate. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 08:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After having it explained to you a half-dozen times, I believe you now should know that <b>press-identification is not the standard - self-identification is. The BBC citation (as well as many others) makes clear Brandon Teena's SELF-identification, and that's enough for WP. The pronouns THE PRESS employs are irrelevant.</b> Your argument is specious, and yet you ignore the arguments of others. Honestly, Gwen, a reasonable person could at this point perceive your conduct as tendentious and your intention to be trolling. Please don't provide any more evidence to support that view.

They verify to <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a>, the massive Dow Jones-run database of most newspaper articles from virtually all major newspapers in the last three decades.

<p>Meanwhile your sarcasm and personal attacks are not helpful. Please stop that. Please support your assertion that <i>like Wikipedia, the vast majority of the reputable press has similar points in their manuals of style</i>. So far, I think I've at least demonstrated that referring to Brandon Teena as a she is not vandalsim, nor the act of a troll. Moreover, <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> has shown that the BBC referred to BT as a she. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 10:51, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've pointed out that there were very few references to Brandon Teena as "she" in the English-language press in the last five years (since the AP changed their MOS), or at least not out of the millions of articles archived on Factiva. I've given you a sample from a wide variety of different, highly-reputable news sources. You've given me one article. I also find it amusing that the same person who was three hours ago insisting on "scholarly citations" is now relying on an IMDB review and two personal websites to try and back up her argument. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 11:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a number of concerns here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have not at all supported your assertion that there are very few references to BT as a she in the English-language press and your assertions that you have done are troubling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, the cites you provided to support the use of <i>he</i> mostly don't verify at all, except mostly to advocacy sites. This doesn't at all match previous experiences I've had in successfully tracking down wire and print articles on the web. Yeah, this may bear further work on my part.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your subjective use of the term "highly reputable" is fraught with opportunities for PoV, intimidation, misunderstanding and unsupported assertion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I haven't given you any articles at all. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> provided the article in response to a request I made.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I specifically characterized the Google spot check as unscientific and provided it to you only as a courtesy, to show you that BT is indeed referred to as a she in the mainstream. I'd never use a personal website to support any edit I might make to an article (and I don't think I ever have). Please don't conflate my good faith attempt to quickly show you some casual pronoun usage with my request that you provide scholarly, peer reviewed support for the use of male personal pronouns in the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As an aside though, and an important one, I do assert that referring to the murder victim as a she is neither trollish, transphobic, nor vandalism, as demonstrated by the BBC article cited by <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> and the interview with BT's mother which appears on the commercial site in the Google list (yes, I'm finally "giving" you a single article, but only to support this, my only direct assertion so far).</li>

<dd>I have given you plenty of sources for Brandon Teena being referred to as "he" in a variety of highly reputable mainstream media, and I have given you enough information to verify this on your own, whether by Factiva itself or by checking newspaper archives. I have pointed out that I found very, very few sources that referred to him as "she", which you are welcome to also verify by Factiva. If your "successful experience in tracking down articles" involves whacking a few words into Google, I suggest you get some more experience. Nearly all of the "mainstream" sources you referred to referred to him as he; only an IMDB review and two personal websites referred otherwise. This is not verifiable evidence in the slightest. I've indulged you and provided sources to counter your claims; you have not provided the slightest evidence to back up your own.

<p>The first link refers to an AP story before they changed their MOS in late 2001, so that isn't particularly relevant these days. The second has quotes from a lot of biased parties, with both used about equally. The third was quoted above. The fourth is a movie review from some random university student website, and hardly very reliable. The fifth is a movie review from a student newspaper. And the sixth is an opinion piece on a website. You are trying to claim that this article should use female pronouns, yet so far you've been able to come up with all of one instance of that usage in a reputable source. Until you actually provide some sort of reputable evidence to back up your claims (beyond citing random websites you found in Google), then I think we're wasting our time here. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 12:18, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, you're mistaken about those links. The first is a copy of an Associated Press article referring to BT as a she. The second is a personal page at an edu site which I threw in only because it seems well-written. The third is a BBC article referring to BT as a she. The fourth is a University of Nevada Outpost movie review. The fifth is a Yale Herald article and the sixth is Salon. "one instance of that usage in a reputable source"? Hardly. My only purpose in citing these particular examples is to support my assertion that referring to BT as a she is neither trollish, nor transphobic, nor vandalistic. By the bye her mother refers to her as a she, as referenced above.

The site attributes the information to the PSB official site, which is flash-based and therefore not very searcheable or linkable. I googled part of the quote he provides, and I can't find another source for it. Quite a few people seem to believe the song is about BT, but a solid citation from the songwriters would be preferable. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 17:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please see my comment above. I trust you realize that ongoing, persistent attempts to ignore WP pronoun usage policy on a BIO page of a murdered transsexual (rather than dealing with the policy issue on the relevant page) is a bad idea.

<dd>I read parts of the essay, and it seems to be promoting an agenda rather than providing information about Brandon Teena's life and death. I think its strongly POV nature advises against including it in Wikipedia, unless in the context of an opinion of one of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a>-related articles. In that sense the website (rather than the specific essay) is rather important, because it delineated a not-often-exposed reaction of the transgender identity. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../l/e/a/User_talk%7ELeaHazel_3faf.html" title="User talk:LeaHazel">talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LeaHazel_6e08.html" title="Special:Contributions/LeaHazel">contribs</a> 14:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The anti-transgender views of some radical feminists is well-known (Janice Raymond's book, for example) but this website is an anonymous set of essays and as such doesn't meet the level of reputability to serve as a source for WP... and of course incorporating the POV of such radical feminist condemnation to the bio page of a murdered transsexual is highly questionable. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 15:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for pointing this out - there's a low-key edit war over the cited material that introduces these names. An IP editor who claims to have been there, but has not yet provided contradictory sources of information, keeps blanking the bit that intro's those names. <b><i><a href="../../../z/u/e/User%7EZuejay_84ee.html" title="User:Zuejay"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue">Zue</font></a></i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zuejay_251c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zuejay"><font face="Times New Roman" color="blue">Jay</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../z/u/e/User_talk%7EZuejay_2f5e.html" title="User talk:Zuejay">talk</a>)</small></b> 14:56, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anon keeps reverting the section stating that Brandon Teena had dated Lisa Lambert prior to the murders, citing personal experience. Needless to say, that's not sufficient for WP. The anon then put a link in to what appears to be a Dutch site, without apparent attribution or verifiability that did not appear to back up the assertion. In a few minutes of searching I found this:</p>

<dd><i>(December 03, 1996) Marvin Thomas Nissen, serving a life sentence for the 1993 shooting deaths of Brandon Teena, his girlfriend Lisa Lambert, and friend Phillip DeVine, will try to convince the State Supreme Court in Nebraska this week that he deserves a new trial due to errors made by police and the judge. <a href="http://www.glaad.org/publications/archive_detail.php?id=1144&amp;PHPSESSID=f" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.glaad.org/publications/archive_detail.php?id=1144&amp;PHPSESSID=f" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></i></dd>

<p>If there is indeed a source to substantiate they were not dating, please provide it. I frankly don't care about this issue either way, but we need to reflect the verifiable facts of this case in the article, not anonymous accounts.

<p>I am the anon you talk of and I am at a loss of how to provide proof of what is in my head. My ex is the former Carrie Gross, Lisa Lamberts roommate at the time of the murders. This is substantiated in both a book "All She Wanted", thru numerous articles on line, and several TV shows including A&amp;E American Justice "The Life and Death of Teena Brandon" plus the doc "The Brandon Teena Story". If anyone would know the actual facts it would be Lisa Lamberts former roommate. She has stated that Brandon and Lisa were never an item and never dated. I have yet to see any truly verifiable source that says they were actually dating. As for me, I have a site on Yahoo: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Brandon93/" class="external free" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Brandon93/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Brandon93/</a> It is a member only site to keep out porn bots, so just ask and I will be more than happy to open the door for you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12:04, 31 March 2007 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12%7E04%2C_31_March_2007_51e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/12:04, 31 March 2007">contribs</a>) 63.215.29.115.</small></p>

<dd>Unfortunately WP isn't a news agency, and since your representation is also not a first hand account, but only hearsay ('my ex knew the victim'), I can't see how WP can accept your account as fact without verifiable, notable corroboration. Right now, GLAAD and other sources represent Lisa Lambert as Brandon's 'girlfriend', making the clear representation that they were 'a couple' at the time of the murders. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 22:22, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am trying to understand your point. How is it GLAAD has information that is correct, when I knew the victim on a personal basis and mine is hearsay? My ex not only knew all 3 victims, she was living in the same house as all 3. How is it GLAAD knows more than any of us who were there? I am trying to understand what makes them a verifiable source of information over someone they never knew, and not a spinner of tall tails to advance their own agenda.</p>

<dd>Here's the short version - I think it's clear WP cannot recognize you as a valid source of information for the following reasons: 1. you are an anonymous user claiming to have knowledge that contradicts a notable source's account of a public event. You need to establish your identity and credentials as a witness and provide your account in some other forum (because WP is an encyclopedia, not a news agency) or point to a notable, verifiable source that has already published an account that corroborates your view. If you have any more questions about your validity as a source for the article, I recommend you raise the issue on one of the administrators' pages, like <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. -- <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanFreisling_b27b.html" title="User:RyanFreisling">User:RyanFreisling</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanFreisling_aab0.html" title="User talk:RyanFreisling">@</a> 00:59, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No. No more questions. I am done with wiki. Thanks for checking out my web site to verify who I am. Good day.</p>
