<p><b>NOTE</b>: I am the one who basically created the framework of this article. Though it has been edited by several people over the last year or so, I am for the most part the person who wrote this article. When I wrote this article I was new to Wikipedia and did not know about inserting references after major statements. Rather than doing that, I wrote the article out in the style of a review or a magazine article, and I placed the sources in the "external links" section. So, statements made in this article are indeed sourced; they just aren't sourced in the traditional Wikipedia style. They are found in the External Links section. Now that I know about proper statement citation, I will add them over the coming weeks. Can everyone please have some patience about this? This article was but a pitiful stub when I found it. My only intention was to give Brad and his fans (myself among them) something he deserves - a good article. This isn't an ego trip for me. If anyone else would come along and write a better article, and I'm sure others would be capable of it, I'd step aside and let them do that. So far, I'm basically the only person willing to devote extended periods of time to this article. So, please everyone, remember that Wikipedia thing about "assuming good faith", okay? Thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 11:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Andrew,</p>
<p>I see you really spent a lot of time on this article and props for that.</p>
<p>I wonder if the content in the intro paragraph, about comparaing to Kurt Cobain and all, is really left best fo a sub heading comparing the two artists. (and then there should maybe be a cross-reference on the Kurt Cobain page somewhere linking back to this brad nowell page?) I was going to put in the change myself, but thought it best to ask your opinion. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattarata_b773.html" title="User:Mattarata">Mattarata</a> 18:35, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the intro paragraphs are a bit long. The reason I made the Cobain comparison was to qualify the impact Bradley did have as opposed to the impact he was expected to have. That gives a way for readers to put in context the tragedy of his death. Whether people like Kurt Cobain or not, he was voted Artist of the Decade by Rolling Stone magazine, and his impact was huge. I think it's saying a lot that Time magazine suggested that Bradley Nowell may've been the "next" Kurt Cobain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other reason I think the comparison is important to make early on is because Bradley Nowell died before he even became famous. I mean, hand-in-hand with Bradley's fame is the awareness of his death and the impact of his death. Unlike Kurt Cobain, Bradley Nowell really didn't have the opportunity to become famous and establish a reputation before he died. For most of his fans, now, Bradley Nowell is known as the talented musician who died tragically before his time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At any rate, if you decide to edit the introductory paragraphs, maybe you could lop off the third through fifth paragraphs and place them in another category further down the page. You're right that, for being introductory paragraphs, the following three paragraphs perhaps go too deeply into discussion of the comparison between Cobain and Nowell. But I think at least the first two paragraphs should stay, because the second paragraph ends with a description of what Nowell might have been had he not died.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And thanks for talking with me before any major changes. I'm certainly not the "owner" of this page, but you're right that I put a lot of work into it and it means a lot to me.</dd>

<p>Someone has been going through this article and changing the "Bradleys" and "Nowells" into "Brads." My thought is that since this is attempting to take the tone of an encyclopedia, he should be identified as "Bradley Nowell" in the beginning of the article and "Nowell" for the remainder of the article, except when in direct quotes by others he is referred to as "Brad" or "Bradley." Whatever the case, I'm too tired right now to go through and revert the article. But somehow I don't think calling him "Brad" is okay with this particular article. It makes it sound like we know him personally. I love the guy, but I never met him personally, so I don't feel comfortable referring to him as "Brad."

<p>I think the article is starting to get to a point close to what I'd like it to look like. I think Brad deserves a good page, so I'm trying to provide him with that.

<dd>Removed picture of him trying to eat his rabbit. Maybe you can find a better picture regarding his love of animals other than dinner.

<dd>Note. The picture this user refers to was found on a Sublime website. The image was not of Bradley Nowell "eating" his pet rabbit, but of him playing with his rabbit. The image underscores Bradley's love of animals, and it was used in the section of the article about his childhood. Further, as evidence of the acceptability of the image, the image in question has been reproduced in the sleeves and inserts of various official Sublime albums. Foolscape may think the image distasteful, but Nowell's heirs, Nowell's bandmates, and Nowell's label, found the image fit for publication -- as did I, which was why I had uploaded it here. I thought it was a beautiful picture that illustrated the playful and loving nature of a beautiful man. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 11:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most Sublime fans know that Brad had a habit of expressing his affection for his pets in an unusual way. I've seen footage of him playing with Lou Dog, footage of Lou Dog licking Brad and Brad licking Lou Dog's tongue in return. Such footage is not hard to find. Go to YouTube and search for a video of Brad Nowell. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 13:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey man still going strong well done... Don't worry about not being into the band when they were playing you have done more than 80% of sublime fans out there.... question heard a rumor here in australia gwen staffani (spelling.. no doubt chick) is writing a book on brad is this true or just crap??? anyway takecare dude keep working ill keep checking lol looks great!! love you brad wish you were still here cause we like the music loud in this here band..-Chris Donnelly-</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's very true: by the time the vast majority of us became fans, Brad was already dead. Very sad. I wasn't a fan of Kurt Cobain during his life, but at least I knew who he was -- and I knew that when he died it was an important event (hard to miss it because it was all over the media). But with Brad, there was nothing. This concept of a pop/rock singer becoming famous <i>after</i> his/her death, it's a bit odd, like <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Cassidy_190d.html" title="Eva Cassidy">Eva Cassidy</a>.</dd>

<p>Isn't stating that he "<b>died</b> as the result of a <b>fatal</b> heroin overdose" a bit redundant? If it wasn't a fatal dose, he wouldn't have died. 65.189.210.173 21:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it's redundant. But such is Wikipedia. I'm the one who originally wrote the sentence, then someone else came along and edited in the "fatal dose" bit, and now we have a redundant sentence.
