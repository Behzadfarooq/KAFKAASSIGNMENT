<p>Has anyone looked into the how much political support if any Bradley garnered from this bill? Has he commented on special cases - coma cases, etc? Has he ever been extremely poor? In other words, is he able to empathize with the plight of a poor father whose wife decided she perhaps could do better and whose job was outsourced to India or Mexico, for example?</p>
<p>I think that answers to these kinds of questions would improve the article.</p>

<li>Real law. Real social problem that has been independently discussed. Unwikified and POV first draft, but that's cause for Clean-up, not deletion. Keep.

<p>I prefer the term Bradley Amendment because that is how it is referred to in technical articles:</p>
<pre>
 The 1986 U.S. law nicknamed the Bradley Amendment.

<p>A contents section could be added if someone wanted to add yet another Bradley admentment. This page is about how uncaring the U.S. Congress bureaucracy has become. A bureaucracy that won't even allow a state, much less a judge, to consider individual cases. It is of particular concern to all males, especially those in the U.S.</p>

<li>Rossami is right that clean up is appropriate, if clean up can do it. We need a lawyer or a contemporary historian, and <i>no divorced fathers</i> or ideologues. That's a tall order for Clean Up. Let it go there with an amendment in its discussion saying that it ought to come back here, with prejudice, if it is unimproved in a month. Before anyone says it, I do have a reason for putting a time limit on it: the persistence of a rant on our space is unlike the persistence of a stub. It leaves us prejudicial and POV. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:18, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<p>Hah.</p>
<p>All *knowledge* is subjective. The winners write the histories as it was once said.</p>
<p>If you think that you can write some kind of antiseptic "truth" in this Wikipedia -- I think you are sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>I know Jeff. I know that his life has been severely affected by the Bradley Amendment.</p>
<p>Is that not knowledge?</p>
<p>Jeff is exposing not only the Amendment, but its deleterious affect on Men. And why not? He "knows" through experience.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia claims to be an "encyclopedia" -- and it uses a form of Open Source Knowledge to do so...yet, here you are, the Pharasees of truth, trying to censure it.</p>

<p>I think the page that I created does at least a fair job of explaining a very important U.S. law. One that is much discussed by the U.S. government itself, state and local. Feel free to do better yourself.</p>
<p>I provided an example, the only one I know about. Examples are not evil POVs, they are the best teaching tool.</p>
<p>I welcome you all to also add your own examples, if you have them. The more the better. And no, I don't care if your examples are radically different than mine. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_relf_9ca3.html" title="User:Jeff relf">Jeff relf</a> 09:47, Aug 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
It is not sufficient to couch your own personal opinions in wording such as "some people say" or "it is believed by some". You cannot possibly claim NPOV for this article, because not only does it slant the treatment of the subject very narrowly towards your own opinions (there is nothing from any opposing view, no pro- arguments taken from Congressional records or court cases to baland the con- arguments, etc.), but it is deliberately written to evoke a certain value judgement in the reader, with off-topic details of worst-case exaggerated hypothetical cases. After all of that, the article ends with "One way or another, this is an abuse." (Plenty of other statements are borderline POV though written as if to pretend that they are not, such as "This renders all state statutes of limitations meaningless.")</p>
<p>It is clear, if only from that last statement, that the purpose of creating this article on the subject was for you to push an agenda, which is POV.</p>
<p>Nor is NPOV best achieved by a battle of contrarian examples (which I could easily give you from my own family's experiences) being waged in the edit history of an article. An encyclopedia is the summarization and culmination of facts and considerations, not a battleground for opinion or even debate. No, an encyclopedia should stand back from the battle and then report on how the dust settles.</p>
<p>It should strive not to take sides, as your article plainly has.</p>
<p>I don't think there is anything much at all salvagable in the current article. There is too much to strip away and nothing readily available to replace it with.</p>

 But show real-live examples,

 is damn near incomprehensible.
 If, as seems likely, no one is interested in doing that,
 and if, as also seem evident, 
 you don't trust me to do the cleaning... 
 Then remember this: 
   People will remain ignorant of this law.

<li>This law effects all Americans, not just me. It also effects people in other countries, as we live in a very global society.

If you want to <i>clean it up</i>, as you say, then I think that'd be a good idea. If you don't... well, all the more <i>ignorance</i> will prevail. How would that benefit you, <i>Keith</i> ?</li>

<li>I have now completely rewritten the article. Please judge it on its current merits. It's not perfect yet but no Wikipedia article ever is. The facts are all supportable.

<li>Considering the cultural consensus (as determined by <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukeofomnium_095c.html" title="User:Dukeofomnium">Dukeofomnium</a>'s Google search, stated above) that "the Bradley amendment" most commonly refers to this particular law, the name is appropriate. In other words, given the cultural consensus, the majority of people looking for info on "the Bradley amendment" will be looking for this one. Given that, I would almost argue that even if we do see articles on other Bradley amendments, that this should be the default topic, with a disambiguation link preface. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">KeithTyler</a> 17:23, Sep 9, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> now. The current article <i>seems</i> NPOV, reasonably well written (probably above the Wikipedia average) and is quite comprehensible. The unsalvagable original did not even make clear what the problem was. As to its name, it could be renamed as Bradley Amendment (1986) or Bradley Amendment, 1986 or something like that to avoid confusion with any other Bradley Amendment. But that could wait until such time, if ever, that another article on another Bradley Amendement is written. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 16:37, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd><tt>However, the above statistics may be misleading because child support cases are typically closed after four years of inactivity. Closed or not, the Bradley Amendment makes all arrearages final judgements, greatly simplifying collections.</tt></dd>

<p>HHS statistics are Very deceptive, because cases are typically closed after four years of inactivity.</p>
<p>Automatically making past-due child-support a Final_Judgement is how the Bradley_Amendment facilitates collection. Collection is it's raison d'etre.</p>

<dd>I'm not disputing your assertion. I just don't understand it. How does the fact that "cases are typically closed after four years of inactivity" create bias or perception of bias in the HHS statistics? If there is bias and if that bias is relevant to the topic of this article, then we must explain it clearly enough to be understandable to any future reader/editor.

<p>By some estimates, including U.S. census data, a million or more men have left the official work force in the last 30 years or so, disappearing into the so_called invisible economy, a.k.a. the informal economy.</p>
<p>So there are men and women who are effected by Automatic_Final_Judgements even though the state has closed their cases and HHS' statistics ignore them.</p>
<p>Automatic_Final_Judgements prevent men from reentering the visible economy for fear of losing everything in a seizure. Even when the past-due debt is 40 years old. Even when the obligee has long since become a former_mother.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just being particularly dense today but I still don't understand the relevance of your proposed addition. The paragraph in question currently reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Sherri Z. Heller, Ed.D, Commissioner of U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement, the child support system collects "about 58% of current support due." The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 68% of child support cases had arrearages owed in 2003 (a figure up from 53% in 1999). Some believe that the process can never collect the full amount because a high proportion of obligors are unable to make the required payments. According to Ford Foundation Project Officer Ronald B. Mincy, between 16 percent and 33 percent of obligors are "turnip dads" (obligors earning less than $130 a week). According to one study (<a href="http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/cse/new/csr9701.htm#9701c|" class="external free" title="http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/cse/new/csr9701.htm#9701c|" rel="nofollow">http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/cse/new/csr9701.htm#9701c|</a>) 38% of non-custodial parents not paying child-support said they lacked the money to pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find the theme of the paragraph in the third sentence. To paraphrase, "A says the Bradley Amendment is good because so much child support is unpaid and A implies that it's unpaid by choice. B says that A's analysis is flawed because a big chunk can never be paid - a problem the Bradley Amendment does not and can not address." If HHS's statistic had included closed cases, are you arguing that the 68% statistic would be higher or lower? In that case, how would the theme of this paragraph be any different? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 22:02, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Ok, I made it like this then:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The numbers above omit closed cases. Typically, cases are closed after four years of inactivity. Open or closed, past-due child support is still automatically a final judgement, thus non expiring and easy to collect.</dd>

<p>Whats happened to the repeal effort since 2004? theres no current information? Or did it fail?</p>
<p>I'm guessing feminist groups are fighting hard behind the scenes to keep that from happening?216.52.163.1 19:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)LUID</p>
