<p>William Bradford Bishop, Jr. was born in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasadena%2C_California_0cce.html" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena, California</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>. He received a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Science_1c0e.html" title="Bachelor of Science">BS</a> in history from <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale</a>, and an <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Arts_%28postgraduate%29_2f46.html" title="Master of Arts (postgraduate)">MA</a> in international studies (with a concentration in Africa) from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California_04ab.html" title="University of California">University of California</a> system. He also attended <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlebury_College_8241.html" title="Middlebury College">Middlebury College</a>.</p>
<p>After his graduation from Yale in 1959, he served 4 years in Army counterintelligence. Bishop is reported to speak five languages fluently: English, French, Serbo-Croatian, Italian and Spanish.</p>
<p>Bishop joined the U.S. State Department and served in the U.S. Foreign Service in many postings overseas. This included postings in the Italian cities of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verona.html" title="Verona">Verona</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>, and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a> (where he did post-graduate work at the University of Florence). He also served as a foreign service officer in Africa including posts in <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addis_Ababa_a075.html" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, and in <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gaborone.html" title="Gaborone">Gaborone</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botswana.html" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>. His last posting was at State Department Headquarters in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> as an Assistant Chief in the Division of Special Activities and Commercial Treaties.</p>
<p>As of early 1976, he and his wife Annette (age 37) had three sons, ages 5,10 and 14. He was 39 years old, anticipating a promotion, and was using a prescription anti-depressant drug called <a href="../../../o/x/a/Oxazepam.html" title="Oxazepam">Serax</a>, which can be addictive. On the afternoon of March 1, he learned he would not receive the promotion he had hoped for.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Bishop_5e77.html" title="Edit section: The Murders">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Murders</span></h2>
<p>After learning of this career disappointment, Bishop told his secretary he didn’t feel well and left work early. On the way home he bought both a ball-peen hammer and a gas can, which he filled at a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filling_station.html" title="Filling station">gas station</a>. Police believe that he used the hammer to kill first his wife, then his mother when she returned home from walking the family's golden retriever, and finally his three sons in their beds.</p>
<p>With the bodies loaded into the family station wagon, Bishop drove 275 miles (about 6 hours' drive) to a densely wooded area off North Carolina highway 94, about five miles south of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia%2C_North_Carolina_2c48.html" title="Columbia, North Carolina">Columbia, North Carolina</a>. There, he dug a shallow hole where he piled the bodies, doused them with gasoline, and set them ablaze. The next day, March 2, a North Carolina state forest ranger was dispatched by a spotter in a fire tower to an area where smoke was rising from the trees. The ranger discovered the burned bodies and a shovel with a label from a Bethesda, Maryland store.</p>
<p>It was later confirmed that Bishop visited a sporting goods store in <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacksonville%2C_North_Carolina_bfc2.html" title="Jacksonville, North Carolina">Jacksonville, North Carolina</a> that same day and used his credit card to purchase tennis shoes. According to witnesses, he had the family dog with him on a leash, and was possibly but not certainly accompanied by a woman described as "dark skinned". All later sightings of Bishop are unconfirmed.</p>
<p>A week later, on March 10th, a neighbor of the Bishops in the Carderock Springs neighborhood in <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethesda%2C_Maryland_ea2e.html" title="Bethesda, Maryland">Bethesda, Maryland</a> grew concerned about the family's absence. The neighbor found the front door unlocked and entered to discover blood-spattered walls and floors, and then called police. Shortly afterward, dental records were used to confirm that the bodies found in North Carolina were the Bishop family.</p>
<p>On March 18, the Bishop family car was found abandoned at a campground in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park_2cb2.html" title="Great Smoky Mountains National Park">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a>, about 400 miles from the Columbia-area pyre. The car contained dog biscuits and a bloody blanket; the spare-tire well in the trunk was full of blood.</p>
<p>On March 19 a grand jury indicted Bishop on five counts of first degree murder and other charges. Evidence included his disappearance, the sighting afterward in the vicinity of the bodies, and bloody stains inside the family home that matched both his fingerprints and the blood of his family members.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Bishop_5e77.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Bishop had approximately one week of advance time before the authorities even began looking for him and could have traveled on his U.S. diplomatic passport. Because of the methods of air travel and immigration in 1976 throughout much of the world, he could easily have avoided leaving a paper trail of any kind.</p>
<p>Since 1976 Bishop has been allegedly sighted numerous times in Belgium, England, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The three sightings noted by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marshals_Service_ef55.html" title="United States Marshals Service">United States Marshals Service</a> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In July 1978, Bishop was seen by an acquaintance of the Bishop family in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm%2C_Sweden_ad9f.html" title="Stockholm, Sweden">Stockholm, Sweden</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In January 1979, Bishop was seen in a water closet in <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorrento%2C_Italy_10dd.html" title="Sorrento, Italy">Sorrento, Italy</a> by a co-worker who had worked closely with him at the State Department. Bishop ran when hailed by the co-worker.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On September 19, 1994 on a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basel%2C_Switzerland_e1ff.html" title="Basel, Switzerland">Basel, Switzerland</a> train platform, a neighbor who knew Bishop and his family in Bethesda, Maryland reported that she saw Bishop from a few feet away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternate theories that Bishop died or committed <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park_2cb2.html" title="Great Smoky Mountains National Park">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a> or that he had defected to the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> are not seen as credible by the police at this time.</p>
