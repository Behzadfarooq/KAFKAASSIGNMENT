<p>I very highly doubt that brampton will have 123,344,334,222,000 people in 25 years.</p>
<p>Could we get the right date of incorporation here? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. The City of Brampton has three "birthdates" - in 1973, it had the Centennial celebrations (the town incorporation in 1873) and in 2003, there was the sesqicentennial celebration, marking the 1953 incorporation as a village. Of course, 1974, the formation of the city, was also marked in 1999 for the 25th anniversary. The city really should pick one date and stick with it to mark. --<a href="../../../s/p/m/User%7ESpmarshall42_1a3c.html" title="User:Spmarshall42">Spmarshall42</a> 00:55, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note the sign saying welcome to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brampton.html" title="Brampton">Brampton</a> says the population is 386,000 and that was changed in 2004. However the mayor said in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brampton.html" title="Brampton">Brampton</a> guradian (april,29th,2005) that the population of brampton is 412,000. Has brampton's population jumped by 100,000 since 1999????</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bet your bottom dollar it has. That's estimated, based on new homes and other records. Also, there's hundreds of homes in Brampton that are, shall we put it, "over capacity", and would likely boost the numbers a thousand higher. But such stats have never included people illegally in the country, or who deny existance in the census. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">user:zanimum</a></dd>

<p>Brampton was such a only 220,000 people in 1995 i remember. Population climbing by 180,000 in ten years is insane. I think we should add two things about this page. One the growth and the demographics of the city which i very interested in knowing. Brampton is a growing city with a population confirmed over 400,000. Wow this city has grown alot. It all started in 1999 when the North of Brampton got developed a lot!!</p>

<li>As per a request by <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil-hong_fac9.html" title="User:Phil-hong">user:Phil-hong</a> I made this page a new, more updated looking info box. Because of the "interesting" format of Brampton's City Council, I'm a little torn on how to list the Councillors - Right now I have them all lumped together in two rows of cells "Regional" and "City" with their wards listed in brackets after their names <i>(see current article page for example)</i>. Alternatively, each ward grouping could have their own cell row - like in the example below. Let me know which one you think looks better and we can either leave it, or switch it.

<li>Like I said about the Infobox made for <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan%2C_Ontario_c875.html" title="Vaughan, Ontario">Vaughan</a>, I am terribly impressed by your work. It certainly looks a lot better than the older tables. Given the EXTREMELY confusing ward system in Brampton, I think your idea in organising the wards like that is the best, because otherwise we'll have clutter. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil-hong_fac9.html" title="User:Phil-hong">Phil-hong</a> 20:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is nothing "unprecedented" or "remarkable" about simple population growth that the City cannot cope with (due to the "Ontario" and confederate feds stealing all of our revenues, not abiding by their own laws, etc., and sorry, nothing in the Ontarios comes close to that compared to the City of Toronto).</p>

See how many pages it takes before you manage to hit little Brampton under Vaughan (page 8), Barrie (page 9), Canmore (Alta.) (Town but with over 10,000 in population), Airdrie (Alta.)

<dd>In response to your GTA comment, you're making little sense. The population growth of Toronto is staggeringly small compared to Brampton. Brampton grew by 21.3% between the 1996 and 2001 censuses (and I believe the growth rate for 2001-2006 is actually a good deal higher than that). Toronto grew by only 4%. As for Brampton and the rest of Ontario, I stand corrected, Brampton is not the second-fastest growing city in Ontario, it's the third (fourth if you include the Town of Richmond Hill, which is a town in name only). That's still pretty good. The whole issue of "remarkable" (which simply means that it's something you'd remark on) is to say it is a very fast-growing city. And it is. Choose a different word if you must, but it's not a political word, it's simply a modifer of "growth" to show that it's <i>pretty damn good growth, indeed</i>. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 16:31, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"Remarkable" means "notably or conspicuously unusual; extraordinary: a <i>remarkable change</i>. (Dictionary.com). It does not simply mean something one remarks upon unless the context is, "&lt;Whoever&gt; remarked &lt;whatever&gt;" or the like, which is explaining that someone else made a remark. Like, "Osgoodelawyer remarked ..." or do you think, lawyer, that that means the same as "Osgoodelawyer is remarkable"? It means extraordinary, unusual, and there is nothing extraordinary or unusual or remarkable about Brampton period. And it used to state <b>unprecedented</b> with no qualifier at all, as though Brampton's popuation growth, which isn't even as high as Toronto's is in reality, not "% change", has <i>never occurred on the face of the planet at any point in history</i> because there is no time qualifier either. And even if "Brampton's population growth [which is not "% change"] is unprecedented in the GTA over the last 5 years" was stated, good luck finding a verifiable source for it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Did you even read what I posted? After I specifically stated (and proved if you click on the link just above the table I posted above) that "% change" is totally worthless/meaningless in the Canadas (or Kshish 4 (B.C.) with <b>5700.0</b> in "% change" in population from the 1996 Census to the 2001 Census takes the cake in the Canadas), why would you point out what I already proved is nothing but hype; by going back to irrelevant "% change"?</li>
</ul>
<p>Brampton gained 57,177 people from the 1996 Census to the 2001 Census, so even with its little population of only 325,428 residents in 2001, how can it possibly mean anything when the City of Toronto <b>gained more people in reality</b>, 96,073 from the 1996 to 2001 censuses, with a 2001 population of <b>2,481,494</b>? You think that Brampton is going to "catch up with the City of Toronto's population" (or is at all remarkable; let alone unprecedented, which is what was stated) by <i>not</i> gaining as many people as the City of Toronto does and having nowhere close to its (irrelevant) resident population either?</p>
<p>And it's nothing against Brampton: it's simple reality with verifiable sources, which is what encyclopedias are for -- not hype. You probably "think" that I'm "hyping" Toronto but it's only because you have an inferiority complex of some sort against Toronto if that's the case. I just state the facts and make sure that they're verifiable.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada doesn't release updated population estimates for CSDs/municipalities (just CMAs) and the Assessment Office of the Ontario Ministry of Finance doesn't release any CSD/municipal population estimates; only for "counties"/Census Divisions (CDs). So amalgamate Peel into one municipality with one city hall and no regional government/council and it will be able to compare apples to apples, with verifiability, as Toronto can: because the municipality of Toronto is also a CD, unlike the rest of the GTA with its 24 (at minimum) municipal governments/councils and four regional governments/councils. --<a href="../../../s/-/r/User%7ES-Ranger_590c.html" title="User:S-Ranger">S-Ranger</a> 16:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>And don't you ever pull this crap again:</b> "I find Brampton's statistics credible. Prove they're not."</p>
<p>YOU PROVE THAT THEY ARE. YOU GET THE METHODOLOGIES, YOU MAKE DAMNED SURE THAT THEY ARE FROM A CREDIBLE SOURCE BECAUSE NO ONE CARES "WHAT YOU (or anyone else) HAPPEN TO THINK" AROUND AN ENCYCLOPEDIA. --<a href="../../../s/-/r/User%7ES-Ranger_590c.html" title="User:S-Ranger">S-Ranger</a> 17:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear S-Ranger, you are dangerously close violating <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. You have certainly violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. Claiming that I have an inferiority complex is just ridiculous. Your "shouting" above is also pretty uncalled for (and also the "threats" for me not to "pull this crap again"). I will "pull" what I find to be reasonable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you read, which you proved you do not regarding your first response, which is why I checked, you would see that I stated, "but it's only because you have an inferiority complex of some sort against Toronto <b>if that's the case.</b>" I have no idea what the case is, but simply by taking offense to what I laid out, you must have an inferiority complex or the like against Toronto (or just a Brampton inferiority complex), because I stated, "if that's the case." So you're saying that it is the case? If not, it doesn't aplly to you, so ignore it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's always interesting to see who does take offense to nothing they have been accused of. And you proved that you don't read (hence the caps; and I should have bolded it as well but didn't even mention a handle so how do you know I was referring to you?), which is exactly what I was trying to prove. The first statement and proof above is all that was necessary. Get proper verifiability (whomever, I wasn't addressing anyone) and that's that. Don't and the 2001 population is all you've (whomever, it's not an email) got that is verifiable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your claim that percentage change is meaningless by noting that some tiny communities grew by massive percentages, I can't possibly see how that means anything. That an Indian Reserve with a population of 1 in 1996 grew to 58 in 2001 (the Kshish 4 you refer to) cannot possibly be considered relevant when discussing the population growth of cities. When compared to other municipalities in Ontario with significant or larger populations, Brampton is clearly growing very fast.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Brampton is a tiny community compared to Toronto. It's not ridiculous at all. You just want it to be ridiculous because you can't figure out that "% change" means nothing when comparing the Sun to Pluto or an ocean to a puddle. The puddle may grow in area by 800% over 15 minutes, but who cares when comparing to oceans? Even with the 2 million removed from Toronto's 2001 population, Brampton still doesn't have the population of the municipality of Toronto, which makes it a puddle and allows anyone else to claim that they have 'unprecedented' (your work?) population growth (which "% change" is not) compared to Brampton.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just because <i>you</i> don't happen to find the population "% change", not growth, to be remarkable elsewhere doesn't mean a thing. I don't find Brampton to be remarkable around anything at all. Toronto has 8 times the population of Brampton (without including all of your commuters into this city), so anything with 8 times less the population of Brampton, 10 times less, 100 times less, so what? "% change" is all that matters and Brampton has no population to speak of from my perspective (let alone a global perspective; which is the perspective of Wikipedia), so why should it be any different around anyone else looking at this page with 8 times less the population of Brampton (and much higher "% change" in population) or more, to claim that their population "growth" makes Brampton look like nothing, which is almost exactly what you said about Toronto's real population growth?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So what if Brampton happens to have more population than communities you find to be irrelevant, regarding their population % change? So does Toronto -- and I also told you and proved that the City of Toronto gained more in <b>real</b> population, which totally destroys your hype. And hype is all it is. You're talking in circles and are making no sense at all.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your comments on remarkable not being what I said it was, er, your quoted "notably or conspicuously unusual" is an apt description of Brampton's population growth in percentage (which, despite your claims to the contrary, is an important indicator of growth). Whereas few cities in Ontario have a population growth of over 21%, Brampton's growth is, well, conspicuous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is the above sentence supposed to make sense? I've read it ten times and still have no idea what you're trying to say. A dictionary proved you wrong on what "remarkable" means. Period. Go complain to the dictionary. Do you know how many times I've seen these "tactics" around "Canadians" who simply cannot accept reality becauze it happens to offend them? Give it up. If you wish to express your <i>opinions</i> then go find some phpBB discussion board. This is an encyclopedia and opinions mean nothing -- only verifiable facts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First you claim that remarkable means a remark, just something that is remarked upon and you were proven wrong by a dictionary. Now you claim that "% change" in population is an important indicator, which goes right back to the irrelevance of total population and simply focues on "% change", which is exactly why I stated that it was/is worthless -- which you agree to by claiming that just because other communities have less in total population than Brampton that their "% change" in population is irrelevant. And that makes Brampton's % change in population irrelevant and you did it all on your own.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And finally, what the heck are "Canadas"? As far as I know, there has only been one Canada since 1867. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 18:03, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"As far as you know" again -- which is not good enough for an encyclopedia. You have to know and back it up with credible sources, not assume/guess anything. The Canadas are the reality of the fiction of the alleged singular "Canada" that is falling apart; again. And "as far as you know" is wrong again. Canada is the Union of Canada referred to in the British North America Act 1867; Upper Canada/Canada West and Lower Canada/Canada East.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The former British colony of New Brunswick, from which the colony of Nova Scotia was formed, joined the Union of Canada in 1867. Then the others followed and if you have not heard that Quebec wants to suceed from Canada and that Kenora wants to be part of Manitoba and that BC is going to suceed and "take Alberta with it" and then "we'll be sorry" (uh huh; they have no land claims at all other than as granted by the federal government as nothing but jurisdictional boundaries), as with the Ontarios, but obviously you know nothing about Canadian history either. Nor is this the place to discuss it. And I'll call the Canadas whatever I feel like calling the mess; on talk pages around immature fools, not in mainspace articles. You can see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiable.html" title="Verifiable">verifiable</a> every time you edit anything and you are not only "close" to violating that, which is the #1 problem Wikipedia has, you are getting quite hysterical about it. --<a href="../../../s/-/r/User%7ES-Ranger_590c.html" title="User:S-Ranger">S-Ranger</a> 19:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) S-Ranger, not only was your use of "if that’s the case" grammatically misplaced, but it was also a "weasel phrase"—you were clearly at the very least <i>suggesting</i>, and likely <i>accusing</i> me of having an inferiority complex. You can't get out of responsibility for such statements by using weasel words. Most intelligent people around here can read around technical use of language to get to the actual meaning. And we'll hold you to it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) You're the one not making any sense. If Toronto has eight times the population of Brampton, then if it was growing like Brampton, one would expect it to have a population increase of eight times that of Brampton. Clearly, that is not the case. Speaking of cities in Ontario, Brampton has very high population growth. If you read the sentence surrounding the use of the word that this whole thing started from, you'll see it was intended to show that Brampton was having a hard time dealing with its population growth. Toronto has no trouble dealing with a population growth of 90-something thousand, but a growth of half that for Brampton is a big deal. That's what the sentence was for, and you seem to miss that. As for ignoring things like "Kshish 4", well, yes, of course we're going to ignore it. It's irrelevant for the purposes of significant cities (and yes, clearly Brampton is nowhere near as big as Toronto, and clearly, culturally it is nothing next to Toronto, but that's not relevant to the issue, and you bringing it up furthers nothing in this discussion).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>3) Wow. I'm sorry you're having trouble understanding a simply-constructed sentence. I believe the dictionary made it very clear that "remarkable" was an acceptable use for the growth rate of Brampton. Yes, I think that "remarkable means something that is remarked upon", but not in the way you're thinking. It's something that <i>deserves</i> to be remarked on, that is, something that it would be more than a passing comment If Brampton's growth rate was, for instance, the average, then it wouldn't be remarkable. That it is far above the average shows that it is remakable. Your quoted definition shows exactly that use. Brampton's population is indeed <i>Noticably or conspicuously unusual</i> when compared to other cities of its size (and what else would it be useful to compare it to?).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>4) Um, no. My comment was, based on other cities of like population, the population growth in percentage is important. The population growth of the Kshish 4 Indian Reserve from 1 to 58 is irrelevant to a discussion of population growth in cities. In comparisons of like things (for instance, comparing the top ten municipalities in Ontario according to population), percentage change is certainly a relevant statistic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>5) Indeed, there was more than one Canada prior to 1867, and this is why I said <i><b>"since 1867"</b></i>. I'm perfectly aware of how Confederation occurred, and I'm perfectly aware that Canada is a federation and as such the provinces are autonomous in many respects. I'm also quite aware of <i>secessionist</i> movements in Canada (although none outside of Quebec are much more than a thought), but I hardly see how this results in there being "Canadas". Also, you used the word "Ontarios" as well. Again, <i>as far as I know</i>, there is only one Ontario. I've never heard anyone else refer to modern-day Canada or Ontario as being plural, so you seem to be making words up that nobody else uses, which kind of makes for difficult conversation. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 20:09, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If there is critism of this addition then lets discuss it here. This is notable and an important subject.

We may not be in a possition to publish opinions and POV about how corrupt people and systems are, but the notable events and statements that do get in the mainstream medea needs to be documented so that Wiki does not become a Soapboax of the establishment to use as more of its propaganda for free.

<dd>May be, could be, who knows? Where's the methodology showing the low, medium and high estimates and explaining how they were arrived at so that statisticians will agree with it as opposed to writing it off as nothing but irrelevant political hype from a press release that proves nothing?

<dd>This is a global encyclopedia and just because you think you can "trust" a press release from the City of Brampton means nothing.

<dd>Toronto is in its own "county"/<a href="../../../c/e/n/Census_Division_eed2.html" title="Census Division">Census Division</a>/CD, and the Assessment Office of the Ontario Finance does release population estimates (with methodologies and low, medium, high estimates so that others actually believe them, which is called verifiability) or complain to Mississauga, which wants out of Peel anyway, Brampton and Caledon (one town hall/local government/council?) and the Peel regional government/council to amalgamate the Peel CD into one municipality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then, anyone in whatever the amalgamated single municipality of Peel in its own CD, will have no problems at all getting verifiable sources, for population and anything else the Ontario and/or confederate feds release regarding CDs.

<dd>Good work, it's all that was necessary in the first place. Verifiability is not some press release that proves nothing, nor are assumptions good enough. All the Assessment Office of the Ministry of Finance proves (with its methodologies for everything explained) is that Peel is estimated to have 1,248,570 residents in 2006. It does not break down Mississauga (which also has no verifiable source for its alleged population), Brampton or Caledon.</dd>

<dd>I'm sure there is proof around, but it's always frustrating to find it, particularly when only free information for the public domain can be used, and with governments that do not provide the GTA with the statistics it needs and deserves given the amounts of revenues the Ontario and federal governments make from this region. The GTA out-populates every province in the Canadas other than the usual: the rest of the Windsor-Quebec City corridor. But population alone means nothing. We also need at least real and nominal GDP for the most basic economic measure around: GDP per capita and split up by at least the 5 CDs that make up the GTA. Lots of places out-populate this area (outside the Canadas) and with not even the most basic economic data around, we could all be unemployed, this could be Old Calcutta with less population, full of slums and open sewers, etc., because population alone means nothing. But it's difficult even getting verification for that, which we should all be complaining to our governments about.</dd>

That's not how encyclopedias work, and from where I sit, you started the personal attacks. But no hard feelings on this end, the table still states the 2006 population estimate and source, but it's just not good enough and particularly as a press release.</dd>

<p>While this might not be as good a response as what one might like, I think the fact that the estimates come from Hemson Consulting, a reputable firm, and take into consideration birth and deaths estimates, housing development statistics, and various other data, shows that this is not just some off the top of the head estimate of Brampton's population. I am satisfied that this is enought to support the inclusion of the figure in the article, and I have therefore included it. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 18:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One oddity about Brampton's street network is the inconsistency of its north-south street dividing/numbering system. Queen Street is the official divider, with streets numbers increasing as as one goes north or south of Queen. However, this numbering sequence is only used for streets between McLaughlin Road and Highway 410, and only applies between Steeles Ave. and Bovaird Drive. Outside the boundaries of these four roads, the Regional numbering system (which begins at <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ontario_d812.html" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>), is used. This fact is usually not recognized, even by officials--for example, the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerade_Centre_b870.html" title="Powerade Centre">Powerade Centre</a> is usually labelled as being located at 7575 Kennedy Rd. <i>South</i>. "South" is technically incorrect, as the numbering sequence continues from Mississauga, and there are several houses to the north with address numbers higher than 7575. There are also several inaccurate street signs posted along <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Road_%28Peel%29_b56c.html" title="Dixie Road (Peel)">Dixie Road</a> (which lies east of the 410 and thus uses the Regional numbering system for its entire length through Brampton) that read "Dixie Rd. N".</p>
<p>Why was this section deleted? It was an informative paragraph on a little-known quirk of Brampton's street numbering system. How many other cities have that? A.L.70.24.71.154 05:34, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seemed rather specific for a general article on the city. It was also, apparently, original research as it was presented. Why is the way streets are numbered useful for an article of this type? I know that some very small streets in a part of Mississauga (with, for instance 20 houses), have numbers that start and end in the thousands, which is also somewhat unusual. It would be ludicrous to think this was an important enough fact to add to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississauga%2C_Ontario_702c.html" title="Mississauga, Ontario">Mississauga, Ontario</a>, though. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 13:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We don't really have a flag (a coat of arms on a white background isn't a flag), our coat of arms itself is not only ugly, but really lacks proper symbolism (and is heraldically wrong), and we don't have a real motto.

It's not like bars were regulated back then, were they? <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 22:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Related note... someone at some point applied to get a Buffy St. in Brampton. The Region denied the name submission, and the City says they will "never" reconsider any rejected name. Crazy, we have a gigantic street named after a modern mayor, in yet one of our first business people doesn't get a street. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 16:43, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hmm, I wonder if it is true, because on google map, I already seen some development north of Mayfield. I would prefer to buy a house north of Mayfield rd&amp;Airport road. because I would like to enjoy some country life without sacrificing some my urban hobbies.</p>
<p>btw, there is a train track goes into DaimlerChrysler factory, and it looks interesting, how often the train actually pulls there? to pick up new cars? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.117.25.232_5c78.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.117.25.232">74.117.25.232</a> (talk) 07:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
