This line is incorrect: Likewise, whatever we can mean by "brain" and "vat" must be such that we obviously are not brains in vats (the way to tell is to look in a mirror). Since the brain can't 'look' in a mirror and see a vat, it will see whatever the virtual reality would decide should be seen in a mirror. Is this line attributable to Hilary or to some editor?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBrain_in_a_vat_2556.html" title="Edit section: Importance of thought experiment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Importance of thought experiment</span></h2>
<p>Back to the point - The 'brain in a vat' thought experiment is important because it reveals a significant falacy - we may think we are experiencing the physical world, but clearly all we are experiencing is information. The physical world is a theory that is consistent with the information. However the existance of the physical world is only one of many, many consistent theories. Clearly, from this, it is impossible to establish any universal physical laws.</p>
<p>[MS] That depends on what you mean by "universal physical laws". Despite what the average layman believes physical science never "proves" anything. Physical science is a matter of collecting observations and creating generalizations from observations. The rule is that the generalization must not include extraneaous constructs. must be consistent with all previous observations (tho' not future observations!). They must also provide testable hypotheses. First, there is no systematic way to check consistency, so the process takes time. Also the observations must be repeatable under a wide variety of circumstances.</p>
<p>So the "laws" of science are only the current `best` generalizations of repeatable observation - little more. With this in mind, we NEVER have the opportunity to establish any "universal physical laws". Even if there is no supercomputer between you and reality.</p>
<p>Physical laws are quite unlike social laws in that whenever there is a violation of a physical law, we fix the law rather than punish the violator. Classical mechanics laid down a nice set of "laws" of motion and force, but new observations of motion at the speed of light caused a revision of these so-called universal laws. No doubt future observation in new and different conditions will cause further revisions. Universal, schmuniversal - these are just a snapshot of current thinking &amp; observations.</p>
<p>Heisenberg noted that the closer you try to observe a (tiny) physical phenomena the more you effect the observation and he put a physical number to the limit of the accuracy of any observation. This is just the sort of sneaky feature we should expect a mad scientist with a supercomputer to apply to his brain-in-the-vat experiment. It's a bit like noting that we each have computer screens in front of us with nice resolution, but if we get out the magnifying glass we will see individual pixels, and there is fundamentally no way to sub-divide the pixel to gain additional information. This limits the amount of computation needed so the mad scientists can then use one of those cheap eSupercomputers.</p>
<p>I can say at least one other thing about this supercomputer - the OS must be by Microsoft. My experience is that at intervals of approximately 24 hours the system crashes, sensory inputs fail and this is followed by a period of approximately 8 hours in which the super-computation is clearly inconsistent and sometimes incoherent. Sometimes gravity selectively does not apply to me. The most egregious violation is when Christina Aguilara shows up in a particularly skanky oufit for a hug. Yes all manner of "universal physical laws" are violated while the supercomputer is "down". Somehow there is a clearcut sense that the reboot is complete, indicated by a sudden urge for coffee and a shower. Then the reality provided by the supercomputer is again consistent with the previous day - or at least consistent with how I recall the previous day (which memory is in some doubt).</p>
<p>OK - my point is that we really can't touch the hypothetical reality we speak of by observation with our feeble and distorting senses. We can't trust our brains to not manufacture the experience - they *seem* to have been designed for some other monkey-like purpose. Also some evil supercomputer may be at the other end of the thin cord that connects us each to experience. Still, the one and only process that seems to be effective in predicting future outcomes based on past recollections of experience is that the scientific method works; that is it leads to better 'apparent' results(extrapolations) based on 'apparent' observations than any other. Yet using that scientific method on the meta-theory of experience should caquse us to reject the brain-in-vat theory as containing extraneous constructs which are not in evidence.</p>
<p>OK - please bear with me for a re-cap. We may or may not experience anything correlated the "external reality"; the question is moot, no evidence can be provided either way. Whatever we observe and whatever we recall *seems* to form a pattern which can form the basis of a generalization which can then be applied, with some more limited uncertaintly, to expectations of the future. That in our potentially faulty experience and recollection, the sun rose today and the day before, provides no proof that the sun will rise tomorrow; yet such patterns of past experience extrapolated to future expectation are quite successfully. A semi-formal system of time extrapolation called "the scientific method" appears to be the most successful at this game of selecting the relevent observations and projecting this into future occurrances. Despite the potential existence of my brain in a vat, or the manipulation of my recollections, this method still 'appears' to be successful at determining patterns in the future based on these potentially cloudy observations and recollections and the potentially manipulated future experiences. The scientific method suggests removing extranaous constructs and unobservable (constructs which genreate no testable hypotheses) from all theories. If applied to the meta-theory about experience, we should remove the extraneous and unobservable mad-scientist/supercomputer parts based on Occam's razor or the parsimony principle.</p>
<p>There is no "proof" that the minimalist theory with extraneous elements removed is correct. We should actually expect it to require revision. But since it, like all scientific conclusions is a tenative statement subject to revision as new observations appear - then the correct minimalist theory which produces a testable hypothesis is, "what we experience, we experience". That much is testable and repeatable.</p>
<p>In more detail we can state that there is great apparent consistency in what we experience - that the speed of light is observed always to be a constant, that mass/energy is observed always to be conserved through the relation E = M*c^2, that masses always fall at the same rate in a constant gravity field, that magnetism is always observed to be a relativistic effect of electrostatics. That the Sun rises each day is also an observation describing all past days. These observations can readily be extrapolated into the future, but with some limited peril.</p>

<p>Just a speculation, but if the "brian in a vat" had an experience of death, would the brain actually die in the vat, because it believes it has died? Or would the brain come to no physical harm in the "real" world because it is only experiencing death in a false virtual reality? <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStovetopcookies_fd12.html" title="User:Stovetopcookies">Stovetopcookies</a> 06:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was wondering the same thing. Suppose you are a brain in a vat. I imagine if you shot yourself in the head fatally that you would die in the virtual world, so the real brain no longer recieves any external information. No sound, touch, taste, sight, nothing. The real brain is alive, but it is interpreting no information. Assume the computer can make the real brain unconsious and you basically have a brain in a vat in a coma induced by the computer. Simulated death. Once again, the brain in a vat will not know that it is a brain in a vat, nor will it know that it is actually alive unless this coma-state is reversed by the computer. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabar_b611.html" title="User:Sabar">Sabar</a> 04:37, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A very small detail: The article says "After Dolittle attempts to reason the bomb to drop from the bomb bay and destroy the nearby planet". If I rember the film correctly, this is wrong. The bomb is malfunctioning due to some energy surge, and it wrongfully believes it recieved ordes to detonate. The crew tries to explain this to the bomb to make it go *back into* the bomb bay and *not* detonate. When this fails they use a Descartes type of reasoning (that it cannot be certain about anything in the real world) which sends Bomb #20 into a filosophical mode which ends in "delusions of grandeur".&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKricke_2428.html" title="User:Kricke">Kricke</a> 19:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>and that this "real" person grabbed another "real" full grown person with "real" experiences in the "real" world, sedated this person and then tricked him or her into believing that reality was never interrupted? meanwhile, as this person's brain is minding its own business in the "super computer" world, the person's body is being amputated...</p>
<p>THEN! the mad scientist (proving his madness) lifts the veil of the super computer sending the brain into a downward spiral of fuzzy logic. viola! the impotent brain is horrified at being stricken powerless and doesn't know what to think leading to immense entertainment on a scale comparable to that of monster truck rallies.</p>
<p>What a fucking retard.</p>
<p>OF COURSE A brain is capable of knowing it has been reduced to merely a brain in a vat. --</p>
<p>Of course Hillary is placing arbitrary limitations on the caqpabilities of the evil supercomputer. Why can't an evil supercomputer cause the brain to believe that it is in a vat, and even believe it is stating that it is in a vat&#160;? Worse, the sentence, <b>"In other words, if a brain in a vat stated "I am a brain in a vat," it would always be stating a falsehood."</b>, is clearly wrong. When an object of category A states "I am an A", it is a tautalogically true statement.</p>

<p>The Lovecraft story The Whisperes in the Darkness has to be one of the earlist referances to a Brain-in-a-Vat, If not does any one know were the idea first apeared?</p>

<p>By Putnam's reasoning, if a brain in a vat stated "I am a brain in a vat," it would always be stating a falsehood. If the brain making this statement lives in the "real" world, then it is not a brain in a vat. On the other hand, if the brain making this statement is really just a brain in a vat, then by stating "I am a brain in a vat" what the brain is really stating is "I am what nerve stimuli have convinced me is a 'brain,' and I reside in an image that I have been convinced is called a 'vat'."</p>
<p>But if this is true, then the converse is also true: If a brain in the "real" world stated "I am a brain in the real world," it too would always be stating a falsehood. If the brain making this statement lives in a vat, then it is not a brain in the "real" world. On the other hand, if the brain making this statement is in the "real" world, then by stating "I am a brain in the 'real' world" what the brain is really stating is "I am what nerve stimuli have convinced me is a 'brain,' and I reside in an image that I have been convinced is called a 'real world'."</p>
<p>This means neither brain "lives" in the real world. It also means that neither brain "lives" in a vat. Both brains "live" in their own world-models, based on the data they're given. Eyes, for example, do not detect color. Color does not exist in the "real" world. Color exists only as an idea in a brain.</p>
<p>Organic machines such as our eyes and ears can lie to our brains just as a computer could, affecting what our model of the real world looks, sounds, smells, feels, and tastes like.</p>
<p>The real world ends at the optical nerve.</p>
