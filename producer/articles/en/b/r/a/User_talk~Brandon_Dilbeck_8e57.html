<p>Why did you revert my spelling changes? Typically, American spellings (leveling, neighboring, etc.) are used in video game articles. Also, according to Microsoft Word's spell-checker, "replayabilty" is two words. Hope that cleared things up, <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">RyanG</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanGerbil10_1003.html" title="User:RyanGerbil10">rbil10</a> <a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanGerbil10_836d.html" title="User talk:RyanGerbil10">(Drop on in!)</a> 04:59, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assumed good faith, Ryan, but I merely just disagreed with some of the changes you made. Sorry if it rubbed you the wrong way, I'm just a big stickler for grammar.</dd>
<dd>Switching between British and American English spellings can, often, and (in this case) does cause edit wars. In essence, the entire thing is pointless--switching the spelling doesn't usually change the meaning anyway. I only switched these spellings back so I could easily make one whole revert (sorry if I was being lazy!). So that's why I switched neighboring and levelling back.</dd>
<dd>I had to switch the semi-colon back because you were using it to separate a dependent clause from the rest of the sentence, and you're supposed to use a comma for this. A semi-colon is not the correct thing to put there.</dd>
<dd>Microsoft Word's spell checker isn't always the best resource for big, obscure words such as "replayability". Try typing a chemistry report--it tells you that every other word is wrong, it seems! <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replay_value.html" title="Replay value">Replayability</a> is an acceptable word according to another Wikipedia article.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for bringing up the discussion. I hope this won't lead to an edit war.</dd>

<p>It's very common for websites to refer to themselves by their domain names, to encourage people to remember the domain name. That doesn't mean that's how Wikipedia has to refer to them, however. I've moved more than a few articles away from domain name titles, some with sysop assistance, for naming consistency — we can't have half of our website articles ending in .com just because the website ops want people to know the address to their sites. If you want to put this issue up for debate somewhere (perhaps a websites section on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>?), feel free, but it doesn't make sense to wait for a concensus on every single page move, because there are just too many of them. ~&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booya <sup>Bazooka</sup></a> 21:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't see that you had changed the titles of the TMNT movies on purpose. I didn't mean to pull a rapid revert on you like that. In my cleanup this afternoon, I had considered using the long-form titles of the movies for the same reason--to avoid confusion with the 2007 movie. But I decided against it because, I dunno, it just looked big and cumbersome in the table of contents. I think it could go either way, but clarity is probably better in this case.

<p>I reverted all the edits because it's easier to revert a huge bunch of edits that have a whole different array of errors in one go, and then fix the things I've caused (which you can see). I, as a Pokémon editor, specialise in Starter Pokémon, I've wrote <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torchic.html" title="Torchic">Torchic</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combusken.html" title="Combusken">Combusken</a>, and helped with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charizard.html" title="Charizard">Charizard</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudkip.html" title="Mudkip">Mudkip</a>, and there is a style guide to them, not only the PCP style guide, but sections where certain things go, and generic openings for all the articles, to maintain the Starter Pokémon continuity. I obviously missed an error the first time, which I later fixed.

<dd>I really appreciate that you want every Pokémon article to have a specific format, but I don't think it's appropriate to revert other users' edits to change some formatting issues, especially if there are decent edits you're reverting as well. I had removed some redundant material which you've reverted--the "In the video games" section now states twice that Quilava can be obtained by evolving one of the starter Pokémon from <i>Pokémon GSC</i>; readers only need to know this once.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you changed a sentence I fixed from "Quilava turn their backs to their opponent" (here, "Quilava" is used in a plural form, as the generic species) to "Quilava turns their backs on their opponent". I have two issues with the sentence as it is now. First of all, there's a subject-verb number disagreement--you could say "Quilava turn their backs" or "Quilava turns its back" but to say that something "turns their backs" is incorrect because "turns" is a singular verb, and you're using it with "their backs", which is plural. Also, you say that Quilava turn their backs "on their opponent". This isn't the right preposition to use here--if I "turned my back on you", that would mean that I'm ignoring, betraying, or walking away from you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I may be new at the PCP, but I'm certainly not a noob at writing good-sounding articles. It would be more considerate for you to run through an article and fix specific things rather than generically reverting all our work.</dd>

I've mentioned it before but he thinks that his way is better, at least he went and <i>fixed</i> some of the errors he reverted. after 3 reverts i was done - trying to confront him through his talk (<a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighwayCello_d327.html#quilava..." title="User talk:HighwayCello">here</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighwayCello_d327.html#you_don.27t_need_to_hide_in_suitcases..." title="User talk:HighwayCello">here</a>), bringing up questions in Quilava's talk, and asking other's opinions at the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_Collaborative_Project_77a9.html#What.27s_been_done" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon Collaborative Project">PCP</a> all proved fruitless. I've moved onto non-species articles, because he doesn't appear to "<a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a>" those.

<dd>Yeah... I don't really like the generic openings for every species article. They make all the articles sound too similar.

<dd>In all fairness i actually understand it to an extent... we shouldn't write the articles assuming the person has clicked on other links, and giving them a uniform intro isn't <i>all</i> bad. It makes sense to give the pokemon's name, a brief sentence describing what pokemon is, <i>then</i> go into the details concerning that specific species. The intro is just something most people are going to gloss over anyway. My main issue is the fact that he ignores wikipedia guidelines and fails to even make an attempt at righting things himself.

The list has gotten substantially long, and many articles refer to specific places within the article, not just the top. I added that due to the fact that personally i found it it tedious scrolling up and down that VERY long article when browsing and thought others might feel the same. I've noticed that it's not actually a common practice, but i find it ironic that it's used effectively elsewhere on the web while wiki has yet to embrace its functionality. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 05:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding the colors used in the templates, let's not use the colors used in 3G Pokémon games. I much prefer the TCG colors and the Pokémon Stadium colors to the Ruby/Sapphire ones, and prefer sticking to colors with X11 color names. We previously color coded the infoboxes based on type, but was removed for readability. We should IMO be more creative (IMO, Fire should obviously be red). Here is my prefered color scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal - Tan</li>
<li>Fire - Red</li>
<li>Water - Blue</li>
<li>Grass - Green</li>
<li>Electric - Gold</li>
<li>Fighting - Maroon</li>
<li>Ground - Brown</li>
<li>Psychic - Pink</li>
<li>Poison - Purple</li>
<li>Ghost - Plum</li>
<li>Ice - Lightblue</li>
<li>Flying - Navy</li>
<li>Rock - Gray</li>
<li>Dragon - Orange</li>
<li>Bug - Lightgreen</li>
<li>Dark - Black</li>
<li>Steel - Silver</li>

<dd>I was just thinking we should use the officially used colors instead of simple X11 color names. That way, we wouldn't have to worry about having to make up colors (I don't remember Dragon Pokémon <i>ever</i> being referred to as orange; it's always been a dark teal color). The hex triplets of the colors as used in the games have been listed <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EPok%C3%A9mon_Collaborative_Project_0eb9.html#Concept_for_types" title="Wikipedia talk:Pokémon Collaborative Project">in the PCP's talk page</a>, in case you didn't know. I just thought it'd be nice to use the real colors used in the games (a soft, orange color instead of bright red for Fire). --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 16:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, those colors are not universally applied. The TCG uses a different color scheme from the 3G games, and even Pokemon Stadium used a different scheme. In most media, Fire is usually associated with red, plus that the color association of the classical element of Fire is traditionally red. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndros_1337_b575.html" title="User:Andros 1337">Andros 1337</a> 18:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The trading card game only deals with 9 types (right?), so it doesn't even deal with all of them, or account for the types that aren't in the game. (What color would Bug be if it were in the card game? Green's already taken by Grass.) Maybe we could post this conflict on the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_Collaborative_Project_77a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon Collaborative Project">Pokémon Collaborative Project</a>'s talk page and see what other Pokémon fans say (and some might not even like this idea of adding templates).

<p>No, it is not original research to add that. That's what Men in Black said! Look at the Misty talk page; he keeps saying that religion not once mentioned in the show when someone (not me) said that she was an atheist.</p>
<p>"Religion is not once mentioned in this article. Religion is not once mentioned in this series. Religion is not once mentioned in any Pokémon game, anime, or manga"</p>

<p>In the article I said: "This claim is currently unsupported because religion (especially Christianity) was never mentioned in any episode of the anime."</p>
<p>I just said it wasn't mentioned in the show. <b>I did not say religion didn't exist in the Pokémon</b> world. Only a reference to a cross was mentioned (by Misty) and Noah's ark (by Brock), besides that it states nothing about people practicing religion.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Men in Black claimed in the Misty talk page:</p>
<p>"Religion is not once mentioned in this article. Religion is not once mentioned in this series. Religion is not once mentioned in any Pokémon game, anime, or manga"</p>
<p>So would you agree that religion is not mentioned in the show, just like Men in Black said? I am not saying that the Pokémon world is a world where religion does not exist in that edit. I only added it because it makes no sense for religious people to criticize a cartoon that doesn't mention religion.</p>

<p>thanx! i know how real life can be... currently i don't have one, so i'm spending too much time here XD neways, i've responded to your concerns about vandalism at the talk page, and i hope i've assuaged any fears you may have. simply put, i've argued that vandalism is relatively minimal on templates when compared to actual articles themselves. and sprocting eliminates nearly all of vandalism against templates (yes there are rare exceptions). if you'd like to see how often vandalism <i>really</i> occurs at wikipedia, just view histories on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbianism.html" title="Lesbianism">lesbianism</a>... a <i>majority</i> of edits are vandalism and reversions. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">Zappernapper</a> 17:22, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose it could be harder for noobs to vandalise because it's not as obvious how to get to a template to edit it.

<p>Thanks for pointing the discussion out to me. As far as I can tell, it goes something like this: The fellas on the WikiProject want to put boxes on the bottom of each creature's page, to show how it evolves. However, why this mean deleting all of the work I've been spending the past four hours doing I don't quite get. Could you please explain this, as the idea that each critter shall not be organised by Stage-category is not apparant in the discussion you mentioned. - <a href="../../../n/p/_/User%7ENP_Chilla_8285.html" title="User:NP Chilla">NP Chilla</a> 22:49, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point was to avoid using the terms "Baby", "Basic", "Stage 1", and "Stage 2", as there is some confusion over what stage <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togepi.html" title="Togepi">Togepi</a> is. It's unclear as to whether it's a Baby or Basic Pokémon. The trading cards actually conflict with each other (there's at least one with "Baby" and at least one with "Basic"), and to decide ourselves whether Togepi is Baby or Basic would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and we aren't allowed to make that decision. The solution to the problem was to avoid using the terms altogether.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "boxes" you described would list out each Pokémon's entire evolutionary line so that readers themselves could see where a Pokémon belongs in the evolutionary line without having to be given a term. Several in the WikiProject were diligently working on these boxes but it seems like we've gotten off track. I'm going to post <a href="../../../p/c/p/WT%7EPCP_5d8a.html#Togepi_Solution_follow-up" title="WT:PCP">a follow-up "reminder"</a> in the project's talk page to see if we can get back on track. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 22:55, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the Pokémon species articles, we write about each Pokémon as if we're talking about all the Pokémon in the species. According to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/WP%7EPAC_S_60cc.html" title="WP:PAC/S">Pokémon Collaborative Project's style guide</a>,
<blockquote>
<p>Like sheep and fish, the plural of Pokémon is the same as the singular, and the same is true of each species, i.e., “One Snorlax, two Snorlax, green Snorlax, blue Snorlax”. Remember that you are talking about a species generally in the introduction, characteristics and video games sections - make sure you use "they are" not "it is".</p>
</blockquote>
I can see how this could be ugly with one-off Pokémon like Rayquaza and Celebi... I know! I suggest you start a discussion topic at <a href="../../../p/c/p/WT%7EPCP_5d8a.html" title="WT:PCP">the Pokémon Collaborative Project's talk page</a> (where it'll get the most attention) about this problem.

<p>I noticed that you removed the Nintendo template from the Pokemon template. I've recently been trying to tag every Nintendo related article, and not having to tag the Pokemon articles would save me a LOT of time. You said that many Pokemon articles have a Nintendo template, but that's not true. And, I can use AWB to remove the Nintendo template from those articles. It would take a LOT less time than it would to use AWB to add templates.
