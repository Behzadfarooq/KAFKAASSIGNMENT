<p>It is standard use for Brazilian currencies to be capitalized. I suppose that is why Brazilian currencies are capitalized all over. In the context, the reference is not as if to say "this would cost X real" (in which case it would be lowercased), but rather to say something like "the Real is the currency of Brazil". That's not expressing value, but rather referring to the currency by its "name", in which case it is capitalized, as if it were a proper noun (and I suppose it is..).

<p>Thanks for the confirmation. Seeing the edit a second time pushed my doubt level over the edge, but now I'll continue reverting if the anon comes back. Another question (this one's just idle curiosity): are prices always specified as "R$", or is the "$" ever used on its own? <a href="../../../h/a/j/User%7EHajor_7ab9.html" title="User:Hajor">–<i>Hajor</i></a> 17:11, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are welcome. As for your question, in Brazil it is common use to have prices specified "R$". There are rare instances where you can find the "$" all alone (but in unofficial places, since the legal form is "R$"), it would be understood, but that's very, very rare.

<p>This must be relevant: "real" in portuguese can mean both "real" or "royal". Maybe the latter is the meaning of the currency's name.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really that relevant, at least for the article. It's the currency name, and as such it would not be translated (like the "peso", for instance). Besides, the distinction is not clear in the minds of Brazilians, meaning that, if enquired about this, most wouldn't be sure. Finally, in terms of history, if we considered what the government was thinking, you could say that both senses have applied. Real has now been the Brazilian currency twice. The first time around (1822 - 1942), you could say that it meant mainly "royal", since it was the currency from the times of the monarchy. The second time around (1994 - present), it's leaning more towards "real", since it was implemented to control inflation and stabilize the economy, and I remember someone saying that they wanted to have a "real" currency, with "real" values established. But I reiterate that this is all mainly retorical, since, as I've said, this is not clear in the country, because when saying "Real" people are just referring to the currency, not evoking some sort of national agenda.

<p>What are those markings on the bank-notes for?

<dd>I checked it. The markings are part of the anticounterfeiting system. The drawings are supposed to be difficult to replicate, and, embedded in there, there's a holographic image, which they call "Latent Image" that is also a safety measure: according to the official explanation, if you hold a legitimate note against the Sun, you should see the letters "B" and "C" in it (stands for <b>B</b>anco <b>C</b>entral — Central Bank in Portuguese). <a href="http://www.bc.gov.br/?REALSEGUR" class="external text" title="http://www.bc.gov.br/?REALSEGUR" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the official page containing all the security measures in the Brazilian banknotes.

<dd>Portuguese is a Romance language just like Romanian, and I know some of the more closely related Spanish, so it won't be that much of a problem reading the page.

<p>This term is used in the article to describe an artform, but it is not clearly explained. Nevertheless, it seems to be linked to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maraj%C3%B3.html" title="Marajó">Marajó</a> article about a large island in the Amazon's mouth. Perhaps the link is inappropriate and should be removed.

<p>I've just found a passing reference to the term in the German article about Marajó. It is apparently an ancient culture that disappeared even before the Portuguese arrived. I know nothing more about it than that. Perhaps someone could elaborate, if not here then at the Marajó article, which is still quite stubby. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 04:40, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the purpose was that the term would be better developed at the specific article. It is only mentioned here inside the infobox. There is no space in it to elaborate on that without messing up the layout, and there's no context in the article to expand on an art style, I believe. The best way to go would be the expansion of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maraj%C3%B3.html" title="Marajó">Marajó</a> article.

<p>People, I find this latest section, named "Orders of magnitude" to be unencyclopedic. It is especially notable that the list is needlessly long. Something like this, even if to be kept, would be only a illustrative exemplification. In actuality, however, I find it as unencyclopedic as those convertion rates that we have to remove every now and then. First, there's inflation, which makes the list always out of date. And then, and perhaps more importantly, there's price variations. An example: a can of coke in Brazil (in January of 2006) can cost anywhere between R$1.10 and R$2.50 (I know, it's shocking, but true) if you buy it cold. If you buy it warm, at a market or supermarket, then it can cost anywhere between R$0.80 and R$1.10. I favor removing this list altogether.

<dd>Let's see, I'll have to do it the longer way, but I'll get there&#160;:). First, I'll devide the word in two parts: re-al. The first part, to approximate the sound in Portuguese, would sound like the following <i>underlined part</i> of the english word "<u>ha</u>il". The second part would sound like the word "owl". Was that clear? If not, I can try to come up with a different explanation. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 11:21, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't worry about it, I've fixed it&#160;:). Thanks for letting us know here. If you would like to re-upload that other image, I might suggest a slightly different title, such as "RealBook".

<p>Maybe I'm imagining things, but the centavo bears a resemblance to the Euro, imo. I don't know if it's note-worthy in the article or not, it's just an observation. <a href="../../../d/t/p/User%7EDTPQueen_b54f.html" title="User:DTPQueen">DTPQueen</a></p>

<dd>I take it you mean that the 1c and 5c Real coins of the Second Family bear a resemblance to the 1c and 5c Euro coins, right? I had never noticed, but indeed you're right (I went over to the Euro article to look at the images..). I'd say it is most likely coincidental, since the Euro coins and the Real Second Family coins were both released in 1998, so there would have been no time for a design "inspired by". Perhaps we could make a short note of this resemblance, just a few words though, since, as you mentioned, it's not really relevant. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 19:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's also worth noting that the 50 centavos (and higher) coins from the second family have the Brazilian Progressivist moto "Ordem e Progresso" engraved along the edge of them. However, I can only find the 50 centavo coin in my collection, but the other coins are worth looking into as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 131.183.99.20 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.183.99.20_7b2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.183.99.20">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed. But I believe this is a feature present only in the 50-cent coin. It is far "thicker" than the other coins, and they used this space to include the engraving. If I'm not mistaken, though, no other coins feature it. I'll figure out where to include the information for the 50 cent coin in the article.

<dd>The R$ 1 and the brass coins (R$ 0,10 and 0,25) also have markings on the edge. The brass coins have engraved stripes, and the R$ 1 has five groups of engraved stripes alternating with equal-width plain surfaces. The other (copper) coins have plain edges.

<p>This article deals with both Brazilian currencies, which are in fact distinct entities. Shouldn't the article be split in two? Rsnetto74 18:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only if there should be a need for that, meaning, if there were so much information on each time period that this article started to be too long. This is an instance where one, same country used a particular name for its currency in two separate timeframes, albeit each time with different regulations, so as long as the article isn't too long, we should keep it unified. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 20:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
