<p>Greetings! I'm glad you're willing to help with the project. Thanks!</p>
<p>If you're reasonably certain that the uploader of an image owns the copyright (e.g. he/she took the photo or drew the picture), then you can safely tag it as ((gfdl)).</p>

<dd>I do not know much about image tags so I can't help you. I knew I had GFDLed my images by uploading them, however, another image of mine was tagged by a third user with <a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairuse_cee7.html" title="Template:Fairuse">Template:fairuse</a> and that seemed appropriate.

<dd>Fair use images are copyrighted, but by someone other than their user (in this case the wikipedia uploader who contributed them and those who continue to use it). I'm not sure if the image itself need be copyrighted to use a fairuse. If the content is copyrighted, such as a Beatles song? <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 19:33, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bratsche,</p>
<p>I'm at a loss here. I don't understand how this could be considered vanity. Were I not his son, I honestly don't believe we'd be having this discussion. Still, I want the article to stay. It is just tough to explain the local context and thus the notability without seeming to be inflating the whole thing. Also, this article has been here since October, eh? Only a few days ago did a guy I've been arguing with for months decide to put it up for deletion, probably because he knew he'd have his way. Please help.</p>

<p>Anything produced by the federal government is in the public domain, but this isn't true for states and cities. Dade County, for instance, copyrights its images and publications. Two states, California and Utah, release their material into the public domain.

<p>Bratsche,</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice. I have created a user page; I didn't know 'red-linking' had a stigma.</p>
<p>If this guides you in your vote, have a look at this: <a href="http://www.gov.ky/pls/portal30/docs/Folder/SITE83/PRESSRELEASES/200307PRESSRELEASES/CMGOBE.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.gov.ky/pls/portal30/docs/Folder/SITE83/PRESSRELEASES/200307PRESSRELEASES/CMGOBE.HTM" rel="nofollow">Profiles of CMG and OBE receipients, July 2003, Cayman Islands</a></p>
<p>Might give you some insight into the kind of people who receive honours in Cayman. If you would be willing, I'd be happy to re-do the page so that it doesn't read like vanity. If you look at the pages of other Cayman dignitaries, i.e. <a href="../../../m/c/k/McKeeva_Bush_83c3.html" title="McKeeva Bush">McKeeva Bush</a>, the Leader of Government Business, and <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Dinwiddy_6aec.html" title="Bruce Dinwiddy">Bruce Dinwiddy</a>, the Governor, you'll see they are done either in a paragraph or CV style. I combined both methods to create my father's article.</p>

<p>Got your reply&#160;:-) Yes, I have a feeling I will be making edits for a while. I am going to look through a variety of sections. I will take another look at some of those links again, but I am sure that they were very commercial and spammy. I will give them another look tho! Thanks for the welcome!!!

<p>Bratsche, thanks for the discussion and for making the right decision. I'm really pleased to have worked with an editor who is willing to listen to others and willing to change their mind when they feel they have been mistaken.

<p>Bratsche, thanks for alerting me. I agree that the change was a bit bold. It should be properly discussed on the talkpage. I've reverted for now. Let's allow Edg2s to give reasons and try to convince interested editors to go with his change. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:55, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(copied from my talk page)The new comments on the talk page are pretty clear. If there's a standard about these infoboxes, I guess there's not much we can do about the simplification/uglification about the infobox. Do you have any suggestions? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche"><font color="#006666">Bratsche</font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a> <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage"><font color="#000099">random</font></a></sup> 21:48, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I do. Nothing is that fixed. The stylesheet is perfectly editable. It had a major change at one point. I've asked edg2s to give instructions for what he thinks is the most acceptable method to do so. I'm all for changing the infobox if there is support for it. Most people won't care, although they probably won't let that stop them from expressing an opinion. If Gerald meets serious obstruction though, it might be better to work within the bounds of what doesn't cause conflict. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 22:46, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have voted for Gerald's box. My reasoning for allowing it to stand is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are not that many infoboxes in use for leaders.</li>
<li>What there are are not particularly standard. As I noted discussing it with Earl Andrew, there are different standards in use for leaders regarding names, and Korean leaders have a different box altogether.</li>
<li>Gerald's design is an improvement. There's no reason that a few editors should expect to impose their aesthetic on the broader community.</li>
<li>Instead of trying to hold back innovation and fresh approaches, we should be spending our time implementing infoboxes: putting them on pages that don't have them so that the consistency that ed2gs desires (and I support him in the desire) is more broadly attained).</li>
</ol>
<p>Should Gerald have gone through the standard channel and made a broader suggestion? Probably. Does reverting his template and shouting at him help him do that? No. What reason did they give for preferring their box? None. Just that it's how it is. Inertia doesn't do it for me. What reason did they give for supporting their aesthetic? None. They just claimed it was better.</p>
<p>Finally, Gerald has <i>been bold</i>. That's a good thing. Okay, maybe too bold for some and I understand their feeling that. But why not take a constructive approach and see what can come out of it?<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 23:25, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Toccolours is a class in the wikipedia stylesheet. It has been designed to match the styling of the rest of the monobook skin (all the sidemenus etc.). Having consistent styling is a Good Thing. Before the image thumb markup we had to make our own image boxes, which where varied to say the least, now all the image boxes fit in perfectly with the rest of the page. If we assign one class to all the infoboxes, we can change the appearance of every infobox on the site using one stylesheet. I am trying to stifle anyone's creativity, but hard-coding styles intro each infobox is the wrong way of putting forward your design proposals. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 01:22, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I wasn't intending to be rude but ironic. Concepts of irony differ between concepts of ironic (most users of British English and Hiberno-English claim that Americans don't <i>do</i> irony - which was why some modern US comedy shows have shocked Europeans by showing that some members do indeed do irony.) Hiberno-English, which I speak and write, is heavily ironic and tongue-in-cheek. That comment was intended in that way. I understand Ed's desire for uniformity and indeed share it. I have been creating formats and styles since I came here. My only point is that when someone finds a better way of doing things we shouldn't adopt a mantra of 'Against the rules. Against the rules' but be willing to say 'that's a better way. Lets see how we can turn it from a once-off into something with a wider usage'. Maybe we should allow a number of variations on the master template, and so allow users to opt for one. Or create a specific template for religious leaders (say Gerald's one), and allow variations for other categories. I'm sorry if my sarcasm was mis-interpreted. It is just a feature of hiberno-english, what is sometimes called (tongue-in-cheek) <i>Irish bitchiness</i>. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="green"><b>Fear</b><font color="orange"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a> 21:42, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

To be honest, I didn't initially intend to revamp it so thoroughly; I was poking around to see if I could find enough info to determine my own vote and I found a couple of things that I figured should be added to the article and then I couldn't figure out how to add them without doing a little rewriting and then one thing just kind of led to another. . . . . . &#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 17:03, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re your vote on styles. I understand and agree. But only casting one vote is effectively a vote <i>against</i> Alternative 1 because it means that less opposition is recorded against its nearest rival. Ireland uses an electoral system called <i>Proportional Representation using a Single Transferable Vote</i>. It works on the same principle as the one being used (only less complicated! I never thought I would find a system more complicated than PR.STV!) What you do is give your bottom preference to the people you want to defeat, and spread your vote in a way that boosts the rivals of the alternative you do not want. So if for example, you find Alternative 3 the one you least like, give it your bottom vote so that opposition to it is recorded. And spread the other votes to ensure the weakest get votes ahead of it. If for example in Ireland I want to ensure candidate 'x' of Fianna Fáil is elected, and ensure candidate 'y' of Sinn Féin is defeated, and there are 15 candidates, I give my number 1 to 'x', my number '15' to 'y' and spread my other votes to ensure that all other candidates beat 'y'.</p>
<p>Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil voters famously used to practice a 'first and only choice' vote by just voting for their own preferred candidate and then stopping. They eventually realised that they were wasting their vote because they weren't using it to block those they were most opposed to, or to build up the rivals to the candidate they were opposed to. To stop Alternative 3 winning, if that is what you want, give it your <i>fifth choice</i> and give your second, third and fourth choices to the weakest options. (Just be careful though not to copy everyone else doing it. If everyone gives the same other alternatives the same order of votes they may win. So if option 4 gets a lot of 2s, give it a 4. Doing a full vote right down the line will have the effect of strengthening Alternative 1 vis-a-vis 3 or whatever. Just voting for 1 and stopping actually weakens it against its rivals if everyone <i>else</i> votes down the line, because while their opposition to different alternatives is recorded, by stopping at 1 your's isn't. <i>Slán</i> <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">00:03, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>
<p>The great thing about the PR.STV system is that it allows you to have a 'live' vote all the way through the system. It also means that the system is (relatively) proportional, so you don't get farces like in the UK right now where someone can win a majority with only 36% of the vote. <i>That</i> barely qualifies for word <i>democratic</i>. PR.STV operates on the idea that you are given, say 15 candidates and a chance to give one of them your vote - if however your choice either is elected without needing your vote, or is eliminated, you are in effect asked 'so which one of the 14 do you prefer?'. And again if they are unavailable, you are asked for your third choice, etc. It sounds complicated but when you are used to it it is very easy. You just rank your candidates in order of preference: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc making sure the one you least want either doesn't get a vote or gets your very last one, 15 on a 15 person ballot paper. That way you can have the fun both of electing your favourite and shafting the SOB you want to block. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">00:14, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<p>As a viola doubler myself, I have a few jokes... some of these are violinist jokes too.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Q.So why are violas so much bigger than violins?<br />
A.They're not, really. Violins just look smaller because violinists' heads are bigger.</p>
<p>Q: There's a bass player, a good viola player, a second violinist, and a first violinist out in a field, when all of a sudden, a $100 bill appears on the ground a little way in front of them. Who gets it?<br />
A: The second violinist. The good violist doesn't exist, the bass player hasn't caught up yet, and no first violinist is going anywhere for only $100.</p>
<p>Q. What's the difference between Greek and alto clef?<br />
A. Some conductors can read Greek!</p>

<p><i>There is no current consensus on a new convention, which is the purpose of the ratification vote. The prior policy of prefixing style is overturned, and it is presently up to the editors of each page how style should be addressed.</i></p>
<p>In other words, if one calls a vote one automatically deletes a past convention instantly. And you have to win the vote to reinstate it. That is not how votes are done. One replaces a convention with another, not wiping one convention out and leaving nothing to replace it.

<p>Your opinions are earnestly sought on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:Crowns|Template" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:Crowns|Template" rel="nofollow">for deletion:Crowns</a>. To put it simply, there were various lists on crowns and state symbols buried on files, hardly touched, and full of unwritten articles. I created a series of I'd say thirty articles on crowns, types of crowns, crown jewels etc, at considerable time and effort. I created a provisional template to link the articles together, which I planned, once I had all the information in place, to separate into a series of templates as there was too much information for one large one.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a>, who has been waging war on templates for ages (usually as a minority of one, through he usually forces his opinion on pages - such as his deletions of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7ECommonwealth_Realms_639f.html" title="Template:Commonwealth Realms">Template:Commonwealth Realms</a> from articles on Commonwealth Realms - by wearing people down on the issue) nominated the template for deletion. While some users have praised the template for creating a workable themed group with a visual unity via the template, a couple of people are determined to delete the template and use their beloved, hideously ugly, lists, the same lists that had proved to be a dead end for all these articles before.</p>
<p>Given your own commitment to proper professional design, not amateurish layouts, on Wikipedia, I would welcome your contribution. The antics of SimonP makes me wonder why bother doing any serious work here, when all one get is attempts by a small number of people to replace professionally laid out information by visually unattractive, frequently complicated and because of the ease of edits, perrennially inaccurate long lists.

<p>Hi, thanks for the kind words. No, I don't think you ever have voted for a town with no inhabitants, but we do have articles on them. I was simply trying to give perspective to the need for articles on different things. I think your argument for ILGA's North American branch would have been stronger had we been talking about a branch of the kind that banks have, but in fact it's a huge organisation in its own right -- a prominent voice in lesbian and gay affairs, which acts on its own account (ILGA is an umbrella body rather than a central body with branches that do its business here and there, which means that its regional "branches" are not exactly subsidiaries in that very narrow sense that a bank's branch is, but rather independent bodies that do their own thing). This is definitely something we should cover. I accept that you made the nomination in good faith, of course, but I think you were misguided. In any case, I think it is better to keep articles than to get rid of them, and to cover more rather than less. When confronted with an article such as that, I tend to try to discover whether there are equivalent articles for the other branches, and if not, I'm tempted to write them. Six well-written, short articles on the regions of ILGA would not be a demerit for WP in the way some of the shabby rubbish that really does merit concern is. Ask yourself this too: what if someone saw "ILGA-North America" in a paper or on a website and came to WP to find out what it was? Worst case, you could redirect it to the main ILGA page (and create the other redirects of course) and that user has been better served than finding a blank page. This is the approach I very much favour over VfD'ing marginal articles. I recognise that your mileage might vary. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:35, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The spelling2 project (to work on secondary namespaces) was opened and finished. Progress charts will be available soon.</p>
<p>Version <i>six-three</i> tracks who made the edits, and rankings are available. Much of the work was done while I was asleep, explaining my <a href="http://humanbot.joeyday.net/enwiki/stats.php" class="external text" title="http://humanbot.joeyday.net/enwiki/stats.php" rel="nofollow">low place</a>&#160;;).</p>
<p>The next project, which may even be released today, will probably fix incorrectly capitalised headings, particularly "See Also" and "External Links".</p>
<p>The mailing list has grown to 24 people and while that is very nice for my ego, it is rather difficult to send out updates. This is why I did not send out a notice that the spelling2 project had opened. From now on, then, you must watch <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumanbot_announce_6ba3.html" title="User:Humanbot/announce">User:Humanbot/announce</a> for updates. <a href="../../../r/3/m/User%7ER3m0t_5466.html" title="User:R3m0t">r3m0t</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/3/m/User_talk%7ER3m0t_43f3.html" title="User talk:R3m0t">talk</a></sup> 12:03, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
