<p>This article needs a lot of work and much of it is highly non-NPOV. e.g, "The Coverup" section. Second bullet isn't using complete sentences. "Legal Aftermath" section looks like a laundry list. Governement statements are described as "lies" on two occasions--this is a highly charged term. Could they have been misstatements? Errors in communications? etc.? Scrutchfield</p>
<p>I agree. I find the section labeled "Government Lies" particularly non-NPOV. I don't know enough about the subject to edit this site, but it needs doing. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanahuff_ac59.html" title="User:Danahuff">Dana Huff</a></p>
<p>I agree with the previous posters, especially when stated as 'lies'. --64.82.252.43 07:59, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not agree. I think it reflects the history accurately. People need to learn American History before dismissing our government as perfect with no cover ups or perspective controlling.</p>

<p>It's your opinion that it reflects history accurately, and your opinion may be correct. I don't know. However, as there's hardly universal agreement on whether said government statements were in fact malicious lies, it would be preferable to say something like "Some &lt;identify who&gt; argue that these statements were lies" rather than stating the opinion as fact.</p>

<p>Some of this was unbelievably POV. Changed to NPOV as much as possible. Removed information about alleged involvement of government informers in the Oklahoma City Bombing because that rightly belongs in the Oklahoma City Bombing article. It really has nothing to do with this one. Also added government reasons given for the raid and gave government side of cause of fire controversy. Also added government side of alleged weapon fire at survivors.<a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArk30inf_d1d1.html" title="User:Ark30inf">Ark30inf</a> 05:33, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is clearly POV since it is a controversial opinion. It is also not clear to me what the allegation of sexual abuse has to do with the rest of the statement.<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">—Eloquence</a> 06:31, Sep 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tried to tone down the comment about the tanks being retrofitted for chemical warfare. Chemical warfare is commonly interpreted as using lethal weapons, and this is reinforced by the article that was linked to (though it is ambiguous). I changed it to "chemical weapon", but even this is too harsh. This is more like a riot control weapon--in common parlance, it would probably be called "tear gas". <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 03:46, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thier is a strong argument that the classification of tear gas as a non-lethal weapon is itself misleading, tear gas can and often does result in fatalities especially when used in heavy concentrations in enclosed areas. The conditions and methods described in the article seem on the surface to present the type of situation in which gas might be lethal, pumping gas into an enclosed area with children present and limited if any feedback on air quality within.</p>
<p>Well, the article seems to have regained NPOV. I think the problem is now sourcing. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhatJew_6f32.html" title="User:PhatJew">PhatJew</a> 10:26, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first thought was, "HUH?" Then I realized, I'd just moved the topics that were creating the most POV problems to <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco_Siege_817d.html" title="Waco Siege">Waco Siege</a>. I guess that now that I've also toned down the Doug Mitchell perspective, that what's left is reasonably close to NPOV. In fact, maybe even the "factual accuracy is disputed" warning should be taken down. The one thing I'm dubious about is the notion that anyone would call themselves "Davidivian Branch Davidians," but now that that has been reduced from an outright statement to a claim by one of the parties, there are no grounds for disputing the accuracy of the article on that account. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWacoKid_d7ce.html" title="User:WacoKid">WacoKid</a> 02:12, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article shows the product of some work. I added a lot and didn't remove much. It could all use more precise detail, such as who was head of FBI, ATF, what agencies investigated, what was the actual number of prosecutions and acquitals, how many escaped at what point during incident, and a list of all victims. It certainly needs sections now, and well, I know more about Waco than I know about Wiki code for making sections. And i type fast and probably won't spell check till latr.</p>
<p>If anyone can find a way to break it out into another article, it might help. The history of the Davidians, as commentator said above, needs better precision and detail. I'm watching the OKbomb article with an eye to including a balanced look at other theories - especially the role of informants who at least advised gov something was afoot. But this is old stuff and I deleted, for example, the McVeigh trial transcript last time I cleaned the hard drive. Other books of mine on the subject are in boxes, but the article really needs at least mention of where some of the major books can be found at markets or libraries.</p>
<p>This article is clearly biased. Whoever wrote it clearly sympathized with the Davidians. The author completely ignored the forensic evidence that proved that almost a third of the victims of the fire died from close-range gunshot wounds to the head, which is indicative of either a suicide or an execution-styl murder. The author also completely ignored infrared evidence that proved that all three fires started at exactly the same time--which strikes a blow to the theory that the FBI accidentally started the fires. The author also ignores the statements of the children who escaped from Mt. Carmel. The children spoke of sexual abuse (Howell enjoyed relations with a ten year old girl), physical abuse, and of being denied meals. This is, quite frankly, a terrible article. The FBI DID fire flammable gas canisters, but they fired them at an underground bunker some forty yards away from the main compound. The canisters bounced off the bunker and fell harmlessly into a field; they did not even open. This is a truly terrible article.</p>
<p><br />
I agree</p>
<p><br />
Fyi, the FLIR shows that the fire DID NOT start in all locations at "exactly the same time". The fire in the front, 2nd floor corner started first, likely sparking the second fire in the kitchen/dining room shortly thereafter. The third fire started afterwards in the rear of the bldg after what Allard argues is the detonation of a flash-bang device. Indisputable is the fact that the third fire started with two flashes at the window. I find the mass suicide theory implausible, especially since the tanks had just penetrated the walls to fire CS, and immediately high tailed it out of there just seconds before fire. Rewatch the FLIR before you judge the article and write factually inaccurate criticisms.</p>
<p><br />
Go check out PBS.org if you want sources. Rickross.com has a multitude of resources concerning the Waco tragedy. This article has been horrible for...well, as long as I can remember. I've tried to fix it, and many others have made brave attempts as well, but somebody with ALOT of free time on their hands keeps editing it. Probably just some pissed-off Davidian trying to spread propaganda. The article also ignores the official government investigation that occurred in the late 90's which absolved the government of all blame. Of course, I don't expect many people to believe that, even when presented with overwhelming evidence that the government did nothing wrong, although they certainly could have handled the situation better. In the end...people believe what they want to believe.</p>

<dd>"At the time, new <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brady_Bill_245e.html" title="Brady Bill">Brady Bill</a> regulations had prohibited the manufacture or importing of certain semi-automatic weapons. The ban drove a profitable market for the newly regulated semi-automatic rifles, commonly called <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault_rifle.html" title="Assault rifle">assault rifles</a> already in the US. Gun dealers could assemble guns from parts and sell rifles with more assault or military-style features than could be obtained from manufacturers. The same rifles could be converted to automatic rifles if sold under the license of an approved gun dealer."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The timing of this is all wrong - the raid occurred in February 1993: the Brady Bill was not passed until the very end of the 1993 session of Congress, in December. The "assault weapons" ban was not even part of the Brady Bill - it was enacted as part of the the 1994 omnibus crime control legislation. 209.149.235.254 16:25, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think one could reasonably refer to "Following the usurpation of the presidency in 2000 by the psychopath George W. Bush, and the subsequent installation of the insane John Ashcroft as Bush's Himmler, things became much worse." as a reasonable statement, regardless of what elements of truth may be in it. However, the article does seem to be a bit schizophrenic in it's lack of neutrality. Some sections are obviously pro-Davidian, some sections are Government position brown-nosing. It was an amusing read nonetheless. - Clay</p>

<li>the raid was motivated by a perceived need to "rescue" adults and children from a "cult". There were allegations of child abuse and/or statutory rape, which is not under the purview of the ATF. A state child welfare offical had some involvment.</li>
<li>the raid was justified as "necessary" despite no attempt to ascertain whether simply walking up to the door peacefully might have produced any fruitful results. (Some sources say that on more than one occasion, the Davidians inculuding Howell (Koresh) had peacefully surrendered, e.g., to charges of attempted murder.)</li>

<dd>Actually, you also need to include that the government swore to drug prodution (in order to legitimately gain military assistance). Also that they had the right to go in and inspect sans warrants because there wes a federally licensed firearm dealer there.

Come to think of it, we also ought to mention the idea that there was no backup plan in case word of the impending <b>surprise attack</b> leaked out. There are conflicting reports on this. According to one account, the raid leader had (a) decided or (b) been ordered to call off the raid if he lost the element of surprise. An official gov't report indicates that he (1) discovered that Koresh knew or suspected the raid was imminent but (2) immediately ordered the raid to continue in spite of this: "they know we're coming, let's go!" <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">-- Uncle Ed</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 21:37, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The flashes look like they might be the heat signature of gunfire, but close analysis shows the flashes do not resemble gunfire in several ways. They persist longer than gunfire, and their shape is more irregular than gunfire. There is no apparent human movement at the flash locations. At several of the flash locations there is identifiable debris, such as fallen windows, which can reflect infrared from sources like the sun, the tank exhaust, and the fire.</p>

<dd>These officials, familiar with the tape, say analysis shows the flashes of light are not from muzzles of weapons, but from light reflected off of other objects.</dd>

<p>although <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanahuff_ac59.html" title="User:Danahuff">dana huff</a> addresses this in her NPOV converns, i would like to call to attention the striking lack of neutrality in the headline "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidian_0995.html#Admitted_Government_Lies" title="Branch Davidian">admitted government lies</a>". i am myself a neutral party (simply by virtue of my lack of knowledge about the topic), so when i send someone a link to a wikipedia article, i expect it to uphold my neutrality. now, while it certainly is possible to objectively say that someone "told a lie", this article evinces too much passion for one side of the topic for anyone to perceive it as a totally impartial evaluation. furthermore, the bulleted "lying to congress" in that same section is not only abrupt, it's also unjustified by further elaboration. for this section to be <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">bipartisan</a>, these statements need to be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">demonstrated</a>, not merely asserted. -ReubenGarrett</p>

<p>The article mentions who is sentenced for how many years, but not for what (and how well-supported those charges might be). Telling someone is in prison but not what for it was - well, let's call it unusual.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason no one seems to know what the surviving Davidians were sentenced for is simple - they were found innocent by a jury of their peers. The judge, Walter Smith, threw out the verdict and sentenced them as though they had been found guilty. It should also be noted that upon appeal the sentences were reduced to 14 years for most. Unfortunately, like so much of this twisted saga, explaning the details is nearly impossible without POV *sigh.*</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing in the American judicial system as being found "innocent". The verdict is "not guilty". This is not a matter of semantics; "not guilty" simply means that guilt was not proven. It does not mean that the court is declaring that the defendant never did anything wrong. 68.47.234.131 05:52, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The external links section might be the source, but I doubt most of those links are even credible, excepting maybe the PBS one. Sorry for the confusion over the edit, but what struck me the most was the POV issue. Sure, my talk page comments are oh-so-uncalled-for and blah blah blah, but I'm intelligent enough to recognize my biases and not insert them into something that is meant to be factual (sure, it is truly impossible to *not* insert biases, but I try my best). Anyhow, I'd look into those links myself, but I'm far too busy ATM (upcoming code freeze and all) to do a thorough job. So if anyone can't validate the "admitted lies," I vote for removing the thing. Frankly, the presentation is bad too... each one of those could be rewritten into a decent paragraph, as opposed to the current ugly list.

<dd>From the Raid section - "Before the raid occurred, the Davidians were tipped off as to what the BATF was planning. The BATF drew heavy criticism following the siege for proceeding with the raid, despite the knowledge that the Davidians knew they were coming. However, an article run in the Washington Post (<a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/waco/waco5.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/waco/waco5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rickross.com/reference/waco/waco5.html</a>) suggests that the Davidian's actions, namely, taking up arms and fortifying themselves in defensive positions, were very questionable, considering they did indeed know that the BATF was planning a raid. If they were, as they claimed, law-abiding citizens, should they not have laid down their arms, and let the BATF legally search their compound? After all, the BATF did obtain search and arrest warrants, despite the trivial reasons that they obtained them for. Knowing that the BATF was going to raid their compound, why did the Davidians take up arms? This seems to indicate that perhaps the wished for a confrontation to take place, or, at the very least, that they were not the peaceful, law-abiding citizens that they claimed to be."</dd>

<dd>It is not the place of Wikipedia to ask questions (rhetorical questions, at that). It's not NPOV. Also, you're inferring that they wished for combat and stating what their categorization is, instead of adding all sides. The prelude, raid, and aftermath need A LOT of work to remove this stuff. Also, the rickross stuff is POV links that can otherwise be obtained from less radical sources. If they can't be obtained from less radical sources as to recalling factual events, then they don't belong there. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegBarc_2f88.html" title="User:RegBarc">RegBarc</a> 13:20, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never under any circumstances:</dd>
<dd>(a) To develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone;</dd>
<dd>(b) To use chemical weapons;</dd>

<dd>The only mention of mlitary involvement is in 1c, concerning preparations, but the article seems clearly to prohibit the use of such weapons in general, not only in warfare. The final clause in the Wikipedia sentence is certianly not grammatically incorrect; I assume that you mean that its reference is unclear — but it surely refers to the fact that the ban applies not only to police use but also to military use.</dd>

<p>My understanding of that was that it concerned the production and sale, not the use of such chemicals. On the other hand, it wouldn't particularly surprise me if chemical weapons were prohibited from use aginst other countries, but permitted for use against governments' own citizens; that fits my opinion of politicians perfectly. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:01, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

You guys...I really think we're getting somewhere in this article. It still has work to be done, but it's finally starting to resemble a fair, somewhat unbiased article. That's pretty impressive considering that we're writing about one of the most controversial events of the 90s. Let's keep up the good work.</p>

<p>I know this is contrary to everything Wikipedia stands for, but this topic might be impossible to do without POV. What we have here is a very horrific incident that was caused by religious fanaticism, distrust of the government, militancy against American citizens, an inept approach to cult activities, and gun play. After reading through this article very carefully I cannot discern why this tragedy occured, or even how it happened. The simple question 'who shot who' is unanswered. If Wikipedia admits that the article MUST by its very nature include POV, will that be like a believer doubting the existence of God? Even if it is, it might be necessary, because this article is truly a mess.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. This article has made significant strides from where I started editing it. It used to be much, much worse. If anything, the article swung from pro-Koreshians to in favor of the government, but, as most evidence indicates, the BDs did start the fire, and were being extremely belligerent. Of course, the government did completely drop the ball here... the standoff was a mess, as negotiations were being done separate from the actions of the besieging FBI units. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomBringer_3afe.html" title="User:DoomBringer">DoomBringer</a> 07:17, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well said <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomBringer_3afe.html" title="User:DoomBringer">DoomBringer</a>. I can not think of any article that can not be written with a NPOV. (Hmm, how many negatives can you get into one sentence?!). I mean that, I think it is possible to write any article from a NPOV, if given sufficient attention. All of the evidence (and official independent enquiries) point to the fact that the Davidians started the fire. However, as stated above, the situation probably could have been handled better. All in all, I don't think we're too far away from a NPOV at the moment. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotmannick_5754.html" title="User:Robotmannick">Robotmannick</a> 09:40, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is simply poorly written, organized, and has a very biased POV (the bias depends on what section you read). I personally recommend that the article be deleted and completely rewritten. I realize that this is not easy for anyone to do, but when you start with a fundamentally biased product (it was written with a very Branch Davidian Bias in the beginning), it becomes next to impossible to simply reword to become neutral.It would be easier to start over with an outline and write each section with group input. This could be done on the talk page, and when a relatively good product exists, it should replace the current article.</p>

<p>I must respectfully dissagree. This is probably one of the wost hack jobs of this subject I've ever seen. While the accusasion/counter-accusation style may tend to be considered NPOV in some peoples eyes, there has been some sworn tesimony provided on much of this subject matter and I would try to rely on that to form a basis for the outline. Now I realise that much of this testimony conflicts. Nonetheless, presenting this conflicting SWORN testimony can provide a basis for a NPOV approach.</p>

<p>Personally I think this article spends too much time talking about the Waco siege. There's an entirely separate article just for that, there is no need to restate everything here. This should focus more on the founding of and the beliefs of Branch Davidians. Of course there should be a mention of Waco, but simply a short synopsis with a link to the full article for those who want to learn more about the actual siege. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpikethehawk_31e2.html" title="User:Spikethehawk">spikethehawk</a> 19:04, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I DEFINITELY support your suggestion to move the section on the standoff to the Waco Siege page, freeing this page to delve deeper into the history and teachings of the Branch Davidians. The obsession with the siege has turned into the tail that is wagging the dog. (The only downside is that there doesn't seem to be a way to transfer the edit history of the sections being moved, but that just has to be accepted.) If nobody pipes up with some decent objections, go ahead. I'll let you, as the person who suggested it first, "do the honors," but I will do it myself if I see no one else doing it. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWacoKid_d7ce.html" title="User:WacoKid">WacoKid</a> 04:07, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wanted to add here that a discussion recently started about the webmaster of the site with those links (serendipity) because of the antisemitic content.

<p>Due to the controversy with the links, I feel the need to investigate the links thoroughly. I'll try to avoid plagiarising the page, but I have to quote a lot of it to avoid having people click between two pages often.</p>
<p>"Much of the Waco information once available on the web has 'disappeared'" Fails to pass even the laugh test. Oh really, the US government, which has limited authority over the Internet, decided to remove webpages? I rather suspect that the pages went out of existance because whoever was hosting them didn't pay the upkeep, or got rid of them as they lost interest. Lets face it, the government really doesn't care at this point...</p>
<p>To begin, note the title: "The Waco Massacre" I contend that the word "massacre" is emotionally loaded, and used incorrectly. The fire that killed most of them was most likely started by the BDs, so "mass suicide" would fit better.</p>
<p>"story that the FBI put out" note the use of the word "story" in the derogatory sense.</p>
<p>"It is a lie" We'll see about that. Unsourced.</p>
<p>"The guns they had were legal" Not relevant, and source? <i>At the time</i>, the BATF thought they had illegal weapons, and there isn't evidence to prove the conspiracy theories flying around about it.</p>
<p>"These were law-abiding American citizens" Depends on the validity of the claim that they had illegal guns, which hasn't been established yet.</p>
<p>"If you still have doubts" Yes I do. Your webpage sucks.</p>
<p>"Bill Clinton, with Janet Reno" Ahh, the right's favorite whipping boy (and girl).</p>
<p>"Already back in 1993 the US government demonstrated its contempt for the American people by carrying out a massacre" Still no proof on that "massacre" thing. This line is just pure opinion, and unsubstantiated at that.</p>
<p>"Following the usurpation of the presidency in 2000 by the psychopath George W. Bush, and the subsequent installation of the insane John Ashcroft as Bush's Himmler, things became much worse. On 9/11 about forty times as many people were murdered as at Waco. In both cases the murderers have so far gone unpunished." What to say about this part? You can argue all you want about the 2000 election, it isn't relevant to Waco and the BDs. "Himmler" is emotionally loaded, of course, the obvious ties to Nazism.</p>
<p>"they did so with guns blazing" Not proven. Some accounts claim the BDs shot first, others say the BATF agents.</p>
<p>"to prevent their exiting Mount Carmel." They didn't want to leave.</p>
<p>"the screams of rabbits being slaughtered" Unsourced on that page. (Maybe the links below are the source, but the page lacks proper source info, such as parenthetical citations or whatever)</p>
<p>I'm skipping a bit...</p>
<p>"with the help of a willing media" OH REALLY? ZOMG! Liberal media! Or not. Whatever.</p>
<p>"Branch Davidian victims" Victims of a fire they set.</p>
<p>"not a wild-eyed madman" Sure, yeah, he wasn't crazy, he just claimed to hear God. Or something.</p>
<p>"deaths of the women and children at Waco were the result of government negligence and incompetence rather than deliberate murder" Emotionally loaded language overload! OMG! Protect the women and children! OMG! Murder! The BDs set the fire themselves! BDs murdered the BDs, or suicide, or whatever you want to call it. Do I really need to continue on this one? Come on!

<dd>He asserts that the word "massacre" is emotionally loaded, and used incorrectly. If the violent deaths of 75-80 people by military-type assault and burning alive was not a "massacre" then what is? Is there a minimum number of deaths required? How many people died in the <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_Massacre_d74e.html" title="My Lai Massacre">My Lai Massacre</a>? Should that article be edited so as to remove the "emotionally loaded" term "massacre"? Both events can reasonably be described as "massacres". And anyway, the question is not what word to use but rather what the evidence shows. To debate about the propriety of the word is to distract from the evidence.
<dl>
<dd>What evidence? The page has none. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomBringer_3afe.html" title="User:DoomBringer">DoomBringer</a> 08:29, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Does not the word "massacre" carry a meaning beyond 'mass death', specifically, that the deaths described are due to directed killings, akin to murder on a large scale? I cannot see that 'massacred' is any less laden than 'murdered', the different appears to be in numbers. To back this up - would the word 'massacre' generally be used about likely accidental deaths such as from a train accident? Probably not. Is it used about the Madrid bombings? Indeed it has. As the usage of the term implies that set 1 of preceding events has taken place, while the rest of the article disputes whether set 1 or set 2 took place, the word is POV. A more NPOV term could be 'mass death'. -Anon, 8 February 2006</dd>

<dd>Doombringer asserts that the fire that killed most of the Branch Davidians was most likely started by themselves and so they 'committed suicide'. This claim is an insult to our intelligence. Does Doombringer have any evidence to support his opinion? No. But tanks were captured on film punching holes in the walls of the main building in order to pump CS gas in (despite the presence of women and children). The gas is inflammable. Any open flame being used inside would ignite it.

<dd>CS gas is combustible, not flammable, meaning that it can burn, but that it will not easily ignite, not even over an open flame. Second, when <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dichloromethane.html" title="Dichloromethane">dichloromethane</a> (methylene chloride) is used as a dispersal agent, chances of ignition are almost non-existant, as dichloromethane is a good fire retardant.

<dd>Doombringer asserts that the statement that "The guns they had were legal" is not relevant. It is certainly relevant because the alleged illegality has been used to attempt to justify the BATF raid. "And source?" That's easy to find for anyone who knows how to use Google. A search will quickly find <a href="http://www.firearmsandliberty.com/waco.massacre.html#1.2" class="external text" title="http://www.firearmsandliberty.com/waco.massacre.html#1.2" rel="nofollow">the article by Carol Moore</a> which demolishes the claim that the firearms on the Branch Davidian property were illegal. If the BATF were not sure whether the firearms were illegal they could have asked the local sheriff to investigate (perhaps he did) before they decided to launch an all-out military assault.
<dl>
<dd>It really isn't. At the time, they suspected that they had illegal weapons. If you're accusing the BATF of ulterior motives here, like that they were trying to justify their existance, then you'd better back that up. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomBringer_3afe.html" title="User:DoomBringer">DoomBringer</a> 08:29, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But I need not go on. Doombringer's basic error here is that he is criticising that page as if it were a Wikipedia article. It is not, and so does not have to conform to Wikipedia guidelines. It certainly has a POV, and attempts to justify it, partly by a presentation of evidence and reference to books, videos and many other web pages which themselves present evidence. But for some reason Doombringer doesn't want other people to know about this evidence, and so wants to remove the links to this article and those by Carol Valentine and Carol Moore which present it. If this is not an attempt at censorship then I don't know what is. Leon Ehrlich 12:46, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh oh, please play the rabbits screams for me, I get off on that stuff. Anyhow, I'm challenging the page's use as evidence here. But if you're so dead set on it, whatever man, whatever floats your boat. I'm pretty tired over the one line, but I'm going to probably sort it into a "Anti-government" links section.

<p>"Psychologists who examined those children who were sent out (not even half were released) during the siege found no evidence of abuse and commented that the children were well mannered and developmentally advanced. Specifically, even the youngest were able to grasp abstract concepts such as infinity and eternity, something that teens often struggle with. Academically the children were also found to be advanced. Finally, each child sent out was well clothed and carried significant sums of cash with a note from the mothers stating that it should be used to pay for quality care and needs of the children.
