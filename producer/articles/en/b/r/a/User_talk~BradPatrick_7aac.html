<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>I read your notice on the discussion page. I agree this needs to be settled. It seems the same person is continuously vandalising the Jeet Kune Do Page by attempting to include instructors that thus far have not proven to have any merit to the article. I have started a dialogue on the discussion page per Wiki polices &amp; standards. It seems this same person is not participating in the debate and just reverting edits without participating or giving the discussions a chance. Also, it seems the same person/persons is deleting the comments on the discussion pages because they do not agree with them; which I would think is a no-no. I am attempting to keep the Jeet Kune Do article up to the highest standard without turning it into an advertisement for instructors or to provide legitimacy for questionable instructors. Anyway any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankWilliams_a1a3.html" title="User:FrankWilliams">FrankWilliams</a> 20:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brad, I was told by Jimbo that it was OK to "proceed with caution" (i.e. ensuring that all changes were fully debated and cited to the hilt). What more was I supposed to do? I don't even have the meat of their complaint. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To expound, this was brought up and discussed <i>at length</i> on wiki-en, and Jimbo did in fact say the above. You can read the <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-December/058659.html" class="external text" title="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-December/058659.html" rel="nofollow">first</a> of his many responses in the thread on the wiki-en archives. There is a dearth of communication with regard to <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> actions, and requests for clarification are ignored. Guy asked for advice as to what to do, got it from Jimbo (and many other people, excluding Danny), and proceeded as instructed. Working in the law profession, I fully appreciate the need for OFFICE and related processes, but the processes need to be cleaned up and clarified, and they should never stand in the way of writing an encyclopedia.

<dd>Ok, so there is an on/off wiki issue (chat vs. wiki), a Jimbo/Office/Danny/Me issue, a time-sensitive response issue, a procedural issue, the merits of the article itself, and probably a few more. Jimbo and I never discussed this particular article in recent memory, certainly not this week, so it's news to me in this case. What I saw from the talk page led me to understand why Guy went ahead and did the edit; what surprised me, though, is that the WP:OFFICE tag is still there. If Jimbo said take it off, then that's that. But I sense a mixed message of "proceed with caution". IRL, we were in Rotterdam for a board meeting and did not have the time to be doing heavy wiki work. I believe the people at PWU deserve an NPOV, well-sourced article that doesn't tar them with the same brush as PWU(HI), based on the information available to me. Given the comments on the talk page and confessed anti-diploma mill sentiments involved, it is a careful line to be drawn. Nobody is putting procedure over substance here either; I think the references in Guy's article are solid. It is the text of the article that caused concern. WP:OFFICE as a working procedure needs improvement, and I welcome further suggestions.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> 22:33, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not faulting you for anything, obviously you have to defend the interests of the foundation as counsel. My main concern is the lack of communication or clarification with regard to <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>. Pages get stubbed and tagged, and then go untouched and protected for, literally, months. That's just not acceptable in my opinion. The process should be much clearer; office gets contacted by requisite counsel, page is stubbed (perhaps some more time should go into this step so that <i>only</i> unacceptable material is removed) and protected, and a note is made on the talk page detailing exactly what the complaint is. Then, administrators can work together to ensure the article is properly sourced, especially with regard to the problem area. Once the problem area is cleaned up and the article is verified from top to bottom, Danny (or whoever protected) is notified to review the article in question. If it passes muster, OFFICE protection is removed. That, in my mind, is the best course of action to take. The fact that it took a 50+ message thread on wiki-en to determine that it is okay to edit OFFICE'd articles cautiously is slightly ludicrous in my mind, but completely understandable — every location has a different explanation of procedure at the moment. The office template says administrators can edit as long as it is discussed on the talk page, <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> says they cannot in any case (at least it did last time I checked), and depending on who in the foundation you ask, you get different answers regarding whether every edit has to be approved or not. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 22:52, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree here - no criticism implied, everyone was doing their best, but there is clearly a problem with missing links in the information chain (Office is new, so that's not a surprise). However, there is one source (Bear's guide) which says that the two institutions are run out of the same office by the same people, the OGA report refers to PWU (CA), and we do know that they are actively working to distance themselves from past controversy - are we sure we are not being used to further this agenda? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A question involving whether the provisions in Serbian and Montenegran copyright law for fair use has arisen at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2007_January_24_53d4.html#Template:SerbiaFairUse.2C_Template:MontenegroFairUse" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 24">Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 January 24#Template:SerbiaFairUse, Template:MontenegroFairUse</a>, as the result of deleting related templates last fall. Can you shed any relevant light? I am additionally concerned because it sounds like the Serbian language Wikipedia may be making use of these, and if the position that led to deletion on the English Wikipedia is correct, that could be a problem. (Not that I read or speak a character of Serbian to investigate that issue.) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 05:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I'm contacting you in regard to a discussion on the Admin's noticeboard aout the East of Eden article, and the fact that an editor claiming to own the East of Eden copyright wishes to have certain information removed from that article. The editor in question, Catbird222 (<a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatbird222_e26e.html" title="User talk:Catbird222">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Catbird222_df2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Catbird222">contribs</a>) has suggested that you may know, or should be informed about this claim.

<p>Mr. Patrick, I wouldn't normally think to bother you, but I believe this situation ( <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Further_on_the_Professor_Tim_Pierce_situation" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#Further on the Professor Tim Pierce situation</a> <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Tim_Pierce_is_.2Anot.2A_a_professor.21" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#Tim Pierce is *not* a professor!</a> <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#Tim_Pierce:_Over_the_top" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#Tim Pierce: Over the top</a>) calls for some adult supervision.

<p>Someone beat me to it - I have serious concerns about the handling of this matter and also because various statements are being made that could be constructed as libel (forgive me - I'm from the UK, so they might not be with the states) - people are assigning various motives to Prof. Pierce - one has stated that he's done this out of <i>to vandalize out of some vindictive annoyance at Wikipedia</i> (no evidence of this) and various other statements assigning motivation with no supporting evidence. In addition if people are firing off emails to universities, pr departments and the like saying "I am wikipedia administrator X", then the assumption is going to be that this person is an official representative of the organisation - that's not a legal problem (well I don't think it is - as I don't knoe if your laws about "agents" are the same as ours) but it could a PR nightmare.</p>
<p>Nobody is saying this Prof. has done a good thing but "Wikipedia get man the sack" is not really a great solution either. Surely any communication like this (to an employer rather than the individual concerned) should be a matter for the office - not for people shooting from the hip.</p>
<p>Apologies if this should have gone elsewhere - but the matter has really upset and disappointed me. --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrick_day_9590.html" title="User:Fredrick day">Fredrick day</a> 21:51, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>While this is sort of a legal question, I felt it might better belong on your user page as placing it here puts it in a more public context and it pertains to a relevant debate at village pump. The issue is whether Wikipedia would be able to legally use .mp3 file format without paying royalties. (The village pump thread is <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html#Spoken_Wikipedia_File_Format" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">here</a>). According to the way I read the <a href="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/emd.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/emd.html" rel="nofollow">Thomson website</a> it would be acceptable. A lawyer colleague of mine supported me in this view and volunteered that "no one would sue Wikipedia over that anyway", but of course the website only provides a few sentences. In your opinion, what would the legal status of including mp3s on Wikipedia be? Thanks. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 02:13, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello thanks for your message. I responded to you on <a href="../../../w/a/s/Talk%7EWashington_University_in_St._Louis_56c2.html#Returning_the_infobox_to_the_WUSTL_article" title="Talk:Washington University in St. Louis">the WUSTL talk page</a>-- thank you for letting us know. I am replying here also.</p>
<p>Let's be sure to continue to distinguish between the <i>seal</i> and the <i>shield</i>.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Seal.</i> I think we have agreed that we would not present the seal, in respect to WUSTL's request.</li>
<li><i>Shield.</i> However, we have not seen the logic behind the shield request. WUSTL's internal guidelines stipulate that the shield cannot be displayed sperately from the text "Washington University in St. Louis." This makes perfect sense, since the shield alone is not recognizeable to everyone as an entity of WUSTL without the accompanying text. We argue that the shield, as displayed in the article infobox, is accompanied by the text "Washington University in St. Louis." We have not and do not intend to orphan the shield from the designation "Washington University in St. Louis." Therefore, since the image is not being abused and WUSTL is not being misrepresented, we argue that the shield falls under a "fair-use" designation.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have not returned the shield to the <a href="../../../w/u/s/WUSTL_2488.html" title="WUSTL">WUSTL article</a> yet, since we want to avoid the edit-warring that has taken place in the past. We await your update before proceeding. Kindly, <a href="../../../l/m/b/User%7ELmbstl_3b5b.html" title="User:Lmbstl">Lmbstl</a> 10:48, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>WUSTL indicates they are willing to let the shield be used, if the image can be watermarked in some fashion to indicate it is trademarked. They are concerned that they will be seen as relinquishing control over their trademarked shield if they allow it. Concerns?--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> 15:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We don't object at all to indicating that the image is trademarked. We have a test version of the infobox <a href="../../../w/a/s/Talk%7EWashington_University_in_St._Louis_56c2.html#Infobox" title="Talk:Washington University in St. Louis">here</a> on the WUSTL talk page. Upon mouseover, the following text is displayed: "The Shield of Washington University in St. Louis - ©Washington University in St. Louis." We do not wish in any way to misrepresent WUSTL's ownership of the image, and we commit to displaying the shield image only as long as it is clearly associated with the text "Washington University in St. Louis."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Does Wikipedia have any concerns displaying the image with such restrictions? Wikipedia certainly displays other corporate logotypes, albeit under a "fair-use" rationale. I think WUSTL's desire to indicate image ownership is reasonable. How can this be accomplished? Does Wikipedia have experience in the sort of "watermarking" WUSTL refers to? What category of use or copyright restriction would accompany the shield image? I assume this information would be displayed on the image description page?</dd>

I <i>know</i> I'm right, but what evidence do you think is necessary to show this is correct? Saying Google said it in a thousand places doesn't make it true, Dear User. Nor does it being on Wikipedia. What I will ask you is to show me where the original citation regarding Avon Old Farms is; I'm sure it isn't in any Astros material, it isn't in anything Ausmus ever said himself, and I'm positive in my own mind the answer is an overzealous correlation of Leech/Ausmus by someone who doesn't know where Connecticut is. But that doesn't answer your question.

<p>Brad you uploaded all of the photos at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:BradPatrick/gallery" class="extiw" title="commons:User:BradPatrick/gallery">Commons:User:BradPatrick/gallery</a> in 2006 stating that the images were taken by Gus Freedman. However, you tagged them with <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Self" class="extiw" title="commons:Template:Self">Template:Self</a> and so asserted that you were the creator. What exactly went on with these images?

<dd>It's simple - WMF hired Gus Freedman to take the photos at Wikimania as works for hire, licensed freely for WMF's use. He was the guy with the white beard running around taking pictures. WMF owns the images. WMF paid for them. Gus provided them. I uploaded them after he sent us a DVD.

<dd>I just went back and looked at it again; see my edit history on Commons <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/BradPatrick" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/BradPatrick" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I think the tagging was pretty explicit.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> 03:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Its a not a big issue really; after all I'm 100% sure these images are free. The confusion comes from the fact that the license tag asserts that "I, the author of this work, hereby publish it under the following license:", when you personally are not the creator. The self template has the <tt>author=</tt> parameter for circumstances like this. Depending on the details of his contract, either {{self|cc-by-sa-2.5|author=Gus Freedman}} or {{self|cc-by-sa-2.5|author=The Wikimedia Foundation}} would make sense.--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilf</a><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Nilfanion" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Nilfanion">anion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 21:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your contributions, hope you stick around. As a side note you may wish to give up your admin rights as Danny as done, since they were given to you due to your former position, rather than election as most other admins.

<dd>Hmm. On the one hand, I see your point (though I think it silly that Danny would have to be nominated as an Admin again; he's one of the greatest contributors in the history of the project - other positions, fine). On the other, I am prejudiced by not having had the luxury of doing a lot of editing given the nature of my work. The important benefit to adminship for me is being able to review deletion history - incredibly valuable to see what was going on in a particular situation. I don't do any blocking or reverting on a regular basis, and I obviously don't have any interest in <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> once I'm gone. What do other people think? Do you trust me to be an admin, irrespective of edit count?--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> 03:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's fine. Why go through an RfA formality — for the sakes of satisfying proceseseses <i>per se</i>? I wouldn't worry about it. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you were able to be trusted as <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> staff, we certainly have been placing enough trust in you already that we can let you stay an admin. No need to bother. We don't force any of the other non-standard admins (like the ones appointed by mailing list after 5 people said they agreed) to go through RfA again, why force you? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 03:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, Danny does not need to go through RFA again. He is a former administrator and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_bureaucratship_Danny_0d56.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Danny">bureaucrat</a> that did not leave under "controversial circumstances", as prescribed in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Giano_fdc9.html#Return_of_access_levels" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Giano#Return of access levels</a>, so if he desires the bits back, he just needs to request them to a bureaucrat. I don't see why the situation would be different here; Brad, you will not suddenly <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantization_%28physics%29.html" title="Quantization (physics)">quantize</a> to a different trust level, nor become less trustworthy on April 1. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">cool stuff</a>)</sup> 17:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Brad, thanks for all your work here; I appreciate, from the little experience I have in OTRS (which measures to <i>nothing</i> comapred to the trouble you deal with), how frustrating it can be. I also apologise for my actions towards you back in August (which you may have forgotten&#160;:) ), which would have done nothing to make your work easier.</dd>
<dd>So, thanks for helping Wikipedia grow through applying your expertise for the Foundation. Anyone who cares about this encyclopedia will realise that your job was (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">is</a>) paramount, and a lot of WMF's success is due to your unwavering actions.

<p>Didn't mean to stir up a bees nest&#160;:) I just threw the idea out there. I think it's entirely up to you Brad, and actually I think going up for RFA might get the trolls all worked up.

<p>I'm tempted to say don't bother, I'd certainly not calling for you to resign as an admin. However, you might want to go through the whole process just for sake of transparency and showing that you will stick closely to rules. On the other hand, you could feel it is a waste of time (for you, and for others) that will achieve little added benefit. So for which to do? Is up to you, based on which of the two sides of how it can be viewed that you most strongly agree with. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 15:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is bad advice. Brad Patrick mustn't go on RFA, and especially not for reasons of "transparency" (well, at least, you'd have to explain how "transparency" is served here) , but especially not for reasons of sticking closely to the rules: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>.</dd>
