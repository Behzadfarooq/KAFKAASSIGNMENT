</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Bratislava Castle</b> (<a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovak_language.html" title="Slovak language">Slovak</a>: <i>Bratislavský hrad</i>) is the main <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a> of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava.html" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, the capital of <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>.</p>
<p>The massive rectangular building with four corner towers stands on a quite isolated rocky hill of the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Carpathians_0d85.html" title="Little Carpathians">Little Carpathians</a> (<i>Malé Karpaty</i>) directly above the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> river in the middle of Bratislava. It is an outstanding feature of the city.</p>
<p>It provides an excellent view of Bratislava, of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and, when there is good weather, of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>.

<p>The castle building includes 4 towers (one on each corner) and a courtyard with an 80m deep water well. The biggest tower is the Crown Tower in the south-east from the 13th century, which housed the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_jewels.html" title="Crown jewels">crown jewels</a> (see History). The outside walls and inside corridors contain fragments of old <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> construction elements. To the east of the main entrance, one can see the walled up entrance gate from the 16th century. Behind the entrance, there is an arcade corridor and then the big <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> staircase, which leads to the expositions of the Slovak National Museum (<i>Slovenské národné múzeum</i>). The left part of the southern part of the building houses the 4 halls of the Treasure Chamber (opened in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>) with a collection of the most precious archaeological findings and other objects found in Slovakia, including the prehistoric statute called the Venus of Moravany. The 3rd floor houses the exposition History of Slovakia. The 1st floor in the southern part of the building houses the rooms of Slovak parliament - the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Council_of_the_Slovak_Republic_054f.html" title="National Council of the Slovak Republic">National Council of the Slovak Republic</a> - including parts of furniture from the 16th century. The northern part of the building- the former Baroque chapel, houses the Music Hall in which concerts are held. The court yard includes the entrance to the Knights Hall.</p>

<p>To the west of the castle building (see the picture), there is the newly reconstructed Hillebrandt building built in 1762 and destroyed by the 1811 fire (see History). The Yard of Honor is the space directly before the castle entrance. It was created in the late 18th century.<br />
Behind the Sigismund Gate and in front of the castle building, there is the Leopold Yard from the 17th century with bastions.<br />
To the east of the castle building the constellation of the Great Moravian basilica (9th century), the Church of St <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savior.html" title="Savior">Savior</a> (11th century) and other Early medieval objects is indicated on the ground. The true archaeological findings are directly below this indicated constellation.<br />
To the north-east of the castle building, next to the Nicholas Gate, there is the Lugiland <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastion.html" title="Bastion">Bastion</a> (which was a Gothic entrance gate in the 15th century), a long building from the 17th century (today a building of National Council of the Slovak Republic), and a Baroque stable (today a famous restaurant). An <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_park.html" title="English park">English park</a> is located to the south of the stable.<br />
The whole northern border of the castle site is formed by a long Baroque building from the 18th century, which today houses the Slovak National Museum and the castle administration.</p>

<p>The castle, like today's city, has been inhabited for thousands of years, because it is strategically located in the center of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> at a passage between the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpathians.html" title="Carpathians">Carpathians</a> and the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alps.html" title="Alps">Alps</a>, at a very important <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_%28crossing%29.html" title="Ford (crossing)">ford</a> used to cross the Danube river, and at an important crossing of central European ancient (trade) routes running from the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a> or the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic_Sea_c752.html" title="Adriatic Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> river or the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, the most important route being the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Route_6849.html" title="Amber Route">Amber Route</a>.</p>
<p>The people of the Boleráz culture (the oldest phase of the <a href="../../../b/a/d/Baden_culture.html" title="Baden culture">Baden culture</a>) were the first known culture to have constructed settlements on the castle hill. This happened around 3500 BC (i.e. in the high <a href="../../../e/n/e/Eneolithic_Period_4623.html" title="Eneolithic Period">Eneolithic Period</a>). Their "castle" was a fortified settlement and a kind of acropolis for settlements in today's Old Town of Bratislava.</p>
<p>Further major findings from the castle hill are from the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallstatt_Period_7dcd.html" title="Hallstatt Period">Hallstatt Period</a> (Early <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Age_6948.html" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, 750 – 450 BC). At that time the people of the Kalenderberg Culture built a building plunged into the rock of the castle hill. Again, the "castle" served as an <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acropolis.html" title="Acropolis">acropolis</a> for settlements found in the western part of the Old Town.</p>
<p><a name="Celts_and_Romans_.28450_BC_.E2.80.93_5th_Century_AD.29" id="Celts_and_Romans_.28450_BC_.E2.80.93_5th_Century_AD.29"></a></p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_T%C3%A8ne_Period_845d.html" title="La Tène Period">La Tène Period</a> (Late <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Age_6948.html" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celts.html" title="Celts">Celtic</a> Period, 450 BC – 1 BC ), the castle hill became a very important center of the Celts. In the last century BC (after 125 BC), the "castle" served as the acropolis of an oppidum (town) of the Celtic <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boii.html" title="Boii">Boii</a>. A great number and diversity of findings (including coins, house equipment, 2 buildings, castle entrance gate etc.) testifies this.</p>
<p>The castle hill, which was situated at the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> and thus since 9 BC at the border of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, was also settled by the Romans during the Roman Period (1st to 4th century AD) as findings of bricks of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_legion.html" title="Roman legion">Roman legions</a> (<i>Legion XIII GAN, Legion X GEPF</i> etc.) and some parts of architecture (a Roman figural relief, roof parts etc. ) suggest.</p>
<p>The developments in the 5th century (the time of the <a href="../../../m/i/g/Migration_Period_e626.html" title="Migration Period">Great Migration of Peoples</a>) are largely unclear.</p>
<p><a name="Slavs.2C_Nitrian_Principality.2C_Great_Moravia_.28500_.E2.80.93_907.29" id="Slavs.2C_Nitrian_Principality.2C_Great_Moravia_.28500_.E2.80.93_907.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava_Castle_b42f.html" title="Edit section: Slavs, Nitrian Principality, Great Moravia (500 &amp;ndash; 907)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slavs, Nitrian Principality, Great Moravia (500 – 907)</span></h3>
<p>The situation changed with the arrival of the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavs.html" title="Slavs">Slavs</a>, the direct predecessors of present-day <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovaks.html" title="Slovaks">Slovaks</a>, around <a href="../../../5/0/0/500.html" title="500">500</a> in the territory of Bratislava. Initially, they partly used older Roman and Celtic structures and added some fortifications. Probably at the end of the 8th century (definitely not later than in the early 9th century), at the time of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Nitra_eddb.html" title="Principality of Nitra">Principality of Nitra</a>, a Slavic castle with a wooden rampart was constructed with a huge area of 55,000 square metres. In the second half of the 9th century, at the time of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Moravia_5ac3.html" title="Great Moravia">Great Moravia</a>, a palace of stone surrounded by dwellings and a big <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basilica.html" title="Basilica">basilica</a> were added The basilica is the biggest Great Moravian basilica from the territory of Slovakia, and the area of the castle is approximately the same as that of the <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikul%C4%8Dice.html" title="Mikulčice">Mikulčice</a> site (the historical town "Moravia"), which is the most important Great Moravian archaeological site.</p>
<p>Material from old Roman buildings was used to construct this Slavic castle in Bratislava. This could be a confirmation of the disputed statement of <a href="../../../a/v/e/Aventinus.html" title="Aventinus">Aventinus</a> from the 16th century, who – referring to lost sources – claimed that around <a href="../../../8/0/5/805.html" title="805">805</a>/7 the Great Moravian prince Uratislaus (i.e. Vratislav) constructed today's Bratislava (Castle?) at the place of a destroyed Roman frontier fort called Pisonium, and the new settlement was named after him Uratislaburgium / Wratisslaburgium. Another probable fact is that around 900 the castle and the territory it controlled was given in fief to Predslav the third son of the Great Moravian king <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svatopluk_I_1eb4.html" title="Svatopluk I">Svätopluk</a> and that Pre(d) slav, or a person of the same name, is the person after which the castle and the town received its old German name <i>Pressburg</i> (from which the old Slovak name <i>Prešporek</i> is derived). The oldest version of this name was <i>Preslava</i> (Slovak)/*<i>Preslav(a) sburg</i> (German). It appeared for the first time in 907 (Battles at Bratislava) in the forms <i>Brezalauspurc(h)</i> (the first 100% sure name of Bratislava (Castle)), <i>Braslavespurch</i> and <i>Pressalauspruch</i> and then around 1000 on <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Hungary_9a0c.html" title="Kingdom of Hungary">Hungarian</a> coins as <i>Preslav(v) a Civitas</i> (meaning Bratislava Castle).</p>

<p>Although the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magyars.html" title="Magyars">Magyars</a> (Hungarians) destroyed Great Moravia around 907 and Bratislava probably became part of their territory, no Hungarian findings were found in the town up to the 12th century, implying that the administration was left to <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovaks.html" title="Slovaks">Slovaks</a>. The developments in the 10th century are unclear. The Slavic basilica and building were partly destroyed in the early 10th century. The construction of a new castle of stone started in the 10th century, but it was not finished. Under the Hungarian king <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_I_of_Hungary_ee6e.html" title="Stephen I of Hungary">Stephen I</a> (1000-1038), however, the castle was already one of the central castles of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Hungary_9a0c.html" title="Kingdom of Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>. It became the seat of a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comitatus_%28Kingdom_of_Hungary%29_9c52.html" title="Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)">county</a> (the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava_county.html" title="Bratislava county">Bratislava county</a>), protected the kingdom against <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemia.html" title="Bohemia">Bohemian</a> (Czech) and German attacks (e.g. in 1030, 1042, 1052, 1108, 1146) and played an important role in throne struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g. struggles after the death of King Stephen I.; occupation of the castle by King <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_of_Hungary_b692.html" title="Solomon of Hungary">Solomon</a>; occupation by King <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_III_of_Hungary_99dd.html" title="Stephen III of Hungary">Stephen III</a>) – see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bratislava_ad33.html" title="History of Bratislava">History of Bratislava</a>. Fighting with the German king <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_aa09.html" title="Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor">Henry III</a> in 1052 caused damage to the castle and the Hungarian king Salomon (1063-1074), who was living in the castle for a certain time, had it repaired in 1073-1074. The old Slavic rampart was modernized and the Church of the St. Savior with a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapter.html" title="Chapter">chapter</a> and a church school were added.</p>
<p>The castle was turned into a proto-<a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanesque.html" title="Romanesque">Romanesque</a> palace of stone in the 12th century (probably after 1179), maybe because King <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_III_2ccc.html" title="Béla III">Béla III</a> (1173-1196) decided to make <a href="../../../e/s/z/Esztergom.html" title="Esztergom">Esztergom</a> the definitive seat of kings of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was a palace similar to those constructed in Germany under <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Barbarossa_528f.html" title="Friedrich Barbarossa">Friedrich Barbarossa</a>. The church institutions and building at the castle were moved to the town below the castle in the early 12th century.</p>
<p>The well-fortified Bratislava Castle was among the few castles of the Kingdom of Hungary to be able to withstand <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol.html" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> attacks in 1241 and 1242. As a reaction to these attacks, a huge "tower for the protection of the kingdom" was constructed at the castle building in 1245 immediately next to two older palaces. The tower was actually a huge high residential building. In addition, 7 (genuine) square towers were built into the old Great Moravian rampart and a stone wall was added around the castle proper (i.e. the residential building). The biggest of the rampart towers was at the same time a corner tower of the stone wall. Today it is a part of the castle building - it is identical with the present-day "Crown tower", which is the biggest one of today's four towers of the castle building. It was probably built around 1250 when <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_St._John_3f97.html" title="Knights of St. John">Knights of St. John</a> were active at the castle.</p>
<p>The new castle had to face further conflicts. In 1271, the Bohemian king <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otakar_II_of_Bohemia_d153.html" title="Otakar II of Bohemia">Otakar II</a> invaded western Slovakia and charged the knight Egid with the administration of the conquered castle. Egid rebelled against Otakar two years later and was defeated by Otakar, but due to problems in Bohemia, Otakar had to leave this territory. In 1285-86, the noble Nicholas of <a href="../../../g/%C3%BC/s/G%C3%BCssing.html" title="Güssing">Güssing</a> (Kysak/Köszeg) occupied the castle in order to use it as a basis for a rebellion against the Hungarian king, but he was defeated. Shortly afterwards, 1287-1291, the Austrian duke <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_of_Habsburg_7b2a.html" title="Albert of Habsburg">Albert of Habsburg</a>, supporting Nicholas, occupied the castle, but was defeated by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Cs%C3%A1k_dfaf.html" title="Matthew Csák">Matthew Csák</a>, who was made county head of Bratislava county for this. A more or less successful Austrian occupation of the castle and the county occurred in 1302-1312/1322 by duke <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf.html" title="Rudolf">Rudolf</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of these permanent fighting, the Hungarian king granted the city rights (town charter) to a part of the settlements below the castle in 1291, thereby withdrawing them from the authority of the county head in the castle. Some settlements on the castle hill remained under the castle's authority and the fortification was gradually extended to them.</p>
<p>In 1385, King <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigismund_of_Luxembourg_5278.html" title="Sigismund of Luxembourg">Sigismund of Luxembourg</a> occupied the castle and the Bratislava county and one year later put the county in pawn to his cousins, the Moravian <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margrave.html" title="Margrave">margraves</a> Prokop and Jošt in exchange for a loan they provided to him. The castle was reconquered by the Polish-Slovak noble Stibor of Stiborice in 1389, who was made the county head of the Bratislava county in 1389-1402 as a reward. He had a chapel built in the Bratislava Castle.</p>
<p>Other allies of King Sigismund, especially in his fights against the Czech <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussites.html" title="Hussites">Hussites</a>, was the noble family Rozgoň (= Rozgonyi, of Rozhanovce), which received the Bratislava county head function in 1421. At some point between 1420 and 1430, King Sigismund (<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Emperor_674b.html" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>) decided to make the Bratislava Castle – due to its central location - the center of his new German-Czech-Hungarian empire. In 1423, the king ordered the Rozgonyis to improve the fortifications of the castle as a protection against Hussite attacks, because the castle was situated close to the Czech border and it was still protected only by the old Great Moravian wooden ramparts. They replaced the old rampart with a new better stone bulwark. Then between 1431 and 1434 a total rearrangement of the Bratislava castle took place. Experts from Germany were invited, material was transported from Austria, towns were imposed special taxes specifically for the construction of the planned largest castle ever built. The construction master was Konrad von Erlingen. The residential "tower" was demolished, and the form of the new Gothic palace was approximately similar to that of the present-day castle (but without two towers). Today, the only completely preserved part of the castle from that time is the Sigismund Gate (wrongly called the Corvinus Gate), i.e. the eastern entrance gate in the bulwark. Smaller parts have been preserve in the main palace. Sigismund plans, however, did not materialize, because the castle was never made Sigismund's residence and Sigismund always lived in the town below the castle.</p>
<p>After Sigismund's death in 1437, his widow <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_of_Celje_5bd6.html" title="Barbara of Celje">Barbara of Celje</a> was imprisoned in the castle by the new king Albert of Habsburg. In 1438, Albert's daughter was engaged to the markgrave Wilhelm von Meissen in the castle. Later on, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladislas_the_Posthumous_59e5.html" title="Ladislas the Posthumous">Ladislaus Posthumus</a> was probably living in the castle (parts of the castle were adapted for him at least). In 1440-1443, there were fighting between the castle of Bratislava ruled by county heads from the Rozgonyi family (supporting King <a href="../../../w/%C5%82/a/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_III_of_Poland_5ca0.html" title="Władysław III of Poland">Ladislaus I of Jagiellon</a>) and the town of Bratislava (supporting – and owned by – Queen Elisabeth which ruled for the young Ladislaus Posthumus) – see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bratislava_ad33.html" title="History of Bratislava">History of Bratislava</a> for details. Castle repairs of 1438, 1452 and 1463 included repairs of damages caused by the above conflict. A water well was constructed in the yard of the castle in the 15th century.</p>

<p>In 1536 (de facto already in 1531), after the Turks (the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>) had conquered present-day <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, Bratislava became the capital (seat of the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diet_%28assembly%29.html" title="Diet (assembly)">Diet</a> and of central authorities, place of coronations) of the remaining Kingdom of Hungary, which was renamed Royal Hungary and was ruled by the Austrian <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habsburgs.html" title="Habsburgs">Habsburgs</a> now. Consequently, the Bratislava Castle became the most important royal castle and the formal seat of the kings of Royal Hungary (who however resided in Vienna normally). At the same time, from the beginning of the 16th century, Bratislava and its castle had to face various anti-Habsburg uprisings in Royal Hungary on the territory of Slovakia. For example, troops of <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_Bethlen_7443.html" title="Gabriel Bethlen">Gabriel Bethlen</a> occupied the castle between 1619 and 1621, when it was reconquered by imperial (=Austrian) troops, and had the royal crown removed from Bratislava Castle till 1622.

The Bratislava Castle in the second half of the 16th century (by Hogenberger)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Immediately after the defeat of the Kingdom of Hungary in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_at_Moh%C3%A1cs_025c.html" title="Battle at Mohács">battle at Mohács</a> in 1526, during which the king died, the queen – <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_of_Habsburg_5adb.html" title="Maria of Habsburg">Maria of Habsburg</a> – fled with her retinue from <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buda.html" title="Buda">Buda</a> to Bratislava. The royal treasure (mostly very valuable objects of art, the royal <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scepter.html" title="Scepter">scepter</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a> and sword, the globe of Ladislaus of Jagiello known as Astrolabium etc.) and many other important objects she has taken with her were deposited in the Bratislava Castle and guarded by the royal burgrave Ján Bornemisza. Shortly afterwards, however, this precious treasure was mostly destroyed by the new king <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_6409.html" title="Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor">Ferdinand I</a> of Habsburg, who needed it to finance his participation in a civil war in Royal Hungary, and smaller parts went to the Treasury Chamber of Vienna (Wiener Schatzkammer), or became personal property of Maria, or got lost forever.</p>
<p>Taking into account the new role of the castle, the emperor Ferdinand I. of Habsburg had it rebuilt into a Renaissance castle by Italian builders and artists, such as Giulio Licino da Pordanone and Maciotanus Ulisses from Rome, between 1552 and 1562 (but some work continued even afterwards). The main designer and supervisor of the construction was the Italian architect Pietro Ferrabosco, who had been serving the emperor in Vienna and knew Count Eck Salm, the captain of Bratislava from 1552 – 1571. The building’s form did not change (except that the entrance was shifted), but it was completely changed inside and outside. Above all, floors and rooms were rearranged, and most rooms received precious (golden etc.) equipment. In late 16th century, a ball house (for various ball games) at the eastern wall and a second, better water well were added. Unfortunately, basically only one part of the castle chapel has been completely preserved from this time, paradoxically because it was walled up as “unnecessary” in the 17th century. As for the rest of the site, there were wooden dwellings for the guards (up to the 18th century) in the north-west, a (today unknown) “old tower” somewhere to the left of the castle building was improved, and the western entrance gate of the site was replaced by a big armoury.</p>
<p>In terms of the castle’s functions after 1530, the castle was home to selected participants of Diet meetings (including apartments of the king (emperor), which have been already there since the Gothic reconstruction ), to some central authorities of Royal Hungary, the county head of Bratislava etc., to the apartment of the Governor of Royal Hungary (usually a brother of the emperor), and since 1552, the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_jewels.html" title="Crown jewels">crown jewels</a> were deposited here as well – in what is today known as the Crown Tower. Initial and final meetings of the Diet took place in the castle too.</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava_Castle_b42f.html" title="Edit section: Early Baroque">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Baroque</span></h5>
<p>Since some of the Renaissance changes were done in haste (especially the wooden roof), as early as in 1616 a new, gradual Early <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> reconstruction started based on a design by the main imperial architect <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Battista_Carlone_f92d.html" title="Giovanni Battista Carlone">Giovanni Battista Carlone</a>. The works were intensified in 1635 and finished around 1647. It was mostly financed by Count Paul Pálffy (Pálfi), the captain of the castle and county head of Bratislava county. The look the castle received through this conversion is basically the look the castle has kept till the present. The northern and western part of the main building have been newly built and a new, 3rd floor was added in the whole building, the main entrance was shifted back to the middle of the wall, the ancient fortifications were improved, the chapel was shifted from the southern part to the northern part (today’s Musical Hall), and 2 new towers were added – yielding in sum the present 4 towers in the corners. As a reward for not having misappropriated state funds during the conversion, the Diet appointed Count Paul Pálffy lifelong captain of Bratislava Castle, county head of the Bratislava county and usufructuary of the castle (which remained in possession of the crown) in 1650. One year later, the emperor made those functions and titles hereditary for the Pálffys.</p>
<p>In 1653, all wooden ceilings turned out to be bad and had to be replaced in the following years, so that precious paintings placed on them got lost. Ten years later, facing one of frequent Turkish (Ottoman) attacks to the territory of Slovakia, the fortifications were improved under the leadership of the military engineer Josef Priami of the Imperial Court in Vienna. Further improvements of the fortifications followed around 1673. They ended with the final defeat of the Turks at Vienna in 1683. In 1703, barracks were built in the north-east of the site and the armoury was turned into barracks too. The present-day Vienna Gate was constructed on the occasion of the coronation of Emperor <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_VI%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_9fa0.html" title="Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles VI</a> in 1712 and it was used as the main entrance to the castle site since then.</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratislava_Castle_b42f.html" title="Edit section: The Maria Theresa conversion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Maria Theresa conversion</span></h5>
<p>When <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Theresa_of_Austria_c27a.html" title="Maria Theresa of Austria">Maria Theresa</a> became the queen of the Kingdom of Hungary in <a href="../../../1/7/4/1740.html" title="1740">1740</a>, she promised to the nobles of the kingdom that she would have a residence both in Austria and in the Kingdom of Hungary – that is in the Bratislava Castle. She kept the promise and spent much time in Bratislava. A corresponding conversion of the defense castle into a (at that time) modern royal residence was performed between <a href="../../../1/7/6/1761.html" title="1761">1761</a> and <a href="../../../1/7/6/1766.html" title="1766">1766</a>.</p>
<p>Minor changes however were done as early as from <a href="../../../1/7/4/1740.html" title="1740">1740</a> onwards: besides various changes in the interior, a large garden was added in the northern part of the site and Emperor <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_8b05.html" title="Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor">Francis I</a> (Maria Theresa's husband, who was interested in botany) created a small garden to the east of the castle building. The chief designer until <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a> was J.B. Martinelli.</p>
<p>Major changes inside the castle (in the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rococo.html" title="Rococo">rococo</a> style) were begun in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1760.html" title="1760">1760</a>. The new chief designer between <a href="../../../1/7/6/1761.html" title="1761">1761</a> and <a href="../../../1/7/6/1762.html" title="1762">1762</a> was Franz Anton Hillebrandt. A new single floor building for the kitchen, servants and horses was added to the western wall of the castle. Because the water supply for the castle was not sufficient, Maria Theresa had <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Kempelen_b183.html" title="Johann Wolfgang von Kempelen">Johann Wolfgang von Kempelen</a> build a special water pipe drawing water from a tank in the town at the Danube bank using pumps. The stairs throughout the castle were rebuilt with a lower gradient, on Maria Theresa's request, to enable her to ride her horse upon them. The result of these changes, as for the exterior of the palace itself and the site gates, was more or less the Bratislava Castle as we know it today.</p>
<p>Due to disputes with Hungarian nobles, Maria Theresa did not appoint a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatine_%28Kingdom_of_Hungary%29_ef44.html" title="Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)">palatine</a>, who used to represent the nobles, and instead in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1765.html" title="1765">1765</a> appointed a governor for the Kingdom of Hungary, who obeyed the queen. Bratislava Castle became his seat and the office of the county head left the castle. The second governor was <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_of_Saxe-Teschen_f431.html" title="Albert of Saxe-Teschen">Albert of Saxe-Teschen</a> since <a href="../../../1/7/6/1765.html" title="1765">1765</a>, the queen's son-in-law – the husband of queen's favorite daughter, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Christine_of_Austria_a303.html" title="Marie Christine of Austria">Marie Christine of Austria</a>. Albert and Maria Christine moved to the castle in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1766.html" title="1766">1766</a>. Since both of them were promoters of culture and science, the castle and the town became a place of frequent events and visits in the sphere of culture and science.</p>
<p>Because the governor did not have enough space, a new palace (later called the Theresianum) was built at the eastern wall of the castle building in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1767.html" title="1767">1767</a> - <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770.html" title="1770">1770</a>. It had been designed by Hillebrandt in the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classicism.html" title="Classicism">classic</a> style. Its furnishings were very expensive and precious and included hundreds of objects of art. The first floor was home to a family gallery, which later became the basis of today's <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albertina.html" title="Albertina">Albertina</a> Gallery in Vienna.</p>
<p>In addition, a winter riding school was added at the northern end of the castle site, a summer riding school was situated directly in the castle yard, both castle gardens were adapted (in the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn.html" title="Schönbrunn">Schönbrunn</a> style), and night lighting using oil lanterns was introduced on the access road to the castle for the first time in history. In <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770.html" title="1770">1770</a>, Maria Theresa herself ordered further valuable paintings and furniture to be provided to both the main castle and the Theresianum, and the governor moved into the completed Theresianum. Maria Theresa visited them frequently there, however mostly unofficially.</p>

<p>The office of governor of the Kingdom of Hungary was re-abolished in 1781 by the new king <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_44e5.html" title="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II</a> , and Albert of Sachsen-Teschen left the castle and took many parts of the equipment away. The (present-day Albertina Gallery) art collection went partly to Vienna, partly to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, where Albert became a new governor. Other objects moved mostly to Vienna. In 1783, Bratislava ceased to be the seat of central authorities of the kingdom. They were moved to Buda (now <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>). The crown jewels of the Kingdom of Hungary were moved to the <a href="../../../h/o/f/Hofburg.html" title="Hofburg">Hofburg</a> in Vienna.</p>
<p>In 1784, the Theresianum, some other secondary buildings of the site, and the gardens were adapted, because the castle became a "general seminary", which was a type of state school for <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> priests introduced by Joseph II. The general seminary of the Bratislava Castle played an important role in Slovakia's history, because it has educated many important Slovak intellectuals, for example <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_Bernol%C3%A1k_b949.html" title="Anton Bernolák">Anton Bernolák</a>, the author of the first successful codification of a Slovak standard language (see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Slovak_language_edf8.html" title="History of the Slovak language">History of the Slovak language</a>).</p>
<p>In 1802, the general seminary moved to another place, and the castle was assigned to the military as barracks. This was the beginning of the end of the castle. The rococo interiors of the castle were adapted in order to house some 1500 soldiers. In 1809, the Bratislava and the castle was bombarded by canons by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> troops. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">28 May</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a>, the castle burst into huge flames due to carelessness of Austrian and Italian soldiers in the castle. The fire even spread into parts of the town.</p>

<p>The destroyed castle gradually went to the dogs. The military sold parts of the main castle buildings to people as material buildings in the surroundings. Many parts of the site however continued to be used as barracks and adapted accordingly till 1946. In 1848, members of Slovak campaigns, which were campaigns supporting the imperial troops in their efforts to defeat the Magyars in the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolution_of_1848.html" title="Revolution of 1848">revolution of 1848</a>, laid down their weapons in the Bratislava Castle.</p>
<p>In 1946, the ruin was opened to the public. Two years later, the town constructed an <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphitheater.html" title="Amphitheater">amphitheater</a> in the northern part of the castle site. The amphitheater was in use for some 15 years.</p>

<p>Finally it was decided to restore the castle. Archaeological and architectonic research started in 1953 and long restoration works began in 1957. The restoration was done to the last (Baroque) state of the main building, but at many places older (Gothic, Renaissance) preserved elements or parts have been restored. The Theresianum has not been restored and the Hillebrandt building of 1762 was restored only around the year 2000. The Slovak painter <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janko_Alexy_a696.html" title="Janko Alexy">Janko Alexy</a> gained recognition for the restoration of the castle. The finishing of the restoration in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> was interrupted in August 1968, when the castle was occupied by <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_Pact_810c.html" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> troops (see <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague_Spring_4241.html" title="Prague Spring">Prague Spring</a>). On 28 October 1968, however, the Federation Law, turning the centralist state of Czechoslovakia into a federation of a Czech Socialist Republic (later called Czech Republic) and a Slovak Socialist Republic (later called Slovak Republic), was signed in the so-called Federation Hall of the castle. On 3 September 1992, the new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Slovakia_9b2e.html" title="Constitution of Slovakia">constitution of independent Slovakia</a> was signed in the Knights Hall of the castle.</p>
<p>Since 1968, the castle has been housing expositions of the Slovak National Museum (<i>Slovenské národné múzeum</i>) and at the same time its rooms have been used by the Slovak National Council (today the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Council_of_the_Slovak_Republic_054f.html" title="National Council of the Slovak Republic">National Council of the Slovak Republic</a>) for presentation purposes. In 1992, the castle housed a branch-office of the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovak</a> president temporarily and later in the 1990s the Slovak president temporarily. It still houses the museum and the presentation rooms for the National Council of the Slovak Republic and for the president. A new restoration has been planned for years, because since 1968 (except for adding the Hillebrandt building) only minor adaptations have been performed, such as in 1988 creation of the Treasure Chamber, in 1995 replacement of glass in the arcades of the solemn staircase, and in 1996-97 a complete repair of the roof. The last minor adaptations occurred on the occasion of the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush-Putin_summit_2005_0a2d.html" title="Bush-Putin summit 2005">Bush-Putin Bratislava summit</a> in February 2005.</p>
