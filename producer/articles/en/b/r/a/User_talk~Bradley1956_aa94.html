<p>I think it may be better to merge the two articles, there was reconstruction between the two periods but you can outline that in a history section.

<li>I have taken the guts of the Stockland Stadium site and placed it into the Dairy Farmers site. So it would be worth removing/deleting the stockland site and just keeping <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dairy_Farmers_Stadium_0144.html" title="Dairy Farmers Stadium">Dairy Farmers Stadium</a> site in operation. I am unsure of what is required to have the MERGE ARTICLES heading addressed or removed so could Ansell please do this for me.

<p>I made a change to this page regarding something you recently added. It was just a small part. I had problems with one sentance in particular. It refered to the anticipation or the emotions of the audiance for the NQCBs kick off at the stadium. This strikes me as something not suitable for wikipedia. I cant remember the exact policy it infringed upon... but i may be able to find it for you if you feel.</p>
<p>The main problem was that it seemed to have little fact and was is it had been written by a passionate fan, which when that happens, we can get side tracked. If you wanted to comment on the passion of the crowd you could perhaps detail, the anticipation, the advertisments leading up to the game or the <i>buzz</i> in the media. Just some hints. BTW, I think your doing some fantastic work. I wish we had more editors like you!&#160;:)</p>
<p>If your a CBs fan, congradulations on your recent win against New Castle. I picked New Castle to win that... I figure the joey johns factor would get them over the line... NCQBs must be premiership favourites now. I hope it happens this year too... despite me being a storm fan. I think you guys diserve one and so does QLD&#160;:). <a href="../../../p/o/d/User%7EPOds_fa4b.html" title="User:POds">POds</a> 10:05, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey mate.. Thats amazing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To your brocos, perhaps you could show them the following, after all they share a similar opinion to those who wanted to reduce rugby league in wikipedia to a few paragraphs in one article:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Delete Rugby league is a minor regional sport that deserves one article to explain its rules, history and main competitions. However, it is evident that its apologists intend to create a massive spread of articles about it on the lines of major sports with which it cannot possibly compete. This is a waste of space and is totally inappropriate to the encyclopaedic purposes of Wikipedia. The article Rugby League is more than sufficient and any more than that should be deleted. Indeed, it could be argued that the section on rugby league in the Rugby football article is sufficient mention of a sport that is an insignificant offshoot of the major sport of rugby union.Jack 20:45, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</i> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_September_10#Category:Rugby_league" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_September_10#Category:Rugby_league" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_September_10#Category:Rugby_league</a></dd>

<dd>Also, i was going to give you something... but i cant find it... if i ever come accross it, i'll post it here. It basicly says that theres two ways of thinking. Our way, and your broco mates way. It gives us a few points for our way&#160;:). Anyway, show them the above... Perhaps they'll change there way when they realise they're like a bunch of union die hards who'd rather see rugby league at the bottom of big hole. <a href="../../../p/o/d/User%7EPOds_fa4b.html" title="User:POds">POds</a> 11:41, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you say the page does not coincide with the style of wikipedia? It runs parallel with all the other club articles from the NRL. Look at the Sydney Roosters PAGE. It is no where near as neat as the North Queensland page. What bothers you? The fact it has pictures? Maybe it is the fact it has information year after year after year and you just cant remember the Brisbane Broncos history. I have been a long time loyal fan of North Queensland from day one and dont have a gripe with anyone elses club pages. The articles are written from a perspective of that clubs followers. If I wrote about the Brisbane Broncos it would be alot different if a Brisbane Supporter wrote about them. That is what is beautiful about wikipedia. Everyone is entitled to edit any page they desire. Write about any subject. That is the major policy of wikipedia in general. Not have people going around saying no mate thats to long or that has to much information. Why does a page have to be cleaned up becuase it is long? what garbage. I dont see the science articles that go on for centuries on wikipedia being cleaned up. That is what is required from a science to get the message across. This is what it is all about. Wikidepia is an editing tool for people to write articles! [[<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradley1956_a8fe.html" title="User:Bradley1956">Bradley1956</a> 12:18, 14 May 2006 (UTC)]]</dd>

<p>Suppose you get into an edit war. Or worse, a revert war. So you try to stay cool. This is good. Congratulations! However, what would be great is if you could carry on working on the article, even though there is an edit war going on, and even though the version on the top is the evil one favoured by the other side in the dispute. So make a personal copy as a subpage of your user page. Just Start a new page at user:MY NAME/ARTICLE NAME, and copy and paste the wiki-source in there. Then you can carry on improving the article at your own pace! If you like, drop a note on the appropriate talk page to let people know what you're doing. Some time later, at your leisure, once the fuss has died down, merge your improvements back in to the article proper. Maybe the other person has left Wikipedia, finding it not to their taste. Maybe they have gone on to other projects. Maybe they have changed their mind. Maybe someone else has made similar edits anyway (although they may not be as good as yours, as you have had more time to consider the matter). Try it. You might like it.</p>

<p>Hi, once again I say great work on NQC. There are a few <b>minor</b> problems I think should be addressed. Already mentioned above, I talked about <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Feature articless</a>, articles of the highest standard on Wikipedia. Some sports team articles which are up there are <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_F.C._0a5a.html" title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cricket_team.html" title="Indian cricket team">Indian cricket team</a> is close to becoming one. I reckon Cowboys could reach there if a couple of changes happen.</p>
<p><br />
1. If you see the FA's above, their history section is not as long and detailed. <b>But</b> thats not a problem. You can make another article called History of North Queensland Cowboys. The history should be about 4 paragraphs.</p>
<p>2. Records is a similar issue to history. Create North Queensland Cowboys records and only summarise on the main article.</p>
<p>3. Add some more sections, like on home ground - Dairy Farmers Stadium, the supporters of NQ, their blue/yellow and white jersey ...</p>
<p>4. Most importantly it has to be referenced. Read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> for this.</p>
<p>There are a couple of minor things, like 2006 squad section goes above external links and references. Otherwise, its not as bad when I first encountered it few months ago. Use the articles I mentioned above as a basis. You seem to understand how Wikipedia works now. Keep up the good work! <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 13:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If someone has deleted large amounts of a page that you have contributed largley too and they have not left any comments then it appears to have been vandalised. In which case, revert the page.</p>
<p>BUT - I've just had a look at that page and it seems as if someone has edited it in an attempt to clean it up. Start a discussion on that page and ask the person or others why large amounts have been deleted. If you believe this was pure vandalism and not an attempt to clean it up, than revert it. But i warn you, dont get angry just because someone has taken a large part of your work and done something with it. This is what wikipedia is about. Its about continual improvement and your page has a large banner on it, proclaiming that it NEEDS to be cleaned up, with specific mentioning of the tone of the article.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could read other articles and figure out how to make your article sound more like those? This is something i've had to do, I.e. grow my vocabulary and general english skills. It may be something you might want to think about? The only way we do this is through lots of practice. So i suggest, that instead of adding things to your page for quite a while, you work on making it sound better with respect to what Wikipedia thinks a good article should sound like. You can find out this information very easily by search for Wikipedia policies. <a href="../../../p/o/d/User%7EPOds_fa4b.html" title="User:POds">POds</a> 08:02, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Robertsaustralia.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>Hey I've noticed you're a regular on rugby league articles, particulary NRL ones. I need your advice on something I'm thinking of starting up on the project. Many WikiProjects have Article Improvement Drives which have different levels of success. I'm thinking of starting one up for this one too, but instead of voting on an article I would rather strive to improve one NRL club every fortnight and bring it up very close to featured status. Now it seems as though there'd be a lot of work involved, but there are also a lot of club fans out there who'd probably be willing to participate. Basically there are 30 weeks in the NRL season and there are 15 club pages that are not yet featured. I propose that we all have a schedule to work on one new article every second round, in alphabetical order. By the end of the season hopefully we will have 15 near-complete, if not complete articles. My only concern at this stage is the dedication of editors to help out other team pages that they are not interested in. Basically in order to get the support of editors like these, we need a few leaders in the project. If you are willing to dedicate a bit of your time every week into this and if you have any further suggestions, could you let me know at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Rugby_league_Article_improvement_drive_06a2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rugby league/Article improvement drive">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rugby league/Article improvement drive</a>?
