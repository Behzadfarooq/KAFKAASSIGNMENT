<p>I added many links to the Toronto wikipedia page, links that are tourism related, yet you only chose to delete a few, not all (even some which are more commercial than others). It is bias. You obviously have a preference or allegiance with some sites but not others. If you do so again without any legitimate reason, I will have Wikipedia remove you.</p>
<p>Toronto.com is the MOST commercial site out there, and yet you did not remove that. There are also other websites. Idiot.</p>

<p>It is only spam when you GAIN PROFIT from advertising. I am a proud Torontonian, and as such, I take a special interest in promoting the city (through my website) to the world and potential visitors. I challenge you to find another site that features more useful information with less advertising than my site. I do not gain money from my site, despite a minor ad or two, which are much less intrusive than many other sites you have added yourself. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.56.115.178.html" title="User:72.56.115.178">72.56.115.178</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.56.115.178.html" title="User talk:72.56.115.178">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.56.115.178_21f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.56.115.178">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>No, it is not only spam when you advertise. It is spam when you keep adding your own site to numerous articles, it is very disruptive.

</dl>
<p>And how is it intrusive? I mainly added links to more information I believe visitors would find useful. Okay, I may be promoting the city too much to not say the "negative" side of things in the city, but most of it, including the profiles and descriptions of attractions and what have you, are all neutral. I'm sorry, you didn't add links. What I meant was that many others have added far more commericial links (to Toronto and others) and you didn't delete them. *I* had to do that. Fodor's and Frommer's, while good sites, are aimed at increasing sales for their travel guides. TorontoInfoCenter.com is nothing but a list of spam. And yet you didn't do anything about those sites. You obviously have a bias about the city and quality information.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.56.115.178.html" title="User:72.56.115.178">72.56.115.178</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.56.115.178.html" title="User talk:72.56.115.178">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.56.115.178_21f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.56.115.178">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Sorry, I don't know how to add my signature. Anyway, you would be much more credible if your previous actions show it. Again, there were many links in Toronto which were much more commercial and you did nothing to them (see examples I mentioned). I never said there wasn't advertising on my site. However, ads on my links are very minimal if you compare it to most sites including Toronto travel sites. And besides, my site has a lot more information compared to many other travel sites, for Toronto or other cities. In fact, I was contacted by an official at TorontoTourism.com regarding further promotion of my site because of the value it contains. What you clearly have is a bias against my site. You say you have a bias against spam in general, but that is not the case. You probably have a bias against this city too. Where do you live? Probably elsewhere in Canada where people are so jealous of us. Anyway, I'm not even going to reply to any more of your comments, because it is just futile. Go edit other Wikipages if you feel the need. But don't harm a good page about Toronto, and the good links. I have done much to better the links section of Toronto. You've only served to destroy that.</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean. This is a factual statement. Coolidge is a celebrity and her writing partner and romantic interest is of relative importance. It is under the the topic of trivia and it is true. What in your opinion is the problem? 4comfort 11:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, it took me a while to figure out what was going on here, since the page shows I never edited it. I think I might have been reverting the previous edit by [68.209.106.93] at the same time you werr adding to it, but your changes got in and mine did not, then I was issuing a warning to [68.209.106.93] and it got to you instead.

<p>Sorry for assuming that easy access to government documents would make it easier to maintain her posting and mention.</p>
<p>As an enthisiast for cross cultural sharing and healing, I openly admit to having several interests in keeping Dr. Martha Cohen's efforts recognized, not the least of which is to acknowledge the continuing need for more social psychologists to become activists in making change as she has for most of her life, creating healing in the aboriginal community as well a creating productive and positive community bonds that have perpetuated. Another interst I must admit I have as an internationally active lecturer in many countries each year, is that while Dr. Cohen is particularly an icon of that work she has done most of her work and still lives in my home city of Calgary, Canada.</p>
<p>I respect the standards you have set and try and enforce at Wikipedia and there are areas I'd like to help in any way and be involved, particularly in areas of human response, communication psychology, design psychology, social strategies and change -- the scienctific realms I correlate for my classes.</p>
<p>In the meantiem I will try and learn and if you have any suggestions on how I can help with the Martha Cohen insertion, please pass them on.</p>

<p>Thanks for the notice. I actually was just trying to add my company to the company list on this page. There are many others added to this as well. I did not intend to spam, as many other of my competitors have their sites listed on this page too. Can you tell me how to add a company page or request a consideration?

<dd>Sorry, but I'm not the best person to ask. I generally just remove what I consider spam links, and tag articles that are short on content. Someone else does the article deletion. I think I tagged one of your articles and removed some links, other people did the rest. Wikpipedia is not going to be like a Yellow pages, where every company gets a listing. e.g. none of my companies will be listed here.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBrat32_b0ca.html" title="Edit section: Strategic planning software">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategic planning software</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_planning_software.html" title="Strategic planning software">Strategic planning software</a> article is off to a rough start and have some comments I am posting simultaneously to Ericaolsen (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EEricaolsen_4b5e.html" title="User talk:Ericaolsen">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ericaolsen_b537.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ericaolsen">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrat32_4f40.html" title="User:Brat32">Brat32</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brat32_638d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brat32">contribs</a>). I suggest that the article is salvageable.</p>
<p>The problem started when Brat32 identified some self-interest edits made to promote a company. In my opinion, Brat32's vigilance is appropriate and helpful to Wikipedia. I do the same type of thing almost everyday, much to the displeasure of a long list of corporate users. Brat32 is to be commended for this diligence.</p>
<p>Brat32 placed a speedy delete tag on the strategic planning software article, which normally an administrator would review and then decide if it should be deleted (or not). However, before an administrator could act, the article was blanked by Ericaolsen. This is not quite proper protocol, because the speedy delete tag was deleted, which should not be done, especially by the creator of the article.</p>
<p>However, reviewing the article, I don't see a problem with writing generically about that type of software, even by someone who is involved in the business, so long as their own company is not promoted. They know a lot about the topic and should be able to write about it generically in a well-informed manner. Any biases that creep in will be corrected by other knowledgeable editors.</p>
<p>I reworked the article, removing some of the obvious references to specific software. I don't know anything about the topic, so it will need more clean up.</p>
<p>So, I suggest allowing the article to grow and even invite Ericaolsen to expand it, hopefully providing citations from third-party sources. If any of the phrases are directly from your own software documenation, they need to be come out and be rewritten or someone will soon tag the article as a <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">copyright violation</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonHarder_ef53.html" title="User:JonHarder">JonHarder</a> 14:11, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not a problem - since someone replaced the prod again, I've taken the liberty of creating a discussion at AFD. Please feel free to add your analysis there.

<dd>Tagging a food article to be added to the WikiDictionary when it is being proposed for deletion is not helpful. You seem to be doing a lot of similar confusing changes that are not helpful. For example you just tagged an article for speedy delete, without a reson, when it was already tagged with a prod that was of more use to all. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrat32_4f40.html" title="User:Brat32">Brat32</a> 03:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made legitimate comment about fixing an error on the CfD page, and made it to the bot administrator before removing the comment. I don't see how that's inappropriate. As for the Sardar Mahtab Ahmed Khan, the reverter agreed with me and REIMPLEMENTED my version of the page, so I hardly see why I can't remove that message either. 132.205.93.88 04:00, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brat32, if I may humbly interject, please be a bit more judicious in giving out warnings. The IP user obviously made a good-faith edit, and if an edit is deemed unhelpful but is in good-faith, it is not vandalism. I would advise you to read up on <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">Wikipedia's policy about dealing with newcomers</a> and remove the warnings you left as a good-faith effort to resolve the situation.

<p>Hi there! I did take a look at the user's contributions before making a comment, and I believe that he's been a valuable contributor and the adding of the Wiktionary tag seems appropriate, for it allows for a discussion to take place. as to whether or not it should be moved. There is absolutely no harm being done, and while the user was wrong in removing the warning, I don't feel that the warning was justified in the first place. It's ultimately up to you, but from an outside perspective, I don't think the user has done anything wrong. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 05:02, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brat32, I've looked over the dispute and I think I may know how you feel to an extent. As a matter of fact, it was hoopydink who corrected me, too, on a somewhat similar basis.

<li>Just a friendly reminder to use an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a> when proposing deletion for an article. Edit summary usage is always good, but it is especially important that edit summaries are used when proposing deletion. The reason for this is that articles proposed for deletion that later have the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag removed should not be proposed for deletion again, but rather sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>. The only easy way to check if an article was previously proposed for deletion is to look at the edit history and the edit summaries people have left before. Thanks!</li>
<li>I have removed the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag from Big Fish Entertainment, which you proposed for deletion, because its deletion has previously been contested or viewed as controversial. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Proposed deletion</a> is not for controversial deletions. For this reason, it is best not to propose deletion of articles that have previously been de-{{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ed, even by the article creator, or which have previously been listed on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>. If you still feel the article should be deleted, please don't add the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} template back to the article, but feel free to list it at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>.
