<p>I was at an event where they said this would be released in Australia in March and never in the US (probably working on old news, typical), but it's damn fun. Perhaps a synopsis of some of the stuff involved in it is in order? Also I believe it's based on a book by the Japanese guy who features in the game, but I know no more than that. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 14:46, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whoever wrote that Brain Traning 3 will come out in Europe when it's not even out in Japan is incorrect. There is no 3rd Brain Training game and Nintendo hasn't announced it either.

<p>The game has been in the top 10 of the Japanese software sales in 47 of the last 51 weeks (that is, since it was released, only 4 weeks it stayed outside the top ten). I believe that is quite noteworthy. I was planning on adding a chart showing that information. However, I am not enterily sure about how to do it, since there must be 47 different bars (see User:ReyBrujo/Temp/Japanese hardware sales, the lowest chart is the one with the BT game information).

<p>On the note of verifiable items in the article, is there any conclusive evidence that the head-shaking is a direct response to saying "Microsoft" and "PSP", or is it just a sort of "I don't know what you're saying" response?

<dd>It sold slightly more than half of what it's done in Europe in NA. In NA, it surpassed 1.1 million. In EU, it surpassed 2 million. The latter was according to a Nintendo press release. Combined, the game has sold more than 5 million as Brain Training, in three different regions (Australia, Europe, and Japan). As Brain Age, it's done less than 1.5 million in two (USA and Canada). Really, I think the situation asks for you to show why Brain Age is more well-known. The fact that it sold more as Brain Training is quite the good reason.</dd>

<dd>You forgot to mention that there is only ONE thing on either side that isn't anecdotal evidence for Trace Memory's move dispute - what you just mentioned. If Trace Memory had verifiably sold more than double as copies in NA than it did in EU, I wouldn't move it. However, I am not arguing for "first appearance tops all" at any point. I'm saying "since it's the best argument I have and is better than your argument, it works". Brain Age coming to NA before Brain Training came to EU doesn't matter, because Brain Training is the name in EU and Australia, and it is also more popular in those two territories than NA. At no point should being released in NA trump that. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with your theory though A Link to the Past is that page names should reflect what English readers while look up in situations like this and not sales numbers.

<dd>(multiple edit conflict) Never in your move attempts you stated you were moving them based in amount of copies sold. The three times were based simply in "it launched first in Europe". Now you are trying with the "sold" amount. However, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">this</a> guideline is pretty clear: <i>use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things</i> You are basing yourself in the fact that, since the game sold more in Europe, it is more known than in US. However, check the References section of the article: 4 mentions to Brain Training, 13 mentions to Brain Age. Therefore, per the article's own references, it is clear the game is better known as Brain Age than Brain Training. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 03:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, the majority of reliable references are from North American sources? Blows my mind, never would have guessed that because North American gaming media is more powerful than European gaming media, the odds of North American media being referenced is much higher. And I never said Another Code sold more copies. I said we have no IDEA how many copies Another Code sold, but we do have the Sega Mega Drive argument to back that up, and we do know that it came first. Being moved to Brain Age isn't backed up by the SMD argument, and because the sales are exceedingly higher in EU/AU than in NA, coming first is out because it's a lesser argument. Also, English is a common language in many EU regions, so I don't see why they should be excluded. It's language, not nationality that matters. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You agree that North American gaming media is more powerful (I am guessing this means North American sites are accessed by many more readers than European ones, right?). Then, wouldn't you agree that it is more likely someone who comes to this article is more likely to be referred to a North American site about the game, or come from a North American resource (say, Time magazine, in example)? Note that I prefer the old name better than the new one, but I would much prefer leaving the article in a simpler link like <i>Brain Age</i> or <i>Brain Training</i>. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 04:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>What? Brain Training does NOT get more Google Hits. Using both the shortened names (Brain Age and Brain Training) and the full names get way more Google hits for the North American name. Also, there are 708 million people in Europe (compared to 310 million for US/Canada. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 04:44, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that proves that the EU market is stronger why...? Are you saying that population is the only determining factor in a market's strength? Regardless, the attach ratio of Brain Training is 5:1, compared to Brain Age's 10:1 (just for trivia's note, Nintendogs in Europe is 2:1). Google hits are purely anecdotal evidence, and do not cancel out the fact that it is the original name (an argument successfully used for the Sega Mega Drive article), does not factor in that there is a book related to the game called Brain Training, the fact that it sold more in Europe, the fact that it is the #2. best-selling DS game ever in Europe, and only the #5. best-selling DS game ever in North America. In Japan, it's #5., while the sequel is #3. Your only arguments are that it was Brain Age in NA first, and the Google hits. The only GOOD argument is the "first come, first serve" argument, but we KNOW that it is more popular, and we KNOW that the name was originally Brain Training. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 04:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Where did those attach ratios come from? And where did those numbers like it being the second best DS game in Europe come from? <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 05:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nintendo press releases and NPD data. In Europe, Nintendogs = 5 million, Brain Age = 2 million, New Super Mario Bros. = 2 million. And I'm still waiting for why sales figures, being the original name, and being based on a book called Brain Training loses to Google hits. It'd be great to know. Oh, by the way - Brain Training is presently the number one selling DS game week after week in the UK. Not so in North America. It's also the best-selling in Germany week after week (and sometimes, it's the best selling of any game in that week), and one of the best-selling games in France. I don't see how you can argue that despite a clear disadvantage in popularity, Brain Age should take the title.

<p>Google hits? USA is a stronger industry, and thusly has more media coverage, and thusly will get more hits. Considering how much larger the industry is in North America compared to Europe, the fact that Brain Training has almost outsold Brain Age by 2:1 speaks to how much more popular it is in Europe. Also, it's the original name. Brain Training is the name of the book, and in all but one in the world in which it has been released, it is known as Brain Training. Brain Age in North America is the exception. I don't understand the idea that Brain Age, which sold less, is not the original name, and is in a stronger market should be the name instead of the original name, which sold more, and is in weaker markets. In Europe, it's sold more. In Japan, it's sold more. The only region Brain Age has beaten Brain Training in is Australia, and DS Lite is not very strong there at all compared to NA, EU, or JP. And will you stop trying to paint my actions as acting bad faith?! You keep making it seem like I changed the redirects for the sake of forcing the situation my way. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 04:35, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Brain Training is not the name of the book. It's <i>Train Your Brain</i>, a slightly different title, but in any case it should not be used to justify the name of hte game.

<p>There seems to be a great deal of confusion. See, the only arguments that work for Brain Age are "it came to NA first" and "Google hits" (which is anecdotal evidence that leans towards North America on account of the fact that many of the top hits for this game come from the biggest media websites, which are all based in NA). However, I can state for a fact that it has sold significantly more in Europe + Australia (Hell, EU alone outsells it, Australia's just an extra nail in the coffin). The name is not incorrect to the Japanese name, and is recognized by more EU/AU DS owners than NA DS owners.</p>
<p>I have provided EU sales for Brain Age, but will not provide NA sales - would if I could, but NPD forbids posting that information. However, AGF more or less states that you'll have to trust me in that what I say is true. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 03:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
