The film depicts a world society created in the aftermath of a catastrophic war, in which an all-powerful world government has eliminated war, crime, and poverty through compulsory use of the sedative drug "Prozium". All races have equality and citizens of the society wear colour-coded clothing according to their class. Outside the clean, efficient cities are "The Nethers", a reference to the Savage Reservations of <i>Brave New World</i>. The Nethers, which encompass the ruins of cities destroyed during the war, are home to those who do not wish to live in the new society. <i>Equilibrium</i> borrows imagery from <i>Brave New World</i> such as the "T" symbol and colour-coded clothing.</li>
