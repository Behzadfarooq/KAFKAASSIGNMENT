<p>Slight NPOV alterations. Any bugger who can come up with stuff like that "<a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouseland.html" title="Mouseland">Mouseland</a>" parody doesn't deserve a rhetorical fellation. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareq_afd7.html" title="User:Wareq">Wareq</a> 02:11, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fellation? I beg your pardon? Please show any mistruths to the material you removed, or I will keep re-instating it.</p>

<p>Your points might be better accomplished, rather than posting untrue libels towards Brad, by coming up with a page for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gerich_c3b9.html" title="John Gerich">John Gerich</a>, including mention of his conviction for fraud. Maybe even call up <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Thomson_a2b3.html" title="Andrew Thomson">Andrew Thomson</a> and get a copy of that memo he has been talking about recently in the Legislature where the Liquor Board is ordered, in the early 90s, to deliver copius quantities of free liquor to Gerich's office. Wikipedia accepts images, but you have to sign up for an account.</p>
<p>Brad was barely even in his mid 20s when the Devine PC's left office, and most certainly was not in a position of authority. In many cases, the Devine PC's flouted the law (ie: retroactive legislation of the harmonized PST) -- you expect they would have given influence to a 23-year-old new hire?</p>
<p>64.110.251.69 16:12, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If this is the case than the part about what happned under Devine both negative and positive should not be in the article about Brad Wall.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Negative things happened under Grant Devine's government? What might those be? And certainly they pale in comparison to anything that has happened under the current NDP government. Pretty much every record from the Devine era for government waste, patronage pork, waste in the Crowns, investment losses, corruption, and scandalous behaviour has been broken by the current government.</p>
<p>Yes negative things happened and this discussion has nothing to do with the current government but Brad Wall who did work as an assistant during the Devine government. When negative things happened well he was employed and they are posted you have deleted them. Either both sides of the story goes up or neither. Not one side of the story.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>That he worked as an assistant to the Honourable John Gerich isn't in dispute at all. As I suggested earlier, if you want the 'truth' to be known about the former Associate Minister, why don't you come up with a wiki page. I am sure there are plenty of articles to plagiarise from The Commonwealth or from any of the Regina newspapers if you want, or even that book, "SaskScandal" which quite elaborately lays out the whole chronology of fraud prosecutions against John Scraba/Gerich/Berntson/Hopfner/Hodgins/Meikeljohn/McLaren/Duncan/etc.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Saskatchewan was an exciting place to be in the 1980s under Devine, Saskatchewan did hit an all-time population high under Devine, Saskatchewan did attract significant foreign investment into such entities such as The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Cameco, SaskOil, etc. And these organizations, for the most part, have absolutely fluorished once they were free of government control, undoubtedely because they were being absolutely mismanaged while under government control. Brad Wall was a part of the economic revitalization of Saskatchewan, and it is something to be absolutely proud of.</p>
<p>64.110.251.69 17:33, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He was an assitant, who you said had little influence on the government. So why would you include that in here when that belongs in the article on Devine? The only thing that could be added to the page during his time as an assistant is about the issue of the liquor board, which was added and deleted by yourself. Also to clear one thing up at the end of Devines government which Brad Wall was so much a part of according to yourself Saskatchewan saw more people leaving than currenlty are.</p>

<p>It now seems abundantly clear that someone who has fond memories of the Devine era has taken upon him/herself to go through Wikipedia and make it seem as though EVERYBODY has fond memories of the period. In the process, the culprit has single-handedly dragged the quality of Wikipedia down.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it is almost an honourable effort. The blatant lack of regard for the standards/guidelines of Wikipedia is evidence of someone who does not even find it necessary to hide such unabashed bias in subtlety or clever nuance. In fact, I suspect that this 'article' was simply lifted from some sort of official bio of Wall (suggesting it is not sourced - another no-no).</p>

<dd>Reverted. Brad Wall is a human being, not just a politician.

<dd>This article has significant NPOV issues. His interest in wrestling and long running cartoons aside, the article doesn't even pretend to be an objective examination of this particular individual. Much of the article isn't necessary (such as the WWE and Simpsons "information") and much of it seems more like a press release from Mr. Wall's office. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 20:34, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted back some old edits which I think are allowed in wikipedia articles such as personal bio information. If that is not allowed I do apoligize. I also put back some parts which were deleted due to bias, but edited them to a degree which I think makes them neutral. Also parts of the article are taken directly from the Sask Party bio page for Brad not sure if that makes any difference or not. Seaweed69</p>

<dd>I think your edits looked pretty good. I made a few edits for additional NPOV purposes. As for information being taken directly from Brad Wall's bio page, that is a no no so we'll have to fix that. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 17:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Articles are NOT created/maintained by syphocants in order to stroke the ego of their subject (or the writer's own ego, for that matter) and are NOT political campaign adds. They are also NOT for the purposes of rewriting history to fit the writer's own personal biases. This article fails when the above criteria are considered. I'm not being "negative" as 64.110.251.69 has claimed, but I think it's obvious to most readers that any attempts at professionalsm and objectivity are lacking and that this article's NPOV issues need to be addressed in a constructive manner. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 02:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Political campaign ads? Give you head a shake. Please stop imposing your own partisan agenda here and be more respectful of wikipedia.</p>

<dd>In fact I don't have a partisan agenda. My only agenda is that articles for wikipedia are objective and professional. The changes being made to the article are an attempt to make this article conform to wikipedia guidelines. They are not vandalism. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 17:56, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added Wall's work for the Honourable Graham Taylor -- but I am not sure which ministry Graham Taylor was involved in. I am pretty sure he was charged with fraud as well. The article seems to be reasonably balanced at this point -- so my attention and time probably will be very limited in the future.</p>
<p>64.110.251.69 14:00, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. I certainly have no concerns with it now. Thank you for your efforts and contributions. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnieHall_12a5.html" title="User:AnnieHall">AnnieHall</a> 14:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I got them all. Not sure which ministries Wall was associated with, however. Maybe I will ask him next time I see him.</p>

<p>I see that somebody keeps adding a reference to Brenda Baaken, and some comments aimed at the leadership style of Brad Wall. A reference to the CBC is even included, which states, inter alia:</p>
<p>"Bakken-Lackey, a Saskatchewan Party MLA, issued a cryptic news release describing her frustrations with the "political system". (geez, I wonder why, after Pat Atkinson bullied her in the Legislature calling her a 'dog')</p>
<p>and further,</p>
<p>"However, she told the Regina Leader-Post newspaper she had frustrations with her own caucus, as well as the political system as a whole." (this isn't even a valid source in itself, because its 2nd hand, and isn't actually a quote, but is rather innuendo).</p>
<p>However, no evidence whatsoever has been adduced that Brad Wall himself, nor his leadership style, has been a source of dissatisfaction with Ms. Baaken-Lackey.</p>
<p>I think one should also take a look at the page for <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorne_Calvert_7382.html" title="Lorne Calvert">Lorne Calvert</a>. There is lots of anecdotal evidence of strife within that caucus, yet the article isn't polluted with unsupported or weakly supported commentary.</p>
<p>70.73.4.197 06:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You keep removing a cited source. Please stop. The page of Brad Wall has nothing to do with that of any other on wikipedia.70.64.4.74</p>
<p>The source doesn't bear any relevance. The source will be removed so long as it bears no relevance or no relevant information.</p>
<p>70.73.4.197 08:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Acually, the source does have relevance to the leadership of Brad Wall. Please quit being a vandal70.64.4.74</p>
