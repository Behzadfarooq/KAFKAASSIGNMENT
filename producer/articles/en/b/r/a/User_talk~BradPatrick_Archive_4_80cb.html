<p>Hello Brad. In reference to your removal of some legal information from the McKenna article, an editor finds it necessary to have your comments regarding this removal included in the article. I have removed the information twice, as it can be construed as a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> violation (negative info sourced by a self-sourced cite). A minor revert war is now in progress over it. You might want to express your opinion about this inclusion on the talk page. I did not think that it is a good idea for this section to be included in the article. Here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_McKenna&amp;diff=79276966&amp;oldid=79275618" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_McKenna&amp;diff=79276966&amp;oldid=79275618" rel="nofollow">diff</a> of the section in question. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:55, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, that's why then. I'm not registered because I'm trying to limit what I register to and I haven't seen much need to edit pages so far. Also, after looking around on that page, I see only statistics regarding articles, which is unrelated to the statistic I am looking for. I'm trying to compare Wikipedia's usercount to DSmeet's (soon to be ABXY's) usercount after an equivalent duration of existence. --24.73.51.219 19:12, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've fielded several questions on IRC lately regarding the importance of privacy regarding the checkuser permission, and in order to give those who have similar questions some answers, wrote up a draft of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Checkuser_Privacy" class="extiw" title="m:Checkuser_Privacy">m:Checkuser Privacy</a> on Meta.

<p>There's a poll on the talk page of the amendment, but I think that is rather silly, I think we should follow the advice of the Wikimedia lawyers, which would be you&#160;:) So I think your input here would be very helpful.

<dd>Thanks for responding. I actually agree with you that we should not seek to compromise our ambition of creating a Free encyclopedia, even if the law permits us to use fair use materials. I just hope that the same standards will be applied in the future for the main page as for other portals, since the inconsistency can be rather frustrating.

<p>Hello there, and thanks for all the work you do for us! I was wondering if you could weigh your legal opinion in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#You_are_legally_responsible_for_your_edits" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">over here</a>: there's a discussion regarding blanked pages and the legal responsibility of reverting editors to make sure that the article that they're reverting the blanking to is free of libel. As none of us are lawyers, some clarification could be helpful if you have a free minute to put your thoughts down (the idea of being held liable for reverting vandalism is something that has some ramifications for us, so I know that I at least would love some "official" guidance on the issue). Thanks very much for your time, <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoutwood_5c9e.html" title="User:Snoutwood">Snoutwood</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnoutwood_5ab6.html" title="User talk:Snoutwood">(talk)</a> 19:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your participation would be appreciated. There are statements to the effect that editors and admins who revert articles to versions that may contain unknown libelous content could be held responsible for that content as if they were the original author of it. That standard would have a chilling effect on the patrollers who revert obvious vandalism, and have the paradoxial effect of leaving more defamatory content in articles. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 04:32, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brad.</p>
<p>I am relatively new to Wikipedia, but I have already, through my new page and recent edits patrolling, become quite familiar with the guidelines.</p>
<p>I have recently started reminding fellow new page patrollers to <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">go easy on the newcomers</a> by also placing the speedy deletion template on the user's talk page. However, the <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/010610.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-September/010610.html" rel="nofollow">shoot on sight edict</a> is being used as an excuse to be rude to the newcomers.</p>
<p>May I request, if it has not already been done, that the policy guidelines are updated to reflect the sentiments expressed in the edict? If they have been updated, would you be able to point me in the right direction, as I have searched unsuccessfully?</p>
<p>May I also suggest that if Wikipedians were less aggressive and more welcoming that the number of phone calls from "self-aggrandizing authors screaming bloody murder" would be reduced.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m writting this message to you, and to <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">User:Mindspillage</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">User:Joy</a>, because I still don’t have a full knowledge of how to proceed about Wikipedia administration/mediation/arbitration.</p>
<p>Well, I see there’s a kind of probelm regarding the creation (by myself on november 8) of the article <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_NATO_bombing_of_Serbia_a501.html" title="1999 NATO bombing of Serbia">1999 NATO bombing of Serbia</a>, which I’ve redirected to <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bombing_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_15e0.html" title="NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. There’s an edit war going: pro-Serbian users are trying to delete my redirect, and even when people (including myself) manifested <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_6c7f.html#1999_NATO_bombing_of_Serbia_.E2.86.92_NATO_bombing_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion">against the deletion</a>, the user which requested the deletion made the request again.</p>
<p>Please if you can help me to solve this question.</p>
<p>PS: Above all these problems, I don’t know about you, but I think sometimes there’s a kind of “Serbian Volunteer Guard <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">Cabal</a>” of users here in Wikipedia that try to make Wikipedian articles related to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_Wars_5a69.html" title="Yugoslav Wars">Yugoslav Wars</a> appear clearly pro-<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a>/pro-<a href="../../../m/i/l/Milosevic.html" title="Milosevic">Milosevic</a> POV, making these articles to show an interpretation of facts very different from most of the press and academic sources around the world. A similar thing is happening now on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnistria.html" title="Transnistria">Transnistria</a> article, that show a clear pro-Transnistrian government POV, with a long war of arguments going on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransnistria_bbdf.html" title="Talk:Transnistria">discussion page</a> of the article.

Should checkuser be used to identify and block vandals that perform specific eggregious acts. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>posting user's name address phone number and children names (in the edit summary as well)</li>
<li>death threats</li>
<li>threatening lawsuits against Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>My view is that we should in some cases - i.e. we shouldn't have to identify potential socks if there are multiple instances of any of the above. I know a "I'm going to kill you" said in haste (or as an excited utterance) is probably not a true threat. But wikistalking followed by a threat to kill - we should treat as a potential threat and deal with the user more harshly. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 20:37, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Death threats are legally considered assault (not to be confused with battery), which could be a felony in some jurisdictions. List them in the IP check section and ask for the results to be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Failure to do this could be considered misprision of felony.

<p>Hi there Brad, ive just found something on a different site i think is a bit odd, but im wondering if wiki admins know about it. I was bored, and did a yahoo search for squadnleedah, which as far as i can make up is fairly unique. A couple of the usual hits came up, but then i saw a strange one coming up under oursportcentral.com, a site i have never had anything to do with let alone signed up for. What it showed was a direct copy of the page Category:User ubx-3 . I had a play and it seems either they have a complete copy of the wikipedia on their site, or are directly linking their pages with yours, because they have a fully working wikipedia on their site. Is this normal? I saw your name on the admins list, and with the extra bit on your name there i figured you might be the best to ask&#160;:) Cheers, Chris <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquadnleedah_fa3e.html" title="User:Squadnleedah">Squad'nLeedah</a> 20:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you find it to be irrelevant or at best probably less than useful, please remove it from the list. If you think that it has any potential, but requires rephrasing, I would be very grateful if you could fix the phrasing.

How does a discussion about the posting of link (a link originally removed by Ford MF, but reinstated as per his understanding of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Wikipedia%7EPornography_8e40.html" title="Wikipedia:Pornography">Wikipedia:Pornography</a>) result in an indefinate block? Even if the link bears removal per <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>, blocking a user for good faith &amp; NPOV contributions on a controversial subject is hardly appropriate. Well, I suppose he can always appeal his block by writing to...I guess that would be you. I guess my point is simply that rewarding a user with close to a thousand edits who has tried to follow WP policy while keeping a NPOV (along side being flamed in non-Wikipedia context) with a block does not seem to me to be the best course of action. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMordicai_e43a.html" title="User:Mordicai">mordicai.</a> 21:26, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Two things - I spoke with someone by telephone today who is deeply concerned that the effect of this posting will be (a) Iran banning Wikipedia outright (b) the jeopardy of the life of the woman involved. This person has already been in contact with Jimbo, who I have asked to do what he thinks is right. I responded to a real-life threatening situation and popped Ford MF pending further investigation. This doesn't need to be decided until Jimbo takes a look at what happened and weighs in. Further, Ford MF's swooning over Jimmy commenting on his "work", plus his own pride in making an "international incident" on his blog <a href="http://fordmadoxfraud.livejournal.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://fordmadoxfraud.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> make me uninterested in encouraging him to contribute to this article. I am at pains to say, what is the point here? Having a link, so the rest of the non-Iranian world can see video, but thereby condemning a woman in Iran to death? Count me in the group that would first seek to do no harm, *then* address the broad and controversial thicket of issues around the topic as a whole. People in jeopardy for their lives is serious indeed. I don't see that the benefit outweighs the risk at all.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradPatrick_8f2f.html" title="User:BradPatrick">Brad Patrick</a> 21:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the quick reply, Brad. Firstly, as to (a) on Iranian Wikipedia banning. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship_in_Iran_9e7e.html" title="Censorship in Iran">Censorship in Iran</a> (an article on FMF's created/heavily contributed list, by the way) seems to state that Iran has <i>already</i> banned Wikipedia. As to (b), Reuters &amp; the The Guardian UK have both reported on the story. While the woman is in danger of 99 lashes, I don't think a media black-out of the event is likely to serve her interests best. As to Ford's swooning over Jimbo's edit, I hardly think that the recognition of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_celebrities_5f98.html" title="Category:Internet celebrities">internet celebrity</a> or mention of the event in his diary are cause for your disdain. What you interpret as pride for making an international incident seems more to me like good-natured chagrin. His Livejournal was <a href="http://fordmadoxfraud.livejournal.com/234085.html?view=1079397" class="external text" title="http://fordmadoxfraud.livejournal.com/234085.html?view=1079397" rel="nofollow">flamed</a> on a number of occasions for his work on the article, from a number of different IPs in seperate nations. It is a misrepresentation of his contribution to focus on the link to the video, especially since he did not add it originally, &amp; in fact removed it initially until reverting his removal as per his understanding of Wikipedia's pornography policies. Not only that, he created a forum on the talk page to discuss the validity of the link. Considering that most of the other content on the page is his, a ban for a link, especially one already removed by another editor (in this case, Jimbo) seems like a false move. The argument about whether the link is fit content is superfluous to the discussion of FMF's block. Making a judgement on an editor due to the controversial nature of a subject would seem to encourage putting blinders on, rather than careful dealing with the subject. Whether or not the link is fitting, Ford MF consulted policy &amp; edited accordingly. Punishing him because Iran has capital punishment for adultery is, I believe, a mis-step, as would ignoring the subject of the "sex-tape incident." An act more in-line with care &amp; caution on the subject would be to lock the article (already semi-protected, on FMF's suggestion), rather than to ban a user who's edit history has no evidence of bad faith. I understand that you have passed the authority on to Jimbo, but I wanted to make my point known. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMordicai_e43a.html" title="User:Mordicai">mordicai.</a> 22:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Brad! I have been contributing extensively to wikipedia for some time now and feel I have come up with somethin that could potentially be huge that would be of enormous benefit to the world.</p>
<p>I propose a new major sister project of wikipedia WikiLanguages or WikiLinguistics which specializes in the teaching of all languages. I have looked over the internet and have found some sites which do have several of the major languages giving knowledge of learning them but this wuould be huge and would provide all the information for learning languages such as most of the 250 languages that already have wikipedias. Learning a language is a major infomration source but wikipedia does not have this in detail. I beleive this wikipedia sister project would be developed into an extremwely valuable resoruce not only for achieving knowledge of major languages but also other world languages which are not always readily available to learn.</p>
<p><br />
If it is created I would hope that say five years down the line we should have the ultimate language learning resource in the world. If everybody contributes from their respective countris and knowledge of their languages we could see a resource which could allow you to potentially become fluent in hundreds of languages. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:08, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I strongly beleive this is what providing free easily accessible information is what wikipedia is all about and think this is an extrmely valuable component missing from the Wikipedia Foundation. E.g if I wanted to learn <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian.html" title="Norwegian">Norwegian</a> or <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech.html" title="Czech">Czech</a> or FInnish at the highest possible level or whatever this resource would be there to provide this knowledge. WikiLanguages would be divided into 250 or whatever massive sub projects e.g WikiFrench WikiSpanish WikiNorwegian WikiFinnish WikiDutch WIkiItalian WIkiPortuguese WIkiThai WikiJapanese etc etc dedicated to providing an English encylopedia of languages<a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>Imagine if this major sister project could incorporate translation technology - imagine the immese benefit for learning but also for tranlsation from foreign wikipedias. This would be a highly useful tool for Wikipedia itself. The site could also incorpate audio technology so the resoruce would not only provide you with the detail to reading and writing a language fluently but provide you with the knoe how to pronouncre and speak a language well. <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnst_Stavro_Blofeld_5935.html" title="User:Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> 12:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please let me know if you think this is a good idea. I would like to organize a proposal petition with the top wikipedia foundation administrators to decide to start this. WikiLanguages would also provide specializes knowledge of localized dialects or whatever -the ultimate global language resource.</p>

<p>I am a representative of 'Bondpedia' (<a href="http://bondpedia.net" class="external text" title="http://bondpedia.net" rel="nofollow">Bondpedia - James Bond encyclopedia</a>). A wiki-based James Bond encyclopedia and we need to advertise. I was thinking, can I advertise on Wikipedia's 'James Bond' article where we will atract most of the good bond fans that we need? please</p>
