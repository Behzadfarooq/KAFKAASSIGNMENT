	    <p><b>Camp Poyntelle-Lewis Village</b> is a pair of resident summer camps in Poyntelle, Pennsylvania, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Located in Wayne County, PA â€“ it is less than 150 miles from New York City. The camp features a 69 acre private lake that separates the camp into two sections; Poyntelle for boys and girls entering second grade through seventh grade, and Lewis Village for teens entering eighth grade through eleventh grade. Camp Poyntelle Lewis Village has been enriching the lives of campers for over 55 years. It is a second-home to many, some of whom has grown from the youngest campers in camp to counselors, and then supervisors, and division heads. The duration of the summer is 7 weeks, from the beginning of July until around the end of August. The first 3 1/2 weeks of camp is known as 1st session, with the final 3 1/2 weeks of camp known as 2nd session.</p>
<p>The staff at Camp Poyntelle-Lewis Village consist of a mix of people from inside the United States and out. Those from outside the United States come from as far as England, Australia, Scotland, Israel, and South America, as well as a mix of young adults in their early twenties from different parts of the U.S. The youngest staff members are referred to as CA's (counselor assistants), and mostly consist of those who were former campers who grew up in camp, and are now eligible to become staff. Over 50% of our staff returns to camp year after year. In addition to our dedicated counselors, we have a full medical staff with a doctor and nurses. With a staff to camper ratio of 1:3 at Poyntelle and 1:4 at Lewis Village, campers get a great deal of individual attention.</p>

<p><b>Break-Out:</b> Break-out is the term used for the event that signifies the beginning of Haruach, and Maccabiah (Camp Poyntelle-Lewis Village's color wars). Break-out is completely unexpected, and can occur at anytime in the days leading up to when Haruach or Maccabiah is supposed to begin. Break-out introduces both the team names, and team captains to the camp for the first time, and is the preliminary beginning of color war, prior to the swearing-in ceremony. Past breakouts have included firetrucks interupting an evening activity, and captains riding in on a motorboat during an all-camp free swim. It is one of the most exciting moments of the summer.</p>
<p><b>Swearing-In Ceremony:</b> Following break-out for Haruach and Maccabiah, each respective side of camp gathers by the campfire pit parallel to the waterfront for a ceremony that officially signifies the beginning of the color war games. The captains each hold a lit torch, and repeat back word-for-word, an oath given by the head(s) of the color war games. The oath mentions utilizing good judgement, sportsmanship, and to be respectful during the duration of Haruach/Maccabiah. The captains of each team then simultaneously light the firepit with their torches, and the games begin. This is immediately followed by the first opportunity for a team to gain points, as each team is given a few minutes to quickly devise a cheer to present for the judges on the spot.</p>
<p><b>Haruach:</b> Every summer during the last week of the 1st session of camp, we have our annual Haruach games. This is a color war in which the camp (each side separately) are split up into 4 teams, each with a Jewish theme as it's name, and compete in 3 days of activities, athletics, and various competitions. On the last night of Haruach is banquet, where each side of camp is given the opportunity to dress up in their finest, and attend a dinner featuring a completely "spruced up" menu, and a beautifully decorated dining hall. Following the banquet is sing, in which all 4 teams gather for the culmination of Haruach. Each team presents two songs, the first is a CHEER. Set to the tune of a loud, uplifting, and intense song, the CHEER allows the team to display it's competitive side while mixing in messages about "winning the competion" along with their respective Jewish theme. The second song that is presented is the COMEDY SONG. The COMEDY SONG can be set to the tune of anything, as long as it results in a witty, humorous song that features playful jabs at the camp's supervisors, administration, and inside jokes that have occurred so far that summer. Props, and costumes are a favorite during the presentation of the COMEDY SONG. The Haruach Sing also features the presentation of the shield, where each team illustrates their theme on a wooden shield, drawn by the campers themsleves, and then get to present it in front of their side of camp, along with a speech on the symbolism, and qualities displayed on their shield. Each shield features the team name, both the year, and Jewish year, and the captain names. Their is also an "ONEG" presentation, where each team has a few of their campers present a skit (previously written) that ties in the theme of their team name. Teams use costumes, props, and signs for their ONEG, and most importantly try to incorporate the meaning, and idea of their team name. On the Poyntelle side, their are 2 captains per team, both counselors selected prior to the start of Haruach by the head of the "games." Their is one male captain, and one female captain. On the Lewis Village side, the oldest campers (LITS-Leaders In Training) are split up four ways, and are given the opportunity to display their leadership by leading the camp for 3 days. It is a tradition that is looked forward to as you go through the ranks as a camper, to one day be an LIT, and a captain for Haruach. Haruach also features the Apache Relay (an all-camp relay race, where each camper on the team gets to participate in one event), College Bowl (a trivia contest), and Mission Impossibles (occuring after lunch, these mission impossibles are for team counselors on Poyntelle, and captains in Lewis Village. It consists of a wacky challenge ranging from watermelon eating competition, to a Jenga contest).</p>
<p><b>Maccabiah:</b> At the end of each summer we have our annual Maccabiah games. This occurs during the last four days of camp, as each side is split up into 2 teams, blue and white. For four days each team competes in activities, athletics, and various competitions, ultimately leading up to the final evening, which is once again, banquet and sing. This is a larger event then Haruach because the entire side of camp is split in half, their are more campers on each side, and the competitiveness is at it's highest, as it is the final all-camp event of the summer. The Poyntelle side features 3 captains per team. Their are 3 female captains, and 3 male captains (all counselors), and they are split by 2 females and 1 male on one team, and 2 males, and 1 female on the other team. This was a new change originating from Summer 2000, when the original structure of 1 male, and 1 female captain per team was changed, to make it easier on the captains. Summer 2003 featured the one and only time their was a change from the 2, and 3 captain structure. That summer, their were 4 captains per team, 2 males, and 2 females per team. Maccabiah features a very important camp tradition known as rope burn. Rope burn is when the oldest campers on each side of camp, who have attended camp the longest (B7/B8, G7/G8 Poyntelle &amp; LITS on Lewis Village) assemble at the waterfront, and the goal is to build a fire using wood, that will reach a rope suspended several feet from the ground. It is an extremely sentimental event, as campers who have been in camp for years look forward to one day having the opportunity to participate in rope burn. In Lewis Village, it is seen as the final step in going from camper to counselor, and is a very emotional event. On each side of camp, the tradition of running into the shallow section of the lake occurs as soon as each respective team breaks their rope. Both teams stay in the water, and celebrate as one, when both ropes are ultimately broken. Maccabiah also once again features an Apache Relay, College Bowl, and Mission Impossibles. A new Mission Impossible tradition that originated on the Poyntelle side in 2003 is chocolate pudding wrestling. On the 3rd day of Maccabiah, following lunch, a small ring is constructed on the main soccer field, and their are several counselor matchups arranged by each team. It is an event enjoyed by both campers, and staff, and is one of the highlights of Maccabiah. The structure of Maccabiah sing is slightly different then that of Haruach sing. On Poyntelle side, each team presents 3 songs. Their is the CHEER, and COMEDY SONG, as also featured in Haruach, but there is also an ALMA MATER. An ALMA MATER is set to the tune of a low-key, sad, quiet song, and words are written that describe the love we have for camp, and how important it is in our lives. Lewis Village does not present a comedy song during Maccabiah. Both sides do present ONEGS, and shields, however Lewis Village also presents a banner. The banner is a large square piece of cloth, mounted on a wooden frame, and features the team name, captains, year and Jewish year, and the display of the team's name, and theme. Lewis Village's shields and banners can be seen in the Lewis Village dining hall, while Poyntelle's shields and banners can be seen in the Poyntelle dining hall &amp; Rec Hall. Lewis Village also presents a dedication shield during sing. The dedication shield is meant to honor a person who has had a tremendous impact on camp, and who has affected camp in a large way during their time in camp. This used to be only a tradition in Lewis Village, but was adopted by Poyntelle to honor our Assistant Director Yochi Paltin in 2001. The receprients of the dedication shields from 2000 on can be found below. Following the performance of the ALMA MATER, their is a lot of emotion that fills the room, as friends hug friends from opposing teams, as the summer has started to officially come to a close. Scores are announced, the winning team is presented, and Maccabiah is over.</p>
<p><b>Burn-Out:</b> On the final night of camp, each side of camp gathers at the waterfront. There, in front of the lake the camp sits as each supervisor gets up, and makes their end-of-the-summer speech, as well as any counselor who has something to say. Following speeches, the returning staff gather in a semi-circle along the beach of the waterfront, and shout "Kiefa", and following the echo in the trees, the campers reply "Hey", this goes on for 3 durations, before one final "Kiefa" and a three-chant "hey, hey, hey." It is a tradition that has gone on for many years on both sides of camp. Following "Kiefa" the word "Shalom" is spelled out on a small fence on the beach, standing upright, and we light it to symbolize the end of the summer, as we watch "Shalom" burnout.</p>
