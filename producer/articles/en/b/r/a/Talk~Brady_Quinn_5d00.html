<p>"Overall, as a starter, Brady is 29-17 (.630) against all opponents and 13-15 (.460) against teams that finished the year with non-losing records."</p>
<p>This stat is not kept for any other players; and it is not kept officially anywhere. The article could go on forever slicing and dicing records to make whatever particular point someone wants to make. It doesn't belong here as it is not an encyclopedic piece of informaiton. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Red375 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Red375_12cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Red375">contribs</a>) 17:52, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>This was probably a cumbersome attept to point out that Brady hasn't had great success in "big games". It's a legitimate point, as this page reads more like a promotional flyer than an objective encyclopedia entry. I've supplied a more nuanced qualification, as below:</p>
<p>While Brady is 29-17 (.630) overall as a starter, he has evoked comparisons to Peyton Manning [1] due to his lack of success in "big games"[2].</p>

<dd>Bowl games is simply an undefined statistic--needs a section if to be of value. Would you care to write a section which summarizes the who, when, where and maybe the why of these Bowl loses? That is what is needed to make this worthwhile. (For example, the 41-14 drubbing by LSU in the Sugarbowl was the same punishment that The Ohio State suffered last night from FL.) The way it was, there weren't even any links which could be followed to find out more information--I always feel that it is important to give them a little teaser and a link for more information.

<p>I don't know if this section should be included at all, but I'll fix it up anyway. All of Notre Dame's rivals should be there as stated in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_rivalries_ea2a.html" title="Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries">this article</a>, also, Brady only played a few series against Michigan and Michigan State his freshman year as shown <a href="http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091303aaa.html" class="external text" title="http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091303aaa.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/092003aaa.html" class="external text" title="http://und.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/092003aaa.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so those games shouldn't be counted.

<p>I cleaned up the article a little bit to make it at least make sense and have some semblence of order.

<p>I put one earlier but someone put it was from a "fantasy football" site which is completely untrue. People editing this aren't doing a great job at it, aside from the people putting blatant nonsense. It is common knowledge by anyone who watches ESPN that he wants to play for the Browns. It is also common knowledge that his draft status IS affected by his Sugar Bowl performace but someone feels the need to delete that every time I put it. I even had a source to it that time and it was considered a "spam link", yet it was ESPN.com....Either someone properly edit it, or leave it be. Don't delete things for the sake of deleting.</p>

<p>I cleaned up the language AGAIN... I don't know what's going on here, but it sounds like 10 year olds are adding the info. The information itself is good - but when you're writing articles for a work of an informational database, you have to have some more technical writing.</p>
<p>Saying things like "had a pretty good season" is pretty poor writing. If you're going to add things to the article, please make an effort to be more proficient.<a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGambitMG_03dc.html" title="User:GambitMG">GambitMG</a></p>
<p><br />
Someone put "excellent" season before that, which would not be true at all seeing his recent performance at the Sugar Bowl. Recent polls on ESPN also show he is trailing both JaMarcus Russell and Troy Smith on the question of "Who would you rather draft?". Besides, a statistically impressive season is different from a successful one. What is the point of putting that? He can have great statistics but floundering in the big game is what people remember. I'm a Philadelphia Eagles fan. Trust me. Statistically impressive means nothing. --69.139.66.80 05:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I actually meant that in terms of technical writing "pretty good" is not an effective way of expressing your point. That is actually more "conversational" speech. In other words, if you and I were sitting at a bar and I asked you how Brady Quinn's season went, you'd probably say, "well, he had a pretty good season". But in terms of a dictionary or encyclopedia entry, we're looking for something a bit more professional, technical and descriptive, which is why I changed it to "statistically impressive". It has no bearing on his draft stock or anything of that nature, I'm talking about the context you are using language in. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGambitMG_03dc.html" title="User:GambitMG">GambitMG</a></p>

<p>There has been no decision made as to the next Notre Dame QB yet since the season just ended, so why is listed that Clausen is the next QB in the stat box at the bottom? There is no proof stating he will start. He has 2 college freshman QB's ahead of him (Demetrius Jones and Zach Frazer), and Clausen is still in high school yet. I would hardly say he is a shoe-in for the job just yet.</p>

<p>I just cleaned up the first part of the article, because of the dregs left over from preveious edit swaps. Too much redundancy existed. I recommend removal of the Personal Information section unless it is significantly enhanced. Currently it has only two pieces of information and they exist in other areas of the article (Info Box) , etc.</p>

<p>We've had a lot of edit-counter edit in this article regarding the negative side of Quinn's records in rivalry games and bowl games. I would like to propose that we create a balanced paragraph which offers both sides of his ND record without concentrating on the pros or the cons. For example, the team's performance in rivalry and bowl games, plus the marked improvement in performance during 2006. (Also, Quinn's ND records broken.)</p>
<p>Overall, this article needs more expansion so that neither positive nor negative records have such a weight.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it here if there is interest.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I listed that he will be drafted in round 1 in his infobox. This isn't debatable and please don't change it. It's an absolute lock that he'll go in the first round.
