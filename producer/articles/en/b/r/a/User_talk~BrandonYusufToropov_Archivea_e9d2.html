<p>Hi, Fred Bauder has drafted a finding of fact describing the focus of the dispute in the Zephram Stark arbitration case, and has added it to the proposed-decision page at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zephram_Stark_Proposed_decision_e71d.html#Focus_of_dispute" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zephram Stark/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Zephram_Stark/Proposed_decision#Focus_of_dispute</a>, where it is currently being voted on. It says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The focus of this dispute is the article <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> which according to Zephram Stark deteriorated due to the aggressive editing and other actions of Jayjg and SlimVirgin. He has waged a campaign to restore what he considers an adequate article, free of the complex ambiguities introduced by his opponents, see <a href="../../../t/e/r/Talk%7ETerrorism_Archive_6_f109.html#NPOV_solutions" title="Talk:Terrorism/Archive 6">Talk:Terrorism/Archive_6#NPOV_solutions</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Zephram_Stark_Evidence_e915.html#ZS.27s_changes_to_Terrorism" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Zephram Stark/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Zephram_Stark/Evidence#ZS.27s_changes_to_Terrorism</a>."</dd>

<p>I feel this is not an accurate way to summarize the dispute. Would you mind taking a look, please, and perhaps commenting on it?

<p>Was Eid yesterday or today? Hope you had/have a nice one. As to the other matter -- I can't keep my temper. It feels to me like a grotesque waste of time and energy to <i>negotiate</i> with the mentally deficient and psychologically impaired. I admit to my defect.

<dd>It would next to useless to write a list, I should think, because the matters under dispute affect the whole of early Islamic history. If a certain set of articles are set aside as "not to be touched without consensus", then that leaves existing or potential biographical articles for hundreds of people out of the reckoning, not to mention all the doctrinal and legal matters, or events, that could be disputed. If the promise were not to edit anything, or create any new articles or templates, without consulting you first, I'd be thrilled. But I don't think that this is what you're being offered. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:57, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brandon, I think I've figured it out. Striver and Zereshk enjoy conflict, enjoy writing something outrageous (poking me) and seeing how I will react. See the talk page on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Shi%27a-Sunni_relations_0fee.html" title="Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations">Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations</a>. I always respond, due to my dogged insistence on trying to make Wikipedia "good" (by my standards). I have to let go of that. I just will not deal with them for a while, and see what happens. It's up to the rest of you to deal with Shi'a bias and Striver's spelling and grammar. I need to step back. I'll see how it goes if I just work on other articles for a while. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Brandon. I've looked at the history, and it's very complicated, so I can't tell right off exactly what is happening. You can report these things on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>, listing the specific edits you think are reverts. Once you're done, if you let me know (and I'm on Wikipedia), I'll take a look, and block if it's accurate. I hope that helps.

<p>Thanks! I really appreciate to get some acknowledgment for my efforts!</p>
<p>As things are, we happen to have different stance on some very emotional issues, and this is causing some stress between us, and will unavoidably continue to do so in the future. I am determined to show that some un-pleasant facts regarding the first period of Islam to be clearly presented, but the Sunni ideology has the stance of forget and forgive, in contrary to the Shia that makes efforts to remember them.</p>
<p>BUT! Aside from that, we are both:</p>

<li>Belivers in Tawheed</li>
<li>Belivers in prophethood</li>
<li>Belivers in the Quran</li>
<li>Belivers in justice</li>
<li>Humans</li>
</ul>
<p>So, no matter what, you will continue to be my brother in Islam and humanity, and i thank you for your proof of good faith, the Barnstar. It will help me to remember to keep differences in perspective.</p>
<p>Peace, brother!</p>

<p>Brandon, you'll need to get consensus to redirect it or delete it.

<dd>Well, the general consensus is to wait for a considerable period of time before relisting on AfD. This might be 4-6 months. I'm only saying this as a general rule of thumb. In the meantime, have you considered putting in material to refute the argument? Trust me, I know what it's like to have an unsavory article you'd like to get rid of. My own personal Waterloo was <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_women.html" title="Christian views of women">Christian views of women</a>, which was <i>terrible</i> when I saw it. At the time of listing on VfD (before transclusions) it survived and I never thought it would be any good. Now I see differently. Articles can in fact change for the better, or prove to be a thorn in the side of the original author who held a particular position! Why don't you try to sort out the article? Just a friendly suggestion. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:13, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That example hardly works. We have <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>. The article Islamfascism is quite a long one, seems to discuss the topic in depth. As a Christian, I've been called worse that an Islamofascist - I would not object to some of the terms being listed for an article here. I'd just update it. Please don't tell me I'm complicit, you know that I'm no Islam-basher (though I <i>strongly</i> disagree with it), as I'm sure you saw when we both fought off Pename on <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a>.

<dd>Well, personally I'd take the Judeofascim one to AfD, and not the Islamofascism one. Why? Because the Islamofascism one is being used by idiots quite often, whereas the Jewish epiteth is almost never used. As it currently stands, the Islamofascism article shows the term to be pretty stupid. If someone looks it up on Google, they'll hit our article and come to the same conclusion: the author is a fool. That can only help destroy that authors credibility. I would have thought you'd be positively <i>happy</i> that such stupidity is being refuted!

<p>I dont think we are going to get rid of it after Mr Bush have said it. I belive there there is a words for that, auxio...something, when you combine two opposites in one word, like "coldwarm". I guess the best is to keep away all nonsense "See also" links like "Muslims hates jews" and non-sense like that. We also can help out with links like "Islamic democracy" and such.</p>
<p>We could make some article that sumarized how the USA foreign realtions have butchered the middle east, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ajax_0f22.html" title="Operation Ajax">Operation Ajax</a>, helping Saddam to power in the same year as the Islamic revolution, pumping him with weapons against Iran, being allied to Saudi Arabia, even tough most of the 19 alledged hijackers where from there, how they tried to blame the anthrax on Iraq, even if it came from their own labs, the propaganda that made Americans belive it <i>did</i> come from Iraq, how ... never mind.</p>

<p>Brandon, it seems to me that recently the Muslim and Jewish editors (or those perceived to be) have been getting along well, better than I remember it when I first started editing. The resurrection of Judeofascism is going to affect that. You know that this isn't right, and that you won't find any decent sources for it. I understand that you're trying to draw a parallel, but it isn't a fair one. There are too many journalists who have used the term Islamofascism, and now President Bush. The only people you'll find using Judeofascism are likely to be extremist websites that will never be acceptable sources for WP, so all that's going to happen is a hornet's nest of trouble will be stirred up to no avail. Please reconsider what you're doing. There's nothing to stop you putting Islamofascism up again for VfD, or trying to persuade other editors to push for a redirect, but you weaken your own case by engaging in a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, and it's not exactly encyclopedic, yet I know that's what you normally strive to be. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've misunderstood AfD. There is no such thing as a vote to redirect. If you vote that, you're voting to keep. AfD controls whether a <b>title</b> exists. It doesn't control content.

<dd>Okay, but be careful, because this is what happened before. You and Mel saw the number of redirect comments and misunderstood them. AfD decides whether to keep a title. After that, the normal editing process resumes, because otherwise you'd have AfD controlling content, and nothing is allowed to control content, except our editorial policies. If the title is kept and the editors at that time want to redirect it, it's a redirect. If two weeks later, another bunch of editors wants an article, it becomes an article. So long as people edit within the policies, they can do whatever they want at any time on any page, and prior consensus counts for nothing. The only way to get rid of this is to vote to delete it at AfD. The only way to turn it into a redirect is to persuade the editors on the page, not at AfD, to redirect it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:38, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bro, i feel for you on this one. We both know that "islamofacist" is nonsense, its as stupid as saying "icehot water". But the problem is that Bush and the other warmongering bigot are using it as war time propaganda to attract other bigots... I belive the best way isnt to try to pretend the word dosnt exist, rather, to explain why the word is nonsense... Dont you agree?</p>

<p>Umm, I'm slightly torn about this issue. I think "Islamofascism" is more notable than <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Polytechnic_Institute_dcd5.html" title="Baltimore Polytechnic Institute">Baltimore Polytechnic Institute</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_%28song%29.html" title="Flash (song)">Flash (song)</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomsdale%2C_Missouri_170f.html" title="Bloomsdale, Missouri">Bloomsdale, Missouri</a>. People know the term (Bush used it in a speech in Korea) and therefore I can't say when we include so many things that Islamofascism in no way deserves its own page. Now, I think in many ways it is a POV fork and is just another way to push an agenda... but, I'm not sure that should dictate how I vote. I do think it needs to be NPOV. I searched the scholarly journals and didn't find it. When I searched Expanded Academic ASAP+ the term shows up in <i>Commentary</i> and the <i>National Review</i>... so, we also know what type of person uses the term. So, we need to NPOV it... but, I'm not sure it doesn't deserve an article. Let's just make sure it doesn't get used for unencyclopedic purposes. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 00:07, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bigotry, Hate speech, and Systemic bias are all things that aren't too good. However, being that Islamofascism is a word that is widely used today, my position on this article is that it should be kept and we should discuss exactly <i>who</i> uses the term, <i>why</i> they use the term and <i>when</i> the term is used.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you know I don't support the use of such a term. However, imagine you are an ordinary Australian who knows nothing about Islam and all of a sudden you are confronted with such a term in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. You think to yourself, "I wonder what this is all about?". The average Australian would normally go to Google and do a search on it.</p>
<p>What do you want them to find? A conservative blogger who pushes their illegitimate POV in a convincing way (and doesn't point out the counter argument for why it isn't a valid term), or the piece on Wikipedia that details, in a neutral fashion, all sides of the argument?</p>

<p>You know, I know your reasoning behind wanting to redirect the page. Really I do. I just disagre with that reasoning, because I feel that it's a significant enough article to merit it's own article.</p>
<p>Anyway, to respond:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have any problem with people being able to track down a good, solid, neutral discussion of this term.
<ul>
<li>I know this!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I fail to see why that means it merits an article of its own.
<ul>
<li>I have answered this already, but I feel that it is too long to include in an umbrella article, and it will unbalance the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Chip Berlet has pointed out, there are hundreds of instances in other encyclopedias where subreferences point people to sections within articles.
<ul>
<li>Indeed. However, we are unique in many ways. We have <i>umbrella articles</i> which briefly summarise the main point of a topic, and they use {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} to point to a large article. It works quite well (I've used it on <a href="../../../m/d/a/MDAC_402c.html" title="MDAC">MDAC</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_2000.html" title="Windows 2000">Windows 2000</a>, both FAs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One good reason to point people to sections within larger articles is the stark factual inaccuracy of the heading the article would have to employ. There is no Islamist anywhere who promotes the actual political doctrine of fascism.
<ul>
<li>Indeed, I don't disagree with you. However we are detailing a neologism and how it is used. A title does not make us take a position. If that was the case, then I would leave the project because of the article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childlove_movement.html" title="Childlove movement">Childlove movement</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That means "fascist" in this case is serving the function of an insult quite consciously chosen for its ability to polarize and distract domestic political constituences.
<ul>
<li>I agree that this is the main reason for the term. This is the same with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_fascism.html" title="Christian fascism">Christian fascism</a>. This doesn't mean we can't document it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which brings me to another good reason to point people to sections within larger articles -- namely a certain moral responsibility among admins with functioning brains to prevent WP from becoming the #$%^&amp;*() Newspeak dictionary, which is clearly the intent here.
<ul>
<li>You are wrong. I am not here to censor anyone's content. I have no moral authority or responsibility to take a position on an article based on its content. If that were the case, I would have immediately killed off the following pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism_and_the_New_Testament_760e.html" title="Gnosticism and the New Testament">Gnosticism and the New Testament</a></li>

<dd>Do you see the slippery slope I would be going down?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Where is the stand-alone article for <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blow_job.html" title="Blow job">Blow job</a>?
<ul>
<li>If you can find enough information on this topic to warrant its own article, be my guest! Currently as it stands it's a slang term for <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a> and it's more than appropriate to incorporate it into this article. However, I'd encourage anyone who did proper research to a) redirect it to <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fellatio.html" title="Fellatio">fellatio</a>, and b) add their sourced material to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>...Zionazi
<ul>
<li>Same deal. If you can find enough information, go ahead and expand the article. Before it was redirected, the article stated:
<ul>
<li>Zionazi: A word invented by those who hate Jews and wish to express their ultimate hatred of them by insinuating a connection with those who perpetrated genocidal mass murder upon the Jews. Most often used by those who are themselves admirers of Hitler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As you know, that is original research. If voted for on AfD it would most likely be deleted. However, while we have no sources then it has been redirected. I encourage you to kill off the redirect and document the term correctly. Again, it's a particularly stupid term but if you can tell us <i>who</i> says it, <i>why</i> they say it, <i>when</i> they have said it, and <i>where</i> they have said it then this would be a valuable addition to our site. Of course, it would also be highly controversial. However, this is pretty much par for the course on Wikipedia.</dd>

<li>Do you seriously maintain that these terms are not notable, or that they are incapable of being adequately discussed within the articles to which they are redirected?
<ul>
<li>Nope.</li>
</ul>

<li>So what's the difference between those terms and Islamofascism? I'll tell you what the difference is. The necons want this term front and center. So they go knocking on doors until they find someone who actually thinks he's acting responsibly by bending over for them.

<p>Actually, if you take a look at what Jayjg actually posted, he is talking about IP addresses. I'm talking about individuals.</p>
<p>I point out for consideration that, pretty much the instant Chaosfeary was banned from editing <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a>, a new <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffyPinkKittensOfDoom_5b53.html" title="User:FluffyPinkKittensOfDoom">User:FluffyPinkKittensOfDoom</a> materialized. (As in no edits before Chaosfeary's 3RR violation.) Please work your way through the diff sequence that begins [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FluffyPinkKittensOfDoom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29547955" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FluffyPinkKittensOfDoom&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=29547955" rel="nofollow">here</a>] and you will see that Fluffy apparently has a long-running hatred of me.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is whether or not one can recognize someone who is using distinctive (and, I might add, distinctively obscene) language and a specific M.O. to sabotage articles here. I believe one can, and that the fact that someone is capable of switching IP addresses doesn't change that.</p>
<p>Jayjg, whose judgment I trust, also pointed out that the edit histories were "suggestive," [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SlimVirgin/archive22#Check_user_request" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SlimVirgin/archive22#Check_user_request" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] though why that assessment hasn't been as widely circulated is not clear to me.

<dd>Brandon, please stop accusing Chaosfeary of being Enviroknot, because it's causing deteriorating relations and a bad editing atmosphere. The technical evidence strongly suggests they're not the same person, and even without that, the writing style is markedly different. That's a separate issue, of course, as to whether Chaosfeary is editing in good faith. As for <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffyPinkKittensOfDoom_5b53.html" title="User:FluffyPinkKittensOfDoom">User:FluffyPinkKittensOfDoom</a>, it's almost certainly someone's sockpuppet, and is likely to be blocked again if it tries to edit. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:51, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that you're both making the behavior of the other worse, so there's a dynamic that needs to stop. One of you needs to take the high ground, in other words. I agree that FluffyPink is almost certainly a sockpuppet, and is likely to be blocked if any more edits are made. The difficulty with assuming this is a particular user is that the other "side" has also used at least one open proxy, and where that's happening nothing can be trusted: for example, someone may be setting Chaosfeary up here. This is why admins looking at this situation are inclined to hand out blocks to both sides or neither, and that may seem very unfair to the individuals involved who know they've done nothing wrong, but you see the difficulty. My strong advice to you is stop deleting posts from your talk page (because it's making you look bad), don't make any more public accusations of sock puppetry on article talk pages and that includes not using attack headers, don't respond to personal attacks or snide remarks, concentrate on content only, edit within the policies, and go back to being the old Brandon people knew and had come to respect. In the meantime, I and others will keep a close eye on the situation and whoever continues to cause trouble will be dealt with in due course. These things have a tendency to work themselves out. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:27, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say on the one hand that a non-sockpuppet would look quizzically or ignore sockpuppet allegations, but at the same time you request a check to show that you're not Yuber. No one who knows your editing believes you are Yuber, but I can request a check if you want. Similarly, no one looking at the writing of Chaosfeary and EnviroKainKabong would imagine them to be the same person (look at it closely: it really is very different for reasons I don't want to spell out in public), and we've done the technical check which supports the view that they're different people.</dd>

<p>Yuber and BrandonYusufToropov are obviously not the same person, and the technical evidence confirms that. While there is no technical evidence linking Chaosfeary to Enviroknot or the open proxies, and while it is extremely unlikely that Chaosfeary <i>is</i> Enviroknot, it is quite obvious that FluffyPinkKittensofDoom is a revert sock related to those open proxies, most likely of Chaosfeary. However, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that someone experienced in the use of open proxies is using those proxies as strawmen sockpuppets to implicate Chaosfeary. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:24, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"American terrorism" is documented and cited as a widely used term. There was no consensus to delete, rename, or redirect that article. It is against Wikipedia policy to make up neologisms like Terrorism by United States of America. It is also against Wikipedia policy to delete, rename, and redirect articles without consensus. I will not give my "cooperation" to people who are violating Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 15:14, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Carbonite seemed a bit high-handed in his support for <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaosfeary_735b.html" title="User:Chaosfeary">User:Chaosfeary</a>'s hijacking of the "American terrorism" article. Chaosfeary renamed the article to a term that he made up without any consensus to do so. Carbonite backed him up on it. The focus of the new article was changed. "American terrorism" was protected as a redirect. This had the same effect as deleting the article on "American terrorism." All of this happened immediately after Carbonite's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_terrorism&amp;oldid=29710269" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_terrorism&amp;oldid=29710269" rel="nofollow">AfD for the article</a> failed. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 05:15, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I backed Chaosfeary up only to the extent that I asked you not to use a cut-and-paste restore of the old article, because without proper attribution of edits, this would be a violation of the GFDL.

<dd>Still, the question that Jayjg posed to Brandon was "<i>...which specific ways Carbonite has abused his</i> <b>admin</b> <i>powers?</i>" The answer is that I didn't even <i>use</i> admin powers, and Brandon has apologized for making that accusation. As far as I'm concerned, the article is in infinitely better shape now and I'm really not interested in waging a war over its title. So, I'm bowing out of any further discussion or actions on the title of this article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:20, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brandon, I'm requesting that you cease framing the issue of the article's title as a dispute with me. As I've explained numerous times, I didn't move the article, protect the redirect or endorse the move. Other than presenting my opinion on the content of the article, my only other action was to ask Peter to stop using a cut-and-paste restore of the old article, as that would be a GFDL violation. I don't appreaciate that you've posted comments all over talk pages stating that you have issues with me or implying that I've done something improper. Please be advised that if this behavior continues, I will pursue a user conduct RfC. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 13:53, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uhh, <i>no</i>. That's not how moves work. Simply swapping redirs and copying the content across to a different page is called a <i>cut and paste move</i>, and it's a right royal pain in the neck, not to mention quite possibly a violation of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. Once an article exists at the title you want, you will need administrator help — not because some rogue bastard protected the page, but because only administrators can delete the page to allow the article to be moved back. Like I said, if y'all can agree on a page title, I will be happy to assist in a move for you myself, even back to the original <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a>.

<p>G'day Brandon,</p>
<p>I've changed the redirect at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a>, to avoid double redirects. That's Request #1.</p>
<p>For Request #2, I don't intend to take a stance on whether the page should be at the original <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_terrorism.html" title="American terrorism">American terrorism</a> or the new USA thing. To take up a position and then use these shiny extra buttons to defend it would be an abuse of my status as an admin, something I've pledged to do only on rare occasions. I can get involved, attempt to mediate, or something, if you'd like, but it would be inappropriate for me — or any of the other admins discussing the issue — to decide which title is more appropriate and use our powers to enforce that.</p>
<p>I <i>can</i> say that the latest round of moves is Very Very Silly, and not at all in the best interests of reaching some semblance of consensus. I won't be undoing them (see above), but I'd like to express my fondest hopes that all people involved in this dispute can refrain from being silly until after it's resolved.

The term "American terrorism" is very controversial and most people don't seem to understand that this country is rooted in terrorism. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> 19:47, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Duly noted. Article, though, is about contemporary use of the term. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BrandonYusufToropov</a> 19:49, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've clarified that the article is talking about the "contemporary usage" of the term. Do we need a "Historical American terrorism" article now? Because you can put a lot more than just the initial rebellion in there. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> 19:54, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How was George Washington a terrorist? He never fought battles in enemy territory, so far as I know...he led basically traditional military attacks on opposing militaries, did he not? Doesn't really matter anyway, of course, if he has been described as a terrorist then Wikipedia could cover the topic, but the contention that "By any definition of terrorist, George Washington was one" seems pretty far-fetched. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:07, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia editors report how a term is used. As far as I can tell, "American terrorism" has never been used to describe George Washington. In every country but the <i>United Kingdom/States</i>, terrorism refers to the creation of terror, either through "a system of coercive intimidation" or by trying "to awaken or spread a feeling of terror or alarm" (<a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">OED</a>). <b>American terrorism</b> is simply the creation of terror by the United States of America (through "a system of coercive intimidation" or by trying "to awaken or spread a feeling of terror or alarm" in its own people). Ask pretty much any person outside of the <i>United Kingdom/States</i>, and they'll explain something closely along those lines as the definition of "American terrorism." --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 16:55, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What is perhaps stressing us (and, I might add, much of the rest of the world), is that the term "terrorism," as a practical matter, currently falls into the "I know it when I see it" category for many American policymakers. And we are all apparently destined to live out the consequences of that fuzzy thinking.</li>
<li>Me, personally, I'm comfortable with something along the line of "targeting civilians to achieve a political aim," but let's be realistic: "terrorism" is slowly morphing into a meaning that reads roughly as follows: "Those who oppose us." This is dangerous in my view.</li>
<li>People can give Chomsky flack if they want, but at least he's focusing on comprehensible definitions.</li>
<li>I've heard the entire insurgency in Iraq described by supposedly reputable sources as "the terrorists," which suggests a) that the insurgency is more uniform in purpose and method than it actually is, b) that American <i>military</i> targets are somehow the victims of terrorism, a suggestion I can't quite fathom, and, perhaps most important, c) that the Pentagon and the neocons, who are quite fond of this "we're at war with the terrorists" formulation, are eager to conceal information, rather than examine it.</li>
<li>My whole problem with the so-called "war on terror" was summed up pretty well by Mr. Brzezinski, who pointed out in an interview not long ago that declaring a war on "terror" was a little like declaring a war on "blitzkrieg" or "marine invasion" or something: you're declaring a war on the <b>tactic,</b> not on any actual entity. Now why are we choosing to do that? I think it has something to do with the fact that unlike Brzezinski, the American public has a very emotionally loaded definition of "terrorist" that basically equates to "Those evil extremists who were behind 9/11." This understanding is being exploited, in my view, for short-term economic and strategic interests, in a way that is, frankly, suicidal for the western alliance.</li>
<li>I don't know what the hell George Washington has to do with any of this. He did say something about avoiding debilitating entanglements with foreign powers, though, and every time I read that advice, I think he's talking about Israel.<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> 14:40, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue I see here is that the article was originally at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>, and was apparently moved to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> without consensus. In addition, the title itself does not follow Wikipedia convention. I'm not aware of any other articles that have the word "(term)" appended, including (as has been pointed out on my page) many other terms people find offensive, such as <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Occupation_Government_e31a.html" title="Zionist Occupation Government">Zionist Occupation Government</a>. As there was no consensus to move it to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism_%28term%29.html" title="Islamofascism (term)">Islamofascism (term)</a> in the first place, it probably should be restored to its original name, but given that you find that option extremely unpalatable, I suggested a wider RfC. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:49, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kudos doubled. I just wish we could cut down the article even more. It spends paragraph after paragraph providing information that should be summarized in a sentence. These quotes are not relevant or important in any way. We don't spend this much time and detail on politician and president entries, I hardly see why Kadee Strickland needs an entry with that kind of probing information - reads like an FBI profile. It is seriously wrong to select it as an example for other actor articles. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 23:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BYT, im writing to you since i know that you are sincer.</p>
<p>We belong to different denominations of Islam, but i trust that it should not be a problem when we both are dedicated to sincer and truthfull. I feel unsecure now that im trying to contact a non-Shi'a in this issue, but things are never going to be better unless we try to comunicate. This is a plea to try to cooperate.</p>
<p>As is now, its me vs Zora. I dont like her methods, and for some reason, people seem to belive her method of not giving sources and acussing me with sweeping and non-specific allegations of being biased to be more credible than my methods of giving sources.</p>
<p>So, i want to try something new. I want to start a cooperation with you. I belive it is much easier to explain to you my stance and i belive that you could see the valid points that i make, something i perceive Zora incapable of. Are you intrested?</p>
<p>What talks against is that we have diamtrical different views of key issues. What talks for it is that we are in a medium that is not concerned with truth, rather with presenting verifiable sources.</p>
<p>I would like you to take a look at the Ali talk page as is, and give me your first impresion, so that we can continue to have a dialog about it, and eventualy reach to something we both can agree on.</p>
<p>I perceive Zora as a person that is incapable of seeing outside her "box", and also as a person that is not intrested with the views of other people. I have seen her take part of evidence for something, only to make a statement that totaly contradicts the evidence she just took part of. I perceive her as a person that is not sincer and impossible to cooperate with.</p>
<p>As is now, its Shi'a vs Sunni and Zora.</p>
<p>The Shi'a, me and Zereshk are active, while the Sunni, you and the other guys are hardly participiate anymore. Zereshk is batteling Zora in the Iranian artricles, while i go against her in the Islamic article.</p>
<p>So that leaves Me vs Zora in the Islamic articles. Problem is, that i get the feeling that you other guys feel that the only way to hold me in "check" is to give Zora support, no matter if she is acctualy right or wrong. Im tired of that. This is counterproductive, specialy since i perceive Zora as unreasonable.</p>
<p>I want get ridd of the "middle woman" and talk to you directly, This is my atempt to start a cooperation between us two. Are you interested? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 00:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I formatted the photos to the way they are and spent hours on it. (After I descovered how to add pics I deicded to perfect my skills by perfecting an article picture wise.) The pictures, and the way they are layed out is the main reason for this nomination. I think that this is as good as wikipedia picture work and layout gets. The only way we could fix red links are to write more articles. Those don't concern the article nominated, so I don't think they are relavent. Yet, if the links should not be there then it may be a valid point. The Canyon doesn't engage in activities. The people in the Canyon do. If you want you could change the section heading to something like "Tourist acivites" or "Visitor activities" but I think it's fine how it is. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 02:31, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps I was misled by the recent flurry of "keep" votes - you are right: it is running at about 2:1 to remove, give or take.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for finalising the vote, the article remains on FARC for two weeks, after which the nomination is archived. There is usually a clear consensus on FARC to keep or remove featured status (see the votes on <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">Peer review</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradox.html" title="Paradox">Paradox</a>, for example). In this case, there is clearly a substantial body of opinion to keep it as a featured article. Jeffrey O. Gustafson has been doing most of the archiving recently, so it may be worth asking his opinion on whether 2:1 amounts to consensus - a look at recent archived discussions may be illustrative. If you are asking for my view, I would not see 2:1 as consensus to remove, but I won't be taking the decision in this case. In any event, the point is worth raising on the FARC talk page. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 15:17, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello. Like ALoan has said, 2 to 1 is not consensus. However, featured content does not always work by consensus. For instance, Raul can deny featured status to an article if it has just one objection among a sea of supports, if he feels the objection is substantive. I use a similar methodology when I close FARCs. If there are reasoned, logical calls for removal, and any number of <i>keep</i> votes that do not actually respond to the objections raised, I am more likely to discount those votes. Indeed, this is a discussion, and not a strict vote, and we must hold our featured content to a higher standard. I will not comment on the progress of the current discussion and will withhold contemplating a decision until the two week limit has expired, except to say that due to the level of genuine objections to its status, Raul should reconsidder the Article of the Day for December 25th. --Jeffrey O.

<p>As you may know, I have had some discussions with Anonymous Editor about the differences of Islam and Christianity. Well, I would also like to point out some things on your page that I didn't quite agree with (please do NOT take this as a personal attack, as it is NOT one). First of all, you said that President Bush ordered a bomb dropped on an ally because of some journalists. I can't see why he would do this. Where did you hear this? Quite a few nespapers are biased, you know. I did agree to the fact that Holocaust denial is BS, and nobody should be engaging in it at all. It's just plain idiocy. Now to what I was saying earlier to AE, Christians believe that Jesus actually died on the cross, and was raised to life three days later. Muslims, on the other hand, believe that Allah just took Jesus from the cross before He even died. Of course that poses a great difference between these two religions. Of course, Allah doesn't have a Son, but Jehovah does. Muslims and Christians can't worship the same God, because they both worship Him in different ways. No offense, of course. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpionman_ba8b.html" title="User:Scorpionman">Scorpionman</a> 02:34, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another thing that you Anonymous editor pointed out is that Jesus said "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God the Father" (Luke 18:19). AE, what He was actually saying was "<i><b>Why</b></i> do you call me good? No one is good except for God the Father". This doesn't mean that He wasn't part of the Trinity. He was asking the rich young ruler why he was calling Him good, and that no one is good except for God, so that meant that Jesus is God, because He is good.

<p>I have officially proposed to split the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> article, with the two most in depth areas being moved to separate articles at Allegations of Jewish or Israeli complicity in 9/11 and Allegations of U.S. government complicity in 9/11. I feel this will help alleviate the problem of the main article being too large and allow these two distinct concepts to be discussed in depth separately. Further division may be in order in the future, but I feel this is an important first step.

<dd>I hear what you're saying, but there are so many definitions out there. We have to be careful it doesn't appear that we're leaving the implication that the simple act of picking any <i>one</i> definition inevitably leads to the conclusion that the US is a terrorist state. (George Bush might choose a different definition, one he could choose to employ consistently, that leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.) <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> 21:53, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brandon, I do understand your POV about MSK. I think her problem largely stems from believing that factionalism is rather more deeply entrenched than it actually is here. Maybe that is the product of a naturally confrontational attitude; maybe a product of her syndrome. I don't know. I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume the best though. The message I'd be giving to her would be "If you want to contribute positively, contribute positively. Don't revert, don't bicker, don't fight." Of course, that involves her finding someone she trusts who will tell her, you're reverting too much, you're bickering, you're fighting. Perhaps her problem with you was that she didn't choose you; you just had something to say to her? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 01:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well yes, other explanations are possible. I do mention, each time I say anything about it, that I can understand other conclusions being drawn. However, for me, assuming good faith means not drawing them if others are possible. If she were given a second chance and returned to the same behaviour (or even the same pages for that matter), I'd be first in line to kick her stupid arse for it. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:08, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You don't have e-mail enabled, so I'll ask my question here. Why is that you find the existence of this article so upsetting? You say that every morning you wake up to a Wikipedia that slurs your faith with the existence of this article. But even those commentators who think that the battle against "Islamofascism" is the most important struggle in human history do not use the term as a synonym for Islam. Daniel Pipes, Christopher Hitchens, even those guys recognize a distinction between Islam itself and the extremist political movements that they find so hateful. So is it just the merging of the two words, "Islam" and "fascism" that you find so upsetting? So upsetting that even a Wikipedia article that merely chronicles the use of the term is an insult to Islam itself? I ask because I genuinely want to understand why this article bothers you so intensely.

<dd>Simple and direct. Don't do this. Its considered problematic and impolite, and is unwise. I don't think you're trying to stack the vote, but its best we just let things gather as they go.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 21:10, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That was dissapointing, to read how you stacked those votes(its not very polite or fair)...Don't do that in the future, man! By the way, I got the mistress to revert her <b>oppose</b>, so it's looking better.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 21:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For what it's worth, this is the first I've heard of this kind of thing being a problem. I will certainly lay off. Out of curiosity, is anyone talking to <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">User:IronDuke</a> about this? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> 21:17, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you could supply a diff, I would. In the future, please just ask people to give their two cents about your argument, instead of asking for them to look at it, without saying anything else(which kinda suggests that you want them to agree with you). You'll get even more points if you consult editors who you respect from both sides of an issue. Not a huge deal, just avoid it yeah. Peace, salaam, shalom.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 21:45, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, thats not good the way he approaches him. If he does it again(two times is enough for me to contact the editor usually), then either you or I should inform him that it's not polite/fair. PS: its been very good discussing issues with you, I find that you get right to the point, thank you.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 22:11, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe there were at least three of these. I will find the diffs and pass them along. Nice working with you, too. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a> 22:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey -- didn't realize this discussion was on your page. Wanted to be able to post a reply that could be read by everyone involved. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 02:47, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>I'm not quite sure how to respond to the above. Let me first say that I find BYT's virtual wiki-stalking of me either very flattering or very creepy, I'm not altogether certain which. Let me also say that if urging people to vote (without a even a specific recommendation) is a violation of etiquette, then I have done so and apologize. However, after having looked at the Catholic Alliance thingie, I am not and have never been a part of any organization or cabal on WP (or anywhere else), formally or informally (unlike, I gather <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a>, who is/was a member of such a cabal). The people that I contacted had all voted on the issue previously, and the vast majority of them I do not know and don't wish to know and have had no previous contact with (and not all of whom voted with me). If, even with the above caveats in mind, this is still a violation of something or other, please let me know. Ironically, the idea to do this came from <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandonYusufToropov_88ae.html" title="User:BrandonYusufToropov">BYT</a>. I've only myself to blame. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke">IronDuke</a> 02:54, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>He definitely is wording that in a way to bias people, so I'd suggest posting it at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a>. I'm going to make sure theres a guideline on some wikipdia page that tells people not to do this type of stuff because it seems like theres no such page, its like an assumed unwritten rule-- ill work on fixing that.

<p>Hi Brandon. Hope you're staying out of trouble&#160;:). There's a proposal to move <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist_terrorism.html" title="Islamist terrorism">Islamist terrorism</a> to "Islamic terrorism". I think this would be unfortunate. If you're interested there's a vote section on the talk page.--<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:09, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems like you support the most recent compromise. Could you formally vote for support if this is the case? 60% is required for a move.--<a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 13:14, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
