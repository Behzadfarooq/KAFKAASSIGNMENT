<p>Brauer College is a government <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_school.html" title="Secondary school">secondary school</a>, located in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrnambool.html" title="Warrnambool">Warrnambool</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>.</p>
<p>Originally established as Warrnambool Technical School in 1911, the school was renamed Brauer College at the beginning of 1990 (after noted 20th century Warrnambool doctor, Dr. Alfred Brauer), to reflect its resulted change from an outstanding technical institution, into a more mainstream and highly regarded college. Brauer has since developed into one of the largest secondary schools in the state with an enrollment of approximately 1450 students ranging from years 7 to 12. The school is known for both outstanding curricular and extra curricular activities, including consistently high VCE results and unmatched levels of success in both the public speaking, performing arts and sporting areas.</p>
<p>The current principal is Mr. Michael Cusick and school council president Mr. Andrew Anderson.</p>

<p>Brauer's main campus is located on Carumut Road, towards the outskirts of Warrnambool's urban area. The school features a state of the art performing arts centre and gymnasium, as well as extensive classroom and other facilities including a driver education track and supergrass tennis courts. In 2007, the library and science wing are to be refurbished in addition to the construction of the Australian Technical College Warrnambool campus. Directly north of the school, a multimillion dollar sports facility known as Brauerander Park is also being built. The park will feature an athletics track as well as facilities for field events, soccer &amp; AFL football fields and a 3-hole golf course. The Park, which was expected to be completed by 2007, has been plagued with delays mainly relating to the synthetic track surface which can only be laid under certain weather conditions. Laying of the track commenced in March 2007.</p>
<p><b>Rutledge</b></p>
<p>Brauer also features a secondary campus known as Rutledge, which is a specialist education centre for students who may have difficulties with work or other problems. Located close by, Rutledge students may receive tutoring or undergo courses teaching them ways of dealing with workloads, stress or other issues.</p>
<p><b>Dunkeld Annexe</b></p>
<p>The Dunkeld Annexe is a Brauer owned facility located in Dunkeld, in the southern Grampians, used for the purpose of school camps. Years 7, 8 and 9 camping trips take place here where the open bush is one of its many benifits.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brauer_College_Warrnambool_c4d3.html" title="Edit section: Academic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Academic</span></h2>
<p>Brauer's year 11 and 12 students undertake the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) program. Brauer offers a range of approximately 100 VCE subjects for students to study in addition to VET and VCAL trade programs. In 2006, the school achieved a 97% pass rate with an average study score of 31, placing the school within the top 6% of government schools and well within the state top 30% - a particular achievement given approximately 150 students undertake the program each year. Highest 2006 ENTER was 98.80, in 2005 98.60 and 99.15 in 2004.</p>
<p>Brauer's Middle School Program (MSP) offers nearly 200 subject choices for students to choose from - allowing a solid working base for most subjects they wish to studay at VCE level.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brauer_College_Warrnambool_c4d3.html" title="Edit section: Extra Curricular">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Extra Curricular</span></h2>
<p>Aside from the school's curricular achievements, Brauer is also well known within both the Warrnambool and wider community for its success in extra curricular activities.</p>
<p><b>Public Speaking</b></p>
<p>Brauer has a very strong and long tradition in the art of public speaking and debating. All students are taught the skills to participate in public speaking. The school has long associations with the Warrnambool Eisteddfod, public speaking and debating competitions run by the Rostrum Club, the Lions Club, the Legacy Group, the Apex Club, the VCAA Plain Englis Speaking Competition and the mooting competition run by Bond University. Brauer's success in these fields has been unmatched, with state and national finalists and champions in all aforementioned competitions. At Eisteddfod level, in 2006 Brauer had over 150 students compete with a high rate of success. In the debating section, Brauer won the overall aggregate for the 16th consecutive year, cementing the school's level of commitment and success. Brauer also participates in the Ballarat region of the Debater's Association of Victoria (DAV), where up to 30 students travel each round to participate, several debaters have previously won Swannie Awards for best debater and progressed to the state final debating rounds. Each year a team of senior public speaking students are choosen to take part in the Bond university mooting competition - an exclusive competition in which Brauer is the only Victorian school to have won the national title, amongst names as Sydney Kings and Melbourne Grammar (all highly regarded independent schools).</p>
<p><b>Music/Performing Arts</b></p>
<p>Brauer's music and performing arts program is, like public speaking, a large part of the school's cohort. Annually, the Brauer musical comprises of approximately 150 students as cast, band and backstage members. In 2006 the production was "Copacabana", with "We Will Rock You" set to be performed in mid 2007. The musical has been part of Brauer since 1984. Additionally, the Brauer Amatuer Dramatics Club (or BAD) produce a non-musical, dramatic performance. In 2006, this was "Two Weeks with the Queen" with another show to be performed in 2007.</p>
<p>Brauer also supports a number of bands, ensembles and musical solo performers with tutition enabling students to participate in the Warrnambool Eisteddfod and other prestigious music competitions. Around 300 students are involved with the music program.</p>
<p><b>Sport</b></p>
<p>Brauer is a major player in the sporting community. The college sports academy consists of 14 sports with students from years 7-12 participating. Academy teams compete against other schools and in larger competitions. House sports are also a major part of the school's sporting program. There are four houses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geefa (green)</li>
<li>Vesta (red)</li>
<li>Aurora (yellow)</li>
<li>Orion (blue)</li>
</ul>
<p>Members of each house participate annually for house championships in swimming, athletics, cross country and overall. In 2006, Geefa was house champion, with the 2007 championships still underway.</p>

<p>In 2006, Brauer in partnership with Baimbridge College Hamiltion won the tender for the Australian Technical College in Warrnambool. Commencing its programs at the beginning of 2007, the ATCW offers courses in mechanics, engineering, metal fabrication and building (building course in Hamilton). By 2008, the school will also operate commercial cookery classes and electro technology by 2009. Currently, the ATCW is operating out of Brauer's trade wing, with a purpose built facility soon to be built. Former Brauer assistant principal Mr. Tony Austin is Executive Manager.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brauer_College_Warrnambool_c4d3.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>In mid 2006, several students took a complaint regarding the school's uniform and hair/makeup policy to local newspaper, <i>the Warrnambool Standard</i>, arguing it was too strict. A subsequent article was featured in the Sunday Herald Sun that same week, although both articles seemed to spark little reaction and a general consensus of "get over it" from both the students and community at large.</p>
<p><b>The Two-Brick Rule</b></p>
<p>On March 13, 2007 an article appeared on the front page of the Warrnambool Standard slamming a policy set by the school stating that "students of the opposite sex must stay two-bricks apart". An article on the same issue appeared on page 3 of the Melbourne Age on Thursday the 15th, with discussion on 774 ABC radio's drive program and a feature story on national television public affairs program, A Current Affair. However, many students and staff alike at the school critisied the publicity with the reality being that while the rule is to prevent any sexual type contact between the students, the rule is not taken seriously and is, in fact, the butt of many jokes at the school - rather than a literal way of splitting people up.</p>
