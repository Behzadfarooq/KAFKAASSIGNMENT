<h2><span class="mw-headline">removed "totally disputed" notice</span></h2>
<p>I have made some more changes, enough that (if they stick) I believe that the article will not substantially misinform anyone. I still would like to review Lifton's book, sharpen up my memory on the conclusions he and Schein reached, and then see what can be done to improve the article. I suspect that much of the problem with the original article can be written off to vague definitions of brainwashing that allowed many <b>relatively</b> benign manipulations to be called brainwashing, that were followed by denials by others that amounted to saying that the relatively benign manipulatios did not meet the strict definition of "brainwashing". I may not remember the Schein and Lifton materials well enough to be sure that the article has produced a full description of the hard-ball version of the technique as used by the CCP.</p>
<p>I suppose that one ancillary problem is: does it make a difference whether one is arrested and thrown into a "commune" where brainwashing is practiced, or one enters voluntarily and with full disclosure of the likely consequences and the methodologies to be used. If somebody says that s/he will remake my mind according to his/her prescriptions by the use of classical brainwashing techniques, then if I voluntarily submit to this person because he/she has a doctor of divinity from Cambridge Theological Institution (of Cambridge, MA) &#160;;-) , have I removed from that person the responsibility to behave ethically according to some external standard? Or can s/he henceforth do with me as she or he desires?</p>
<p>Another ancillary ethical question would be whether it is o.k. to use brainwashing techniques to try to rehabilitate prisoners who have been convicted of felonies. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 17:38, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>One of the most prominent advocates of this theory was the controversial <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Singer_e382.html" title="Margaret Singer">Margaret Singer</a> who was discredited, when her psychological theory of 'mind control' was declared "not scientific" by the American Psychological Association <a href="http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/Singer/Evaluation/index2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/Singer/Evaluation/index2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</i></p>
<p>I've removed this claim. The reference not only comes from the Scientology-operated 'new' <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_Awareness_Network_385b.html" title="Cult Awareness Network">Cult Awareness Network</a> -- hardly an unbiased party on the subject -- but a quick search of the reference shows that it never even mentions the American Psychological Association or the words "not scientific".

<p>I support the recent reversion made by Antaeus Feldspar. If some business, e.g., a tobacco company, claims that their product does not contain chemical agent X, it is not POV to point out that a chemical analysis would be a way to decide whether their claims are true or the government's claims are true. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 18:53, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Patrick, there is a long list of scholarly articles and books that challenge the brainwashing theories advanced by anti-cultists. The list above is just a series of documents pertaining to Singer. There is a long list of citacions from other books and articles that discredit brainwashing in the context of NRMs and "cults".

<dd>The problem is you want a double standard; when there's evidence of wrongdoing, you want each cult to be judged separately; when there's a statement that <i>certain research</i> was found to have been lacking in scientific rigor, you want that to be converted into a blanket statement that the entire notion was found pseudoscientific and that <i>all</i> cults have thus been absolved of the charge.

<dd>Can be left there if you do some research and provide citacions in which these "objective determinations" have been conducted in a scientific manner.

</dl>
<p>[P0M]: Zappaz, why do you put "objective determinations" into scare quotes? Please avoid rhetorical tricks. Is it is your understanding that objective determinations cannot be made, then say so and explain how you can justify such an extraordinary claim.</p>
<p>[P0M]: I don't follow your reasoning. A statement was made to the effect that when contending <b>claims</b> have been made about some matter, then the claims are just that pending serious research. If you want to say that the scientific research has already been done, well and good, but that doesn't alter the validity of the other sentence. The expectation, if one is going to use research to settle contending (possibily ideologically motivated) claims is that the research should be done. Your reasoning is oddly spiral, i.e., sort of circular. You will not permit an assertion that scientific research is essential to true knowledge until such time as the scientific research is actuall--y done.</p>
<p>[P0M]: To assert that first there must be "research and ... citations [to cases] in which these objective determinations have been conducted in a scientific manner (in what other manner might an objective determination be made in such a case?), and only later can one state that scientific research to settle the question ought to be helpful, has everything going in the wrong direction. That sounds to me like a tobacco company saying, "First prove scientifically that spoking tobacco products is bad for the consumer's health, and only then can you ask the government or some other competent authority to conduct scientific proof." A tobacco company might say that, but I would have to question their motivation for doing so. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 07:54, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally fail to follow your reasoning. The paragraph represented a covert argument that is allegedly used by some religious groups, and, in doing so, it left the encyclopedia giving tacit agreement to (the mere assertion of) their innocence on the more serious charges. So something needed to be said to pull the covers on that bit of rhetorical manipulation whether it was intended or not.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 22:23, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Do you mean that the first part of the paragraph was wrong and the last sentence was wrong, so the whole thing was wrong? Something may be uncited but true. Then the question should be whether the uncited claim looks interesting enough to get somebody to supply the missing citations. Disapproving of your reasons for chopping things out does not mean that I necessarily approve of what is there. See my somewhat earlier remarks below. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 22:23, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[P0M:] It took me a while, working with the history pages, to see what Zappaz actually did. He removed the whole paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should be noted that some religious groups, especially those of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> origin, openly state that they seek to improve the natural human mind by spiritual exercises. Intense spiritual exercises have an effect on the mind, for example by leading to an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altered_state_of_consciousness.html" title="Altered state of consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a>. These groups do not, however, proclaim that they use coercive techniques to acquire or retain converts. Whether they do so or not is a matter for objective determination in individual cases.</dd>
</dl>
<p>[P0M:] He evidently did so in order to eliminate the final sentence. His argument for removing the paragraph appears to be that he didn't write it and Feldspar didn't write it. That reasoning, in my opinion, is flawed. The content of the paragraph is relevant. People have been accused of doing certain things. They admit to doing some of those things or to doing them in a less intense way. To do so is actually a strong stance to take in a debate: Stipulate to what is true and/or does not hurt your own case, because it is pointless to defend something that doesn't actually need defending. If so-and-so is accused of being a Marxist, a Green, and a spy, there is no reason for him to try to deny the allegation that he is a Marxist or the allegation that he is a Green -- especially if he is indeed a Marxist and a Green. The good debater will say that , yes, it is true what the opposition says on one or two points. They've noticed that I'm a citizen of Tanzania, and that's true. But so what? None of those things make me a spy.</p>
<p>[P0M:] What the groups in question <b>may</b> be trying to do is to admit to lesser "sins" (knowing that they are "legal") in order to create the impression that they are innocent of the more serious charges, i.e., create the impression that they would admit to the more serious charges if they were true.</p>
<p>[P0M:] Probably the whole question of religious groups that are viewed as non-cults and religious groups that are viewed as cults and that also tell people how to lead their lives should be put in a separate article. The important thing in this article is to make clear what brainwashing actually is, not what it is not, and not the details of less manipulative forms of influence and persuasion. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 22:11, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

I finally found my own copy of Lifton's book, so I can underline or highlight as I read rather than taking extensive notes in the library's copy. Every time I look at the article I find more things that seem shakey. Probably the "seems to be" and "are taken to be" things need to be moved away. (That'll be one way to keep the article down to the 32K limit, too.)</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, I propose re-inserting the paragraph that I wrote. For example, the Hare Krishna and my former group (Sathya Sai Baba) openly state that they want to purify the human mind by sadhana. It is not only my experience but I read it too. It is a fact that does not need attribution. I think it was dr. Reender Kranenborg who wrote it but I do not understand why I need to provide references for such well known facts. It is relevant because it may help to understand phenomena that some anti-cult activists call snapping <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/06/17/235116.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/06/17/235116.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.cultinformation.org.uk/article1_printable.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cultinformation.org.uk/article1_printable.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 22:38, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we are going to discuss what brainwashing is not -- with the aim of distinguishing it from things that resemble it fairly clearly, and so not involving us in pointing out that brainwashing is not the teaching and learning of multiplication tables, nasty though that practice is -- then I think the paragraph would be very useful. Being able to cite book and page would be very helpful in avoiding battles conducted in the midst of fog and smoke. What Kranenborg (or whoever it really was) wrote may seem like general knowledge to you, but even though I've been interested in brainwashing for nearly 50 years I know nothing about what you describe. So if it came down to a question of whether to credit the passage or not, then I would definitely want citations, and so would most non-experts. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 23:10, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Patrick, I will try but I need some time. I think that <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_James_2cca.html" title="William James">William James</a> wrote that intense spiritual excercises may lead to an altered state of consciousness though that term may not have existed when he wrote the classic The varieties of religious experience. I have the book (which is also online available) but have not read it yet. I do not know how to prove the other obvious statement yet. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 02:13, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The James materials will be valuable. There is a great deal in Lifton's work about the differences in the ways people react to Chinese intense brainwashing. It's the "wishy-washy" ones who escaped. They "wishyed" over to the pro-PPC position and then "washeyed" back to the consentual reality of the West as soon as they got out from under information control. The "true believer" type, however, tends to switch from being an adamant "no arguments" Catholic (or whatever) to an adamant PPC believer. It's like a cube. You push it and push it and suddenly what was the bottom becomes a side, and there is no easy way to get it back into its original orientation. You have to push it just as hard to get it to go back as you did to get it to turn in the first place. The other type is more like pushing a bean bag. You push it on one side and the top part of it will move over but the bottom part stays about where it was to begin with, and when you let go it squishes back to about where it was when you started. I'll check out the URLs you added above. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 04:39, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"It has become clear in the course of time that the definition of reality for most people - that includes questions like, what happens with me, with others and with the rest of society - and their judgement about what is good and evil, is very sensitive to suggestion, influence and manipulation if this happens when these people are cut off from other sources of information. If there is only one interpretation available and if in addition this interpretation is also accepted by other co-believers and if even a suspicion of doubt is explained as a shortage of faith or betrayal to the cause, then, it will be clear, that investigation of reality is not easy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The question is not whether brainwashing exists</span></h2>
<p>There seems a lot of evidence for the existence of brainwashing given the fact that many people's opinion are resistant against evidence but the question is not whehter is exists but whether it is a suitable explanation following <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockham%27s_razor.html" title="Ockham's razor">ockham's razor</a> for this phenomenon. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 04:05, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

There is a '<b>huge'</b> amount of scholarly research done on Brainwashing, mind control, influenece, propaganda, etc. Attempting to bypass all that research and attempt to find an explanation following ockham's razor, is laughable.

<dd>I do not mean to re-do the research here but what I meant is there seemed to be some good reasons to believe in brainwashing by cults that should be stated here. I mean, we should explain why this at a certain point of history this was thought to be a plausible explanation for what happened to members of purported cults. Some of them, like altered state of consciousness and what Barker wrote about the big influence of communal reinforcement and lack of information can and should be stated in the article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:47, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So "why the anti-cult movement tried to apply theories of brainwashing to members of NRMs", this is "evidently obvious". The notion that "mind control" is exactly the same theory as "brainwashing" only under a different name, this too is "evidently obvious". But oh, sorry, when it comes to anything the anti-cult movement might have to say in <i>answer</i> to accusations that they are a homogenous lump of pseudoscience-spouting bigots, I'm sorry, we <i>can't</i> read their minds on that like we did on those other two issues; it's going to need references before anything can be allowed in on that matter. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:39, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that Andries has a good point. There is a large range of phenomena that get called "brainwashing." (Which presidential candidate admitted to being "brainwashed" after he repeated some CCP conclusions?) Even within the confines of Chinese practice, the brainwashing that was practiced in Korea was different from the more intense brainwashing applied within their national borders. Brainwashing developed out of Russian show trial "preparation" of prisoners, which in turn owed much to techniques used by the Catholic Church during the Inquisitions. Much of what I saw in my own Presbyterian Sunday School background used elements of coercive persuasion, and in between are the televangelists. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 20:22, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fully agree. That is why we need to make clear distinctions in how the term has been applied to different situations and by different people, as well provide the necessary context for readers. After all, hope you agree that this is a "loaded" term: By utilizing the term "brainwashing" anti-cultists in the 70s and 80's attempted to ride the wave of the obviously negative connotations of the term, and use that as a weapon of misinformation and propaganda against the new religious movements they opposed. When scientist rejected the theories of brainwashing within the context of "cults" and NRMs, they simply changed the term to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">mind control</a>. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 22:14, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is very gullible. Hassan and othre anti-cultists changed 'brainwashing' to 'mind control' and 'deprogramming' to 'exit counseling' as a way to diassociate themselves from the controversies that ended up as a huge discredit to anti-cultist. Mind control and brainwashing are <b>both</b> inventions without any scientific standing.

<dd>Zappaz, I think you overlooked the fact that many ex-members sincerely do not understand their own experiences and look for answers and they sometimes end up with simplistic theories such as mind control but to say that they were devised cynically to have strategy against cults, well, that may be unconcsiously part of the reason. I am happy to see that you are somewhat cynical and suspicious of the motives of people if you can apply this attitude to all players in the debate, not just to anti-cult movement but also to leaders of NRMs. The disappointment and the anger of so many once ardent followers, such me of so many NRMs indicates that there is sufficient reason to do so. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:29, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, this is a general problem that I have with your edits in Wikipedia. You seem to welcome NRMs as an enrichment of cultural and religious diverdity but seems to forget or ignore the fact (and this is just a fact) that the lives of people have been ruined by NRMs. You only focus on the persecution and unjustified stigmatization they receive and to depict the people who criticize them as untrustwothy and hate mongers . In some cases there is believe me a good reason for this stigmatization of certain NRMs. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:58, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emerging religions are indeed a societal phenomenon and part of the cultural diversity and development of societies. Your generalization <i>"the lives of people have been ruined by NRMs"</i> can coexist with the opposing statement that <i>"the lives of people have been enriched by NRMs"</i>. My position, supported by years of study and corroborated by many scholars, is that the number of people who's life was "ruined" to use your term, is a tiny minority and that most people are either indifferent or enriched by their experience in NRMs. I agree with you that some NRMs are very destructive, but please note that the anti-cult movement and their proponents have a very distorted view of reality either due to their apostasy, their religious background (mostly evangelical christians), or their ideology and that they tend to crtitique any and all groups that are outside of mainstream religions. Most scholars that study NRMs concur with this. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 20:22, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indifferent because they were never deeply or long involved. Why do you always conveniently forget to mention that? Many people who wake up after long feel they have been harmed. Many people for whom it is just too difficult or too painful to see the evidence do not wake up for obvious reasons. At a certain moment when they are not so devoted then they may look at the evidence and then this may not be traumatic. But you have to understand that there are people, like me, on which the evidence was forced due to circumstances when they were superdevoted and supercommitted. Zappaz, I was fully aware that some people in the anti-cult movements made flimsy, crazy criticisms on NRMs even when I was a follower but that does not mean that ex-members/apostates cannot tell the truth. Why do you think so many post on ex-Jehovah forums. Don't you think that ex-followers feel cheated and angry, at least for some time? What apostates do is consumer protection for spiritual seekers. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 21:19, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zappaz, thanks for the best wishes and you too. But there is huge difference with marriage i.e. the relationship resembles a one to many relationship unlike marriage so that makes it meaningful to warn people not to make the same mistake. And there is another difference my former guru requested all devotion and love directed to him, and every act dedicated to him.
