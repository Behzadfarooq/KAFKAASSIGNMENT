<p>Hello everyone, I'm new to Wikipedia, so be gentle with me in my early stages. Whilst I am not aware of the full history of this article, there have clearly been some spicey exchanges! I am a graduate student who is researching the Brahma Kumaris as part of a larger study, therefore I have a particular interest in this BK site. For Wikipedia readers (many of whom are scholars) transparency and neutrality of information is integral to a solid knowledge base. At present the article, although good, could benefit from more detail. Given that a lot of work has gone into the current page, I would like to incorporate a little more depth and detail into the 'History' section while maintaining the content. Please advise me if I haven't referenced something correctly or adequately. I am learning the new wiki language as I go. All the best, Amasintay 10:42, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good to have you on board! I'm sure you'll find your study an interesting experience. However, you will notice the article is currently going through arbitration and although that doesn't stop you making edits (I personally have no problem with new editors doing this), you might be received with greater warmth by some of the involved editors if you waited until the arbitration process is over.

<dd>Your first edits were to REMOVE depth and detail, add unreferenced and in places erroneous waffle (I am sorry, I cant think of a more tackful way of saying that), e.g. "It was frequent practice in the early to mid 20th century to adopt a new name when beginning a life of spiritual endeavour" and the stuff about Jains and head back into whitewash or obfuscation, e.g. "Regular" for "daily" mediation. I think that you are also misusing the &lt;ref&gt; tags and your use of the &lt;br&gt; tag suggests that you are using the same material as Luis.</dd>

<dd>Dear .244, Please be civil. At least give our new editor a warm welcome... It seems that you have started with your "little quizzes" as well? Perhaps Sister TalkAbout will complain about it ... Please there is no need to be so finical about simple edits with reliable sources behind it... "erroneous waffle"?? After all you asked for more editors to show up and change things around. Perhaps you should show some reliable sources which maintain the opposite view.. however; you should remember that academia has the first hand...

<dd>a) Not looking for consensus, because people are people and even experts differ on their understanding of given areas. Also, my preference here is really for accuracy and not for a pro or anti site which is not very useful to anyone... there are enough of both. Wiki offers a unique opportunity here to co-author a precise, neutral and well-informed article. My primary interest is in helping with that, in any way I can.</dd>

<dd>b) As with most researchers, my academic interest comes from a personal one. However, my exploration is more into the role of spirituality in general rather than any particular path or dogma. I'm doing a PhD on three separate groups of people to determine the role of spirituality in creating resilience/ reducing suffering for people during events of disaster. In fact, I am researching three very diverse groups (to be confirmed). Brahma Kumaris (as a disciplined NRM), NY Firefighters (often secular/ atheist) and a more traditional religious group in Sri Lanka (Buddhist or Muslim perhaps).</dd>

<dd>c) I have attended murli classes and so am familiar with sakar and avyakt versions of them and also how they are distinct from each other. While the article mentioned 'murlis', which is a new word for most Wiki readers, I thought it needed some elaboration so readers can understand better what murli's are, how they are spoken and where they come from.</dd>

<dd>The note about adopting a spiritual name I thought was common knowledge (which often doesn't need referencing). Perhaps because I grew up in the 1970's and I know many people, particularly who have been to India, that have taken a new spiritual name (not BK's although I know many of them have done similar). I will remove it though - it's not that important, it was just a point of interest within the Indian culture.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the comments about Jainism perhaps I should remove those anyway, because it's not about BK... what does everyone think. Anyway, in response to the comments, the information about Jain practise is actually correct. Some comes from a great book by Dundas called "The Jains (Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices)" published by Routledge. The information is re-iterated on official Jain websites, one of them scholarly (<a href="http://www.jainuniversity.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.jainuniversity.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jainuniversity.org/</a>). I will post them up.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the section that mentioned meditation at 4:00am I'm seriously not looking to whitewash. Honestly, I don't have time for that. You should see the ocean of paper and books I am living in! Regarding the 4:00am comments though, "regular" may be less specific but it is in fact more accurate, as I have spoken to many that identify as BK's but don't necessarily get up every day at 4:00am. I even thought about changing the 4:00am to between 2:00am and 5:00am as it's more correct, according to their <i>actual</i> practice. What do you think?</dd>

I did cut and paste previous content into the new edit, but you'll have to explain the <i>ref</i> and <i>br</i> tags to me. I'm not clear on their use. How should they be used and does it matter if I use the same references as previous editors?</dd>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a query about the 'Patterns of Membership' section on the Brahma Kumaris site. I have read Wallis's research article and, while it is the findings of one ethnographic study, it doesn't necessarily reflect the current patterns of membership within the BKWSU, particularly given that the research was undertaken approximately 10 years ago. When speaking with older members of the BKWSU, membership within the Brahma Kumaris has changed markedly since the mid-1990's and so this section just needs to be contextualised and re-worked. The 'patterns of membership' may not even warrant a section of its own. It could, for instance, be incorporated into the section on 'Expansion' perhaps. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. All the best, Amasintay 13:51, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Amasintay, Do you have any recent reliable sources? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I was able to find scholars whose articles where published 10 or more years ago. Babb, is one of them, his writings about BK are probably out of date as he himself asserted to me. Particularly I like Wallis patterns of memberships because it clearly states that people interested in spirituality are not just looking for BK knowledge, but other type of meaningful experiences. That is why, this article in my view; should consider those patterns of membership. Not everyone is interested in hearing about BK philosophy; nevertheless, a neutral article will give everyone the chance to explore by themselves and to find out if BK is for them or not.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd say that section could be cut entirely. It is not particularly defining of the BKWSU. It is generic and could quite easily apply to any NRM/cult. It does not identify the real membership pattern/requirements of what it means to be a BKWSU Brahmin rather than just a user of the services they offer nor the differentiation between established BKWSU Brahmins, e.g. senior sisters/juniors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It does also not take into consideration any difference between different cultures/nations. Where are you coming from? <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.82.106.244.html" title="User:195.82.106.244">195.82.106.244</a> 23:33, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dear 244, It is not about "definition of BKWSU" It is about describing it. BKWSU is not a dictionary word. There are several level of membership in BK. You should know that. BK is a "Spiritual University" and that means that it is open to everyone...However, "everyone" could be neatly classified into different groups as Walliss has done.

<dd>Hi everyone, What if we kept the section, because it is quite interesting and relevant to the organisations patterns, but framed it socially and historically... can you tell that I'm an anthropologist yet (medical anthropologist actually)!? Also, it is correct that the research we're <i>primarily</i> drawing on in our discussions only covers the main foreign centres of the UK and Australia, and it should be stated as such (although I recognise Babb's work in 1970's and early 1980's India). However, I do know that in reading the work of Howell, Babb and Walliss, membership patterns have altered significantly over the BK's journey of expansion outside of India. It could be useful to write a brief trajectory of membership: ie, that it was stricter in the 1970's and 1980's with a high rate of expansion, followed by a re-negotiation of identity from many members in the 1990's (when Walliss did his work) accompanied by little growth to current patterns which, from what I've witnessed and heard in informal interviews, is different again. The categories of membership currently seem to be quite blurred and 'elastic' if you like. What do you think about something along those lines?</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBrahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University_Archive10_3b4e.html" title="Edit section: Concerns over removal of references to criticism of Brahma Kumaris">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Concerns over removal of references to criticism of Brahma Kumaris</span></h2>
<p>I looked at this article some months ago and found it very useful. I had been attending a free meditation class run by BK and was already feeling a little unsettled at the direction things were going. This wikipedia article, as it then was, helped me make an informed decision over whether or not to continue my involvement with BK. Looking at this article is it now stands, I'm concerned that all discussion of whether the organisation is or is not a cult (or "cult-like") appears to have been removed. Clearly, Wikipedia does not need to take a position as to whether or not BK is a cult (with all that entails), but given the extensive discussion of this issue elsewhere on the internet - including some disturbing personal testimonies from ex-BK members, this article seems incomplete without some examination of the issue. Such an examination might present the arguments on both sides of the debate, and then leave readers to make their own judgement. As things stand, a casual reader would have no indication that such a controversy even exists.</p>
<p>Of course I can understand that those wikipedians who are currently BK members, and feel strongly that BK is a good thing, would want to present the organisation in the best possible light, and defend it against criticisms they believe to be unfair. But as things stand at the moment, the removal of all discussion of such criticisms seems to have affected the neutrality of this article, and seems to run counter to the spirit of wikipedia. Such actions could be perceived as an attempt by BK members to stifle criticism of their organisation, and manipulate wikipedia into presenting a one-sided view, which I'm sure is the last thing anyone would want to see. Can I suggest that we create an additional section in the article marked "Criticism and defence of Brahma Kumaris" or "Controversies"? To take an example more or less at random, this article does something similar: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism</a>. The entry on Scientology (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology</a>) has a "controversy and criticism" section, and a similar section exists for the article on ISKCON (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISKCON#Scandal_and_controversy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISKCON#Scandal_and_controversy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISKCON#Scandal_and_controversy</a>).

<dd>Hi Rcameronw,</dd>
<dd>Yes you do raise a valid concern. There has been critisism and controversy throughout the history of the organisation and the article is incomplete if this is not documented. As one of the BK editors of the article I can tell you that there has been quite some strife in the last few months and I think we are all agreed that we have a broken article at the end of it. Having said that, there is one crucial difference between a negative and a positive biased article, and that is, libel. The problem we (BKs) had with the article is that a lot of the negative statements were inadequately sourced and presented in a biased, even spiteful and malicious, way. Opinions were stated as fact. An article on Wikipedia that is actually libelous is needlessly damaging to the subject and their reputation. From what you are saying it seems to have even made an impression on you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've looked at other NRM articles and their talk pages such as <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem_Rawat</a> and the critism is, at least compared to what I have seen here, robustly sourced, cited and presented in a neutral way. It has to be. I have to say I know the BKs are very, very different to Scientology!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you look at the arbitration case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Proposed_decision" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Proposed_decision" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> evidence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Evidence" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Evidence" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> you can see a list of suitable sources that <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> has proposed can be used. I know that a lot of controversy is covered in our own literature too, although this would be considered a primary source. I'm sure it has also been covered in secondary sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The arbitrators have indicated they would like editors, who don't have a conflict of interest, to contribute to the article who are not associated with the BKs or former-BKs. Are you planning on staying around on this article? If so then welcome aboard&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>rather than work up a little slur, could you substiate? "Inadequate ... libel ... negative ... biased ... even spiteful and malicious ..." That is a fairly heavy lean to one side.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>And are you willing to admit that the organization is attempting to keep a more complete and detailed documentation out of the public domain because it does not fit in with current service plans in the West?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An awful lot of very basic, valid, neutral stuff has been removed needlessly and are missing mostly because the editors involved just had no awareness of the documentation and their own agenda, e.g. to de-Hinduise the BKWSU, the history, core Knowledge, Brahmin lifestyle etc.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate the thought to create a resolution however I think all pages on Wikipedia are expected to have an NPOV rather than having different versions of biased pages. I wonder if they also get indexed by Google. Also the arbitration case is intended to define what resolutions are appropriate to this article. I'm not sure if we (involved editors) might be doing more harm than good by inventing our own solutions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The choice of sub page name is also interesting, "Pro_BK_proposal" and "Objective_proposal". This kind of implies that one is pro-BK biased and the other isn't biased and is "objective". Well, I can tell you there are some different views here on that&#160;:-) What parts of the "pro-BK" page do you think are biased? Can you quote example statements from it that you consider to be either not cited or POV? So far, we know that a Controversy/Critism section needs to be added, but is there any part of the article that is there already that you consider inappropriate for not being NPOV?</dd>

<dd>That is correct. It would seem to be the only way forward to create two entirely different sandboxes for the kids to play in so they stop fighting. Basic child psychology. After a while they will get over their differences, lonely, and want to start working together. It also follows others opinion above. That is all they are, sandboxes.</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'd point out that extended version of Kranenborgs quote that used to be at the top of the intro paragraph. Unscientific, unsubstainable, unprovable. It was just a repeat of "highest of high" marketing PR. Can't be proven.</li>
<li>I'd say that "patterns of membership" stuff instead of actual Brahmin Maryadas whas deliberately misleading. That is to say, defined how individuals "didn't join" the BKs rather the actually proscribed lifestyle of a BK Brahmin.</li>
<li><b>anything that fudges the issue of who God is into general language that is misleading and inaccurate, e.g. the "highest" etc.</b></li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of the problems with depending on a lot of sociological stuff is that when the -ists write their thesis or essay, e.g. membership patterns ... feminism within NRM etc, generally they are not writing about the BKWSU but about a sociological theory into which they want to fit or use the BKWSU as an example. This means that their work is not an accurate, direct documentation in the same way that a historian or historical theologian would.</dd>

Frankly, my point of view after finding 5 books now that have information that the "scholars" seemed to have missed is that it will all come in due time. Once the information is placed in here, maybe those "scholar" may take off the blinders and have a look see. Until that time, we must work within those confines and give it our best efforts. I for one don't feel bad as the group has been successful in hiding their practices, beliefs and the "Hidden Doctrine" from the UN. I have found two English academics who's work is cited (by other academics) due to its in depth research (through actual cases...interviews, well researched) and a Spanish one (catalyst of the French government report) that also includes other groups and examines the causal effect of such groups (once again via cases......interviews, psychological reviews and well researched). As to Sethie's comments, well I for one wouldn't say “leave” ( I recognize the long term affects of the group and applaud the fact that you are still standing able to speak. I also, am cognizant of another that was 5 stories up ready to jump and since found the were with all to continue. Please, note that perhaps not all have read the personal stories, nor understand what the “orthodox” like you endured.), as we all have our good days and our bad days.

Arbitration is in place, you just have to be patient... in the meantime, and just to keep you busy, you can continue defaming me. I liked the write up you did on your site. I could have provided a better pic for you, something recent..with a " say cheeese" smile in the face... <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/articleindex.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/articleindex.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I would like to thank you for allowing me to sharpen my computer skills...Still the brahmakumaris.info vs. .244 sockpuppet issue hasn't been resolved. I am looking forward to hear exactly how that is done. I can probably provide some help on it. Oh yeah, I would like to create another account as well to provide an accurate account of your latest defamations so we do not have to repeat the same things over and over every time you figure out how to delete the evidence. It could be: "bkinfowatch." A technical discussion on procedures to detect sockpuppet accounts could be added as well. The beauty of TCP/IP and open source.

I agree, I'm no fan of using words like "the Highest" where the word "God" would surfice. If Kranenboug is going to be cited then the language would need some serious de-flowering. So do you have NPOV issues with the article in it's current form rather than the version you are refering to which, as far as I can tell, is buried in a hail of revert-bullets now?

<dd>Thank you but, no.</dd>
<dd>a) the article has been torn to shreds mostly by folks who seemed to actually not know that much about the BKWSU, a whole lot of good stuff and accurate details were removed; the history and lifestyle details, for example.</dd>
<dd>b) we have a whole load more referenced and new stuff to add when it is opened back up.</dd>
<dd>c) we cannot confidently use the word "God". There is no evidence to suggest that the spirit entity involved here is "God", just that it is a spirit entity and that it is being channelled through mediums. The conception that the BKWSU has of "God" is so far at variance with all other world religions that it has to be clarified.</dd>
<dd>Sorry, but unless it is clarified, this has always been one of the whitewashed elements I have a problem with.</dd>

<dd>OK in response to each point above,</dd>
<dd>a) I am quite happy to see the article as it was ripped to shreds. As has been documented, there were serious issues with it in terms of uncited &amp; contentious statements, bias, sensationalism and an overall ridiculing tone to it. May it R.I.P.</dd>
<dd>b) Good that you have some references now. I don't have a problem with criticism documented in the article as long as it is NPOV. That means, however, that the article isn't just made up of citations cherry-picked to back up a certain POV. The fact is that the BKWSU isn't really <i>that</i> controversial and an NPOV article will reflect that. I suspect you will disagree with me on this.</dd>
<dd>c) I've read with interest your view on the BKs and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> both here and on your website forums. Interesting, but I think it is an opinion, and more than that, an opinion not shared by many others. You could say that the Christian concept God is "their God" since Christ is considered to be exclusively part of God in the sense of being one part of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>. By the same argument, you could say that any religion that doesn't consider Christ to be uniquely part of God in this way must have a different God. Let's not go there. I suggest that God is universally recognised as being conscient and pure Light, Love and other spiritual qualities in their pure and infinite form (from a BK perspective, that's "infinite" in terms of depth, not space). In this respect the BKs do not differ from other religions. And they also do not differ in the sense that most religions believe God spoke to them via a medium such as the prophet Mohamed or a burning bush etc. Not intending to start any religious wars here but just to say that it is appropriate and polite to give any religion credit for having an valid concept of God and not to belittle their beliefs just on the basis of their differences.</dd>

The article confirms the concern of cult watch groups, self-belief in being angels, problems created in family relationships and wrecked marriages and, financial controversies, the BKWSU spokesperson declining to comment (<b>rather than deny</b>) on allegations that it encourages followers to donate property and savings.</p>
<p>"<i>Once asked what she thought of the "BKs', Dwina replied: "They are living, walking angels on this earth. They can help us become angels too."</i>" It goes on to report that, "<i>The group is led by 90-year-old Indian spiritualist Dadi Janki, a woman Dwina regards as her guru and whom she consults, according to a source close to her, 'about everything'. Both Dwina and Robin make regular donations to Brahma Kumaris.</i>".</p>
<p>I note that these were all elements the BKWSU IT members have acted to remove. Feeling somewhat vindicated by this report, would the admins consider it fair now that they were reinstated?</p>

<dd>As the Evening Standard and Sunday Mail papers that published that article about Cherie Blair are considered “<a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid.html" title="Tabloid">tabloids</a>” it might be worth noting Wikipedia’s mention of tabloids as I don’t think that can be considered a trustworthy source for an encyclopedia:</dd>

<dd>"In its traditional sense, the term tabloid refers to a newspaper that tends to emphasise <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalism.html" title="Sensationalism">sensational</a> stories and which is suspected of or prone to creating its news if the publication's management believes that the subjects cannot, or will not, sue for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>. In this respect, much of the content of the tabloid press could be said to fall into the category of <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junk_food_news.html" title="Junk food news">junk food news</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Tabloid newspapers in Britain, collectively called the tabloid press, tend to be simply and sensationally written, and to give more prominence than broadsheets to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrities.html" title="Celebrities">celebrities</a>, sports, crime stories and even <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a>; they also more readily take a political position (either left- or right-wing) on news stories, ridiculing politicians, demanding resignations and predicting election results."</dd>

In the UK, a tabloid is like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_b09b.html" title="The Star">The Star</a>. It has a reading age of about 5 years old, with the requirement of a firm interest in breasts. So may be make that younger. The Mail is a proper newspaper and as such is governed by libel laws and duty of care. They could not print something with they had not confirmed and did not defend. You have the additional reported opinion of cult experts. It would say it supports the inclusion of a controversy section.

<dd>I would have thought the quality (or lack) of the article speaks for itself. The whole story is based on association. I'm sure there are plenty of "cult experts" around who are basically like hammers to whom just about any NRM you suggest to them looks like a nail. Actually I don't see why the BKs should be too bothered by the article. It's so overtly trashy that it can be safely filed under, "there's no such thing as bad publicity".</dd>

Wikipedia describes the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a> as a tabloid and "arguably the most right-wing" newspaper. That means they tend to support the opposition Conservative Party. Cherie Blair is the wife of the Labour Party prime minister. See any obvious conflict of interest there?</dd>

<dd>It is interesting to note that the article only tells half the story. It goes to great lengths to explain what are perceived to be Luis's shortcomings but completely fails to mention that 244 managed to get himself banned for making personal threats. If it is indeed 244 that is running that site and writing these articles then I guess that is not so surprising. Certainly the style seems quite similar to me. I notice an discussion thread about this issue has been posted already on the site (see bottom of page onwards) <a href="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/bb/viewtopic.php?t=18" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brahmakumaris.info/bb/viewtopic.php?t=18" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.</dd>

<p>I'm uneasy about using quotes attributed to people from an article in the Daily Mail - a UK tabloid (which had an attack agenda against the BKs in the concerning article) in the controversy section. However, I'm not going to delete it myself as it may be taken as a "disruptive" move by me. I'll leave it for other editors to decide. However, I have added a reference in the section that the quotes are from the Daily Mail - so the casual reader can make their own minds up about the veracity of the quotes. (I forgot to log-on when I made the change. Appledell 22:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear All, I have added a tag for "Original Research." in the controversy section. I have attempted to contact the paper cited without a response from editors. There is no mention of author nor qualifications from that source. If someone could provide this information, it would be appreciated. Best Wishes, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 14:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest we time out this paragraph and delete it within one week, that's on 20th Jan 2007. The article concerned has a clear agenda to try and make Cherie Blair look as daft as possible so obviously Dwina Gibb and BKs are made to look as dodgy as possible. They would obviously quote the most damning description they could find from the whoever would give it who could be presented as some kind of expert.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is also an article in a series <a href="http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=425471&amp;in_page_id=1770" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=425471&amp;in_page_id=1770" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=426927&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ito=1490" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=426927&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ito=1490" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, highlighting the Blair's association with the Gibbs. It is entirely possible that someone contacted the Daily Mail and suggested this interesting new angle to add to the series. I believe there is currently a campaign being waged against the BKs by contacting media and we sometimes come across other signs of this <a href="http://www.greenevents.co.uk/london/new-view.php?new_id=733" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greenevents.co.uk/london/new-view.php?new_id=733" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The nature of the accusations made and language used is always very distinctive even though the source is anonymous. I can read an article and get a hunch who's probably behind it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we actually have an obligation and are "are expected to convert the article from its present state based on original research and BK publications to an article containing verifiable information <b>based on <i>reliable</i> third party sources</b>." I think a week is fair enough time to allow for objections to deleting the text.</dd>

<dd>Thanks Luis, but the edit summary you used was maybe a bit inappropriate. Summaries like that have got you some rap in the past. It is actually OK for an editor to make changes without discussion. The problem we have is with this particular edit was that it was by an anonymous IP posting for the first time and it was a seemingly calculated, nonconstructive and provocative edit.

<dd>Formally, the movement does not have any ‘holy book'. Nevertheless, there is the so-called ‘Murli', a work that has originated since Lekh Raj received his messages.

Something that is a clear definition would be nice. "There is the so-called Murli" but what the heck is a Murli? Is it a book, a type of book, the name of a book? <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethie_02d0.html" title="User:Sethie">Sethie</a> 08:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But isn't "murti" something completely different to "murli"? As far as I am aware "murli" is a type of flute <a href="http://www.sursudha.com/bansuri.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sursudha.com/bansuri.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. In the context of the BKs, the delivered messages are likened to Krishna playing the "flute/murli of knowlege". Now all we need is a reference to say this. It probably says so in Adi Dev, though this is a primary source. I'll have a look.

<dd>Firstly, please stop attacking the other editors by making accusations like, "and you and your TEAM have in essence taken <b>Ownership</b> of the article". If you read the previous discussion you will see that I am in favour of a controversy section however a sensationalist story in a tabloid newspaper probably isn't the best source for it. Please read the previous discussion for the reasons why. Regards <a href="../../../b/k/s/User%7EBksimonb_ffe3.html" title="User:Bksimonb">Bksimonb</a> 17:43, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

Secondly, upon viewing a <a href="../../../c/n/n/Cnn.html" title="Cnn">cnn</a> article I would point out the clear conflict of interest as stated in this article about Microsoft <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/01/24/microsoft.wikipedia.ap/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/01/24/microsoft.wikipedia.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. As I said I am documenting all the activity and may well write some thing about it at a later date. If this is your "Official Position" so be it! As to the ownership yes, my contentions are that it is the case. As to you making a case of me "attacking" anyone, rest assured that I have thought this through as I see it a ruse to get me banned. I have placed a request for protection of another page and see that, that requested was given "little" response yet yours tend to have garnered a quick reply. So, as I said I will continue to document every thing and when you seek to have me banned I will request an advocate.PEACE<a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalkAbout_6f36.html" title="User:TalkAbout">TalkAbout</a> 19:25, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

Specifically, they introduce material that 244 was known to champion. Also the style of editing is consistent with how 244 was behaving just before arbitration.</p>

<p>It looks like the IP editor is the banned 195 editor, based on the style and content of the contributions (complaints about the BK IT team, correcting descriptions of the practices based on personal experience). However, the edits are coming from Japan, where 195 was in England, so it could be proxies (human or digital), but the result is the same. I can't block 6 different Japanese ISPs so the only choice is to semi-protect the article. You do need to be aware that a fair and accurate article should probably contain some description of negative reports of the group, so protection is not a license to ignore such contributions. Ideally, links to external sites and inclusion of negative material would be evaluated by editors who don't have a vested interest in either direction. Protection will expire automatically, I won't say exactly when, but if the 195-like IP edits return, post another notification to <a href="../../../a/e/_/WP%7EAE_df73.html" title="WP:AE">WP:AE</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 08:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Riveros, unless user:TalkAbout has identified him or herself openly, please do not divulge what you believe to be that person's name (or make a game of going half way, as you appear to have done). Much of your comment is a borderline personal attack and is inappropriate. All editors need to work together in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation, and playing word games and making insults does not accomplish this goal. I would also suggest you review <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Sathya_Sai_Baba_2_Proposed_decision_f967.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sathya Sai Baba 2/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sathya Sai Baba 2/Proposed decision</a>.

<dd>Actually this article needs editors who are neither BK nor xBK. So they are most welcome here. Having said that, an overtly pro or anti POV in itself about a subject can be a conflict of interest. Probably a lot more so than simple affiliation with the BKs. I'm as curious as anyone about what is behind the hostility I am seeing expressed here towards BKs but at the same time I would really appreciate more input from sober, "detached" editors&#160;:-) Regards <a href="../../../b/k/s/User%7EBksimonb_ffe3.html" title="User:Bksimonb">Bksimonb</a> 19:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Bksimonb, It would be nice to have that kind of input. However, historically in this article, you had one side (pro-BK) or the other (against BK) even editors self-proclaimed "non-Bks/non-ex Bks" are one sided and realistically I do not see anyone whithout a "vested interest" to spend the kind of time which is needed to contribute here. For that reason, I am very curious as well as to why someone like TalkAbout is so intent in defaming BK with such passion... I wonder....

<dd>Dear Talkabout. May I request that we only discuss the article, not the subject here. I consider your view on detachment to be a gross, and seemingly provocative, misinterpretation of BK beliefs. That is, it appears to me to be flamebait. If you look at the talk history you'll see I almost bit the bait too! These ranting attacks are really not conducive to creating an atmosphere where any development of the article can take place. Wikipedia is really not the place for activist campaigns or for fighting battles. It's a time-consuming headache for the admins that are trying to manage this situation and the other editors that are trying to fend off the guerrilla tactics.

I wouldn't be that sensitive if it were not for <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a>'s incessant hostility towards me and (since you seem to be the only one that has hinted that he should settle down) I thought I should protest early so it wouldn't go further. Thank you and I did leave your entry in when replacing the cited material.

TalkAbout, any registered user may make changes to the article. Anonymous editors may either register, or make suggestions here and post {{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">editprotected</a>}}, which places a notification to admins that there is a request to have an edit made. I'm reasonably sure that the recent anonymous edits were made by the person, or at the behest of the person, who used to post from 195, and who is banned from wikipedia for a year. Protection seems a better response than getting the habit of reverting every anonymous editor. Reliable negative information should be inlcuded in the article. Jossi's list of sources <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Brahma_Kumaris_Evidence_1067.html#Evidence_presented_by_third_party_jossi_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs.29" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Brahma Kumaris/Evidence">here</a> should be useful, and his comments were pretty smart, too.

<p>Is this section really needed? Once started, where does it end? I'm not sure if it adds much in terms of the sum of knowledge about the BKs and I can understand why it would just be seen as an ad for the BKs. Appledell ~~</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Appledell; Thatcher131 mentioned that "some negative stuff should be in this article as well." If that is the case, to make it a balanced article then positive stuff should be there as well. After all, this is about informing about BK to the public. If there is something recent, something which anyone can see by themselves, to make their own opinion, why not? Brahma Kumaris works in different countries as well, as I said before; this is not about India and the UK alone.</dd>
<dd>Besides, it is something which anyone could check with an internet connection. It is not a gossip from a tabloid nor a non-reliable source. If anything that looks positive is considered an advertisement, isn't "negative stuff" another form of an advertisement? Then, take away the negative and the positive.

<dd>Err. Two wrongs don't make a right (three lefts do!). This is definitely a flyer. Consider the sentence, "This program is webcasted in order to assure greater participation." How relevant will this statement be after the event? I suggest that if we have a section listing projects that it just takes a list form and a link to the website concerned without saying any more about it.

<p>Dear All, Please take a look at the history of the article. User 244 has been making several changes with his sockpuppet account. TalkAbout is no less.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately that Wikipedia will allow things like this to happen, specially after going through arbitration. It seems like the power to enforce is lacking.... and then you wonder: These same individuals are good about giving "shrimat" to others..."Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"

Secondly, I did leave <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESome_people_b091.html" title="User:Some people">Some people</a> a message on both his/her talk page (not too receptive) and mine. Thirdly, let me tell you how one time a bot came along after a vandal and did multitude of little corrections and I was stuck reverting the vandal and re-inserting all the little corrections. So, my point is that you should remove the edit in question <b>with good reason</b> and leave the others alone.

<p>Dear TalkAbout, You are right .. you are not a sockpuppet account; however, please make your additions using a current discussed version.

<dd>Dear Sister Double "T": Please do not be so touchy...stay relaxed, Ok? There are no personal attacks here. Firstable, it is obvious that user "some people" it is your old friend 244. That user have been banned. He is unwilling to comply with his "sentence." He is acting in a dishonest way. There is no obligation for us, editors to accept his changes. You are acting desperately and dishonest as well. Use a "good version" of the article. Do not wait for 244 to make all the changes and then you make yours, and use that opportunity to complain about me, when I revert to the last "good version" obviously your changes will be gone as well. As I said, use a "good" version... There is no need for you to go through so much pain and agony, sister... You know, 244 is "some people" do you? I am surprised admins have not taken action yet...Are you familiar with american and spanish sayings? No?? Look at the deeper meaning of those. Obviously, you are not a dog or a mosquito.

<dd>If TalkAbout agrees with the edits made by 244 she can make them. Your behavior is also a problem. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=103962279&amp;oldid=103872115" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=103962279&amp;oldid=103872115" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you reverted across over 30 edits by three different people, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=103962279&amp;oldid=103152124" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=103962279&amp;oldid=103152124" rel="nofollow">here</a> you reverted across 57 edits with almost no changes preserved. The best practice would be for TalkAbout to revert the 244 editor <i>and then</i> to carefully re-add those parts of 244's edits that conform to editorial policy. Remember that the key issues at this point include no original research. Adding material based on your own knowledge of the movement and your own interpretation of documents you have seen is original research. Clearly, people interpret the movement's documents differently. The 244 editor seemed to be interested in adding interpretations of the movement's documents that made them seem more dangerous or crazy. All editors must adhere to the policy of reliable sources. You may describe what other investigators, religious scholars, reporters, and so forth have said about the movement. If you do not have an outside <b>reliable</b> source (and not just someone's web site, either positive or negative) then you can't add the material. If 244 has some good sources then TalkAbout can use them. If 244 is just re-adding his personal determinations, then TalkAbout should not support them. If the editors here keep edit warring and can not learn proper use of reliable sources and the no original research policy, the arbitration case may be reopened and additional sanctions applied.

<dd>Dear Thatcher131. I am concerned that allowing 244 to continue to edit via a sockpuppet if supported by a sympathetic editor is sending out the completely wrong message. The changes that 244 has made in the last few hours were very far reaching and it seems they have just been rubber-stamped. I would be disappointed if it is really this easy to circumvent the arb com ruling. I would feel more comfortable if banned from editing really did mean what it said.

<dd>Dear Thatcher131, I am afraid you are not behaving consistently here. User 244 has been banned. You blocked him for 24 hrs because he used his sockpuppet account "Some people" .. Now, He comes back again using the same account to make his changes and ... everything is fine!! The second edit which you claim is a problem on my behavior, it is my own revised change after we had a discussion here on this page. I am suspicious now that things are not being handled as they should. Yes, I will request for re-openning of this case if necessary and I will request for a member of the ArbComm to take a look at this. I wonder if there is any other admin here besides you. So far, all the requests we have made for checking 244 have been ignored or delayed. (and that is not only my requests.)</dd>
<dd>Briefly: 244 is not supposed to post here. Then TalkAbout cannot use his posts under "Some people" to add a new version of the article. See, it is logical.</dd>

If this is the finding then I will adhere to your decision and monitor this. All I did in relation the the editing was checking what was being added and even left a message about the edits on the user's talk page. I would like to state that I am using my own sources/books which I am now able to read. My issue with <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> is his blanket removal of my edits which are of well sourced and his continued personal attacks. Now, in fairness <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> should be made aware that it is common for other editors to clean-up others work...there are even BarnStars for this type of editing.

At the time of Riveros' first complaint about the IP editors I was not convinced about Some people, I have become more convinced over time. That's not "official" in the sense of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_infallibility.html" title="Papal infallibility">Papal infallibility</a>, for example.

In general, banned users are not allowed to contribute, and the edits of banned users may be reverted by anyone. There is nothing against reinstating the edits of a banned user under your own name; if there was, lots of articles would be frozen forever. But, when you edit the article you take responsibility for your own edits, whatever they are. Riveros needs to be careful about his reverting, that he does not assume that every anti-BK editor is 244. That judgement should be left to an independent party. Also, Riveros should not revert other editors' edits; that's just edit warring and is subject to sanction if it goes too far. Discuss edits on the talk page, please. Edits that derive from unreliable sources should be removed, but it is better to discuss it first rather than start reverting.

<p>Dear Thatcher131, I will consider this paragraph:"Riveros needs to be careful about his reverting, that he does not assume that every anti-BK editor is 244. That judgement should be left to an independent party. Also, Riveros should not revert other editors' edits; that's just edit warring and is subject to sanction if it goes too far.

Edit summaries are not a substitute for discussion. Thatcher131 15:35, 29 January 2007 (UTC)"</p>
<p>1. Please take a look at the history of the article. It was totally reverted last night. Not even 24 hours ago. User "Some people" hasn't participated here since 244 was banned. You are not the only one who can get "convinced" over time by the "modus operandi" of 244 and "Some people." The only difference between you and I, is that you make the call at this point. However, as I said before if "some people" can make a revert with 30 + posts in 12 hours without sharing a word here...is that considered OK by your standards? 244 has deep animosity towards Brahma Kumaris. He has the time to post that here. It is his life quest. Any other sensible user wouldn't be here trying as hard as him. and No.. I do not think that every user who posts against Brahma Kumaris is 244. But certainly, "Some people" is him.(even you have suggested that) 2. I have made a post myself "Current activities Worldwide." I do not see that header now. Perhaps TalkAbout has some special powers with you which I am not aware of. She complains about her posts being erased, how about mine? How about the other editors? Neither TalkAbout nor "Some People" gave us the chance for rebuttal. 3. Edit war. You seem too loose here. TalkAbout has been doing that as well as "Some people." But for some reason you like to pick on Riveros. Consider that.</p>
<p>4.Consider this: "Discuss edits on the talk page, please. Edits that derive from unreliable sources should be removed, but it is better to discuss it first rather than start reverting." Did "Some people" and "TalkAbout" followed that? Or that is conveniently from "now on"?</p>
<p>5.Finally, the outcome is that the article has been totally reverted in the last 12 hours. "Some people", "Talk About" and even Andries were there, does it ring a bell to you? I request this article be reverted to the way it was yesterday, January 28th after I made my changes in the header (Current Worldwide activities) I added after discussing it here. TalkAbout could make her edits on that version and she could give us the opportunity to discuss here as you pointed out. 24 hours to do that is fair. Otherwise I will be forced to bring this issue to the ArbComm and perhaps request a review of this article and its new "players." Thatcher131, I trust in your sense of fairness and goodwill.

<dd>All editors are expected to behave themselves according to our standards of community accepted behavior. The fact that some editors do not discuss their changes on the talk page does not give other editors license to do the same. When you reverted Some people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=103962279&amp;oldid=103961612" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=103962279&amp;oldid=103961612" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you also reverted several of TalkAbout's edits. One way to deal with the situation is, rather than reverting, try and remove poorly sourced content added by Some people without removing TalkAbout's. Another way of handling it would be to apologize to TalkAbout: I'm sorry that I had to revert your work as well, but Some people is a banned user, and it was too hard to separate your edits from his. Go ahead and add your stuff back." A third way of dealing with it would be to negotiate with the other editors on the talk page before making any changes. Try and propose compromise language, or point out sections that are original research rather than reporting what other reliable sources have said.</dd>
<dd>I see some good things and some bad things in the difference between Riveros' preferred version and the current version. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=104150938&amp;oldid=103971111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;diff=104150938&amp;oldid=103971111" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> Good things include more use of academic published sources. Bad things include direct use of BK sources, and the possible reliance on Dr. Walliss' web site. (I would need to study this more). There seem to be long passages of church documents or scriptures quoted in footnotes without corresponding citations, I would tend to remove this. "He had a vision of XXX" should be footnoted with a source confirming this, it is not necessary and probably excessive to quote the vision at length). In general, using church documents and other original sources to make a new argument is original research and not allowed. If a reliable source has described the BK beliefs his description can be used as a source instead. No one should really add or remove stuff just because they don't like it. If material is acceptable per editorial policies, then it becomes a question of the judgement of the editors as to how far to go in any given situation, which should be worked out first on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 21:59, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Dear Thatcher131, Thank you for your reply. I suggest you spend more time looking at the problem and the issues before responding so quickly. The issue here is that a user reverted a post I had for a week after discussion. Whether that post has BK sources or not is not the issue. The issue is: it was deleted whitout letting me know about it. It is obvious you have not seen the note I left to TalkAbout in one of my reverted versions:<b>"01:06 29 January 2007 (talkAbout: You can add your links here. Do not be dishonest by using 244's versions. See discussion)"</b> I am sorry I did not use such an apologetic language as you suggest, but the space in that box is not big enough sometimes. TalkAbout ignored the suggestion by pretending not knowing who I was referring to.</p>
<p>Perhaps a history of the page from the time it was changed by "Some people" could help to refresh our minds: 23:47 28 Jan Some people - 23:49 28 Jan TalkAbout - 23:56 28 Jan Some people - 00:00 29 Jan TalkAbout - She added her things for the next 20 minutes. until I reverted to previous version at 00:24 29 Jan - 5 minutes later TalkAbout reverted. 5 minutes later I reverted with a note to her. Evidently most of the changes had been done by "Some People" at the time of my first revert.</p>
<p>There is a concerted effort here to change things in synchrony, which the history of the article could easily show. There are some things which I do not understand in your post: "No one should really add or remove stuff just because they don't like it." Can you add stuff here that you don't like? - I don't recall using Dr. Waliss's website as well but rather papers he sent me via email which I posted for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Thatcher131, there is a lot to be desired about your neutrality here. It is unfortunate but I have no option but to do as I said I would, of course; backed up by the resources I have already collected. Will start working on it from tomorrow on. Very Best, <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiveros11_6019.html" title="User:Riveros11">avyakt7</a> 01:17, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
