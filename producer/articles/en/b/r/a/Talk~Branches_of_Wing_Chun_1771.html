<p>I would like to begin by saying that I am a practioner of Ving Tsun Kung Fu for nearly five years, and that I agree with the depiction of the article, especially in regards to describing the system. Now, as the article within states, Wing Chun may stem from assassination techniques for fighting and most definately the economy of movement, but to the Westerner, is efficiency the aim with being a practioner of martial arts? Since martial arts originate out need rather than desire, the initial purpose is for practicality. In modern society, one will have few uses for fighting techniques that demand cutthroat efficiency. After all, you can seriously injure someone. Therefore, it may be important to transform and evolve your Kung Fu or whatever into an expression of oneself rather than an art of killing. But in doing this, does one lose the potency of the traditional uses of Kung Fu and thereby lose some philosophical potency as well? It may be a toss up. Bruce Lee may have been trying to find a balance between all of these martial arts while many masters of Kung Fu say that a single martial art requires two and a half lives to fully understand it. Much of this debate comes down to specialization and differentation, which is the core of both Western and Eastern ideologies. This has been at the core of my inquistion of the martial arts for years; I am anxious to see other opinions.</p>

<p>The listings under Yip Man are getting way way to crowded. Its getting border line personal advertisement, and there's simply no need for it. It would be simply beyond the scope of this entry to list every single generation of student everyone has on down the line. I'm proposing limiting it to three generations (meaning the student of yip, their student, and grandstudent if applicable). --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 20:57, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought about that, and I can see arguments for and against. Probably the most dramatic precedent for this sort of thing is the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay_people.html" title="List of gay people">List_of_gay_people</a>. If this becomes an unmanagable size, we should do what you suggest and keep generations 1-3 for this article, but we can somehow link elsewhere to "practitioners of Wing Chun (Yip Man 4th generation and below)". It isn't really that heavy promotion (it isn't like they all have biographies or links) but the benifit can be quite tangible when people discover Grand Sijo Nick Riviera is really a 5th generation student. I say don't remove information, but stub it off somewhere else if it is bothering you. It's a shame that I can't find any sort of TREE structure in wiki, a family tree template would solve this. Unless you want to lose hours trying to work out how to format it, maybe just let it be for now. <a href="../../../r/p/f/User%7ERpf_84da.html" title="User:Rpf">Rpf</a> 14:07, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Really, its up to the individual if still living. If not, then you have to list them in their multiple linneages (unless they themselves didn't want to acknowledge it). Having multiple sifu's and linneages is a pretty common occurance in modern days, not so much historically though. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 17:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't consider this option, but I don't like it for a simple reason that you can probably guess. It's common to learn under 1 sifu for the majority, then briefly under your Sigung. If I study under Sammy Kwok for 6 years ,then visit Ip Chun for a year, surely it is inflating my credentials. In fact, sometimes its the diffrence between being pruned for depth and not being pruned for depth...Even if you don't mind, it's still unencyclopedic. I vote a short blurb at the beginning explaining that lineage will be assigned by where the majority of training was undertaken, but in modern times it is common for cross pollenation.<a href="../../../r/p/f/User%7ERpf_84da.html" title="User:Rpf">Rpf</a> 23:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a different situation you're describing - you're talking about learning under multiple people within the same branch/linneage. I can understand and somewhat agree what you're saying for that specific circumstance. However, applying your idea across the board would not be correct for people who've had multiple sifu's across different branches/linneages/systems of Wing Chun. I've I've learned within Tsui Shun Tin's linneage lets say, and Moy Yat's, I have sifu's in both and neither one supercedes the other. If I've learned under multiple sifu's in just Tsui Shun Tni's or just Moy Yat's, I could see your idea. But I'd also say that if anything, that approach is unencyclopedic and not the other way around. In an encyclopedic biography, if I lived in multiple cities or went to multiple places for school, those individual places are listed. Even if its just "so and so attended St. John's University in such and such year, but went on to St. Eugenes to graduate in blah blah blah". Not just ignore that part of them because they actually only graduated from one. In Wing Chun, a good (and contrvercial) example is Leung Ting. Regardless of the whole student of Yip Man controversy, he still had two other sifu's that are listed in his biography and who he's routinely listed under in family trees. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 04:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if somebody has had a number of different Sifu's, regardless of branch, it's still the most objective to choose the Sifu with the longest exposure. If it's a tie between a couple, fine list them under both. If they have had a dozen, then it is misleading to associate them with a branch anyway and common sense must prevail! Perhaps a section for the "mixed branches", where some guy teaches William Cheung, Gu Lo and Yip man versions (for random example&#160;;P ) The Leung Ting case I believe is pretty clear cut: longest a student of Yip Man's school taught primarily by Leung Sheung, and private lessons for a much shorter time under Yip Man (if this isn't the case, then perhaps list under both). -- <a href="../../../r/p/f/User%7ERpf_84da.html" title="User:Rpf">Rpf</a> 02:26, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely not. Trees aren't done on "length of study", they're done to represent "study" and "affiliation". Leung Ting is traditionally, in any publicized tree, listed under all three. Bruce Lee, for example, is listed under Yip, Wong, and William. There's other examples as well. The function of a family tree listing is not to promote the sort of stuff you're calling for, and never has been. Duration and other specifics are covered within an entry/biography of the person themselves.--<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 17:20, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't be diplomatic for its own sake, at least not on here. An encyclopedia couldn't care less what the individual believes is their own affiliation. You seem to be implying that there are no standards whatsoever when drawing up a tree. If that is the case, this article does not belong in an encyclopedia because it is never verifiable. NPOV is in direct contradiction with any idea of "it is up to the individual" (or, for that matter, any student of that individual agreeing).</dd>

I'm putting it back. <a href="../../../r/p/f/User%7ERpf_84da.html" title="User:Rpf">Rpf</a> 02:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your own position is what's not NPOV, stating "Don't be diplomatic" is a prime example. An encyclopedia cares about the relationsip period, not on an individual's personal agenda to push someone's importance down. NPOV dictates if there's a recognized student/teacher relationship, they are of that linneage, regardless of length. And the very resources you posted verified that. Nobody is stating X went to a seminar and is claiming to be a student, these are all well established people we're talking about. You're twisting words around as usual, the "up to the individual" was in reference to if they want to still be listed under a linneage or teacher they left. Family trees, in any book, reference, or source, are *always* about study and affiliation. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 03:57, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NPOV dictates nothing of the sort, YOU dictate that. If it is your personal opinion that branch should be decided by a personal teacher/student relationship, you are entitled to it, but you need to give a good justification for that belief. If you can point to a good reference in the "literature" that that is the best definition, then fine. Given your standing as a Sifu organising those love-in seminars, I was going to take your word for it. Problem is that your attitude has been one of ownership of articles, which begins to grate if you do it without adequate justification.</dd>
<dd>You can assume I have an agenda until steam comes out your ears, but that has no bearing on facts. The simple facts are
<ul>
<li>I believe that this article should be based on majority of training time. This is arbitrary but I feel this is common sense for the reasons I have outlined (you, btw, have not given an alternative that makes much sense, or at least is quoted somewhere reputable)</li>
<li>If you are going to rv something, it's unreasonable to expect people to accept it just because you say so.</li>
<li>Leung Ting was primarily a student of Leung Sheung. This is not a bad thing and to say that is putting importance down is silly. You were the one happily culling students &gt; 3rd generation.</li>
<li>The vast majority of readers will need to be alerted to just what decides assigning lineage. An article in an encyclopedia should be authoritative and justified, backed up by facts.</li>

<dd>Actually no, NPOV dictates you take a neutral stance. I.E. the word NEUTRAL. Your stance and attitude ("Don't be diplomatic", "love-in seminars") is not. Period, no matter what spin you want to try and put on it. A <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_tree.html" title="Family tree">family tree</a> is based on affiliation, not years. That's how a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_tree.html" title="Family tree">family tree</a> listing is structured. Period. My attitude has been one of trying to promote a neutral stance instead of the political bickering. Your stance on Leung Ting is a political one, period. If you are missrepresenting that he studied with 3 different sifus for your own personal whim, that is political. (Just as you are trying to missrepresent the "culling" of depth from the branch for presentation purposes and the "non self-promotion" wiki policy). I have not needed to give an alternative, because I have been presenting the standard, which you asked for in your first question. All martial family trees, whether in books (of which there are plenty), periodicals, etc. (here's several random websites <a href="http://www.wingchun.com/yipline.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wingchun.com/yipline.html" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="http://www.hchwingchun.com.au/lineage.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hchwingchun.com.au/lineage.htm" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="http://home.vtmuseum.org/genealogy/chi_sim/family_tree.php" class="external text" title="http://home.vtmuseum.org/genealogy/chi_sim/family_tree.php" rel="nofollow">3</a>, <a href="http://www.sifugrados.com/sifamilytree.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.sifugrados.com/sifamilytree.shtml" rel="nofollow">4</a>, <a href="http://www.martialartinstitute.com/family_tree.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.martialartinstitute.com/family_tree.htm" rel="nofollow">5</a>,)to this date, have been based on affiliation. They're meant to denote a relationship, i.e. a claim to that linneage. Not how long. If you are going to change something because you feel it makes sense to your opinion even though it goes against the standard, its unreasonable to expect people to accept it because it meets your whim. Leung Ting had three Sifu's. Even the article you posted as a reference has Wang Kiu stating that. There is no need to assume an agenda, when your entire outlook in every thread has always been confrontation of standards, accusations, and rv'ing until you're blue in the face (or very likely red). And when you can't get your way you do things like sign in from multiple anonymous ip's (that all trace back to your location) to delete the wingchunkuen.com link for example. Very bluntly, this is not a matter of opinion, this is a matter of *fact*. <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_tree.html" title="Family tree">Family trees</a> *are* done to chart out affiliations. Always have been. You're the one that seems to need the special explination, nobody else has needed this. If it makes you feel better to add the dates he was with each person, such as (19xx - 19xx) after his name in the branch entry, that by all means is acceptable. Though, as is shown in the wiki definition, is normally done in literal "family" tree charts (such as to show the years a family member was born and died). Just make sure you have actual references to state the years and that there's no conflicting evidence, otherwise both will have to be stated to avoid NPOV issues. --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 18:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad you're seeing some sense by conceding at least training time in that "affiliation" should be specified at least somehow. Now, in less than 6000 words, can you give me one credible source outlining the convention in assigning lineage in a kung fu family tree? The links you gave me were examples of trees and, without detailed investigation, demonstrate very little on how the convention should work. This is not a wacko anti-Ting agenda (it's not like I'm trying to push that stupid photo thing is it?), I just find it all a bit misleading ((for the record, those other IP's were REAL PEOPLE disagreeing with you, not me. Ask a mod if you like)). In any case, more should be outlined at the beginning of the article (more than what you just added). The convention you describe would be more relevant to the mentoring, one-on-one, "Kill Bill"/"Karate Kid", type affiliation, but as you said this is a thing of the past. -- <a href="../../../r/p/f/User%7ERpf_84da.html" title="User:Rpf">Rpf</a> 13:00, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I said no such thing, I said if it makes you happy I'm willing to compromise by having you put dates of study by their names, even though its not commonly done. Please show a large swatch of examples of martial arts linneage trees where dates are used for anything other than birth and death. The convention for using family trees is very clear and well established, whether it was the exact definition here on Wiki I provided, or the several random examples that clearly illustrate it in use, all very credible and well established (of which I can provide many, many more from periodicals, books, and websites). The fact is that its you that has to establish credibility for your opinion and desire to change standards, rather than just continuing to spit out sarcasm and point the finger at others. And one to one mentoring relationships *is* whats being described in a linneage tree, you're listing a mentor/teacher relationship. In the case of teacher/student relationship trees (unlike a literal family tree), you can have more than one teacher. And that's not the case with the ip's, or you're saying that all of them (124.168.6.140, 203.217.81.242, 203.217.71.84, 203.217.69.27, 203.10.77.190) are not originating through the same location, Sydney, Australia? --<a href="../../../w/g/u/User%7EWgungfu_95f9.html" title="User:Wgungfu">Marty Goldberg</a> 17:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not going to pay for 2 different ISP's (or login repeatedly from a friends house) just for a few wiki revert wars. iinet.com.au isn't my ISP. As I said, a mod can verify that I don't login from that ISP. Looks like at least one other Australian agrees with me. Save your reverse DNS awesomeness.</dd>

<dd>I don't think any convention is clear OR well established. Most of this stuff isn't. The "Sifu" system is a total shambles. It's gotten so ridiculous that people are calling themselves "Sijo" left right and centre (I can think of at least 2 explicit, 1 implicit) and the stupidity of whether someone should be called "Great Grandmaster" v.s "Grandmaster" is even worse. There are no sanctioning bodies to control any of this. And one-on-one mentoring relationships can't be what is being talked about. Using the Yip Man example, the school had dozens of students at any one time, so it was more like one-to-30. To make matters worse, his longest students would teach most of the classes, while Yip Man was out the back. The point remains that "what is a branch of Wing Chun" needs a seperate section at the beinning of the article. -- <a href="../../../r/p/f/User%7ERpf_84da.html" title="User:Rpf">Rpf</a> 23:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
