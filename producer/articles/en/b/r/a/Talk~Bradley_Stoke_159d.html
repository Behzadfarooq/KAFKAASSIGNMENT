<p>The nickname 'Sadly Broke' is well known in the Bristol area and residents of Bradley Stoke. It can be considered to be an identifying feature of the development, which history recalls, was troubled by financial crisis in its early years. Therefore it is justified to include the "Sadly Broke" reference. It is a neutral statement that is not particularly offensive to any of the residents since it refers not to them but the financial difficulties of the original developers, which coincided with the late 80s property crash.</p>
<p>Comments please on whether you think it is valid to include this reference.</p>

<p>Dunk, the test is would you be startled to see this passage in Britannica or En Carta. I certainly would.<br />
However, please revert because I know I can't make you understand.<br />

<p>Who says <i>we</i> are trying to create an encyclopedia that is just like Britannica or En Carta. I believe the WP mandate can go far beyond that. Adding something that creates a bit of humour to an article, rather than a completely dry piece of prose, can add to the interest in the topic and should not be reverted on your principle.</p>
<p>The point is factually correct and non-offensive. Why should it be removed? --<a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunk_b3f3.html" title="User:Dunk">Dunk</a> 17:52, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I <b>support</b> you. Although it was designed for humour and to possibly offend, it is light-hearted and forms part of the (short) history of the area. I don't see any obection to it. WP is different to "Britannica" or "En Carta" from the fact it is a community, and should be editable by all, I feel to compare it to such encyclopedic forms is unfair, <a href="../../../w/h/a/WP%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_95f8.html" title="WP:What Wikipedia is not">WP:What Wikipedia is not</a> states how it is not a paper-encyclopedia, and I feel this may be an example of that. However if this comment were to be seen as offencive by others, it's removal could be considered. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13">Ian</a> <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan13_e2ae.html" title="User talk:Ian13">13</a> 20:12, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree it should be in there. In fact it might have been me that added it to the page originally... There's a wider point to be made here, apart from its historical veracity, that WP is not Brittanica, etc, all of which are very good reasons. There seems to be a tendency for people here to mistake interesting trivia, unusual writing styles, etc as POV, somehow. As a result there is a trend for articles to become more and more bland and dull over time, as new contribuors change things simply to eradicate these quirks, which overall do not alter the factual content of an article, only its style. I call it 'blandification' and I see it many articles. I think it should be resisted, though it's pretty difficult at times. If something is genuinely POV, or factually incorrect, by all means it should be changed - but simply changing a particular choice of words to another choice to eliminate more interesting language seems to me perverse and detrimental to the project. WP does not need to be dry. WP does not need to be a dull list of facts. All WP needs to be is true, and well-written. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 22:01, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I myself am relatively new to editing with an account at Wikipedia, but as long as interesting styles and facts are accurate, I feel it can only expand knowledge on a subject. I feel there is a great lession to be learnt. WP is very mixed in editors, but as long as it is accurate, I love it. Shame power corupts, and I <i>think</i> it may be the same here (just a hint). <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13">Ian</a> <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan13_e2ae.html" title="User talk:Ian13">13</a> 21:42, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I give in, but continue to disagree with the comments above. Firstly, I don't know how much that "sadly broke" name was used. I live only 5 miles from Bradley Stoke but, at the time, never heard the phrase used, Secondly, it <i>does</i> sound jokey and silly, whether the enclopedia is on or off line. However, I'll leave it there under protest - <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 15:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It was recently (well, 3 months ago) mentioned on a BBC National News article, as the nickname for badley stoke, when they were discussing falling house prices and rising interest rates. Also before that time, when I visited reletives in north england, they managed to pick up on the name, so it is quite well used. But I can see why it would sound inapproate. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13">Ian13</a> <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan13_e2ae.html" title="User talk:Ian13">(speak!)</a> 20:47, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely the point is the link refers to Bradley Stoke and is thus a genuine Bradley SAtoke article - it doesn't matter one iota how many links off google it's got - my final word anyway as it's unbelieveably petty this whole discussion IMHO.

<p>[From the anon user making the edits[ Thanks Nige. I think the site adds to the article, and despite what Ian is claiming, it is clearly a new news site, despite the fact it is run in Blogger. The definition of a site should not be down to the tools used to create it. The addition does no harm.</p>
<p>Also, Ian, the site was down due to vandalism of the Telewest network according to its homepage. I think *that* is a petty excuse to have a go at it if ever I saw one. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.12.20.181 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.12.20.181.html" title="User talk:84.12.20.181">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.12.20.181_8fea.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.12.20.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Ian, again: Three users got involved in the Examiner debate, two said keep it, you said take it down. I think this means it should stay. When you say in the edit 'no objections raised', I think there were actually TWO objections raised to removing it. I don't understand your logic to removing it when clearly there were more people - albeit a small number - who said it should remain. Please explain why you have once again acted without backing to remove it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There were no objections to my views raised in the big bulleted list above (and still isn't), and as it stands one anon and one newish registered user have expressed concerns (who was highly uncivil and swore), no other long-term editors to the page (or content adders) have. To save my time, I quote from above:

<p>I noticed that someone changed the article to say that Bradley Stoke is a town, rather than a large housing estate, but this was reverted pretty much immediately by <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13">Ian13</a> without any explaination why. So, what is the status of the place? It has a town council, doesn't this make it a town? What does everyone think? <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGasheadsteve_2c86.html" title="User:Gasheadsteve">Gasheadsteve</a> 11:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am also happy with it being called a town. I really should have added some explanation, however this article is quite inactive. The things I had a problem with were "new" since articles are designed to not reflect a relative time frame since we try and make it usable for the future without modification. I also disagreed with "PostalTown= BRADLEY STOKE". Postal Town is based on the prefix to the postcode, and BS is Bristol, and hence should be shown as such. The word large was also removed, and although this could have been better explained, compared to others at the time it was built, it is very large. Since I felt "purpose-built town" and "large <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing_estate.html" title="Housing estate">housing estate</a>" were pretty much interchangeable, a blanket revert didn't seem to out of place at the time. Feel happy to address any of these issues I have stated, or refer to it as "purpose-built town". Hope this clears it up. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13"><span style="color:#067"><u>Ian</u>¹³</span></a><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan13_e2ae.html" title="User talk:Ian13"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">/t</span></a> 16:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for replying, I agree that 'a new purpose-built town' sounds a bit silly, after all it's not like places become towns accidently, they are all purpose built.&#160;:) Maybe we should just stick to 'a town in South Gloucestershire'. I know about all about post towns now, thanks to having to check 12,000 of them on a database in work, and you're absolutely right about that, the post town is Bristol. <a href="../../../g/a/s/User%7EGasheadsteve_2c86.html" title="User:Gasheadsteve">Gasheadsteve</a> 17:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just noticed this one - are we sure that Bradley Stoke is served by Gloucestershire Fire Brigade? (see links on the right of the main page).</p>
<p>Looking here: <a href="http://www.avonfirebrigade.gov.uk/stn_locator.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.avonfirebrigade.gov.uk/stn_locator.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.avonfirebrigade.gov.uk/stn_locator.asp</a> seems to suggest we're in Avon Fire &amp; Rescue's patch.

<dd>I think this was autogenerated because of the Glos county - I've changed it. Do you think the same applies to any surrounding areas?— <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodw_1052.html" title="User:Rodw">Rod</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodw_6741.html" title="User talk:Rodw">talk</a></sup> 18:16, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it does - Avon F&amp;R's area goes up as far as the South Gloucs border. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.185.240.120_1ced.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.185.240.120">132.185.240.120</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/2/User_talk%7E132.185.240.120.html" title="User talk:132.185.240.120">talk</a>) 12:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Thanks - can you name the areas likely to be affected so we can change the Fire &amp; Rescue entry in the infoboxes? — <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodw_1052.html" title="User:Rodw">Rod</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodw_6741.html" title="User talk:Rodw">talk</a></sup> 13:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Rod. It's basically all the areas in South Gloucestershire. I had a quick check around - Longwell Green/Filton didn't have info but Thornbury had just Template:Fire so that needs to be amended.</dd>
