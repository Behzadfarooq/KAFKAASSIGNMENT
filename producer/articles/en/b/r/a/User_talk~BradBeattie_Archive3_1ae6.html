<dd>Image as requested. It's uploaded as a PNG as JPEG doesn't support transparency. The edges might have a little harshness to them as the image I was working with wasn't really high-res.

<dd>Apologies. It was a quick reaction to the prod being removed with no edit summary. I see at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html#Conflicts" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD#Conflicts</a> that even in that case the prod should not be restored.

<dd>It is a common and understandable reaction. However, since the admin processing the expired PRODs will nominate the article at AFD instead of deleting it, it will only slow down deletion of the article.

<p>Oops, sorry for the dolphin mistake. Sometimes I do jump the gun a little. Probably because I use a combo of VP, Vandal Fighter, and Popups. I forget where I'm at on occasion. Then there's the factor that <b>need</b> to be on secure pages on <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/" class="external free" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/" rel="nofollow">https://secure.wikimedia.org/</a> or I get involuntarily booted out of my account.

<dd>Good afternoon Brad, or should I say <i>konishiwa</i> as you appear to be in Tokyo as I type this? I have reviewed your last five hundred edits in the user Talk and Wikipedia spaces, as they are the areas that I made a particular point of noting at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FBradBeattie&amp;diff=82289846&amp;oldid=82287580" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FBradBeattie&amp;diff=82289846&amp;oldid=82287580" rel="nofollow">your RfA</a>. My particular concerns were to do with warning vandals and justifying your opinions on XfD discussions with reference to policies and guidelines. In the two months since your RfA took place, I can see that you have made substantial and successful attempts to communicate with vandals and to back your opinions up with policies. I really like editors who do this as it makes it easy for me and any other person to instantly review your reasoning in order to support you - no one has to redo your work as all of your working-out is included! On this basis, using your current performance as a baseline, I would have no problem in supporting you if you decide to go for another RfA in the New Year. Even if you don't, this is the sort of performance that new editors should be able to look at and use as a model for their own Wiki-careers. I hope that this information is useful to you.

<p><a name="Re:_Webcomics_barnstar" id="Re:_Webcomics_barnstar"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Webcomics barnstar</span></h2>
<p>Hi there. I'm R. Noyes, the creator of Cat Town, a website whose Wikipedia entry was deleted a few weeks back in a CfD you spearheaded. I'm not mad that the article was deleted. I took no part in its creation or maintenance, I kept out of the initial VfD to avoid a conflict of interest, and I haven't been active in Wikipedia for so long that I hadn't even known there was a second, much less third call for deletion of the article.</p>
<p>Frankly, I was initially flattered that someone took the time to write an article about a silly little thing I had done primarily to amuse myself and some friends, and I gave the author permission to include the logo picture in the article, but I really didn't feel it important enough for me to leap in and boldly defend should it come under fire (and besides, on Wikipedia, an author who boldly leaps in to defend something of hir own has pretty much lost the fight right there.) The project wasn't mainstream, I didn't advertise it, and honestly it's been inactive in over 7 months so techically it's not current anymore. I didn't feel offended by the first VfD, and when I read over the other two this evening, I didn't feel offended by them, either. I know Wikipedia policy is all bureaucracy and a squeakiest wheel competition besides, so why waste time and energy being a blowhard about it?</p>
<p>I am offended, however, in the barnstar you received from <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a> in honor of the article's deletion. How something can be deemed so insignificant yet garner Wikipedia's high accolade with an extremely POV and mean-spirited explanation upon its deletion is beyond me, but that's not the point. I'd probably have to take that up with <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a>. You seem to be a good and vigilant editor, you're doing your part to help make Wikipedia into what you think is a better place, and that's great, but displaying such an insulting note betrays your good faith and good intentions as an editor. I've received my fair share of angry email from people who didn't think Cat Town was funny, and I was never bothered by them -- to each his own, really. But for some reason, that barnstar hurt. It felt like I was watching two 5th graders gleefully gloating over a frog they'd just stomped on for no other reason than to stomp on a frog. Surely Wikipedia isn't helped by such mean-spirited jubilation, but again, perhaps that's something that's all <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a>'s doing in the first place.</p>
<p>I'm not asking you to remove the barnstar, though I guess technically I could edit it out if I wanted to and you could put it back in and then we'd have a revert war and accomplish absolutely nothing except for hilariously snarky insults in our edit summary fields. It's your call, really. Please just keep in mind that on the Internet, especially on a public web site such as Wikipedia, your words and actions and the reactions to them can be seen by anybody and everybody. And that often there can be another person behind another monitor who, whether you know it or not, is directly affected by such actions. I just wanted to point that out and to, uh, thank you for ruining my dinner tonight.</p>
<p>Take care, and keep up the good fight, whatever you perceive it to be. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpatch_4004.html" title="User:Spatch">Spatch</a> 02:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey there. I'd like to apologize for the barnstar that was previously displayed on my user page. I had a habit of displaying any recognition that people presented me with there, but have since revised that policy. You are very much correct in that it wasn't charitable of Hahnchen to single out your comic and say such harsh things nor should I have blindly displayed the barnstar. It has been removed from my user page and will remain so.</dd>

<p>I'm the creator of this online comic ("Jaxtraw") and little surprised that it's been deleted. How are these things decided? The article's been there for some time, and a few people chose to edit it so presumably thought it in some sense worthy. I don't know what a comic has to be to be "notable"- is this a matter of personal preferences among editors? The comic itself has been running for over 5 years now, so it's hardly a flash in the pan, abandoned comic languishing in a corner of Keenspace or whatever they call it these days. Is it just because it's "adult"? I may be being overly defensive here, but I wonder if somebody just flicked past it checking all these many articles and presumed it's just some porn site, which is far from the truth.</p>
<p>If nothing else, as that rare thing, a webcomic supporting itself financially by readers' subscriptions, it's notable, surely? 82.71.30.178 20:12, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - sorry for taking a while to reply. I really think that the creator should be notified, even if they do not appear to be currently editing - the template states that it should be done. However, either way, I think that this is not an uncontroversial deletion and so I would also be happy to remove the prod template on these grounds. There are lots of links to it, so I think that an AfD would be most appropriate for the article; perhaps it may be possible to get some more input to deciding whether it is notable or not. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarofdreams_f9b2.html" title="User talk:Warofdreams">talk</a></i> 22:38, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

He knows everything that I put up on that page. I had asked him why he didn't put his interests up there and he said he was too lazy so I did it myself.

<dd>Hey there, Kizor. I know we often end up on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to what we want to do to questionably notable articles, but we're certainly on the same team. I really do appreciate your efforts in the deletion discussions. Thank you for that. As for "The Accidental Centaurs", it's on the list under "The". Also, it's not really a trophy list; it's a way for me to see when a deleted article is recreated as happened for Kid Radd. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small> 20:16, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that's just the sentiment I was trying to get across. Thanks. It's good to hear that we maintain perspective when AfDs can traditionally be so antagonizing.<br />
I see the comic is there now that you've pointed it out, too. I'm not a reader and had missed the "The."<br />
As for the list, I really thought I'd foiled you in the Kid Radd AfD and couldn't resist... --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 20:52, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
