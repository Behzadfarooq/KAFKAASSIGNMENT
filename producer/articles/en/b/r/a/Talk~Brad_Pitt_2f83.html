<p>What about my change {As of yet it is not clear if this belief applies to persons under the age of 14, those who wish to marry more than one person, or those who prefer to have relations with animals.[4]} was unhelpful, and why did you remove my earlier question {Marrage Statement</p>
<p>Why did someone remove the sentence I added? After all, it is unclear weather or not the "Marrage Statement" he and his breeding partner have issued applies to persons under the age of 14, persons who would like to marry more than one person at a time, or persons that prefer to have relations with animals. }from the discussion page?</p>

<dd>Who says it's unclear? I mean, I've read the article and from context you know he's talking about gay marriage. Besides, wiki rules state we gotta keep away from potentially libelous statements when talking about a living person. Implying that Pitt supports polygamy, paedophilia or zoophilia _is_ potentially libelous. And to be honest, I've searched around and it seems all press agencies understand that Pitt was referring exclusively to gay marriage. I think your statement was a bit outlandish, and thus correctly removed.

<dd>a)It's irrelevant whether it's unclear; the sentence is an editorial comment. b) It's not unclear; gay marriage is well-known to be a topic of societal debate, and the comment was widely interpreted as referring to gay marriage, even on the page that the anon troll cites below; it was widely understood to refer to gay marriage, even by trolls who pretend otherwise. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 04:46, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>_____</p>
<p>I, as well as others [ <a href="http://www.federalreview.com/2006/09/brad-pitt-is-genius.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.federalreview.com/2006/09/brad-pitt-is-genius.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreview.com/2006/09/brad-pitt-is-genius.htm</a> ] , say it is unclear. (It only takes one.) How did you read an article that will not be out until next week? All I have is commentary from other people that have received advanced copy for review. Do you have a copy of the article? May I see it?</p>
<p>All I have seen is others attributing his statement to a support of same sex marriage, not a statement of his actual support. From the statement given in quotes, "Angie and I will consider tying the knot when everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able," it is unclear because there is no attribution as to purpose.</p>
<p>Libelous? Hardly. In order to be libelous, a statement has to be false. In order for what I wrote to be so, you would have to prove that I know he does not support such things, which I do not. If he had been quoted as stating, "In support of same sex marriage, "Angie and I will consider tying the knot when everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able," what I wrote would be in error, and I most certainly would not have written what I wrote.</p>
<p>I do not know why you are replying to a question I have asked others, but not you.</p>
<p>I will place the addition up again, unless I am made aware of a valid reason I should not do so. It is my understanding that no one of you, nor all of you own the content in question, that ownership is common to anyone on earth. I am here to make my claim with the rest of you. Cheers!</p>

________</p>
<p>Yamla, I am not a vandal. As I wrote earlier, I only wish to contribute to the effort to document Mr. Pitts' social activism, as well as other facets of his life and work.</p>
<p>How, exactly, is the sentence I added to be classified as original research? It is nothing more than a statement relating to the lack of clarity encapsulated within the quote.</p>
<p>Would a different construction suffice? How about "Others have noted that Mr. Pitt's words do not include a specific reference to same sex marriage, leading some to question weather or not he also intended to voice support for child marriage, polygamy, polyandry, and so on."</p>
<p>Would that be OK if I listed sources, as in people having stated confusion as to his meaning? Is the general population to be ignored? Having viewed the "original research" page, I noted within it "For non-academic subjects, it is impossible to pin down a clear definition of "reputable."</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, I have not seen any source with a direct quote of Mr. Pitt having stated his support for same sex marriage, only that he would not marry until "everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able". I am sure you would agree that the statement is hardly the same as stating that they would not marry until same sex marriage was legal.</p>
<p>Thank You For Your Patience, anon</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be reasonable to note that people are confused if you can find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> your claim. Note that a blog, or the site you listed above, is not acceptable. Something like a citation from the New York Times or similar would be good, though. I find it highly unlikely that any reasonable person would read into Pitt's statements that he was supporting child marriage or marriage to animals. It seemed clear to me that he was talking about consenting adults. Similarly, it seems reasonable to assume good faith and not read into his statements that he was supporting incest and the like. However, if you can find a high-quality citation indicating that people are really thinking this, please by all means add it to the article. Pitt certainly wasn't as clear as could be required of, say, a lawyer, but I suppose it is possible that people now believe Pitt supports marriages with goats. Once again, a high-quality reliable source indicating that people actually believe this would be required. You may well want to post your planned source here first because we'll have little patience with gossip sites. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 02:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such a note would not be reasonable in any case; this is an article about Brad Pitt, not about confused people and their confusion. It's a <i>fact</i> that he was referring to gay marriage, even if "anon" is confused (but we can be reasonably certain that he isn't). We know it's a fact because bans on gay marriage are a current topic of discussion in American society whereas bans on marrying goats are not, and virtually everyone who commented on Pitt's statement (including the page that "anon" cites) interpreted it that way, and not a patently incorrect way. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 04:54, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>____</p>
<p>Yamla,</p>
<p>Understood. However, I've noticed that the source listed [ <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060908/ap_en_mo/people_brad_pitt" class="external free" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060908/ap_en_mo/people_brad_pitt" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060908/ap_en_mo/people_brad_pitt</a> ] does not contain within it any reference to same sex marriage. Is that what you mean by "high quality citation"? Perhaps the "same sex marriage" statement should be removed?</p>
<p>In any event, the article listed as a citation does not have a byline, so we do not know who wrote it. I would think that this may also disqualify its' use as a citation in support of anything.</p>

<ol>
<li>the photo is only being used for informational purposes.</li>

<p>I was thinking of using this image: . I looked at the site and it says that the picture is free. Also, I was thinking of just using the rightmost 1/3rd of the picture. And if his penis isn't desired, then I could crop the picture to just show the top half. Would this be okay?</p>

<dd>I would venture to say that it was a grammatical error as far as the word is concerned. Though I'd like to see a source for the entire sentence.

<p>Yeah, your point seems to make sense. Why would someone being a part of the movie intentionally "teach" them how to make soap when it wouldn't do anything for the movie. It isn't like it's valid movie research that would add anything to the movie in an overall sense.</p>
<p>"Learnt" is past-tense of "learn". It is more commonly written as "learned", however, but "learnt" is still perfectly valid. I didn't add the word to the article, however, and it is possible that you are complaining about something other than the choice of words. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 15:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It states that Brad is of English Ancestry. Is there interest in taking this further? On his mother's side, he is decendent of two large families, the Cokers and the Ogles. The Cokers came to the U.S. during the Revolutionary War. Family lore claims that the first Coker was captured from a trading vessel and forced to be part of the British Army. Upon arriving in the new land, he promptly went over to the Revolutionary soldiers and told them were the British were camped out. In return for his actions, he was awarded a lot of land. On the Ogle side, it is much better. The Ogles come from British and French royalty - decendent of Charlemagne. Also, the Ogles are all over Sevierville - where the Partons are from. So, Brad is certainly linked through a list of aunts and uncles to Dolly Parton. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 08:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have the name of Brad Pitt's former spouse, Jennifer Aniston. However there should also be the information added for his current family and there status as well. He is now with his partner Angelina Jolie and their three children, Maddox, Zahara and Shiloh. Is there a reason that this info is only visible at the end of page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.33.109.120 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.33.109.120_6687.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.33.109.120">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Simple - Angelina is not a spouse. So, she doesn't belong in a list of former and current spouses. There is an abnormally large section describing his personal relationship with her. When (if) they wed, she will be added to the list of spouses. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 05:15, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you want it to be "relationships", you need to include practically every actress he's been paired up with. There's a reason that the women he dates demand that he not make a movie paired with another actress. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 22:16, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brad Pitt is listed as one of the three producers for the film "The Departed". and when a movie wins Best Picture at the Oscars that specific award is given to the producers of said film. so, since "The Departed" won, wouldn't/shouldn't Pitt be listed as an Academy Award winner for producing the film? i mean this as a legitimate question, b/c i honestly don't know.

<dd>The Academy set up specific rules where they essentially get to choose the producer(s) who get the award, up to 3 people. This was in reaction to the growing lists of producers on various films, and was actually fairly controversial. Unfortunately, Scorsese and Pitt were not chosen as 'official' producers in this vein...only Graham King.
