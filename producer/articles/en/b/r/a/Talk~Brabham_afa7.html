<p>I believe the official name of the Brabham team was "Motor Racing Developments", and not Brabham Racing organization. Jack Brabham was staunchly against using his own name as part of the team, and insisted on the "MRD" name - though it sounded rather unfortunate when spoken by a French commentator. The Brabham name was adopted as a moniker by commentators, but the actual entrant name on all the team's GP Entries was Motor Racing Developments. Is it possible that the author has confused Brabham with Ken Tyrrell's 'Tyrrell Racing Organisation'? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPosthocergopropterhoc_2235.html" title="User:Posthocergopropterhoc">Posthocergopropterhoc</a> 5 July 2005 04:01 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A few months ago I e-mailed Donn Gurney, who is the contact person at <a href="http://www.jackbrabham.com/contact.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jackbrabham.com/contact.html" rel="nofollow">Brabham's website</a>, on this very issue; apparently he asked Sir Jack, who confirmed that Brabham Racing Organisation is the correct full name for his team. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 15:02, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The team was "Brabham Racing Organisation". But the constructor was called "Motor Racing Developments". Brabham saw BRO as just another one of several MRD clients. --<a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">Pc13</a> 22:17, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Motor Racing Developments was the main company which manufactured the cars, and although BRO was the works F1 team from 1962 to 1969, it was MRD that was the entrant after that. On the policy that has been applied to other teams, this article should really be called 'Motor Racing Developments, Ltd.' but that would be hopelessly confusing. It might be better if this article was renamed 'Brabham', never properly the name of the team, but what most people know it as, and 'Brabham Racing Organisation' and 'Motor Racing Developments' redirected here. That way, most people get what they expect, and those who know the correct full titles also do so. Thoughts? <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 17:44, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll second that plan. That is similar to the manner in which the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surtees.html" title="Surtees">Surtees</a> team has been handled. Although Team Surtees (the race entrant) went through a number of names (Brooke Bond OXO etc etc) they all link back to the main Surtees page, as does the official constructor: Surtees Racing Organisation. <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrope_6763.html" title="User:Pyrope">Pyrope</a> 15:18, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Judging from model numbers, the production of customer cars for anything outside F1 seems to have ceased in the early 1970s after Bernie Ecclestone took over. What I've read so far (not very much!) suggests that Bernie just let the customer side die out, where you'd have thought that it could have been sold as a going concern. Anyone know what the story is? <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 23:44, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Come to think of it, what company did Jack actually sell to Ron Tauranac? Was it BRO or MRD, or both?</p>
<dl>
<dd>After (much!) further reading, it seems that BRO was only the sole F1 entrant up to 1965, after that it was more of a joint effort with MRD and BRO seems to disappear at the end of 1969 when Jack sold his shares in MRD to Ron - after that the name on the entry list is almost always MRD, or a variation thereon. MRD is the company that was sold to Bernie - who has said that he wasn't interested in continuing the customer side - he may well have been right as it was around this time that Lotus and others competing in F1 also stopped producing customer cars. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 07:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With a 30 year history, this may become a very long (tedious?) article if it basically consists only of the 'racing history'. I've already split out the MRD bit to a separate section and I'm starting to wonder whether it would be worth splitting out a more summarised 'racing history' (just a canter through who drove for the team and where the team finished in the championship - possibly even in a table?) from a narrative history which could then gloss over the 'quiet years' (1962 - 1965), (1971 - 1975?), (1989-1992?) even more than the article does at present. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a></p>

<p>This article has contained the statement that this is an Australian team since before I started messing about with it. Now, I'm not questioning the team's 'Australian-ness' in its first decade: Drivers, designer and most of the mechanics were from either Oz or New Zealand, and some components - most importantly the Repco engines - came from there. However, the nationality of a team is defined by the Motorsports national body under whom it was registered (hence Renault is indeed a French team, although the chassis operation is firmly based in the UK and largely staffed by Brits). Does anyone know whether Brabham was actually registered with CAMS (the Aussie motorsports body) or whether it was technically a British team? <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 07:04, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just as a query, until the advent of sponsorship liveries, the MRD/Brabham works team always ran in Australian racing colours, i.e. BRG with gold/yellow trim (see the photo of Graham Hill in the lobster claw car). How does this tally with the CSI national colours ruling that was in place until 1969? <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrope_6763.html" title="User:Pyrope">Pyrope</a> 09:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Excellent question. By which I mean, I have no idea whatsoever! Given that, as you say, it was BRG with gold trim, and that other teams 'trimmed' their liveries - Lotus with yellow, for example - perhaps this was just the same thing? If so, the statement 'raced in the Australian colours' (although taken from one of the histories, I think) is a bit of an anachronism. Possibly at the time they were officially seen as racing in British colours. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 18:45, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't give the actual quote at the moment, but according to Alan Henry's book on the team the concept of a fancar <i>was</i> banned (i.e. they closed the loophole that said that the <i>primary</i> purpose of the fan must be to cool the car, which had left room for its secondary purpose to be the creation of downforce), but the car was not ruled to have been illegal when it raced in Sweden - in other words it was a legitimate interpretation of the rules, which were then changed. The BT46B could not have raced again legally however, so it was in effect banned. I think what Ecclestone may have done is to decide not to fight the decision. I'll try and give quotes later today. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a>
<dl>
<dd>From <i>Brabham - The Grand Prix Cars</i> (Alan Henry, 1985) page 187: "It should of course be emphasized quite categorically that the BT46B fan-car may have been outlawed <i>after</i> its victory at Anderstorp, but it was never declared illegal, nor was it disqualified from that Swedish Grand Prix success."</dd>
<dd>and: "although the <b>fan-car was banned</b> by the CSI, a technical commission from the sport's governing body examined the BT46B and broadly agreed with Gordon Murray's contention that the fan was employed 'about 70 per cent for cooling and 30 per cent for ground effect'".</dd>
<dd>From <i>Brabham - Story of a Racing Team</i> (Phil Dracket, 1985) page 98: "Before the French Grand Prix, the <b>fan car had been banned</b>, but the Swedish result was allowed to stand as the cars had raced there with official approval."</dd>
<dd>Sorry to go on at length, but the story that it wasn't banned seems to be quite common, I can only assume it comes from the true story that it wasn't illegal <i>at the time of the race</i>. It would have been illegal if it had raced again.

<dd>Your latter comment on the percentage devoted to cooling agrees with what Henry says. Dracket's account doesn't contradict Henry's though - both say the <b>"car was banned"</b>! As an aside, I don't think too much of Dracket's book. Anyone who can refer to Nelson Piquet as Argentinean (albeit only once) or say that the Rover-BRM was a 'turbo' engined car hasn't done their research too carefully. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 21:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I can give you two more examples of "banned" from books - 'The Concise Encyclopedia of F1' ( and 'The A-Z of racing cars' (1990). I can also (because I'm always fair!) give you one to support your side: A history of Brabham in the May 1999 edition of Motorsport says (p.43) that "contrary to popular opinion, <b>it was never banned</b>". The author? Alan Henry, 14 years after saying it <i>was</i> banned in his book!</dd>
<dd>More seriously, I've got some contemporary newspaper reports here from the Times. On June 24 1978, less than a week after the Swedish race, John Blunsden (also a writer for <a href="http://www.motorsportmagazine.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.motorsportmagazine.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Motorsport</a>) writes "The controversial Brabham-Alfa Romeo BT46B, the "fan car" with which Niki Lauda took victory at last Sunday's Swedish Grand Prix, will not be raced again, at least for the next three grand prix. This is the effect of a decision reached yesterday by the CSI...However <b>the ban</b> will not be retrospective..." (my emphasis again). Six days later he wrote: "The Parmalat Brabham team's BT46B, the "sucker car" has been <b>banned</b> from further racing, at least until August 1." (My emphasis again). For once an extremely rapid decision was taken by the CSI. The significance of August 1 is that by that date new rules were to have been agreed regarding the 'moving aerodynamics' thing. As the current regs say that aerodynamic parts may not move (hence the discussion over flexible wings) it seems that an agreement was reached. <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 06:52, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, you're right. There were also complaints about underweight qualifying cars - exacerbated no doubt by the team's ownership by Mr Ecclestone which some felt put them in a advantageous position when it came to interpretation of the rules.
