<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg_v._Ohio_6bc5.html" title="Edit section: Background of the case">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background of the case</span></h2>
<p>Charles Brandenburg, a <a href="../../../k/u/_/Ku_Klux_Klan_2a27.html" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> leader in rural Ohio, contacted a reporter at a Cincinnati television station and invited him to come and cover a KKK rally in Hamilton County. Portions of the rally were taped, showing several men in robes and hoods, some carrying firearms, first burning a cross and then making speeches. One of the speeches made reference to the possibility of "revengeance" against "niggers," "Jews," and those who supported them. One of the speeches also claimed that "our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race," and announced plans for a march on Washington to take place July 4. Brandenburg was later convicted of advocating violence under <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>'s Criminal Syndicalism statute for his participation in the rally and for the speech he made. In relevant part, the statute proscribed "advocat[ing] . . . the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform" and "voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society, group or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism." He was fined $1000 and sentenced to one to ten years in prison.</p>
<p>Brandenburg's conviction was affirmed by an Ohio appellate court despite his claim that the statute violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Ohio Supreme Court dismissed his appeal without opinion. The rather cursory way in which the Ohio courts dismissed Brandenburg's constitutional arguments is unsurprising in light of the state of First Amendment law in the pre-<i>Brandenburg</i> era. Although <i><a href="../../../y/a/t/Yates_v._United_States_2994.html" title="Yates v. United States">Yates v. United States</a></i>, 354 U.S. 298 (1957), had overturned the convictions of mid-level Communist Party members in language that seemed suggestive of a broader view of freedom of expression rights than had been accorded them in <i><a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_v._United_States_ec3a.html" title="Dennis v. United States">Dennis v. United States</a></i>, 341 U.S. 494 (1951), all <i>Yates</i> purported to do was construe a federal statute, the Smith Act. Thus, <i>Dennis'</i>s reading of the First Amendment remained in force: advocacy of law violation, even as an abstract doctrine, could be punished under law consistent with the Free Speech Clause.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg_v._Ohio_6bc5.html" title="Edit section: The Court's decision">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Court's decision</span></h2>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court reversed Brandenburg's conviction, holding that government cannot constitutionally punish abstract advocacy of force or law violation. The unanimous majority opinion was <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Per_curiam.html" title="Per curiam">per curiam</a></i> (issued from the Court as an institution rather than as authored and signed by an individual justice): it had originally been drafted by Justice <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abe_Fortas_a2a4.html" title="Abe Fortas">Abe Fortas</a> before he was forced to resign in the midst of an ethics scandal, and Justice <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_J._Brennan_01e0.html" title="William J. Brennan">William J. Brennan</a> made only minor changes to the opinion before it was published. Justices Black and Douglas concurred separately.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg_v._Ohio_6bc5.html" title="Edit section: Per curiam opinion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Per curiam</i> opinion</span></h3>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Per_curiam.html" title="Per curiam">per curiam</a></i> majority opinion overturned the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute, overruled <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_v._California_550c.html" title="Whitney v. California">Whitney v. California</a></i>, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), and articulated a new test—the "imminent lawless action" test—for judging so-called seditious speech under the First Amendment:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"[our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The three distinct elements of this test (intent, imminence, and likelihood) have distinct precedential lineages. Judge <a href="../../../l/e/a/Learned_Hand_e22b.html" title="Learned Hand">Learned Hand</a> was possibly the first judge to advocate the intent standard, in <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Masses_Publishing_Co._v._Patten_3cc2.html" title="Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten">Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten</a></i>, 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), reasoning that "[i]f one stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or their interest to resist the law, it seems to me one should not be held to have attempted to cause its violation." The <i>Brandenburg</i> intent standard is more speech-protective than Hand's formulation, which contained no temporal element.</p>
<p>The imminence element was a departure from earlier rulings. In <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schenck_v._United_States_6a21.html" title="Schenck v. United States">Schenck v. United States</a></i>, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), the Court had adopted a "<a href="../../../c/l/e/Clear_and_present_danger.html" title="Clear and present danger">clear and present danger</a>" test that <i>Whitney v. California</i> had expanded to a <i>bad tendency</i> test: if speech has a "tendency" to cause sedition or lawlessness, it may constitutionally be prohibited. <i><a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_v._United_States_ec3a.html" title="Dennis v. United States">Dennis v. United States</a></i>, a case dealing with prosecution of alleged Communists under the <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_Act_66fe.html" title="Smith Act">Smith Act</a> for advocating the overthrow of the government, used the clear and present danger test while still upholding the defendants' convictions for acts that could not possibly have led to a speedy overthrow of the government. <i>Brandenburg</i> explicitly overruled the bad tendency test and made the time element of the clear and present danger test more defined and more rigorous.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <i>per curiam</i> opinion cited to <i>Dennis v. United States</i> as though it were good law and amenable to the result reached in <i>Brandenburg</i>. In point of fact, <i>Brandenburg</i> essentially eviscerated <i>Dennis'</i>s central holding and held that "mere advocacy" of any doctrine, including one that assumed the necessity of violence or law violation, was per se protected speech. It may be that principles of <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stare_decisis.html" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a></i> figured in the Court's decision to avoid overruling the relatively recent <i>Dennis</i>, but the distance between the two cases' approach is obvious and irreconcilable.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg_v._Ohio_6bc5.html" title="Edit section: Concurrences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Concurrences</span></h3>
<p>Justice <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Black_d420.html" title="Hugo Black">Hugo Black</a>, renowned civil libertarian and First Amendment absolutist, filed a short concurrence indicating his agreement with Justice <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_O._Douglas_e42d.html" title="William O. Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>'s longer opinion and pointing out that the <i>per curiam'</i>s reliance on <i>Dennis</i> was more symbolic than actual.</p>
<p>Justice Douglas's concurrence reflected the absolutist position that only he and Black ever fully subscribed to, namely that the phrase "no law" in the First Amendment ought to be interpreted very literally, and that all speech is immune from prosecution, regardless of the governmental interests advanced in suppressing some particular instance of speech. He briefly traced the history of the clear and present danger test, illustrating how it had been used over the years since its debut in <i>Schenck</i> to dismiss dozens of what Douglas viewed as legitimate First Amendment claims.</p>
<p>A short but interesting section of Douglas's opinion indicated that he might be open to allowing the government greater latitude in controlling speech during time of "declared war" (making clear that he was not referring to the then-current Vietnam conflict), although he only phrased that possibility in terms of doubt (as opposed to his certainty that the clear and present danger test was irreconcilable with the First Amendment during time of peace).</p>
<p>Douglas also pointed out the legitimate role of symbolic speech in First Amendment doctrine, using examples of a person ripping up a Bible to celebrate the abandonment of his faith or tearing a copy of the Constitution in order to protest a Supreme Court decision, and assailed the previous term's <i><a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_v._O%27Brien_5023.html" title="United States v. O'Brien">United States v. O'Brien</a></i>, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), which had allowed for the prosecution of a man for burning his draft card. In all these situations, Douglas argued, an action was a vital way of conveying a certain message, and thus the action itself deserved First Amendment protection.</p>
<p>Finally, Douglas dealt with the classic example of a man "<i>falsely</i> shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic." In order to explain why someone could be legitimately prosecuted for this, Douglas called it an example in which "speech is brigaded with action." In the view of Douglas and Black, this was probably the only sort of case in which a person could be prosecuted for speech.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg_v._Ohio_6bc5.html" title="Edit section: Subsequent developments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Subsequent developments</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Brandenburg</i> test was the Court's last major statement on what government may do about inflammatory speech that seeks to incite others to lawless action. It resolved the debate between those who urged greater government control of speech for reasons of security and those who favored allowing as much speech as possible and relying on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketplace_of_ideas.html" title="Marketplace of ideas">marketplace of ideas</a> to reach a favorable result, leaving the law in a state along the lines of that which Justices <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Brandeis_487f.html" title="Louis Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a>, and, post-<i>Schenck</i>, <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes%2C_Jr._824c.html" title="Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> advocated in several dissents and concurrences during the late 1910s and early 1920s. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the <i>Brandenburg</i> test is still the standard used for evaluating attempts to punish inflammatory speech, and it has not been seriously challenged since it was laid down in 1969. Very few cases have actually reached the Court during the past decades that would test the outer limits of <i>Brandenburg</i>, so the test remains largely unqualified.</p>
