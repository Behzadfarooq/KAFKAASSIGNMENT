<p>Why do you keep adding the "no source" template to all the MZ covers, which clearly <i>do</i> have sources? --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 19:42, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They weren't covers, they didn't have titles or issue numbers that a scanned comic cover would have had. They looked like promotional art, but there was no source information, just links to news websites that the files were taken from. Per the license template, "The copyright for it is most likely owned by the company who created the promotional item or the artist who produced the item in question; you must provide source information as evidence of ownership." I realize the Ultimate Fantastic Four covers come from the marvel site and that's my mistake, but the others come from different sites. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradtcordeiro_239b.html" title="User:Bradtcordeiro">Brad T.

<dd>1, most of the covers can be found <a href="http://www.marvel.com/news/2.299" class="external text" title="http://www.marvel.com/news/2.299" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 2, Marvel released them to sites like Newsarama and ComicbookResources as promotional materials. 3, they all fall under the promocomic template.--<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 22:42, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, saw your comments inserted into the text of the article. While I share your concern about links being broken, would a better solution be to link to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_temple_architecture.html" title="Hindu temple architecture">Hindu temple architecture</a>? OK, perhaps that is only an ideal, but in practise I think the Temple architecture article is a poorer quality than Indian architecture. Maybe temple architecture needs improving (take the info from Indian architecture) so that links can go to it instead. By the way, which articles to link to that section? --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 04:32, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm actually not that familiar with any kind of architecture, I was doing <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_pages_with_links_2ad7.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links">Disambiguation link repair</a> and the page I was working on, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a>, linked to the Hindu architecture section on the Indian architecture page. Not knowing much about architecture, I used this link while fixing many articles that were pointing to the disambiguation page. If the Hindu temple architecture page fits better, I won't disagree with you, and I'll work on fixing links again. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradtcordeiro_239b.html" title="User:Bradtcordeiro">Brad T.

<p>You may have a point there. She is, however, list as being in the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_Shintoists_b1f8.html" title="Category:Fictional Shintoists">Category:Fictional Shintoists</a> (I think by someone else, I dunno when it was added) and that is a subcategory of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Category%7EShinto_db9c.html" title="Category:Shinto">Category:Shinto</a>, which is the scope of the project. All articles in that category have been added to the project's watchlist at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Shinto_Articles_90c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Shinto/Articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Shinto/Articles</a> as well, to help the project monitor articles for improvements, vandalism, what have you. Personally, I honestly have no way of knowing one way or another. However, if you do wish to remove the banner, it might make sense to remove the category as well. If you do that, please notify me or the project on its talk page so that she can be removed from the articles list there as well. Sorry, that's all I've got. I'm afraid I don't know one way or another whether she qualifies as Shinto or not. I think maybe it was guessed on the basis of her father, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shingen_Yashida_b083.html" title="Shingen Yashida">Shingen Yashida</a>, maybe? Also, <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine.html" title="Wolverine">Wolverine</a> is in the category Fictional Shintoists as well. I have <b>real</b> reservations about that one myself. If you do have any information to clarify any of these characters categorization as Shintoists, one way or another, I think both the project and I would be very grateful. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 22:51, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../v/2/_/Image%7EV2_1.PNG_2335.html" title="Image:V2 1.PNG">Image:V2 1.PNG</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to <a href="../../../v/2/_/Image%7EV2_1.PNG_2335.html" title="Image:V2 1.PNG">the image description page</a> and edit it to include a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bradtcordeiro_4bd0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bradtcordeiro">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box.
