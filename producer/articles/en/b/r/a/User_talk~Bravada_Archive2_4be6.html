<p><small>Hi Bravada. Since you seem to be quite knowledgable about the different statuses which are awarded to articles on WP, I am asking you this question. If I nominate one of my articles that just got GA for FA status but it does not succeed as an FA nominee, does it retain its GA status? (I'm not talking about Passenger vehicles in US). I couldn't find a clear answer for this, so I though you could help me with this question.

<p><small>Hi, about your question about DYK and suggestions about similar things. When I update the template I don't mind if similar topics (eurovision entries, english and french houses seem to be popular at the moment) pop up every day or two as long as the article is good quality and the hook for the DYK template is interesting, if the blurb is boring and we're not short on suggestions I'll pass over something that there has been a lot of recently. Hope that helps. Keep up the good work. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">Peta</a> 09:25, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>I've added some links (lyrics and performance video) for Angelica's song, which might help it get over the line in a DYK sense.

<p><small>Thank you for the apple pie award, I apreciate it. Also, an idependent review is a good idea as we just need to agree to disagree on Passenger vehicles US meeting of GA criteria.

<p><small>For what it's worth, please don't remove {{<a href="../../../a/u/t/Template%7EAutomobileWatch_5558.html" title="Template:AutomobileWatch">AutomobileWatch</a>}} from any categories... you're free to change the <b>contents</b> of the template to use your new one, but don't replace that specific template from categories, as I have an upcoming feature that relies on them.</small></p>
<p><small>Also, I don't think I'm against your ideas. In the latest case, I'm just personally interested in a single list of essential articles, rather than four separate lists.</small></p>
<p><small>Anyway, with a small bit of fiddling, it should be possible to have lists of articles display both on separate "task force" train-style pages, as well on one single "essential articles" CVG-style page.

<dd><small>Well, hopefully they would - the thing is that compiling and keeping the list up-to-date would be quite cumbersome and one small mistake could have disastrous consequences.

You get a mention&#160;:) I hope that the article is up to your lofty standards this time, hehe. Really, I'm serious: your input has been wonderful. Even though 99% of the work for the article in its present form has been done by me, much of that work would not have been done at all if it had not been for you and your useful advice, pointing me in the right direction. Thank you. I now truly believe that the article is great. I hope you are able to support it.

<dd><small>Aww, thank you for the "12 points"&#160;:)</small></dd>
<dd><small>Okay, so three things:</small></dd>
<dd><small>1) Thanks for pointing out the fact that IE won't display the hair-spaces either side of mdashes: that's what happens when I use Firefox! I have replaced these with regular spaces.</small></dd>
<dd><small>2) I do agree that the FA criteria should be high: that is why I have waited until now, as I believe this article is great after all the improvements made, and I do not believe there are any more addressable points. Your own reservations seem to come from your own preferences, and not addressable concerns which are rooted in WP policy and guidelines. Surely everyone has their own way in which they would write any particular article, and if every person objected on the grounds that "they would write it differently", even though there is nothing wrong with the article as far as WP guidelines are concerned, then no article would ever become featured.</small></dd>
<dd><small>2) I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on the "Expansion of the Contest" section.. although I would like to know exactly why you think it is POV. You said that there are undertones which imply that "Eastern Europe destroyed Eurovision". Well, I can't see a single sentence which says, either directly or by implication, that the Contest's expansion is a bad thing. In fact, the result of all the expansion is that we now have <i>two</i> shows: the semi and the final! That could be taken as a good thing; certainly it provides more entertainment for fans, such as myself. Personally I am not against the expansion, and welcome the new countries: they have provided us with many wonderful songs, which I love. Therefore it is hard for me to imagine how I could have had any subconscious undertones of negativity when writing that section. The only one problem I have with the new countries is that in some cases, they make it even more obvious that there is neighbourly/block voting. However, the expansion section does not touch upon voting at all: that is dealt with in the "criticisms" section, which itself does not even mention Eastern Europe, and even steers clear of it by giving Greece and Cyprus — old-timer Eurovision countries — as examples. Really, my bottom line on this point is that the expansion <i>is</i> a major theme of the Contest, as the past ten years of its history have produced more changes to the Contest's format than any other period. Most of these changes are a <b>direct</b> result of the fact that there are more countries wishing to enter than it is possible to host in a single show. Therefore this theme needs its own section, which explains <b>in context</b> exactly how and why the changes happened. To incorporate the information elsewhere in the article would be to down-play it, and to make it a lot less clear exactly what happened. If you still feel that the section is POV, please give examples of specific sentences which you believe imply that the expansion was a bad thing, and I will take a look at them. If there are no such examples you can find, then surely you must then admit that it is not POV. Oui?</small></dd>
<dd><small>3) The Criticisms section. In the Peer Review, you said that a discussion about musical styles and performances should have its own section. I have thought about this. I would like to be able to give it its own section, but I don't really see how such a section would be encyclopædic and comprehensive. I mean, there are so many styles which have been included in the Contest.. it's almost like proposing that we discuss every single song. If I were to create such a section, then it's hard to see what justification I would have to highlight particular, individual songs above others. When I wrote the article originally, I really tried to stay clear of talking about the <i>actual songs</i>, because: a) it would be difficult, if not impossible, to make the discussion encyclopædic; b) as songs, by their very nature, are artforms to be judged (especially in such a competition!), it would also be next to impossible to write about them in an NPOV way; and c) such discussions about the music of the Contest would be an open invitation to editors to edit that section and include their own POV. I therefore decided to only mention something which is directly referenced, which is an example of the criticism which the Contest faces.</small></dd>

<p><small>I don't think it would be too hard. Right now, I'm working on a couple of other things, and trying not to get sucked back in to spending too much time on Wikipedia (it's not working). I want to say that I'll consider it and get back to you much later, when I find time. Knowing me though, I'll probably get to it relatively soon. No promises. I don't think it will even take much change from what I already have, but that's easier to figure out once I can actually try to do stuff. So, let me know when your template is done, and where you want me to put the article lists, etc.</small></p>
<p><small>Also, my bot can be used to tag articles in the project once you get your template done. It won't be able to categorize them, but might make it easier to find them. It's only good at tagging all articles in a category though, not picking out which ones apply. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMom2jandk_49c0.html" title="User:Mom2jandk">Ingrid</a> 16:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>I fixed the problem, but the list is too long to fit on one page. All articles are on the main page, but if you're interested in other types of pages (talk, templates, project pages, etc.), you'll have to look at subpages. <a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMom2jandk_49c0.html" title="User:Mom2jandk">Ingrid</a> 15:02, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>Okay, I add the design task force as many article completely lack info on design.

They are mere listing of engines and options. I will think over this task force as I see your point-you want to assign specific article's to a certain task force. Also, as w/ luxo cars, yes the boundaries would be somewhat vague as they include some companies such as Volvo and Saab which are soetimes seen as lux, but it is these gray areas where a lot of POV sometimes hides as people try to make their semi-luxo car out to be luxo cars. Again, for now I have put my name under the NA TF. Guessing from your comment on my talk page a POV removal TF would also be against the original idea wouldn't it? <b><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 19:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>I didn't notice that task force (actually I never actually read the list properly&#160;:( ), so thanks for informing me of it!</small></p>
<p><small>With regards to the notice on the Category:Keicars, I wasn't sure how appropriate it would be (I couldn't find anything at all about writing text like that in any cat guidelines), and probably didn't word it as well as I should have. AFAIK all those cars <i>are</i> kei cars in Japan, it's just the export versions can differ greatly and some articles currently only refer to the European models. Some may be the same car, or the same car with a larger engine exceeding the 660cc kei car limit. Then there's some which are all over the place - the <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzuki_Alto_22ed.html" title="Suzuki Alto">Suzuki Alto</a> sold in Europe has been since at least the early-mid '90s made in India, is rarely (if ever) based on the JDM Alto (IIRC the model in the picture is based on the Suzuki Fronte, and the one after that is based on the Suzuki Cervo Mode), and depending on when/where/what spec they may or may not conform to the kei restrictions - usually they're just older JDM Suzuki kei car models with larger engines stuck in them. And then there's stuff like the Wagon R, in which the Euro models where never really kei cars, though are based on the original Wagon R which is one.</small></p>
<p><small>And then you have to couple all this with the fact that most of these articles are sporadic at best in content right now. My idea with putting these articles in this cat are that (i) though some articles may currently have nothing about the JDM kei car sold under that name, they should, and hopefully will in the future (and I'll try my best to fix this), and (ii) if there is significant content about both the JDM kei car and the loosely-related export/foreign-built model that goes by the same name, the article should be separated into two, with only the standard-compliant cars staying in the keicar cat.</small></p>

<p>Hi, I just want to say that I am not trying to obstruct you on this AfD for any other reason than I simply don't agree. This is probably the stance of most other people advocating to keep the article. Your comment that you are "still waiting" for me to explain how to get profitability from company figures is a little impudent, to use your words. You also say that you find the scope of the arguments annoying. Perhaps you may find it easier to discuss individual's points of view on their own talk pages. By no means would I presume to tell you what to do but my advice is to try not to make this so personal, accept that not everyone agrees, and just let the AfD run its course. I hope there are no hard feelings. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 00:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know how the educational system in Poland works but I hold a qualification in business practice at advanced level in the UK. This covers understanding of profit/loss accounting amongst many other subjects. In the UK account keeping must be meticulous and as I said on the AfD the results are available for every company operating in the UK at any time (provided the fee necessary to obtain it from the registry is paid). A precised version is provided to all shareholders. The problem for me is that I have no idea whether the rest of the world has such transparent accounting practices, and the UK has precious few car manufacturers left! I suppose a short version of all I have said above is that I would be confident to try researching it if the company were based in the UK, if not I would not know where to start! <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 00:57, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your reply. Your qualification is superior to mine though that's largely I guess because I have taken a different path through life. I have been a company director of a road haulage firm, though related, it's a far cry from manufacture. I have abandoned this kind of work and am now working in banking services in the field of the prevention of money laundering. Again, obliquely but not directly related to accounting. I doubt either of us are going to try, and given the international nature of the article, as individuals we would find it an impossible task to verify everything in the article. I doubt we would be able to get enough willing co-operation to do it especially as a cost would almost certainly be incurred. I guess the bottom line is that the AfD will be decided on issues other than this. We've gone a little bit off on a tangent here but there's no harm in that! <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 01:21, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bravada. I don't know very much about old cars, but since I can read portuguese fluently I will be of great help when things come to cars produced or imported in Brazil. I've already found a work by the brazilians José Rogério Lopes de Simone e Paulo César Sandler entitled <i>"Simca - A história desde as origens”</i> (Simca - The history since the beginnings). A quick search was already productive: <a href="http://www.autosantigosbrasileiros.hpg.ig.com.br/SimcaChambord1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autosantigosbrasileiros.hpg.ig.com.br/SimcaChambord1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://www2.uol.com.br/bestcars/ph2/175a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.uol.com.br/bestcars/ph2/175a.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> seems to have good information. Today it's Dad's Day here in Brazil, so I will come to my dad's house to enjoy a Sunday lunch and a great afternoon together with my family, perhaps tonight or by the week I'll be able to come up with something new.

<p>Hello, Bravada. First off, thanks for your kind note.&#160;:) I've looked over some of the discussion at <a href="../../../b/a/p/WP%7EBAP_1254.html" title="WP:BAP">WP:BAP</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Automobiles_3883.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Automobiles">WT:WP Automobiles</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/t/Image%7EAutomotive_Barnstar.png_7255.html" title="Image:Automotive Barnstar.png">this</a> design really stands out. It's probably more creative, elegant, and fitting than any design I could come up with for an Automotive/Automobile Barnstar. If you'd like to contact other graphic designers who might be able to help out, some users named at <a href="../../../b/s/_/WP%7EBS_05bb.html" title="WP:BS">WP:BS</a> include <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">ClockworkSoul</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918">Brian0918</a>, and <a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">Smurrayinchester</a>.

<p>Hi, Bravada. If you'll duck over to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automotive_Lighting_c3e2.html" title="Automotive Lighting">Automotive Lighting</a>, you'll see I've been hard at work whipping existing references into shape and adding new ones. It is slow work and I expect it will take some time before the article is as exhaustively sourced as it ought to be. I have still not yet settled on the best formats for several types of cites, which is why you will notice inconsistency. One thing I have not figured out how to do is to re-use cites. That is, if there is a particular source that will be cited more than once in the article, I would like to be able to have all instances of that cite refer to the same reference number, if possible. I'm also not yet pleased with how to reference the ECE Regulations. Not only is each of them an individual PDF, but there are also revisions and amendments to many of the regulations, and each of <i>those</i> is its own PDF. I will keep thinking about how to rework this for maximum ease of use. Wiki contains excellent cite templates for books, journals, encyclopædias, websites, even Usenet posts, but none for technical standards, which would help out considerably in this case. I have not yet looked into what it takes to create a new template, but perhaps I will do so this evening or tomorrow. In any event, interested to read your thoughts! --<a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7EScheinwerfermann_3853.html" title="User:Scheinwerfermann">Scheinwerfermann</a> 21:52, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bravada, I took this picture the other day in Brigg. I have to say this is the first time I have ever seen one of these. I guess it is not British made as it is LHD and has beam deflectors. The badge reads Taurus TRANSIT. So far my googling has proved unsuccessul. I would appreciate any suggestions. By the way I got consent to use any of the Argentinian Fiat 125 Club images as we talked about. I simply have not got around it yet.

<p>I took this one today. I drove past the car and felt the need to turn around. Too pretty to let it go without a pic. I guess it is a Fiat Dino but it was just badged as Dino (i.e. no Fiat badge anywhere to be seen).

<p>Hey, what's up dude! Some of us GMI'ers are wondering what you're up to, including me - you are such a great fountain of knowledge, we don't want it running dry. If it's anything of a serious nature, email me. My address is dcbjms1988@hotmail.com .</p>

<dd>Regarding Ford, I know someone who can possibly help. He owns the North American English &amp; European Ford Registry, and I think he can help. I'll just give him a holler on FordEurope.net, since some of the Euro Ford articles are also on FordEurope.net. In addition, there was also a series of book exclusively on Ford in Europe. I'll see if I can find the link for it. Anyway, thanks for responding to my message.

I'm following that principle, as it is the underpinning for WP:CSD I3 and is a criteria for immediate, speedy deletion. If Jimbo felt there was negotiation room on this, he would have indicated an acceptable wait period, such as the 7 day wait period for unused images hosted here under a claim of fair use.</li>
<li>I've removed the Ford image from "Did you know?" because of the policy violation, and did so prior to it's deletion.</li>
<li>As I noted, I appreciate the effort to gain permission and sending such permission to Wikipedia is a good step. However, the lack of a response from Wikimedia is not an affirmative proclamation that the use of the images is acceptable.</li>
<li>Please understand; I'm not trying to be in any way hostile towards you. I didn't see the images and think "Hey, I'll be a jerk to this guy". I'm simply following the explicit policy decreed by Jimbo Wales, the founder of this project. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:29, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Respectfully, I did inform you of why it was so and took pains to be as polite about it as possible. I am sorry you feel this was offensive; it most certainly was not my intent.</li>
<li>You do have an opportunity to gain permission from the copyright holder to freely license the image and re-upload the images, presuming you still have copies of the images, which I think is a reasonable conclusion. Deleting the images does not in any way prevent you from re-uploading the images again, under a free license. In fact, I heartily encourage you to do so! They are great images, and I'd love to see them here. We just need to have them under a free license.</li>
<li>I'd just like to juxtapose the images you uploaded under a limited license with <a href="../../../s/i/m/Image%7ESimca_Ariane_-_cropped.jpg_5be5.html" title="Image:Simca Ariane - cropped.jpg">Image:Simca Ariane - cropped.jpg</a>. This image was released under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.</li>
<li>As to why it needs to move quickly and what harm can be caused: I'd like to have you take a look at <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks">Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks</a>. There are literally hundreds of sites that are using our content. The images that you uploaded are for use of Wikipedia alone. However, the images would <i><b>rapidly</b></i> propagate to a number of sites having no affiliation with Wikipedia. The use of the images on those sites is in direct contravention of the permissions granted by the copyright holder of the images you uploaded. We are trying to be respectful of copyright holders who grant "used with permission" licenses who are frequently unaware of how widely their work is distributed. A copyright holder would be rightfully angered if a used with permission image showed up on hundreds of non-Wikipedia sites, with us saying "Hey, it's not our fault. We're not responsible for their actions!" While it is true we are not responsible for those sites, we do have some responsibility to be respectful of copyright holder's wishes, else gaining access to copyrighted work through a free license could be considerably more problematic.</li>
<li>Again, I'm sorry you feel offended. I had no intention of trying to upset you in any respect. Deleting the images was not a knee-jerk response to a used with permission problem, but a process built on sound reasoning as you can see from above. I heartily encourage your contributions, but we must have material available to us under a free license or under terms of fair use (which is narrowly defined on Wikipedia, for reasons of self protection among others). --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions as well. When emailing people about images, it's important to ask whether the image can be used under a free license such as the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-2.5_411a.html" title="Template:Cc-by-2.5">cc-by-2.5</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}}, ... The images can be re-uploaded only if you contact the copyright owners again, and confirm that the image can be released under a GFDL-compatible license. There's more info at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Email_templates" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Email_templates">commons:Commons:Email templates</a> as well.

<dd>Yeah, I'm Interiot on Skype, unsurprisingly. Some of the copyright issues can be stressful, but, for what it's worth, this is a clear part of policy, and Durin is just doing what policy says, so try not to get upset with him specifically.</dd>
<dd>Copyright is complicated, and nearly everyone (including me, an anal copyright whatchyamacallit) gets upset when their photos are contested.</dd>
<dd>The short version is that it's important that our work here not be controlled by any one organization. The work here is "open source", so if Jimbo goes insane tommorow, you can just take <a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://download.wikimedia.org/" rel="nofollow">a copy</a> of the encyclopedia and set up bravadas_noninsane_encyclopedia.org and all the sane people here can go work over there instead, because the encyclopedia <i>is not owned by anyone</i>, not even Wikimedia. When people give you permission to only use the image on Wikipedia, that means the work isn't free for anyone to distribute anymore. I don't know if you've heard of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracenote.html#Commercialization_and_controversy" title="Gracenote">CDDB</a>, but that's a very good example of why you don't want community-generated content to be controlled by any single organization. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 14:57, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><small>de-indent</small> Respectfully, I did explain why the images needed to be deleted. Please note that most of the images were tagged for speedy deletion before I ever got to them. Most items that fall into <a href="../../../c/a/n/Category%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_4c9c.html" title="Category:Candidates for speedy deletion">Category:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> are rapidly deleted without any commentary left to the creator/uploader at all. In most cases, this is entirely proper; considerable content that is deleted through that category is of a nature that does not deserve deletion explanation (for example, an article on John Smith being created saying "He's a terrible teacher! The worst at North Sebastian Junior High!"). I took time to explain why the images were deleted because it was apparent you had put forth considerable effort with regards to the images, and it deserved an explanation. I recognize there are limitations to textual communication and that the explanation was not sufficient for you. From my chair, I thought it would be as I explained the policy under which it was deleted. Since then, it's become apparent that explanation was insufficient. But, I chalk that up to communications limitations rather than willful intent on my part. If we'd been talking in person about this, this would have gone considerably more smoothly, I am sure. It's not you and I that are really at odds here; I think we can get along fine. It's the limitations of our communication medium here in this case causing disruption to the explanation.</li>
<li>We don't disable forking/mirroring of content because the only copyrighted content that we allow here is used under terms of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>. Thus, any other use of the copyrighted content is also (hopefully) legitimately under terms of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>. With that in mind, we are not violating the rights or permissions of any copyright holders. The principle behind this is that we are striving to build an encyclopedia that is free to anyone, for any purpose, anywhere in the world. For example, one of the projects that is using Wikipedia content (in this case under the auspices of the Wikimedia foundation) is a printed encyclopedia intended to be distributed to third world countries for the education of children. It is entirely possible that some for-profit actions will need to be involved in that in order to pay for the significant costs of that project, though of course to the children it would be free. If we had content here that we could only use on Wikipedia, we'd be significantly restricted in our ability to conduct such projects. This devolves into a messy situation; if we permit images to be here under a "used with permission" license, we should also permit textual content under such a license. The two types of material are not subtantially different. It would create a very messy situation that would be immensely difficult to untangle to create derivative works from Wikipedia. We're trying to keep it simple; It's either free use or fair use.</li>
<li>As to requesting your content be removed; it is my understanding you can't. All textual content that you have contributed has been licensed under terms of <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.</li>
<li>We can't use an image of the Ford Vedette here under a fair use license because there are multiple such vehicles in existence (maybe hundreds, or even thousands). The car was produced for 7 model years. This particular image is not of unique historical value (one of the ways in which fair use can be claimed) nor is access to such a vehicle to take a photo of it impossible, such as no surviving vehicles being in existence (another way in which fair use can be claimed). Fair use taggings are regularly disputed. See <a href="../../../d/i/s/Category%7EDisputed_fair_use_images_c75c.html" title="Category:Disputed fair use images">Category:Disputed fair use images</a>, which contains several hundred images. So while the images in question might have slipped in under the radar on fair use, it is likely they would have eventually been picked up. The only reason I found these images is because I was doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=10" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=10" rel="nofollow">recent changes patrolling against templates</a> and pulled up {{<a href="../../../d/i/d/Template%7EDid_you_know_2dd7.html" title="Template:Did you know">Did you know</a>}} looking for fair use violations, which is something I frequently do. See <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html#Fair_use_work" title="User:Durin">User:Durin#Fair_use_work</a>. Other people may have found them in other ways, such as reviewing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=6" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ARecentchanges&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">recent changes for images</a>.</li>
<li>I apologize that I did not remove the images from the articles in question. As you noted, I have now done this. It is indeed standard policy to remove them. I'm human too.&#160;:)</li>
<li>I don't mind you pouring it on me. I don't mind being a bumper. I probably type more in explanation of various things than the vast majority of Wikipedians (for example, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_International_Institute_of_Management_432c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/International Institute of Management">this</a>; most admins just close/delete without explanation). I'm not bragging on this; just noting that I'm happy to be the person you butted up against in this, as I'd much rather have me explain than have someone else barely explain or not explain at all and have you leave the project over a misunderstanding.</li>
<li>I don't intend to complain to Jimbo about this policy because it's well founded in my opinion. Please understand; Wikipedia is under a *constant* onslaught of image uploads that are wildly inaccurate in their licensing and in their use on Wikipedia. A recent estimation of mine showed that we have more then 34,000 fair use violations, and that's just <i><b>one</b></i> area of copyright problems that we have with images. Used with permission images created a very significant problem for us, and it is an area that became intolerable because it was being badly abused. The CSD I3 criterion was in response to that, to give up some weapons to fight the very serious problems we have with copyright abuse. This goes to the core of the very survival of Wikipedia; if we come under an onslaught of copyright lawsuits, it would drain our (very limited) coffers. We just don't have the resources to fight such problems in court. I am not saying your images in particular are so egregious; just that the category they found themselves in is one of the battlegrounds of copyright problems on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>As for being subjected to impolite treatment; Hey, that's your fault not mine&#160;:) Seriously, I don't take offense at people getting upset when policies are applied properly. We try very hard to educate users, and offer plenty of opportunity for them to be exposed to and understand our policies and guidelines. Still, it's a heavy task and one that only a small subset of users undertake prior to conducting a given contribution. I don't think there's much more we could do to educate our users prior to making contributions in contravention of our policies without locking down the encyclopedia for editing by all but trusted users. Of course the problem then is how do we get new trusted users, and the answer is we don't. So, some negative outcome of the application of policy is to be expected. It hurts, and we have users who get upset, but I'm not sure we can do much more short of a mandatory bootcamp or some such for new contributors. But, that again undermines the very basis of what we are as a project.</li>
<li>I am at a loss as to understand the disconnect we are experiencing regarding the intent of this project and your viewpoint on what the intent of this project is. I wish we could amicably resolve this. I was rather startled to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Interiot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70223687" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Interiot&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=70223687" rel="nofollow">this</a> when my explanation was no less illuminating or less polite. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 15:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your reply! I did not email anybody, BabyNuke was kind enough to do so (although I did not intend him to, I was just trying to get his opinion on that). I have asked the same question I asked you to Durin, and he stated that he would rather be more dilligent. As licensing under CC is a quite major issue, considering the possible results, I think it would be better to make sure Mr. Stedehouder understands all the aspects of the issue. Seems like I have to pester BabyNuke again... Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 23:44, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If he gave permission for them to be licensed in a particular CC license, then you should definitely only tag the image with that specific license. It's not really even good to change the <i>version</i> of a license that someone agreed to (eg. cc-by-sa-2.0 to cc-by-sa-2.5). It really is a specific legal agreement that can only be changed by the copyright holder.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, for what it's worth, if you're worried in the "who owns the copyright" bit, even if someone licenses an image as GFDL, they still own the copyright to it (eg. if the creative commons is not valid in a country, then the image falls back to being simply copyrighted... or if someone doesn't accept the terms of the license (eg. they don't want to let people know who the original author was), then the image falls back to being simply copyrighted, and the person can be legally liable for copyright infringement because they don't have a valid license to use it)).</dd>

<p>So <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isopropyl_nitrate.html" title="Isopropyl nitrate">this</a> is the sort of silly sub-stub I write when I start out articles. I don't know how you DYK people crank out great writing.</p>

<p>Malcolma, thanks a lot for taking care of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_SAF_6125.html" title="Ford SAF">Ford SAF</a> article. I will be grateful if you could state what sources you were using when expanding this article. If you speak German, you might also want to take a look at <a href="http://website.webcenter.lycos.de/www.fomcc.de/saf.htm" class="external text" title="http://website.webcenter.lycos.de/www.fomcc.de/saf.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> - it provides some more information on the commercial vehicle side of the business.

<dd>I used mainly the Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile, a massive 3 volume work I treated myself to. Sorry, should have added the source to the article. I'll do it now.<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolma_ac3d.html" title="User:Malcolma">Malcolma</a> 15:56, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have checked and ammended the refs as you requested. We seem to be lacking a Ford Germany article unless I just can't find it. Any ideas? I can start one from the same source if you wish but it is something about which I know virtually nothing.<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolma_ac3d.html" title="User:Malcolma">Malcolma</a> 17:39, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Great, thanks a lot! I will try to find references for the other parts then... Seems like our level of knowledge about Ford Cologne is quite comparable&#160;:D I will let you know if I find something, but please do start the article with whatever you have - I will join in if there will be anything I will be able to add. BTW, does the book mention when Automobiles Ford became Ford SAF?

<p>Bravada, I´m now a owner of a Chevrolet Astra CD (my 1998 Marea engine blown-up!). I made a litle research about the Astra here in Brazil and it seems that it saw a different history here. The Astra was facelifted in early 2003 (before the Astra H introduction) only in Brazil. The interior panel was facelifted again in 2005 (it's a pitty because I've bought a 2004 Astra and the new panel is pretty beutiful!!!). The new Opel Astra (H) will probably never saw the light in Brazil because it's design was borowed for the Chevrolet Vectra, which is based on the Chevrolet Astra platform!!! The engine of the Astra 2.0 (116cv) is the same of the Chevrolet Monza (a rather old car even by brazilian standards! And very few information exists on wikipedia about the brazilian Monza - based on the Ascona). The current brazilian Astra received a <i>Flexpower</i> engine which can use petrol or alcohol or any mix of those (121cv with petrol and 127cv with alcohol). The Astra SS model was also introduced in 2006. See the photos on <a href="http://www.fastdriver.com.br/site/noticia/not582_19.asp#foto" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fastdriver.com.br/site/noticia/not582_19.asp#foto" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (click on any image of the Astra to see more). The interior is very <i>unique</i>. I'll try to summarize more information about the Chevrolet Astra an will put it into the Opel Astra article. If it gets too long then we create an article for the Chevrolet Astra and link to it from the Opel Astra article.

<p>I have put together the bare bones of an article on Ford Germany from what info I have. There is loads of stuff on the web about the relationship between the company and the Nazi party but I will leave that to someone else. I know nothing of the truck manufacture which is why it is omitted. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolma_ac3d.html" title="User:Malcolma">Malcolma</a> 10:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was looking at the GM engines (family 0, 1, 2...) on wikipedia and found very litle information about the brazilian flex-fuel engined (FlexPower). GM do Brasil seems even to have made a Multipower engine (ethanol, petrol or LPG based engine). The problem is that I don't know nothing about engines! And I don't know either where to find the engine designation numbers. Did you know someone who kwnows something&#160;:-) about engines that could work with me on this? By the way I did nothing yet about the SIMCA...&#160;:-( Regards <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 16:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
