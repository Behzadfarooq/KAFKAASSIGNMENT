<p>Maeda entered the Kodokan at 18 or 19 and got his reputation there. It is not known exactly how much Tenjin Shinyo-ryu he studied as a boy but it wasn't a huge amount - he was not an expert. He was a Judo guy - simple as that. Oh and its spelled Japanese.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 10:47, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It' a shame to see this kind of vandalism which goes without any sources to back it up. Maeda, the father of BJJ was an incredible Judoka. Let's see what the book about Maeda by Stanlei Virgílio (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 85-87585-24-X</a>: bibliographic information: Virgílio, Stanlei - Conde Koma: O Invencível yodan da história / Stanlei Virgílio - Campinas - SP, Editora Átomo: 1-Japoneses - Brasil, Norte 2. Jiu-jitsu - Brasil 3. Judô - Brasil 4. Maeda, Otávio Mitsuyo)
<dl>
<dd>Born in November, 18, 1878 in Aomori province, Hirosaki city, Funazawa village he attended to Kenritsu Itiu, a school from Hirosaki. While a child, although with a defined physic with strong arms and hips and legs he didn't have the ideal body for <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumo.html" title="Sumo">sumo</a> practice, the sport he was practicing without much success. For this reason, after hearing comments about confrontations between Judo and the jiu-jitsu of that time, in which were exalted the names of Yokoyama, Shiro Saigo, Yamashita, Hajime Izogai, Suiti Nagaoka, Oda Tsunetane and other heroes of the Kodokan, who formed the first generation of fighters and teachers of that entity, he choose to follow the path and ideals of Judo since he thought it was the best for him.</dd>
<dd>This way, at seventeen year old, in 1894, he entered Waseda university, in the capital, and registered too in the Kodokan, which had moved from Hongo Shinsatyo to Koishgawa Shimatozokatyo, with a dojo of 100 tatamis.</dd>
<dd>Maeda came to the Kodokan with 1,64m and 64 kg, arriving at the capital from the rural country, was confused with the paper boy. Master Jigoro Kano with great discernment spotted him and recognized his valor and put him under the smaller of the teachers, Tsunejiro Tomita, showing that in Judo size was unimportant. Timita was a 5th dan and took Maeda under his care.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Well, this is a great book, I could go on and on to show that Maeda was a Judoka, not a Tenshi Ryu practitioner. But I will not. The information provided above will be merged in the Maeda Article, but I have to find time to do that. But in the light of seeing this vandalism in the BJJ article I am writing it, translating it from Portuguese to English in a hurry (as can be seen in the bad spelling and grammatical errors above...). It's consensus that BJJ came from Judo. I would even not list Ju-Jutsu in the origin since Maeda was a Judoka and to a less extent a Sumo fighter too.

<p>I have tried to contact the user DrParkes who is constantly vandalizing the BJJ article, which we all fought hard to improve (still need lots of attention though). I have provided the reasoning on the section above, but the user keeps misbehaving himself and reverting the edits which were backed up by historical facts and references, introducing his own interpretations on the facts. He completely ignores the talk pages and also his own <a href="../../../d/r/p/User_talk%7EDrParkes_45e7.html" title="User talk:DrParkes">talk page</a>. I don't understand this disrupting behavior, nor what one gains by doing so. Wikipedia is already criticized (without justification) for its inaccuracies, we do not need to help this wrong image prevail. I really would like some help from administrators to solve this issue. I would start by blocking this user from editing this article for a few days.

<p>While I have nothing against BJJ itself - it is an excellent fighting system/sport - I find it extrmely aggravating, to put it mildly, that the Gracies and their followers far more often than not fail to acknowledge judo, particularly kosen judo, as being the true root of BJJ. Sensei Mitsuyo Maeda, the man who introduced jujutsu (or jiu-jitsu, as they insist upon spelling it) to Brazil in the first place, spent four years training extensively in judo and traditional jujutsu in his native Japan before traveling to Brazil where he taught Carlos Gracie. I say this as a shodan (black belt) in judo and a practitioner of Brazilian jujutsu. You've got a great system, guys; just do not forget that Jigoro Kano, Mitaemon Tanabe' and, of course, Maeda are the grandfathers of what you call "Brazilian" jujutsu. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.214.47.178_5e9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.214.47.178">68.214.47.178</a> (talk) 22:51, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>How do you figure? Have you ever read <i>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Practice</i> by Royler and Renzo Gracie? The authors definitely emphasize the importance of Kano and Maeda in the development of BJJ. Akqjt 06:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, this is a misconception to say that Maeda practiced jiu-jitsu. Maeda was the second generation of Kodokan Judoka. He did Sumo as a youngster but with 1m64cm and 70kg he wasn't fit to Sumo. He went to train Judo at the kodokan. He never did "old-school" jiu-jitsu. When Maeda, Lako, Shimitsu, Satake and Okura arrived in Brazil all the newspapers acknowledge Maeda as a jiu-jitsu world champion even being sent from the Kodokan. Judo was almost unknown outside Japan, and all the Japanese fight was jiu-jitsu. That's the source of the confusion. It was only in 1956 that the Kodokan sent Yoshio Kihara to Brazil to introduce the nage-no-kata and to specifically separata Judo from Jiu-Jitsu, but that was too late for the Gracies to embrace a new name and BJJ is Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, not Brazillian Judo.

<p>Well, I just know that most of the jiu-jitsu guys, at least in the Atlanta area, tend to ignore their Japanese roots. One dojo in particular I'm thinking of, they have a Brazilian and an American flag side by side, but no Japanese flag. I insisted that they put one up, but of course I couldn't force them. Also, you know that legendary "Fight", so-called anyway, between Maeda and Gracie? Yeah, well, they try to make it sound like it was a fight, but, truth be told, it was Gracie demonstrating his ability to take a lot of falls, not much else.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here in Brazil we call BJJ simply Jiu-Jitsu, no need to call it brazilian jiu-jitsu. Only in english language advertising the brazillian is pre-pended. You won't find a jiu-jitsu (by that I mean Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) academy with japanese flags around here... It's considered (and indeed it is) a brazilian martial art (or should I say sport?). Since 1920s it almost evolved by itself, with the Gracies. It's even harder to see this japanese root acknowledged overseas... But, even if it descended from old japanese jiu-jitsu, then this would be a japanase root too. You won't find a brazillian football (soccer for USA residents, football for the rest of the world) club with english flags, even tough football come from england. I think that's the correct reasoning behind all that. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELoudenvier_da01.html" title="User:Loudenvier">Loudenvier</a> 18:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don´t try arguing with Loudenvier or his alternate sockpuppet identities. Loudenvier/FlowWTG/Nate will just get you banned and have your contributions hounded off Wikipedia. Disagreeing with anything they say is punishable by eradication. One only has to look at that proud martyr to Truth, DrParkes.</p>

<p>I do judo, I do traditional jujitsu and I do BJJ.
