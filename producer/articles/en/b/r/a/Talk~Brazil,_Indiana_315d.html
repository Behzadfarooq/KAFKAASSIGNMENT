<p>Hi. A few details that could be interesting for the article: first, a question of mine: how does one call a citizen of Brazil, Indiana? A Brazilian, as in the country? Second, a couple of things I picked up from a tv report a saw a while back (basically, a Brazilian – the country in South America – tv crew paid a visit to the city in the US that had the same name as the country): First, about the origins of the name: apparently, the founders of the city (then just a settlement) were thinking of a name for the place, when one of them saw in a newspaper news of a mining conflict in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. He liked the name and suggested it to the others, who approved it. Sorry, I don't have more specifics (such as who this person was, or the exact date when this happened); Finally, the town of Brazil has a 18th century Portuguese colonial water fountain in its main square, which was donated by the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> government to the city, in commemoration of their namesake. The fountain apparently doesn't work today. Again, I'm sorry that I don't have the date when the donation was made or the people involved in it. Still could be interesting though, but I'm not sure of how or where to insert it in the article. Perhaps a new "Trivia" section?

<dd>I've lived in Brazil for a little more than three years, and near it since 1989. As far as I know, there is no real common term referring to a person from Brazil, IN. Generally, one would just say that someone "is from" or "lives in" Brazil. The article refers to the people of Brazil pronouncing it as "Brayzill" or "Braayzeeull". I've not heard someone from Brazil pronounce it that way, unless they were making a joke. Typically, the only people that use that particular pronunciation are non-locals that are making derogatory comments about the city or residents. I have heard the legend of Brazil's naming, but don't know if there's any truth to it. As for the fountain, I've never seen it operate but I do know that it's a the entrance of Forest Park, and holds a nativity scene during the Christmas season. When I get home next week, I'll see if I can find the dates relating to the fountain. If you're interested, I also have some photos. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianFane_8791.html" title="User:BrianFane">BrianFane</a> 13:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I moved to Brazil in 1999 and am leaving as soon as possible - the place is hell if you're under 65 (IMO). My wife, who is a native, does say "Bray-zill" on occasion. As far as "Brazilian", the bowling alley here is called "Brazilian Lanes". Also, I'm not sure about Orville Redenbacher. My wife said he may have lived here at one time, but he was actually born in Cory, which is south of Brazil, though still in Clay County. Also, she is the one who told me Henry Lee Summer's real name as she used to watch him play basketball for the old Brazil High School Red Devils--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 05:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My late paternal grandmother served on the Brazil City Council for several years, and my father is active in the Clay Community Theater. Having lived in Brazil, Indiana the majority of my life so far (from birth to the age of twenty-five), I believe I can offer some insight relevant to the discussion. Concerning the question of how one refers to a citizen of Brazil, Indiana, I always thought "Brazilian" was the most appropriate term. Concerning the city pronunciation, most residents pronounce it the way the South American country is pronounced, but I've heard a fair number of its older and/or more rural inhabitants pronounce it with the emphasis on the first syllable and a de-emphasized, almost swallowed, second syllable, with the "A" sound resembling the vowel in "cat" - "BRAH-zull." My father went to school with Henry Lee Summer, formerly known as Henry "Hank" Schwartz, who is related to my late fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Frost. My late maternal grandfather knew Orville Redenbacher. Coincidentally, I discovered earlier this week (on Wikipedia no less) that Orville Redenbacher lived his last years in Coronado, California, where I am currently stationed with the Navy. Small world. I also happen to agree with MarshallStack's comment, that Brazil is hellish (and not just if you're under sixty-five). Many of the people I grew up around were ridiculously bigoted; racism, sexism, and religious discrimination are firmly entrenched in the local mindset. I had the good fortune to be a member of a reasonably open-minded and well-educated family, but many of the people I knew there are ignorant and apathetic; they don't know any better and they don't want to learn. I am glad to have escaped. Zachary C. Sneddon 05:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, Zachary. I agree with everything you've said about the bigotry, etc. I came here in 1999 from the South Bend area (married a local girl) and never adjusted. We're getting the hell out of here (to Michigan) as soon as our house sells. I think I may know your father, by the way.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 06:50, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
