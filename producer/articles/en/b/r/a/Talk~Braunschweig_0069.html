The Brunswick website says, that the origins of the town are unknown, and that it may be founded by traders. So do other websites. No word about a Bruno. Instead of deleting the sentence I turned it to the version: "Legend says, that..." But actually I don't know about such a legend.

<dd>I am bothered by this paragraph as well.

<dd>I believe the english name is the mediaeval name of Braunschweig. Brunswiek, if I remember correctly. I learned that in school, so I have no references. And I also learned about the legend that this Bruno founded a Wiek (whatever that is) from which Braunschweig derived 134.76.10.66 13:07, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While you get lots of hits on "Brunswick Germany", many are not relevant. First, I used the advanced search feature and searched only for the exact phrase - only 3,640 hits, some of which are Wikipedia. Second, even of those, many refer to the historical Duchy which, while related, is <b>not</b> the same as the city. Third, a quick review showed that most of the relevant google hits were listing Brunswick in brackets or parentheses after the more commonly recognized "Braunschweig". A search on the exact phrase "Braunschweig Germany" finds 208,000 hits. (Note that searching for <i>Germany</i> instead of <i>Deutschland</i> will filter it down to the english language sites so we have a fair comparison.)</dd>
<dd>The Rand McNally World Atlas index lists "Brunswick, Germany" but the entry says <i>see Braunschweig</i>. Even the Wall Street Journal uses "Braunschweig" instead of "Brunswick".</dd>
<dd>I propose to move the contents of this page to Braunschweig, expand the disambiguation page to make the issue clear to everyone, redirect "Brunswick" to the disambiguation page and then run a "what links here" and start cleaning up all the links. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 02:51, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Brunswick, Germany, should be at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>. The English name has fallen out of use for the present city (compare Google results for "Brunswick Germany" vs "Braunschweig Germany"). --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 18:30, Nov 25, 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's not true.

<li>You have to include the quotes, otherwise you get a lot of pages relating to the historic duchy, or to one of the U.S. Brunswicks, or New Brunswick.

<li><a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunswick%2C_Germany_9ad6.html" title="Brunswick, Germany">Brunswick, Germany</a> should not be at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a> if Brunswick is the more common name in English. The city's own website calls itself Brunswick on the English pages. <a href="http://www.braunschweig.de/e/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.braunschweig.de/e/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 04:00, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. Wikipedia policy is not to have the english version of a name but the most common version used <i>in</i> english. That clearly is Brunswick, not <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>, so Brunswick is where the page belongs on the english wikipedia. German wikipedia, would needless to say be different. Sorry. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 03:33, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In addition, remember even if <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a> is used increasingly in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_english.html" title="American english">American english</a>, that does not mean the same phenomenon is happening in other forms of english. AE has tended to adopt nativised forms of names, eg, Turino, Milano, Roma, but that simply is not happening in British English, Hiberno-English or Indian English and I wonder if it is happening in Canadian English or Australian english. This is <i>english</i> wikipedia, not <i>American English</i> wikipedia and we must use forms of names that are internationally recognised. Google searches throw up largely American websites as most websites are American. That is no evidence that <i>worldwide</i> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a> is either used or even recognised by people. The only people I have heard ever use that name are (i) Germans, naturally, and (ii) <i>some</i> users of American English on the web (never even in person). I have never heard it used by anyone else. We would want pretty clear evidence of its universal usage before opting for it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I respect the theory but I'm not sure I agree that this is an American English only trend. For example, the Wikipedia article on the capital of China is at <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> - Peking is a redirect. In the case of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunswick.html" title="Brunswick">Brunswick</a>, I'd like to see some evidence that the anglicized version is still in wide use. The objective evidence the other way is starting to appear pretty compelling (see below). The only countervailing evidence presented so far is the personal experience of Wikipedians. I don't want to discount personal experience but, based on the reports above, it appears about evenly split so ... well, I guess I do discount it in this case.&#160;:-) What more research can I provide to convince you that Braunschweig has become the more common usage? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 03:21, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well-filtered google searches find Braunschweig over Brunswick at &gt; 50 to 1.</li>
<li>BBC.com (which I have to assume is written using British English) had 4 hits for Braunschweig and only one hit for Brunswick that refers to the city in Germany (and that one is in context of WW2).</li>
<li>FT.com (Financial Times) (again, safe to assume in British English) returned 20 articles for Braunschweig Germany and zero for Brunswick Germany.</li>
<li>CNN.com had one hit for Braunschweig and five for Brunswick, but <b>none</b> of the five refer to the city in Germany.</li>
<li>Factiva all dates/all sources finds 1423 articles with "Braunschweig Germany" and 195 with "Brunswick Germany".</li>
<li>Two atlases checked so far use Braunschweig as the primary name (though they both list Brunswick as an alternate usage).</li>
<li>The city's official website has an English translation page that uses "Brunswick".
<ul>
<li>Personally, I discount this as the opinion of one webmaster with unknown English experience and possibly dated information. (I know I wouldn't trust Cleveland's official website to tell you anything useful about <i>my</i> hometown.)</li>

<p>As to google, google also says that the Prince of Wales's surname is <i>Windsor</i> (wrong), <i>proves</i> completely inaccurate facts about W.E.

It is a thoroughly unreliable standard against which to measure facts, as I found when double checking information on it time and time again. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:08, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but still it is the default unless you have a better authority to base your claim on.

<dd>It should <i>never</i> be the default. If it was wikipedia's default, wikipedia would be a laughing stock. It is at best a secondary source notorious for its unreliability. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 15:47, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Google may not be a reliable source for many kinds of factual information, but as a polling device to provide evidence of general usage of language or the degree of importance or interest in a topic, I believe it to be quite credible. Granted, there is risk of a systemic sampling bias because the internet population is still skewed toward educated and affluent participants compared to the general population, but that is only a <b>risk</b> of sampling bias, not evidence that a biased result occurred. Wikipedia uses google searches as evidence all the time. As a single example, look at how often google is mentioned in support or rebuttal of an entry on the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> page. The internet may not be perfect but it's better than relying solely on personal opinion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 21:56, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I don't think AE/BE is an issue here. Where do you get the idea Americans say Roma? "Rome Italy" - 2,060,000. "Roma Italy" - 207,000. So that's 10-1 for the English name. With Braunschweig it's 50-1 for the German. So the frequency of using the local form is 500 times higher for Braunschweig than for Rome. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a> 23:58, Dec 4, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't say Americans use <i>Roma</i>. I said that there is increased usage of native language names of European cities in the US. Such a phenomenon simply does not exist in the rest of the English speaking world. So whereas some academic and broadcasting organisations in the US opt for <i>Milano</i>, in the rest of the english speaking world exclusively uses <i>Milan</i>.</p>
<p>By the way the earlier mention of Beijing/Peking by Rossami is irrelevant. It is nothing to do with english vs native language names, but to do with different linguistic methods of creating an english name. Everyone uses Beijing and have done for decades. It has no relevance to this debate. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 15:47, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. Beijing/Peking is not merely a choice of written transcription. It is also an example of the difficulty of phenome matching - some sounds have no easy parallel in the target language. Before long-distance travel became cheap and easy, the experience of most english-speakers with german phenomes was quite limited. Brunswick was a reasonable transliteration of word by a non-german speaker. We now have greater exposure to more phenomes. If you heard someone say Braunschweig today, I dare say you would write down something other than Brunswick. As for "everyone [using] Beijing... for decades", I can personally vouch for the use of Braunschweig by Americans for over a decade. Braunschweig/Brunswick is merely an older example that has gone uncorrected longer, not fundamentally a different problem from Beijing/Peking. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 21:56, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lexis-Nexis suggests Braunschweig is more in use: A search for "Braunschweig" and "Germany" on European news sources for the past six months gets 25 hits, most appear relevant, whilst "Brunswick" and "Germany" gets 10 hits, most irrelevant. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 05:46, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>European news sources aim their content at multilingual audiences and so make considerable usage of native language names. That is irrelevant here as this wikipedia is exclusively an english language encyclopædic source aimed at english language speakers and has to use a form recognisable in english. <i>Braunschweig</i> would mean absolutely nothing to millions of english language speakers except those belonging to special subcategories; people of German descent, people with direct cultural and business links to the city, people with regular access to, and fluency in, non-english language sources, etc. Wikipedia policy is to use the most common accurate name. For the generality of readers worldwide that is <i>Brunswick</i>. <i>Braunschweig</i> 's usage is not recognised by the generality of readers but those attached to subgroups who have specific reason why <i>they</i> would use or hear the german language name, not the english deriviative. (By the way, BBC news carried a story some days ago which started "A trial in the German city of Brunswick . . .

<dd>So we should put ourselves out of step with European <b>and</b> US news sources? Who is left that we will be in-step with? We agree on the policy - most common english usage. We obviously still disagree on the conclusion. I've presented my facts. I believe they overwhelmingly support <i>Braunschweig</i> as the more common usage. I disagree strongly with your statement that <i>Braunschweig</i> is limited to special subcategories. So prove me wrong. What facts or measurable behaviors support your belief that <i>Brunswick</i> is still the more common usage? <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 21:56, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

<p>Just to put my own two cents in (of course, just because it's me, Jtdirl will probably oppose it) I would favor "Brunswick" being a disambiguation page and "Braunschweig" being the listing for the German city. But there clearly is an AE/BE problem; I rarely hear Americans use "Brunswick" for the German city, but in part that may be because I live in Maryland and "Brunswick" means "Brunswick, Md." when used alone. Brits tend to anglicize (they would say, of course, "anglicise") more than Americans; Americans tend to use native names more, but the real statistic varies from place to place. Nobody even America calls the Italian capital "Roma," but you do hear "Milano," and I suspect that "Livorno" is used 1000 times as much as "Leghorn." (of course, the <i>chicken</i> is a Leghorn, but that's another story!) - <a href="../../../b/r/g/User%7EBRG_b05e.html" title="User:BRG">BRG</a> 16:34, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Just to put my own two cents in (of course, just because it's me, Jtdirl will probably oppose it)'</i>!!! absolutely not. If you are right, you are right. If you are wrong, you are wrong.

<p>To add my US$0.02, I don't think it makes <i>that</i> much difference either way. I'm personally more familiar with the name "Brunswick," but I can't say with absolute confidence that that's not because of the other cities named "Brunswick" ("New Brunswick" and so on). As long as there are redirects from one to the other, and both are mentioned at the very beginning, I don't think anyone looking for one or the other will end up confused. And, unlike Gdansk/Danzig and related disputes, this isn't an ethnic dispute, so I think people looking for one are unlikely to be offended if they find it at the other. My slight preference in borderline cases is for local names, perhaps because I prefer things like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaloniki.html" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesos.html" title="Peloponnesos">Peloponnesos</a> to their Latinized or Anglicized versions. Cases of overwhelming English usage like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> (<i>Roma</i>) and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> (<i>Athina</i>) excepted of course. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 22:47, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support using English names wherever available. The fact that the name of a city was translated into another language is a sign of its importance. Hence using Brunswick means treating this city with the same respect as Bruxelles, The Hague, or Vienna. -- 134.169.99.111 10:45, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a quick explanation for my vote - it seems that from the evidence we've been able to find, and my personal experience, Braunschweig is now by far the most common way the place is referred to in English.</p>

<p>I voted for "don't care" because I'm not a native speaker and have no idea what the more common English name is. I thought it was Brunswick, but seem to have been proven wrong. However, if the article is moved to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>, I think that <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunswick.html" title="Brunswick">Brunswick</a> should stay a redirect and not be turned back into a disambiguation page - if it is, it will only continue to collect links, <i>all</i> of which will refer to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braunschweig.html" title="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>.

<p>"It" seems to refer to both the town and a military unit.
