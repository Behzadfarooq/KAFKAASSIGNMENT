<p><i><b>Braceface</b></i> was a Canadian <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_series.html" title="Animated series">animated series</a> formerly broadcasted on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teletoon.html" title="Teletoon">Teletoon</a> in Canada, and on the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Channel_faad.html" title="Disney Channel">Disney Channel</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Family_f6c6.html" title="ABC Family">ABC Family</a> in the United States.

It is aimed at pre-teens and teenagers, and presents situations that more mature kids can understand. The show is somewhat infamous in the U.S.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> as appearing to be more for the younger set, though topics like PMS, homosexuality and teacher/student romantic relationships are alluded to.</p>
<p>The show, set in southern <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, is based around 13-14 year old <b><a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Spitz_633a.html" title="Sharon Spitz">Sharon Spitz</a></b> (voiced by Silverstone), who is an eighth grader with <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tooth_braces.html" title="Tooth braces">braces</a>. It seems as if her braces always get in her way of leading a normal teenage life. In the first season she studies at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Pickford_4f22.html" title="Mary Pickford">Mary Pickford</a> junior high, and in the second season she and her friends moved on to high school.</p>

<p>The show's characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sharon Spitz</b> A teenager who wears braces, as the show's name suggests, Sharon was popular in Jr. High School (which she was attending when the series began). Sharon's main rival is <b>Nina Harper</b>, who followed Sharon to <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a>. In high school, Sharon faces trouble trying to gain popularity, as she is seen by most students as inferior because she is a ninth grader (the lowest high school grade in North American high schools). Sharon's family members include her father Richard, her mother Helen, her two brothers Adam and Josh, two <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dogs</a>, and three <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat.html" title="Cat">cats</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharon's best friend is Maria Wong and her other friends are Connor MacKenzie, Alden Jones and Brock Leighton. She has a huge crush on Alden and evenutally he becomes her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Sharon, like Silverstone, is an animal rights supporter, and a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarian.html" title="Vegetarian">vegetarian</a>.</p>
<p>Many times, her braces form a central part of <i>Braceface</i>s plots, as they are magnets, which leads Sharon to unintentionally attract different objects and get into embarrassing situations.</p>
<p><a name="Other_characters" id="Other_characters"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/a/Braceface.html" title="Edit section: Other characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other characters</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Ms. Helen Spitz</b> Sharon's mom, is one hard-working lady. Not only is she a successful as a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychologist.html" title="Psychologist">psychologist</a> who sees <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clients.html" title="Clients">clients</a> in her home office, she’s also a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_mother.html" title="Single mother">single mother</a> raising three kids. And despite having to juggle a lot of balls in the air, Helen is a great mom who does her best to stay ‘in touch’ with her kids. This sometimes takes the form of ‘psychoanalysing’ Sharon and her brothers - which drives them crazy. Sharon sums up her mom in three sentences. Means well, love her dearly, doesn’t get it. Helen divorced Sharon’s dad when Sharon was six, but her parents still get along well. Helen is now dating a guy named David who, in Sharon’s opinion, is a dork. Harmless, but definitely a dork.</li>
<li><b>Adam Spitz</b> Seventeen-year-old Adam is Sharon’s gigantic older brother. Thanks to a recent growth spurt, Adam is going through a real awkward phase - so it’s a good thing he can laugh at himself. Like most older brothers, Adam just loves to tease his little sister and likes to play pranks on her. But when Sharon really needs to talk to someone, Adam is a surprisingly good listener and a helping hand when she is in big problems. Sharon and Adam go to the same high school, so if Sharon gets herself into a mess, Adam’s sure to hear about it through the grapevine. But most of the time, he’s happy to stay out of her business. When Adam’s not at <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling.html" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a> <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practice.html" title="Practice">practice</a> or working out on his home gym in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basement.html" title="Basement">basement</a>, he’s usually hanging out with his <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petite.html" title="Petite">petite</a>, yoga-loving girlfriend, Hannah.</li>
<li><b>Josh Spitz</b> Sharon's younger brother, an <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspiring.html" title="Aspiring">aspiring</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianist.html" title="Pianist">pianist</a>. In fact Sharon often says to anyone who needs to see him; "If you’re looking for my little brother, just shut your eyes and follow the sound of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_music.html" title="Classical music">classical music</a>!", as ten-year-old (he was originally nine at the start of the series, but had a birthday) Josh is not just aspiring but something of a <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_prodigy.html" title="Child prodigy">prodigy</a>, and he spends a lot of his time (As his older brother or sister puts it) <i>"Practising symphonies by various dead guys"</i>. Some day, Josh will definitely be a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional.html" title="Professional">professional</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a> like his dad. Away from the piano, Josh is a normal ordinary kid. He likes video games, fast food, and playing with the family dogs and cats. Sharon cares deeply for Josh and both couldn't be closer, with no conflicts between them - other than when he’s being a nusiance (Or as Sharon would state; <i>"Having a bratty day"</i>) such as when Sharon sort to spend time with Alden only for Josh to go and spoil it for her at every turn (his mocking reactions when he learned of her hoped romance with Jones didn't go down to well with her or for him during the outcome). Oh or when his piano playing is getting on her nerves while she's doing a task like <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homework.html" title="Homework">homework</a> or something even more important like writing an email to a <i>special someone</i> or some other major priority (particularly if she's carrying on a phone conversation with a friend or a potential <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beau.html" title="Beau">beau</a>). Or inconvenience due to having to babysit him when she's involved in "alternative arrangements" her style getting cramped is normally the least of Josh's worries when such an event occurs. But basically on the whole, for a little brother...Josh is pretty cool and at times wise beyond his years when it comes to giving out advice to her, his family or anyone willing to listen. Perhaps because of his <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent.html" title="Innocent">innocent</a> child <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perceptions.html" title="Perceptions">perceptions</a>, he can see things more clearly and less <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complicated.html" title="Complicated">complicated</a> than they normally are to others. Both his older siblings do really love him, though neither Adam nor Sharon wouldn't openly admit it.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Wong_ce1b.html" title="Maria Wong">Maria Wong</a></b> Sharon's best friend, she is very into sports and the tomboyish type. She is laid back but incredibly organized. Sharon’s best pal Maria is a real ‘rock’. Loyal and honest, Maria knows when to give Sharon a shoulder to cry on, and when to tell her to ‘get over herself.’ She’d do absolutely anything for Sharon - except go on a double date with that goof Brock Leighton. Even best-friendship has its limits. Maria loves extreme sports, and she’s always trying to get her friends to join her - but Sharon and Connor don’t share Maria’s thirst for danger or her competitive streak. So Maria usually ends up whizzing down the snowboarding pipe on her own, while her friends cheer her on from a safe distance. Maria also happens to be brilliant in school, but she’s no goody-goody. She and Sharon have been ‘partners in crime’ on more than one occasion! Maria’s background is as diverse as her interests - as she’s <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_race.html" title="Mixed race">mixed race</a>, half-<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_people.html" title="Chinese people">Chinese</a> and half-<a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian</a>, and she embraces all the good stuff both <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultures.html" title="Cultures">cultures</a> have to offer. Although, learning <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_calligraphy.html" title="Chinese calligraphy">Chinese calligraphy</a> was definitely more her parents’ idea. When Sharon was spying on her and a teacher, Maria kept slipping her feet out of her shoes and Sharon made the comment that her feet smell bad. One episode had Maria dealing with feelings for a teacher of hers and thought he was trying to gain her attention, but was disappointed when she learned he requested she join him along with several other students to request they volunteer as he felt they all had potential in becoming teachers themselves. Maria is disappointed, but learned it was probably better the teacher was behaving professionally.</li>
<li><b>Alden Jones</b> This guy to most seems the height of cool. Guys like him, girls flock to him...he’s good-looking and easygoing. But the nicest thing about Alden is that he has no clue just how adorable he is. He’s always stunned when he hears that girls think he’s cute. “Me? Are you sure?” Not that Alden’s uncomfortable with the ladies - he has three sisters, so girls are no big mystery to him. Like a lot of guys, Alden’s into video games and sports. He’s a talented hockey player, and he plays guitar in a band called “Mangled Metal” with his buddies Brock and Carmen. They practice really hard, and many think the band’s gotten pretty good! They won’t be playing Madison Square Garden any time soon, but that doesn’t stop Alden from having rock-star dreams. He was Sharon's first <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crush.html" title="Crush">crush</a>, whom still keeps a friendship-boyfriend and girlfriend type of relationship with Sharon.</li>
<li><b>Connor MacKenzie</b> Sharon's other best friend who plays the show's stereotypical <i><a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">geek</a></i>. He lives in her neighbourhood and treats Josh as a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrogate.html" title="Surrogate">surrogate</a> little brother, who Josh can come to if he's having a problem his family can't help him with. Connor has been Sharon’s neighbour and friend since diaper days - so long that sometimes Sharon forgets he’s part of the same confusing species that boyfriends come from. Connor and Sharon enjoy all the same stuff - hanging out at the smoothie shop, going to the movies, doing <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">yoga</a>... Well, maybe not ALL the same stuff. Connor’s allergic to <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">yoga</a>. Actually, he’s allergic to pretty much everything. Thanks to his awkwardness, allergies and a touch of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypochondria.html" title="Hypochondria">hypochondria</a>, Connor has a reputation as an oddball - but Sharon and his good friends know that there’s way more to ‘the walking sneeze’ than that. He’s a whiz at science, believes in <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra-terrestrial_life.html" title="Extra-terrestrial life">extra-terrestrial life</a>, and he plays a wicked game of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cards.html" title="Cards">cards</a>. And when it comes right down to it, Connor doesn’t care what most people think of him. He’s okay with himself. And as long as his friends are too, what’s the problem? Connor eventually overcomes some of his oddball ways to sum up the courage to tell Allison how he feels about her.</li>
<li><b>Nina Harper</b> the school's most <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_girl.html" title="Popular girl">popular girl</a> who makes it personal to try to make Sharon's life impossible. Beautiful and vicious, Nina Harper is someone you do not want to cross. Sharon got on Nina’s bad side many years ago, when someone snapped the heads off all of little Nina’s precious <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unique.html" title="Unique">unique</a> <a href="../../../d/o/l/Doll.html" title="Doll">dolls</a>...and Nina decided that Sharon was the guilty party. Ever since, Nina’s been doing her best to wreck Sharon’s life and those who dare attach themselves too her. Example: Nina was the one who stuck Sharon with the nickname "Braceface"- and for that, Sharon will never forgive her. Nina has all the money a kid could ever want, and a wardrobe that Sharon would give her right arm for. She’s also smart enough to be at the top of her class. So for Nina, the big dilemma is should she <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduation.html" title="Graduation">graduate</a> from a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> before or after her <a href="../../../c/a/r/Career.html" title="Career">career</a> as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/International.html" title="International">international</a> <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion.html" title="Fashion">fashion</a> <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_%28person%29.html" title="Model (person)">model</a>? Part of this reinforces her attitude as a heartless <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bully</a> who subjugates those she sees as <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flawed.html" title="Flawed">flawed</a> to ridicule and pull spiteful pranks on people like Sharon or Connor. Not many kids actually like Nina - but there are quite a few who wouldn’t mind being her. Loved by adults, feared by her peers - Nina Harper is a force to be reckoned with.</li>
<li><b>Mr. Richard Spitz</b> Sharon's <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musician.html" title="Musician">musician</a> father, having a dad who’s a professional rock drummer is fun - except for the part about his being out on <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour.html" title="Tour">tour</a> all the time. And since the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a>, it’s been even harder for Sharon to spend time with her father. But Richard is determined to be the best dad he can be - so he keeps an apartment in <a href="../../../e/l/k/Elkford.html" title="Elkford">Elkford</a>, and he’s made a few <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifestyle.html" title="Lifestyle">lifestyle</a> changes so he won’t be on the road as much. Which is great! But Sharon knows that whether he’s in town or not, her Dad will always be there for her when she needs him.</li>
<li><b>Brock Leighton</b> Brock is Alden’s best buddy and co-founder of their band. He’s the kind of guy who’s always trying to get attention - like once, he tried to tattoo a ‘B’ on his arm, but it came out looking like a 13 instead. Which freaks people right out, but at least it gets Brock noticed. If you drew a map of Brock’s brain, there would be a corner for the band, a couple of parts labelled ‘school’ and ‘sports’ - then a great big chunk reserved for thinking about girls. He works really hard at his ‘ladies man’ persona, but he’s not fooling anyone - especially not Maria. Brock’s had a not-so-secret crush on Maria for a long time. Deep down, Brock’s not as confident as he seems. In fact, he’s kind of jealous of how easy it is for Alden to meet girls and come off looking cool. But Brock shouldn’t sell himself short - if you can get him to quit clowning around, you’ll discover that he’s an amazingly sweet guy. A friend of Sharon's, who later goes out with Maria.</li>
<li><b>Allison</b> A sweet girl, rather feminine, and a childhood friend of Nina. She and Nina do not get along at all and Allison becomes a friend of Sharon's. She likes Connor.</li>
<li><b>Marlo</b> An athletic girl who likes hockey, she is a friend of Sharon and Maria. She goes out with Alden after he and Sharon break up.</li>
<li><b>Lauren</b> Mr. Spitz's girlfriend, she works at a publicity promotion company.</li>
<li><b>Griffin</b> Lauren's son, who initially dislikes Sharon a lot. He later goes out with Nina.</li>
<li><b>David</b> Ms. Helen Spitz Boyfriend, he struggles hard to be supportive of her and tries <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_bonding.html" title="Human bonding">bonding</a> with her <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offspring.html" title="Offspring">offspring</a> with not always successful results especially with Sharon or Adam.</li>
<li><b>Hannah</b> Adam's Girlfriend, Sharon in fact helped get her brother and together after she moved into the <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhood.html" title="Neighborhood">neighborhood</a>.</li>
<li><b>Dion (a.k.a. Mark Jones)</b> For Sharon, meeting Dion was the best thing to happen to her in grade nine. This eccentric senior was assigned to Sharon as a ‘mentor’ to help ease the transition into high school, but since then, Dion has become her close friend and confidant. His real moniker is ‘Mark Jones’ but he prefers to go by ‘Dion’ in honour of Celine Dion, the musical diva he adores. Dion is a budding fashion designer, and his innovative creations - usually made of stuff like dental floss or credit cards - are the hit of the school fashion shows. His dream is to get into the Fashion Institute in New York and go on to a fabulous career. Sweet, flamboyant and funny, Dion has an outrageous personal style, and he always speaks his mind. He’d rather stand out than fit in - and Dion has no time for anyone who doesn’t ‘get’ that. When Sharon gets too hung up on what other people think of her, Dion is the first to remind Sharon how cool she really is. Although obviously <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> Mark <i>Dion</i> Jones is shown to be one who doesn't fit the stereotypical <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> character.</li>
