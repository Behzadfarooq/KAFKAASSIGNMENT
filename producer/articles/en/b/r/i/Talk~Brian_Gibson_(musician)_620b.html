	    <p>It's ridiculous to pad out this article by listing every single little compilation appearance that Lightning Bolt has ever made. Those should be left to a discographical link on an external L.B. webpage. The quote Gibson gives about his bass guitar rig is unilluminating and should not be on here. Near the top, it is described as "his bizarre and complex set-up," whereas a few paragraphs down is the phrase, "the simplicity of his musical setup." His playing is "hook-heavy"? Name one "hook" that has ever been in an L.B. "song." L.B. is one of the most anti-"hook" bands there is.</p>
<p>Overall, this article attempts to posit the bassist of a derivative/redundant band as some kind of musical pioneer, and as such should be dramatically downsized, or, preferably, merged with the Lightning Bolt article. The recreation of his rig using a GuitarGeek template (this is known colloquially as showing a "Geeked rig") is unnecessary, and since it is uncredited to GuitarGeek, it is likely illegal. See <a href="http://www.guitargeek.com" class="external text" title="http://www.guitargeek.com" rel="nofollow">Guitar Geek</a>.</p>
<p>This whole article just screams propaganda/bias. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris77xyz_87e5.html" title="User:Chris77xyz">Chris77xyz</a> 20:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seeing as how I contributed/added a great deal of the content you find unnecessary, I'll respond.
<ul>
<li>I for one do not find Lightning bolt derivative nor redundant. Regardless, nowhere in the article is Gibson described as a pioneer. The article breaks down his style and setup in as close to an encyclopedic, matter-of-factly way as I could make it. That said, I can still see your point about it being slightly propaganda/bias (I don't know if it "screams" it, but your point is well taken). I'll edit it down a bit when I get the chance.</li>
<li>Every little compilation appearance LB has ever been on isn't <i>that</i> expansive of a list is it? It's only 13. Furthermore none of the official Lightning Bolt webpages reference all of the compilations mentioned in the article, so merely having an external link would be incomplete. I've thought about making a separate Lightning Bolt discography page, but I don't feel they've released enough music to warrant that. So, I guess you could say they're in the funky area in between.</li>
<li>The contradiction between "his bizarre and complex set-up" and "the simplicity of his musical setup" is also well-noted, I'll see about fixing that too.</li>
<li>Good call on the Guitar Geek picture. I'll update the image description page as best I can.</li>
<li>Seeing as how Gibson is involved in other projects other than LB, I think having his own page is warranted. (Actually, I think it's more warranted for Brian Chippendale, but since he gets one Gibson should too I suppose).</li>
<li>I for one hear alot of hooks in Lightning Bolt songs. I'm by no means a musical expert though, so perhaps my definition of hook differs from the actual meaning. But, it isn't crucial to the article, so I can take it out.</li>
<li>I think the quote from Gibson is good because: a) it's direct source material, b) sheds light on the creation of his rig and his implementation of it, and c) describes Gibon's "sound" in terms of his rig.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So, I'll make some changes, as I described above, and hopefully that'll make the article better. If it's still not up to par, then post something up on the Discussion page and we'll figure it out. Thanks for the comments and keep up the good work!<br />
