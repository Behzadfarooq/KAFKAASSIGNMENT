<p>Brian Woermann attended Milford High School, where he played <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diving.html" title="Diving">dove</a>. After graduating, Woermann obtained a job selling cars and attended college in his spare time.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> Woermann began training under Les Thatcher, proprietor of the Main Event Pro Wrestling Camp in <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evendale%2C_Ohio_5362.html" title="Evendale, Ohio">Evendale, Ohio</a>, much to the chagrin of his mother. He trained under Thatcher for five months, suffering a knee injury in the course of his training. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Woermann wrestled his first match, facing "Bad Boy" Bobby Kane. He then chose the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_name.html" title="Stage name">ring name</a> <b>Matt Stryker</b> and began working for Thatcher's Heartland Wrestling Association. In 2001, Stryker appeared on <a href="../../../w/w/f/WWF_Raw_77b6.html" title="WWF Raw">WWF Raw</a> posing as a police officer who informed <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Undertaker_e9f5.html" title="The Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> that his wife <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara.html" title="Sara">Sara</a> had been in a car accident.</p>

<p>Stryker was initially a <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heel</a>, and defeated Pepper Parks for the vacant HWA Cruiserweight Championship on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_16.html" title="March 16">March 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.

Stryker's second reign lasted until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, 2001, when he lost to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Noble_c8ae.html" title="Jamie Noble">Jamie Knoble</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Woermann_b974.html" title="Edit section: Ring of Honor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ring of Honor</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Stryker began to wrestle for <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_of_Honor_71eb.html" title="Ring of Honor">Ring of Honor</a>. He made his debut at Revenge on The Prophecy in a losing effort against fellow HWA wrestler <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Collyer_5ad9.html" title="Chad Collyer">Chad Collyer</a>. The two competed in a rematch at Expect the Unexpected, with Collyer once again getting the better of Stryker. His next match was a scheduled <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#basic_non-elimination_match" title="Professional wrestling matches">three-way match</a> with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colt_Cabana_1499.html" title="Colt Cabana">Colt Cabana</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Carter_eca8.html" title="Tom Carter">Tom Carter</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samoa_Joe_5d67.html" title="Samoa Joe">Samoa Joe</a>, who won the <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_World_Championship_bb9c.html" title="ROH World Championship">ROH Championship</a> at the previous show, interjected himself in the match after his bout against <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotstuff_Hernandez_91ed.html" title="Hotstuff Hernandez">Hotstuff Hernandez</a>. Joe said if any of the three competitors could defeat him, he would give them the ROH Championship. Despite his best efforts, Stryker once again lost in his third match for the company. This would be the end of his losing streak, as he defeated <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Bentley_3628.html" title="Matt Bentley">Michael Shane</a>, <a href="../../../b/j/_/BJ_Whitmer_a2fc.html" title="BJ Whitmer">BJ Whitmer</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donovan_Morgan_e1d1.html" title="Donovan Morgan">Donovan Morgan</a> and Chad Collyer in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#basic_non-elimination_match" title="Professional wrestling matches">five-way match</a>.</p>
<p>Things appeared to be looking up for Stryker in ROH, as he won his next two matches, but he once again lost to Chad Collyer at Wrestle Rave 2003. The two had a rematch scheduled for Death before Dishonor, but Collyer missed the show due to working in Japan. Stryker instead defeated his replacement, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Rave_d18f.html" title="Jimmy Rave">Jimmy Rave</a>. He also scored a major upset at the following show when he defeated former <a href="../../../e/c/w/ECW_World_Championship_cb75.html" title="ECW World Championship">ECW World Champion</a> <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Credible_d447.html" title="Justin Credible">Justin Credible</a>.</p>
<p>Around this time, ROH began hyping the “Field of Honor” tournament. Eight wrestlers would be divided into two blocks (Block A and Block B), and would wrestle each member of their block. The wrestler with the most wins would wrestle the winner of the other block in the tournament finals. At Bitter Friends, Stiffer Enemies, Matt Stryker wrestled BJ Whitmer, with the winner gaining entry into the tournament. The two wrestled to the fifteen minute time limit, and both gained entry. Stryker would go on to defeat <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Walters_b93e.html" title="John Walters">John Walters</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Sabin_447f.html" title="Chris Sabin">Chris Sabin</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jirus_bad2.html" title="John Jirus">Xavier</a> to win Block A. Whitmer had tied with Colt Cabana and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Maff_ff7a.html" title="Dan Maff">Dan Maff</a> with two wins and one loss apiece. The three wrestled in a three-way tiebreaker match at The Conclusion. Whitmer won the match and would face Stryker at Final Battle 2003. The show prior, the two competed against each other in a gauntlet match. Stryker was the third entry and defeated <a href="../../../c/m/_/CM_Punk_9dee.html" title="CM Punk">CM Punk</a> and Colt Cabana before facing Whitmer in the final match. During the match, Stryker was knocked out on the floor and was being check on by the referee. Whitmer surprised everyone when he threw Stryker back in the ring and hit the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Suplex.html#exploder_suplex" title="Suplex">Wrist-clutch Exploder</a> on him, winning the match. After coming to, Stryker got into an argument backstage with Whitmer continuing the match despite the fact he was knocked out. Whitmer responded by staying that that was pro wrestling, and if he didn’t like it he should quit. At Final Battle 2003, Matt Stryker defeated BJ Whitmer to win the “Field of Honor” in a match that lasted twenty-nine minutes.</p>
<p>At the Second Anniversary Show, Stryker competed in a one night tournament to crown the first <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_Pure_Championship_d589.html" title="ROH Pure Championship">Pure Wrestling Champion</a>. He defeated Josh Daniels in his first round match, but lost to <a href="../../../a/j/_/AJ_Styles_a1e6.html" title="AJ Styles">AJ Styles</a> in his second match. After failing to capture the Pure Wrestling Championship, he set his eyes on the ROH World Championship. At At Our Best he defeated John Walters to become the number one contender for Joe’s title. Stryker lost to a very angry Joe (<a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Erazo_945f.html" title="Nelson Erazo">Homicide</a> had thrown a fireball in his face the previous night, leaving him burned) at Reborn: Stage Two.</p>
<p>At Round Robin Challenge III, Stryker lost to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Shelley_0181.html" title="Alex Shelley">Alex Shelley</a> in the first match of their best-of-three series. The second match, scheduled for World Title Classic, did not take place as originally planed. Shelley, along with his new <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heel</a> faction <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Next_2df2.html" title="Generation Next">Generation Next</a>, told Stryker that since he’s already beaten him in a match, there was no longer a need to continue the series. Instead, he told Stryker that Generation Next was going to take his spot, and that he only had two options about it: step down or get beaten down. When Stryker refused to step down, he was attacked by Generation Next and left a bloody mess after Shelley punched him in the head with a steel chain wrapped around his fist. John Walters and Jimmy Rave, who Generation Next had attacked at the previous show, ran to help Stryker who had to be carried to the back. After disposing of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Evans_46f6.html" title="Jack Evans">Jack Evans</a>, Walters and Rave faced the rest of Generation Next in a three-on-two <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#handicap_match" title="Professional wrestling matches">handicap match</a>. Stryker returned to help Walters and Rave, but they were unable to defeat Generation Next.</p>
<p>Stryker competed in the inaugural Survival of the Fittest, losing in his qualifying match against Samoa Joe. During the match, Stryker was inexplicably heckled by the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> crowd. At Reborn: Completion, Stryker once again competed in a one night tournament to crown a new ROH Pure Champion (A.J. Styles had to vacate the title when he was pulled from all ROH shows by <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling_e010.html" title="Total Nonstop Action Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> after the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Feinstein_6956.html#Legal_problems" title="Rob Feinstein">Rob Feinstein controversy</a>). He competed in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#Basic_non-elimination_match" title="Professional wrestling matches">four-corner survival match</a> against Alex Shelley, CM Punk and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries</a>. Before the match, he was once again attacked by Generation Next, and once again punched in the head by a chain wielding Alex Shelley (who would go on to win the match). Later that evening, Generation Next got into a brawl with CM Punk and the legendary <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Steamboat_cca9.html" title="Ricky Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a>. Steamboat would assemble a team a pure wrestlers (dubbed Team Steamboat) to combat Generation Next. At Death before Dishonor 2: Part One, Matt Stryker teamed up with John Walters and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Jacobs_53ae.html" title="Jimmy Jacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a> to defeat Generation Next in a six-man tag match. They were not so lucky the following night when Stryker and Walters were defeated in a tag match.</p>
<p>Stryker would miss the month of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a>, before returning at Glory by Honor 3 in a match that would major implications on his ROH career. He would square off against <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Lethal_cf3a.html" title="Jay Lethal">Jay Lethal</a> in a match with major stipulations: if Lethal lost he would no longer be booked by ROH, if Stryker lost he would no longer be flown to the East coast shows. After losing to Lethal, Stryker got on the microphone and lashed out at the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> fans. He said he was going to go back to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-west.html" title="Mid-west">mid-west</a> were the fans still respect good wrestlers.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2006.html" title="December 2006">December 2006</a>, Matt Stryker has yet to return to wrestling on the East cost Ring of Honor shows. He still appears on shows in the mid-west.</p>
