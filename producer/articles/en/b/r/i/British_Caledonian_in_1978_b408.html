<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_c69f.html" title="British Caledonian">British Caledonian</a> termed <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> the "Gatwick Year". There were several reasons for this.</p>
<p>By 1978 the airline had fully recovered from the 1974 crisis year, which had threatened its very existence at that time. After the severe contraction forced upon it by the early '70s' oil crisis, the company's core scheduled operation was growing again with new widebodied aircraft and routes being added and schedules being expanded. Furthermore, business was booming with planes being fuller than at any time in the firm's history and it expected to earn record profits during that year.</p>
<p>To underline BCal's confidence about its future prospects, the interiors of the airline's narrowbodied fleet were undergoing a major refurbishment at that time. (These aircraft - including the entire 16-strong, short-haul BAC 1-11 fleet comprising nine larger series 500s and seven smaller series 200s - were given "widebody look" interiors featuring new seat covers that prominently displayed BCal's corporate <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logo.html" title="Logo">logo</a> among several other improvements to give customers the same travel experience as on the newly delivered DC-10s.)</p>
<p>During the second half of 1978 BCal also introduced an updated livery and replaced its single Piper PA-23 "Aztec" acquired in 1975 with a pair of larger <a href="../../../p/i/p/Piper_PA-31_b17b.html" title="Piper PA-31">Piper PA-31</a> "Navajo Chieftains". (BCal used one of these aircraft to inaugurate a new Gatwick-<a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> feeder route at the start of the 1978/'79 winter timetable period.) <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>BCal also became a "scheduled service only" airline during 1978 <sup id="_ref-risk340_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk340" title="">[2]</a></sup> implementing a decision taken the year before when the share of passengers travelling on charter flights had declined to just 15% of all passengers carried (as opposed to two-thirds at the time of the airline's inception seven years earlier). There were two main reason's for BCal's withdrawal from the charter market:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 25% contraction of the transatlantic ABC flights market as a result of the initial success of the daily Laker Airways "Skytrain" low-fares, "no frills" scheduled operation between London Gatwick and New York JFK, which began during the previous year's autumn season. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A steady decline in charter rates in the European package tour holiday market where BCal used to supply whole-plane charter seats to its Blue Sky Holidays tour operator affiliate as well as third party tour companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to "Skytrain", BCal had been a major operator in the ABC market running regular flights to the US, Canada and West Africa from its Gatwick base and a number of other UK departure points. These flights were sold through its Golden Lion Tours tour operator affiliate. BCal found that it could deploy this long-haul capacity far more profitably to increase the number of routes and flights in its most important long-haul scheduled markets because the <a href="../../../y/i/e/Yield.html" title="Yield">yields</a> on its prime long-haul scheduled routes were much higher than in the ABC market.</p>
<p>Although operating short-/medium-haul whole-plane charters enabled the airline to improve the utilisation of its BAC 1-11 fleet - especially at week-ends, the company's increasing focus on the scheduled side of its business (as opposed to charter flights) meant that overall costs were increasing as well. The reason for this increase in costs was the greater number of overheads that were required to support the expanding scheduled operation. This, in turn, meant that the firm had acquired significantly higher costs than most of its contemporary <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter_airline.html" title="Charter airline">charter airline</a> rivals, thereby making it more and more difficult to compete profitably in this market at the prevailing low rates. In addition, there always used to be problems with the aircraft's configuration. <sup id="_ref-friends94_5_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends94_5" title="">[4]</a></sup> (BCal used to operate its short-/medium-haul schedules and charters with the same planes as its whole-plane charter market activities were not of the scale that would have justified keeping a dedicated fleet for these activities. This, of course, meant that the airline was unable to adopt separate high- and low-density seating arrangements to meet the differing, specific requirements of the scheduled and charter markets.) <sup id="_ref-friends94_5_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends94_5" title="">[4]</a></sup> Moreover, there used to be time-keeping issues resulting from operating scheduled and charter flights with the same aircraft that negatively impacted the scheduled services' punctuality whenever these were delayed due to the knock-on effect created by late-incoming charter flights. <sup id="_ref-friends114_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-friends114" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>1978 was the first year BCal operated the majority of its scheduled services plying the prime long-haul routes to West Africa and South America with state-of-the-art widebody equipment.</p>
<p>At the start of that year's summer timetable period flight frequencies on BCal's Gatwick-Glasgow and Gatwick-Amsterdam routes increased to five round-trips per day on week days (Monday to Friday). During that period the airline also resumed its Edinburgh-Newcastle-Copenhagen service, which it had abandoned in 1974.</p>
<p>During 1978 <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abidjan.html" title="Abidjan">Abidjan</a> joined BCal's scheduled route network. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benghazi.html" title="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> and Birmingham joined the network at the start of the 1978/'79 winter timetable period when the airline increased frequencies between London Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle to seven daily round-trips on week days, with flights operating at two-hourly intervals. The addition of twice-weekly flights to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libyan.html" title="Libyan">Libyan</a> port city of Benghazi to the existing five weekly services to Tripoli meant that for the first time BCal was able to offer its passengers daily flights to Libya, an important market for highly profitable, oil-related business travel. <sup id="_ref-baa21_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup> BCal's introduction of a 747 on the daily Gatwick-Houston schedule also enabled it to replace its two-class configured 1-11-500s on the West African coastal schedule to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjul.html" title="Banjul">Banjul</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freetown.html" title="Freetown">Freetown</a> via <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca.html" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Palmas_c0d5.html" title="Las Palmas">Las Palmas</a> with 707s. The 707's greater range (compared with the 1-11) enabled it to cut out the intermediate stops and offer its passengers a more convenient, direct routing that took less time. BCal furthermore replaced two-class 1-11s operating on the Tripoli route with 707s.</p>
<p>In addition, the BAA had just completed the first phase of a major refurbishment and extension of BCal's Gatwick base. The centrepiece of this revamp was a completely refurbished centre pier featuring eleven telescopic, widebody-compatible loading bridges. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-risk354_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk354" title="">[8]</a></sup> These were the first loading bridges to be installed at Gatwick, which was a single-terminal airport at the time. For the first time in its history, BCal also gained a dedicated check-in area for all its flights. This allowed its passengers to avoid the so-called "bucket-and-spade" brigade (as the airport's charter airline passengers were commonly referred to during the 1970s and early '80s). <sup id="_ref-risk354_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk354" title="">[8]</a></sup> These passengers had given Gatwick a poor public image during the '70s and '80s. At the peak of the annual summer holiday season the press used to descend on Gatwick to take photographs of hundreds of families with small children crowding the airport's terminal while awaiting announcements of their delayed charter flights' departures.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Government had announced its intention to take pro-active steps to help ensure Gatwick's development as a genuine alternative to Heathrow the year before. It was hoped that this in turn would assist BCal's development as a serious alternative to BA and the other major, established scheduled airlines.</p>
<p>These steps included inviting BCal and Britain's other Independent airlines to apply to the CAA for route licences to operate scheduled services to destinations in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and on the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a> that were not already served from Gatwick, thereby increasing the reach of the airport's scheduled route network as well as providing more connecting traffic for BCal. (At the time BCal was Gatwick's principal scheduled airline, which operated almost all of the airport's long-haul scheduled services as well as the bulk of its short-haul schedules.)</p>
<p>The CAA had conducted a public hearing into competing applications for the award of several licences to commence new short-haul scheduled services from Gatwick during 1977. The applicants included BCal as well as BA, BIA and Dan-Air. At the time BCal had applied to begin scheduled services from Gatwick to Copenhagen, <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothenburg.html" title="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo.html" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> <sup id="_ref-risk360_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk360" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-baa18_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa18" title="">[10]</a></sup> as well as to add Aberdeen to its existing Edinburgh-Newcastle-Copenhagen licence. BCal was keen to expand its limited short-haul European network beyond the existing four routes linking London Gatwick with Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam-<a href="../../../s/c/h/Schiphol.html" title="Schiphol">Schiphol</a>, Brussels-National (<a href="../../../z/a/v/Zaventem.html" title="Zaventem">Zaventem</a>) and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa.html" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> (a former BUA route). The airline needed to develop its connecting traffic through Gatwick by growing the European network to include destinations in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Europe_61ee.html" title="Southern Europe">Southern Europe</a> in order to help it increase load factors on its long-haul flights to Africa, South America and the US as well as to improve the profitability of these services.</p>
<p>BA had applied to serve <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusseldorf.html" title="Dusseldorf">Dusseldorf</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt.html" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and Zurich from Gatwick. <sup id="_ref-baa18_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa18" title="">[10]</a></sup> It also asked the CAA to confirm several licences it already held to serve additional destinations in Europe from Gatwick.</p>
<p>BIA had applied to serve Dublin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan_Linate_4b43.html" title="Milan Linate">Milan Linate</a> and Zurich from Gatwick. In support of its application, BIA had proposed to operate these services with 65-seater <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker_F-28_e72f.html" title="Fokker F-28">Fokker F-28</a> 1000 series "Fellowship" jet aircraft, rather than the larger BAC 1-11-500s its rivals had planned to use on their services. These had almost twice the seating capacity of the <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker.html" title="Fokker">Fokker</a> jets. Using smaller aircraft would have enabled BIA to offer more frequent flights, thereby offering a more attractive product for the business travel market. BIA reckoned that this would improve its chances of being awarded these licences.</p>
<p>Dan-Air had applied to run scheduled services to several of the aforementioned destinations as well as to Berlin Tegel, where a number of that airline's aircraft were already based, and <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>.</p>
<p>In the event, the CAA decided to approve both BCal's as well as BA's applications but to reject BIA's and Dan-Air's applications. The CAA argued at the time that the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> routes BCal had applied for constituted important feeder services for the airline's long-haul flights to Africa, South America and the US, thereby aiding the future development of the company's scheduled route network at Gatwick. The CAA also argued that BA in its capacity as the UK's primary flag carrier could not be excluded from Gatwick's further development. The CAA furthermore argued that both BIA and Dan-Air lacked the necessary expertise to take on the established scheduled airlines on major international trunk routes.</p>
<p>However, BCal was unable to use its newly awarded licences as there was no provision in the bilateral air services agreements the UK had concluded with <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> for another carrier to operate scheduled services on the main trunk routes between London and these countries in addition to the incumbent flag carriers' services. This meant that BA and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian_Airlines_8404.html" title="Scandinavian Airlines">Scandinavian Airlines</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/s/SAS_2db4.html" title="SAS">SAS</a>) had an effective monopoly on most routes between the UK and Scandinavia. To help secure BCal's reciprocal traffic rights on the main trunk routes between London and Scandinavia, the UK Government agreed to begin negotiations on a new bilateral air services agreement with its three Scandinavian counterparts in December 1978. <sup id="_ref-risk360_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk360" title="">[9]</a></sup> It was hoped that this would enable BCal to commence its first-ever scheduled services from London to Scandinavia at the start of the 1979 summer timetable period.</p>
<p>BA, which was facing no such bilateral restrictions, was able to commence operations an all four routes for which it had been awarded licences at the start of the 1978 summer timetable period itself. <sup id="_ref-baa21_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, it chose to run low-frequency services offering no more than a single daily round-trip on each of these routes.</p>
<p>Despite this setback for BCal, it was still able to offer its passengers a greater number of possible connections at Gatwick during 1978 compared with the year before as a result of additional frequencies on existing domestic routes as well as new domestic feeder routes operated/launched by other Independent British airlines.</p>
<p>British Midland replaced its <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vickers_Viscount_4110.html" title="Vickers Viscount">Vickers Viscount</a> <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turboprops.html" title="Turboprops">turboprops</a> with which it had operated a thrice-daily service between Gatwick and Belfast ever since it had taken over the route from BCal in 1974 with <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-9_c2f9.html" title="McDonnell Douglas DC-9">McDonnell Douglas DC-9</a> jets. As a result of the jets' higher cruising speed, British Midland was able to operate up to four daily round-trips on that route. In addition the <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-9_3680.html" title="DC-9">DC-9</a>'s seating capacity was greater than that of the Viscount, thus resulting in a significant overall capacity increase.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/y/Brymon_Airways_3842.html" title="Brymon Airways">Brymon Airways</a> began a new twice daily Gatwick-<a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth.html" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> service using an 18-seater <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-6_Twin_Otter_2269.html" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter">De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter</a> commuter plane. <sup id="_ref-baa21_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Air Westward, a newly formed regional airline, began a new service linking Gatwick with its base in <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeter.html" title="Exeter">Exeter</a> operated with an 18-seat <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embraer_EMB_110_Bandeirante_cac4.html" title="Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante">Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante</a>. <sup id="_ref-baa21_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dan-Air commenced a new thrice weekly Gatwick-<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen.html" title="Bergen">Bergen</a> 1-11 schedule. <sup id="_ref-baa21_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup> This service in particular had scope to deliver additional high-yield, oil-related connecting traffic to BCal as Bergen was one of the twin centres of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>In addition, Aer Lingus became the first foreign airline to split its scheduled operations between Heathrow and Gatwick when it launched a daily Gatwick-Dublin service to complement BA's service on that route. <sup id="_ref-baa21_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Government initiatives in support of Gatwick's development also included new policies to transfer all scheduled services between London and Canada as well as London and the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_peninsula.html" title="Iberian peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> from Heathrow to Gatwick on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> and to compel all airlines that were planning to operate a scheduled service to or from London for the first time to use Gatwick instead of Heathrow. The latter policy was officially known as the "London Air Traffic Distribution Rules". It came into effect on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> and was applied retrospectively from the beginning of April 1977. These rules were designed to achieve a "fairer" distribution of traffic between London Heathrow and London Gatwick, the UK's two main international gateway airports. The policy was aimed at increasing Gatwick's utilisation to help the airport make a profit.</p>
<p>In the event, only BA transferred all of its scheduled services to Gibraltar, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> from Heathrow to Gatwick at the start of the 1979 summer timetable period, after the Secretary of State for Transport had instructed it to do so. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Canada_a526.html" title="Air Canada">Air Canada</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia.html" title="Iberia">Iberia</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/p/TAP_Air_Portugal_e242.html" title="TAP Air Portugal">TAP Air Portugal</a> all refused to follow suit. <sup id="_ref-risk354_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk354" title="">[8]</a></sup> (Air Canada in particular argued that Gatwick's runway was too short to enable it to operate fully laden 747s from there non-stop to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian.html" title="Canadian">Canadian</a> West coast with a viable <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payload.html" title="Payload">payload</a>. It had also threatened to make <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt.html" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> its "number one" destination in Europe if the UK Government forced it to move its London operations to Gatwick.)</p>
<p>The "London Air Traffic Distribution Rules" stated that airlines that did not already operate an international scheduled air service from/to Heathrow prior to <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a> would not be permitted to commence operations at that airport. Instead, they would have to use Gatwick for all their London-based operations. However, airlines that did not already operate at Heathrow prior to this law taking effect could still commence domestic scheduled services at the airport provided that the BAA, which ran both Heathrow and Gatwick on behalf of the Government, as well as the incumbent Secretary of State for Transport granted them permission to do so. In addition, the "London Air Traffic Distribution Rules" banned all new all-cargo as well as all charter flights from Heathrow as of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/v/i/Avianca.html" title="Avianca">Avianca</a>, the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Aviation_Administration_of_China_c135.html" title="Civil Aviation Administration of China">CAAC</a> (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_China_69d7.html" title="Air China">Air China</a>'s predecessor) and Philippine Airlines were among the first batch of airlines directed to use Gatwick instead of Heathrow as a result of the "London Air Traffic Distribution Rules". (Both Braniff Airways and Delta Air Lines commenced operations from Gatwick at the same time as a result of Bermuda II.)</p>
<p>Another pro-active measure the Government took to aid BCal's and Gatwick's development at the time was to grant permission for a high-frequency helicopter shuttle service linking both of London's main airports. <sup id="_ref-baa21_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>BCal recorded a pre-tax profit of £12.2m at the end of the 1977/'78 financial year on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> <sup id="_ref-risk365_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk365" title="">[11]</a></sup> (the airline had changed the end of its financial year from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a> to <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a> in the meantime). This translated into a £10m retained profit. It was the company's best-ever financial result since its formation back in November 1970. It also was a clear sign that it had left the dark days of late 1974 and early 1975 when its very existence was under threat firmly behind.</p>
<p>BCal's senior management decided to allocate £644,000 of the retained profit to a new profit-share scheme <sup id="_ref-risk365_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk365" title="">[11]</a></sup> to reward its staff for their hard work, which had succeeded in bringing about a dramatic turnaround in the airline's fortunes. BCal's profit-share scheme, which began the following year, was the first of its kind in the UK airline industry.</p>
<p>The good results boosted BCal's management's confidence in the airline's long-term future prospects. They also boosted staff morale and made everyone working for BCal at the time proud of their company's achievement.</p>

<p>A new, high-frequency helicopter shuttle service linking London Heathrow and London Gatwick was inaugurated on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>This service was operating ten times a day in each direction using a 28-seater <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikorsky.html" title="Sikorsky">Sikorsky</a> S-61N helicopter, which was owned by the BAA. BCal held the licence to operate the service and provided the cabin crew. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[13]</a></sup> (A single crew member used to look after the passengers on this ten-minute flight.) British Airways Helicopters, the wholly owned helicopter subsidiary of BA whose headquarters were located at Gatwick, provided the flight deck crew and engineering support. <sup id="_ref-baa21_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baa21" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The service gave BCal's passengers easier access to flight connections at Heathrow, especially to destinations not served by scheduled flights from Gatwick at the time.</p>
<p>It was used by 60,000 passengers during the first year of its operation. <sup id="_ref-risk356_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk356" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The service ended in 1986 when its licence was withdrawn on environmental grounds following the completion of the <a href="../../../m/2/5/M25_motorway.html" title="M25 motorway">M25</a> London orbital motorway. (There were growing complaints about the "excessive" noise created by a low-flying helicopter from people living underneath the Gatwick-Heathrow Airlink's flight path in politically sensitive constituencies.) <sup id="_ref-risk356_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk356" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_in_1978_b408.html" title="Edit section: Supersonic ambitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Supersonic ambitions</span></h4>
<p>1978 was also the year BCal set up a task force headed by the late Sir Peter Masefield, at the time BCal's deputy chairman, to investigate the possibility of operating the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersonic.html" title="Supersonic">supersonic</a> airliner viably on the airline's long-haul route network as there were still a few unsold, "white tail" examples available at that time.</p>
<p>Another important reason for BCal's decision to set up a Concorde task force was that the 1976 aviation policy review had left open the possibility of BA launching supersonic services to prime business and leisure destinations within BCal's sphere of influence, such as Lagos or Rio for example. To ward off this potential threat, BCal's senior management decided to develop its own Concorde plans, either independently or in partnership with BA. <sup id="_ref-risk316_7_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk316_7" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The most obvious choice for a supersonic service was Gatwick-Lagos, the backbone and main money spinner of BCal's scheduled operation. BCal's Concorde task force's brief was to assess the viability of a second daily all-premium supersonic service complementing the airline's existing daily <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsonic.html" title="Subsonic">subsonic</a>, mixed-class widebody service on this route.</p>
<p>BCal put in a bid to acquire one of these "white tail" aircraft. (BA, which had jointly introduced the world's first commercial supersonic service with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_France_27d0.html" title="Air France">Air France</a> in 1976, was bidding for the aircraft as well.) In the event, BCal's bid was not successful.</p>
<p>Following the unsuccessful bid to acquire Concorde direct from the manufacturer, BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and to have them maintained by Air France. It became necessary to find additional work for BCal's envisaged two-strong, leased Concorde fleet to increase the aircraft's utilisation, thus permitting a profitable operation. Therefore, BCal decided to use the second aircraft to launch a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta. The reason BCal chose to operate its first supersonic service to the US to Atlanta rather than Houston, a far more profitable destination due to the oil-related traffic, was Concorde's range limitation. (BCal's Concorde task force had come to the conclusion that only non-stop supersonic services were viable.)</p>
<p>Both supersonic services were to be launched at the start of the 1979 summer timetable period.</p>
<p>However, the changing geopolitical situation - especially, the fall of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_of_Iran_82cd.html" title="Shah of Iran">Shah of Iran</a> and the subsequent tripling of crude oil prices - as well as the sheer complexity of the operational arrangements eventually put paid to BCal's Concorde plans.</p>
