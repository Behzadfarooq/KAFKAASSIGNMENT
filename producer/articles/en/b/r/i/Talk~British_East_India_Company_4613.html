<p>New edit for Seven Years war/French/Opium implication (Check history) It seems like the paragraph got shuffled around in an edit and no one noted it.

<p>David -- just so you know -- I've got a textbook in front of me that calls the British East India the East India company ...aaargh!!! I like it with British myself....<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Absolutely so, JHK - it was the plain EIC <i>to Britons</i> just as the Dutch called theirs the United East India Company; I think the French may just have called theirs the "Company of the Indies" - anyway, I think it's legitimate to distinguish each by the country whence and (within commercially justifiable bounds) for which it operated. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Parker_bf5d.html" title="User:David Parker">User:David Parker</a></p>

<p>true that, I'm writing a report on the Company and Was thoroughly confused about diffrent companies' origins, thanks</p>

<p>A good article, and very promising. But I have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>established a trade transit point and a factory.</i> When? 1608?</li>
<li><i>In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe represented the British interests at the court of the Mughal emperor</i>. How long for? Was he a permanent representative, or was this a one-off mission?</li>
<li><i>Its monopoly was curbed in 1694</i>, but it was <i>Deprived of its trade monopoly in 1813</i>. Are these different monopolies?</li>
<li><i>It therefore raised its own armed forces</i> When?</li>
<li><i>Around the same time, Britain surged ahead of its European rivals with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. ... the French were forced to maintain their trade posts ... without any military presence. This allowed the Company to surge ahead in its interests in the Carnatic from its base at Madras and in Bengal from Calcutta.</i> I don't quite understand the relationship between these elements. Why did the Industrial Revolution help the company? Why did the lack of a French military presence in their trade posts help the company?</li>
<li><i>a pact ... that would allow the land to be under the control of the Crown, and be leased to the Company</i> How much control did the Crown have? What exactly did the Company lease? The passing of the 1773 act seems to imply that the Company was still the effective government until then.</li>
<li><i>The <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal_famine.html" title="Bengal famine">Bengal famine</a>, in which one-sixth of the population died, set the alarm bells ringing back home. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control.</i> Why did the famine affect the company? Did the costs rise because of the famine? Why?</li>
<li><i>The Eastern British armies at home</i> What does this mean? Were they in India or in the UK?</li>
<li><i>In a series of reforms</i> What series? Was the Act part of a series, or did it contain a series? The article only mentions one reform due to the Act.</li>

<p>I have done extensive research on the East India Company, and I am very positive that it was not called "John's Company". I tried changing it, but it got changed back. Can someone show me proof on this name?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought it was John Company, not John's Company. What about <i>John Company</i> (London, 1926) by W. Foster, for starters. I've seen hundreds of references to this name. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 21:08, 16 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Or if you want to go back further, there's <i>The Good Old Days of Honorable John Company: Being Curious Reminiscences Illustrating Manners and Customs of the British in India During the Rule of the East India Company from 1600 to 1858</i>. pubblished in <b>1882</b>.

<p>Still one question: if the company was wound up as a trading enterprise after 1813, what were the commercial operations it was carrying out between 1858 and 1874? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkalexander100_03f8.html" title="User:Markalexander100">Markalexander100</a> 05:54, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>How commonly was it known as "John Company"? Should this really be in the first line of the article? I have also not heard this name before. Would it be accurate to say that this is a rather archaic nickname? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a></p>
<p>There are several books about the Company which use John Company in the title. I hadn't heard of it before either (though in my case that really doesn't mean much), but it does seem to be fairly common. Here's a quickly drawn assortment of books and links:</p>

<p><b>Malayan Peninsula and Tin mining</b></p>
<p>If India was the jewel of the empire, then the Malayan Peninsula (now West Malaysia) was the empire's treasury. Tin mining and rubber contributed immensely to the British Empire so much so that the British virtually denuded the peninsula of tin. They also brought in the Chinese and Indians who forever changed the political landscape of Malaya. Can somebody do some research on this and dig up, pardon the pun, some statistics on how much the British profitted.</p>

<p>It is a big change from British to English, but it is not the British East India Company. Britain , or Great Britain, refers to the British Empire, which the English East India Company had a large part in forming. This is not my interpretation, but how the company is referred to in the community that writes about it and pre-modern economic history.</p>

<p>Your intro states the company was formed with the intention of trading in India. The main body of the article states (correctly) that it was formed with the intention of trading in the East Indies, and only turned to India after being thrown out of the Indies by the Dutch.

<p>Re: "The flag probably inspired the Stars and Stripes (as argued by Sir Charles Fawcett in 1937)." Richard Buckminster Fuller's also argued this fact in his paper "Critical Path", he goes furter to say that as most of the boats involved in the boston tea party belonged to the east india company, this would have been that flag that flew over heads of the revolutionaries.</p>
<p>maybe the RB Fuller &amp; "Critical Path" reference can be mentioned, but i will leave that to ye.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sir Charles Fawcett's article mentions this point. There are a number of reasons that this argument is questionable. Firstly, the British East India Company only had a mandate to fly its colours east of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Helena_24fa.html" title="St Helena">St Helena</a>. Therefore its colours should never have been flown anywhere near North America. Secondly, the East India Company ships only traded between India and the UK. All goods went through British ports, whereupon they were transferred to other ships for distribution throughout the empire. As such, it is unlikely that actual East India Company ships made it to the shores of North America. However, that certainly doesn't remove the possibility that the flag was the basis of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Union_Flag_bfee.html" title="Grand Union Flag">Grand Union Flag</a>. In its day, the East India Company flag would have been one of the most common sights and recognisable flags to any travelled sailor. Also, many of the British troops in Boston had served in India and may have brought these flags to the shores of North America. It is unlikely that this flag was not known by the population of a major colonial port in the World, such as Boston. But, it is unlikely that British East India ships themselves ever went to North America, let alone flew the flag. <a href="../../../d/b/n/User%7EDbnull_167f.html" title="User:Dbnull">Dbnull</a> 16:16, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In regards to the flag: The use of the earlier St. George's Cross (English Flag) version of the EIC flag at the top of the page refers to the English EIC, before the Great Britain existed.

<dd>I don't think it makes a great deal of difference does it though? Neither was ever the correct name for the company as far as I know (and the company did certainly have Scots and Welsh employed). The name is simply to disambiguate from other East India Companies. English is perhaps marginally more correct though it carried a union flag as part of its flag as you can see from the article. I usually hear it referred to as simply the East India Company or John Company. The proper title would be either "United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies" or "The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies" (since the company changed names when amalgamated with the New Company) I suppose but would people be able to find the article then? Was "Honourable East India Company" ever an official name it traded under? --<a href="../../../r/g/c/User%7ERgclegg_deb7.html" title="User:Rgclegg">Richard Clegg</a> 11:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is still an HEIC Archive Office in London. If you look, for instance, in <i>Burke's Peerage</i> going back to the beginning of the 19th century, at the armies of men from these old families who served with the company, you will see that against all of them are the initials HEIC or "HEIC's service". Several books have been published over the years about "The Honourable Company". Do you think this has been plucked from thin air? I, for instance, have <i>never</i> heard of the "John Company". Is this a working-class description rather than the official title the company wished to be known by? What next! It is also bizarre to suggest that just because an English company has Welsh, Scots or Irish working within it, that it somehow assumes a British/United Kingdom status. It does not. It's an English enterprise. It was <i>never</i> known as the British East India Co, so the title on this article is, very simply, <b>wrong</b>. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristchurch_0443.html" title="User:Christchurch">Christchurch</a> 19:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As can be seen earlier "British" is simply to distinguish it from other East India Companies. I don't think anyone ever claims it ever officially had that name. Do you have any evidence it was ever called the "Honourable East India Company"? I know it was widely known by that name and a thousand other variants. It was certainly known as "John company" in the mid 19th century. I suspect it was a common soldier's name for it. --<a href="../../../r/g/c/User%7ERgclegg_deb7.html" title="User:Rgclegg">Richard Clegg</a> 21:02, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states: "However, the demands of Company officers on the treasury of Bengal contributed tragically to the province's incapacity in the face of a famine which killed millions in 1770-1773."</p>

<dd>That article presents a certain point of view very strongly. To what extent the EIC is to blame for the Bengal famine is questionable, though the company should certainly take some measure of blame for what happened (and perhaps a large measure of blame) we can only speculate what would have happened had Bengal remained under the control of the French-backed ruler instead. --<a href="../../../r/g/c/User%7ERgclegg_deb7.html" title="User:Rgclegg">Richard Clegg</a> 12:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pasting from another wikipedia article (look for Bengal Famine) here since it's relevant: <i>"Fault for the famine is now often ascribed to the British East India Company policies in Bengal. As a trading body, its first remit was to maximise its profits and with taxation rights the profits to be obtained from Bengal came from land tax as well as trade tariffs. As lands came under company control, the land tax was typically raised by 3 to 4 times what it had been – from 10-15% up to 50% of the value of the agricultural produce. In the first years of the rule of the British East India Company, the total land tax income was doubled and most of this revenue flowed out of the country. As the famine approached its height, in April of 1770, the Company announced that land tax for the following year was to be increased by 10%. The company is also criticised for forbidding the "hoarding" of rice. This prevented traders and dealers from laying in reserves that in other times would have tided the population over lean periods.]]By the time of the famine, monopolies in grain trading had been established by the Company and its agents. The Company had no plan for dealing with the grain shortage, and actions were only taken insofar as they affected the mercantile and trading classes. Land revenue decreased by 14% during the affected year, but recovered rapidly (Kumkum Chatterjee). According to McLane, the first governor-general of British India, Warren Hastings, acknowledged "violent" tax collecting after 1771: revenues earned by the Company were higher in 1771 than in 1768 [1]. Globally, the profit of the Company increased from 15 million rupees in 1765 up to 30 million rupees in 1777.</i></p>
<p><br />
So the question is not really what would have happened had the French ruled, but why this did really did not result either in a serious revolt or by the closure of the EIC by the monarchy. As for the latter, perhaps the later Bengal famines and the response of various British leaders including Churchill is a pointer to the nature of the Raj (not very different from the EIC). These really are bigger indicators of the devastating impact the successive British leaderships had on the Indian economy and society than relatively smaller incidents like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the article exaggerates the reduction in the French threat after Plassey; for example in:</p>
<p><i>By 1760, the French were driven out of India, with the exception of a few trading posts on the coast, such as Pondicherry.</i></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><i>By the Treaty of Paris (1763), the French were forced to maintain their trade posts only in small enclaves in Pondicherry, Mahe, Karikal, Yanam, and Chandernagar without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the Company. In contrast, the Company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of a disciplined and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the Carnatic from its base at Madras and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.</i></p>
<p>But in 1795 William Kirkpatrick, the British resident at Hyderabad, wrote: "[General Michel Raymond] is now at the head of a disciplined force of at least 10,000 infantry, with a well-equipped train of artillery, pretty well-officered with Europeans who are of his own nation and principles."(Dalrymple 2003: p100)</p>
<p>As for French ambitions being laid to rest, there was considerable fear that Napoleon was going to attack India after his conquest of Egypt. In fact, it could be argued that the expansion of British power in India was a deliberate power game in competition with the French. The French were allies of Mysore in the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Mysore_Wars_948a.html" title="Anglo-Mysore Wars">Anglo-Mysore Wars</a> and supported Tipu Sultan at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Seringapatam_5efd.html" title="Battle of Seringapatam">Battle of Seringapatam</a> in 1799. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 06:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Actually, the British East India Company made a fortune selling Opium in China. The British gov't even made deals with them to allow sales of opium as long as they didn't sell in England. Granted China wasn't the only place they sold opium but it sure was the biggest customer. So don't whine about it just because you think it's racially insensitive. It is accurate.</p>

<p>And that is why the British had to fight wars to ensure they could continue selling opium in China. Yeah right, that makes a lot of sense.</p>
