<p>Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheltenham.html" title="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire.html" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Jones suffered from <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a> his entire life. His parents, Lewis Blount and Louisa Beatrice Jones, were of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> descent, and middle-class residents of the town. Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">3 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> and died on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">14 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> of <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leukemia.html" title="Leukemia">leukemia</a>, and Barbara, who was born in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>.<sup id="_ref-wyman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brian's parents were both very interested in music, and it seems their interest had a profound effect on young Brian. In addition to his job as an aeronautical engineer, Brian's father played both piano and organ, and led the choir at the local church. Jones's mother Louisa was a piano teacher and started teaching her son the instrument at a very young age. Eventually Brian required formal lessons as he progressed too quickly for her to continue teaching him. He soon learned how to read music, and eventually took up the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarinet.html" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a>, becoming first clarinet in his school <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">orchestra</a> at 14.<sup id="_ref-wyman_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> Jones was first exposed to the jazz musician <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a>; this sparked a lifelong interest in jazz music and Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a>. As with many instruments he attempted to learn, Jones initially played endlessly, only to find he became somewhat bored with the instrument after a while, and finally would search for another instrument to play. Two years later his parents gave him his first <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel-string_guitar.html" title="Steel-string guitar">acoustic guitar</a> as a present for his 17th birthday.<sup id="_ref-wyman_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

He enjoyed <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Badminton">badminton</a> and diving but otherwise was not very skilled at <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sports</a>. However he found his schooling to be too regimented and formal, and refused to conform when he reached adolescence. He was known to eschew wearing the school uniforms, refusing to wear his <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortarboard.html" title="Mortarboard">mortarboard</a>, and angering teachers with his behaviour. As a result, he remained very popular and well-liked with the students. This open hostility towards authority figures got him suspended from school on two separate occasions.<sup id="_ref-wyman_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend of Brian's, is quoted as saying about the guitarist:</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> Jones obtained nine <a href="../../../o/-/l/O-levels.html" title="O-levels">O-levels</a> in his exams.</p>
<p>All this, and his popularity with the other school pupils, came to an end in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, when at the age of 17 Jones impregnated his girlfriend, a 16-year-old Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie. She was four months younger than Jones, who encouraged her to have an abortion. After this she wanted no further contact with Brian and instead chose to have the baby boy adopted.<sup id="_ref-wyman_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup> The child, named Simon, was given to an infertile couple upon his birth and Brian quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling throughout northern Europe, including <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, for the summer. During this time, Jones later claimed, he lived something of a <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemianism.html" title="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> lifestyle, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busking.html" title="Busking">busking</a> and playing guitar on the streets for money, living off the kindness of others. Simon never met his biological father.</p>
<p>While Jones was fond of telling others about his trip throughout Europe, it remains uncertain as to how much of his story is real and how much is embellishment. Other friends and acquaintances spoke of Jones merely staying with relatives outside the UK, yet to hear it from the musician himself, he had no money, no home, no friends and no family after he left England.</p>
<p>Upon his return, Jones became much more interested in various types of music. He was taught <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">classical</a> music at a young age, and he always preferred <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues.html" title="Blues">blues</a> (particularly <a href="../../../m/u/d/Muddy_Waters_a6ef.html" title="Muddy Waters">Muddy Waters</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Johnson_%28musician%29_9e45.html" title="Robert Johnson (musician)">Robert Johnson</a>), however he soon took an interest in <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%27n_roll.html" title="Rock 'n roll">rock 'n roll</a>. He began playing at local blues and jazz clubs in addition to busking and working various odd jobs, and used the money he earned to buy more instruments. He was also known to steal small amounts of money to pay for cigarettes, which got him fired from jobs on several occasions.</p>
<p>Despite the unwanted attention he received from impregnating his girlfriend at a young age, Jones showed no signs of changing his lifestyle. A second child, whom Jones named <b>Julian Mark Andrews</b> (his mother being Jones' then girlfriend Pat Andrews) was born in October <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. He sold his record collection the day his son was born to buy flowers for Pat and clothes for the new born and lived with them for a while.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1962, Jones recruited <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Stewart_%28musician%29_8b04.html" title="Ian Stewart (musician)">Ian "Stu" Stewart</a> and singer <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> into his band — who, with Jagger's childhood friend <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Richards_53f8.html" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a>, met Jones when he and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Jones_%28singer%29_49c1.html" title="Paul Jones (singer)">Paul Jones</a> were featured playing <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmore_James_34a1.html" title="Elmore James">Elmore James</a>' "<i><a href="../../../d/u/s/Dust_My_Broom_8a16.html" title="Dust My Broom">Dust My Broom</a></i>" with Korner's band at <a href="../../../e/a/l/Ealing_Jazz_Club_2fad.html" title="Ealing Jazz Club">The Ealing Club</a>. On his initiative, Jagger brought guitarist Richards with him to the rehearsals; Richards then joined the band. Jones' and Stewarts' acceptance of Richards and the Chuck Berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists Geoff Bradford and Brian Knight who had no tolerance for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Berry_39cc.html" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>. As Keith Richards tells it, it was Jones who came up with the name "The Rollin' Stones" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner.</p>

<p>Throughout much of 1962 and 1963 Jones, Jagger and Richards shared an apartment (referred to by Richards as "a beautiful dump")<sup id="_ref-jagger_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jagger" title="">[2]</a></sup> in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea%2C_London_7702.html" title="Chelsea, London">Chelsea, London</a> at 102 Edith Grove with James Phelge, a future photographer whose last name would later be used in some of the band's writing credits.

<p>The group played at local blues and jazz clubs around London, eventually forming a solid fan base despite strong resistance from traditional jazz musicians who felt threatened by the Stones' popularity. While Mick Jagger was the lead singer, Jones, in the group's embryonic period, was the leader, promoting the band, getting them shows around London and negotiating with venue owners. Jones would often act more as an entertainer in these early days, playing several instruments including vocals, rhythm guitar, slide guitar and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonica.html" title="Harmonica">harmonica</a>.</p>
<p>During live performances around this time, and especially at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, Jones was frequently a more animated and engaging performer than even Mick Jagger. Jagger initially stood still while singing, mainly by circumstance, as there was hardly any room for him to move at all.<sup id="_ref-jagger_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jagger" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>While acting as business manager, Jones arranged to have himself paid 5 <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pounds_sterling.html" title="Pounds sterling">pounds sterling</a> more than the other members of the group, a practice which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentment against him.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>As the Stones' popularity grew, they came to the attention of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Loog_Oldham_0942.html" title="Andrew Loog Oldham">Andrew Loog Oldham</a>, who met the band in April 1963 at the suggestion of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_Mirror_11f7.html" title="Record Mirror">Record Mirror</a> music writer Peter Jones (no relation) and soon became, with Eric Eastman, their co-manager. Oldham, who had worked briefly as the Beatles publicist, was an admirer of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Burgess_55ab.html" title="Anthony Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a>' novel <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i>, as well as the film <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expresso_Bongo_3137.html" title="Expresso Bongo">Expresso Bongo</a>, cultivated an image for the band as unruly and slightly menacing, a kind of blues-inflected, rough-edged answer to the more amiable <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a>, using the novel's protagonist and his gang as his inspiration. It was Oldham who coined the phrase <i>"Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?"</i> Piano player Ian Stewart was pushed into the background by Oldham for two main reasons: Oldham felt that Stewart, a somewhat burly Scotsman, did not fit in with the image he wanted of the group; and Oldham felt that six group members were too many for audiences to remember clearly. Stewart remained the Stones' road manager and principal keyboard player until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
<p>Oldham's arrival also marked the beginning of Jones' own slow estrangement from the band, one which saw his prominent role progressively diminished as Oldham sought to shift the Stones' centre of gravity away from Jones and towards Jagger and Richards.</p>
<p>Until this time all of the songs in the group's repertoire were either blues covers or instrumentals credited to "Nanker Phelge" — a credit that indicated the song was a Jagger/Jones/Richards/Watts/Wyman composition. Oldham, and everybody in the group, recognised the financial advantages of writing one's own songs, as exemplified by the Lennon/McCartney team, as well as the simple fact that playing covers won't keep a band in the limelight for years to come. Further, Oldham wanted to make Jagger's onstage charisma and flamboyance a central focus of the band's live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers he would have preferred, and more Jagger-and-Richards-penned originals, and as Oldham began asserting increasing managerial control, displacing Jones from another key role.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> 1964 Jones fathered another child out of wedlock, this time to girlfriend Linda Lawrence. Jones named this child <b>Julian Brian Lawrence.</b> (Julian would adopt the surname Leitch after Lawrence married the folk singer <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donovan.html" title="Donovan">Donovan</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>.)

<p>Throughout his career, Jones showed a musical aptitude, having the ability to play a myriad of instruments, due to his training on the piano and clarinet in his youth. As soon as the Stones earned enough money to record in professional, well equipped recording studios like <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Studio_529b.html" title="Olympic Studio">Olympic Studio</a> and the <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_Sound_Recorders_4e1c.html" title="Sunset Sound Recorders">Sunset Sound Recorders</a> studios in Los Angeles, Jones started experimenting with different wind and stringed instruments at a rapid pace.

In total he is known to have played at least 15 instruments with the Stones. Brian's signature guitar is a <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teardrop.html" title="Teardrop">teardrop</a>-shaped prototype <a href="../../../v/o/x/Vox_%28musical_equipment%29.html" title="Vox (musical equipment)">Vox</a> Phantom Mark III, though he used many others throughout his career, being fond of <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibson_Guitar_Corporation_93e5.html" title="Gibson Guitar Corporation">Gibson</a> models (various Firebirds, ES-330, and Les Paul models) as well, along with the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rickenbacker.html" title="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a> 12-String model made famous by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a>.</p>

It was Brian Jones who played blues harp ("harmonica") on most of the Stones' recordings throughout the 1960s. He contributed to two Beatles songs: "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_Know_My_Name_%28Look_Up_The_Number%29_4e64.html" title="You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)">You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)</a>", which he played saxophone on, and "<a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Submarine_%28song%29_2174.html" title="Yellow Submarine (song)">Yellow Submarine</a>", in which he hit two pieces of glass together.</p>
<p>In the Stones' early years, Jones was also a harmony singer for the Stones, particularly from 1962–1964. Notable examples are "<a href="../../../i/_/w/I_Wanna_Be_Your_Man_a585.html" title="I Wanna Be Your Man">I Wanna Be Your Man</a>" and "Walking The Dog." Jones' backing vocals can also be prominently heard on "Come On," "Bye Bye Johnny," "<a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_%28That%27s_What_I_Want%29_e1f8.html" title="Money (That's What I Want)">"Money"</a>," "Empty Heart" (alongside Jagger and Richard), and others.</p>
<p>Jones and Keith Richards excelled on what is known as "guitar weaving," later dubbed the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_guitar_players.html#Ancient_Form_of_Weaving" title="Multiple guitar players">Ancient Form of Weaving</a>, that has become a signature part of the sound of the Rolling Stones throughout their career. It involves both guitarists playing rhythm and lead parts at the same time, without ever really differentiating between the two styles. This style of playing is also known as the "Chicago" style, as it can be heard on albums by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Reed_ad22.html" title="Jimmy Reed">Jimmy Reed</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/d/Muddy_Waters_a6ef.html" title="Muddy Waters">Muddy Waters</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howlin%27_Wolf_c3c5.html" title="Howlin' Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>, with <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_Sumlin_bab7.html" title="Hubert Sumlin">Hubert Sumlin</a> as the main exponent.</p>

<p>These indulgences did nothing positive for Jones's physical health (he suffered from asthma, and was never a very health-conscious individual). On several occasions he was in the hospital while the rest of the group was elsewhere, doubtlessly contributing to his paranoia and physically separating him from his bandmates.</p>
<p>Jones was arrested for drug use for the first time on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> 1967, shortly after the Redlands incident at Richards' Sussex home.

He confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugs. Like the arrests of his bandmates, protesters appeared outside the court demanding that Jones be freed, and he was not kept in jail for long.

<p>Tensions grew between Jagger, Richards and Jones, and his heavy drug use and drinking did not help matters. His contributions with the Rolling Stones would become more sporadic even as he began some projects outside the group. Keith Richards began to play more lead guitar while Jones, bored with the instrument, would usually find something exotic to play, though he was frequently absent from recording sessions. Jones's gradual decline in contributions started around 1967 and continued until May 1968, when he recorded his last genuine contributions to Stones songs. Clips of Jones in the 1967 promotional film for "We Love You" show him slumped and barely able to keep his eyes open, most likely due to the effects of Mandrax (<a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaalude.html" title="Quaalude">quaalude</a>), a popular recreational drug on the scene at that time. However, Jones maintained close relationships with many others outside of the Stones camp, including <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Marriott_56aa.html" title="Steve Marriott">Steve Marriott</a>.</p>
<p>Life continued to become much more difficult for Jones. In the summer of 1967, Jones's girlfriend <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Pallenberg_6b13.html" title="Anita Pallenberg">Anita Pallenberg</a> ran off with Richards while Jones was in hospital, severely damaging Jones and Richards' friendship.

<p>Jones's last substantial sessions with the Stones were in the spring and summer of 1968, when the Stones produced the classic "Jumpin' Jack Flash" and the <a href="../../../b/e/g/Beggars_Banquet_1eae.html" title="Beggars Banquet">Beggars Banquet</a> album. A relaxed Jones can be seen in the <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Godard_0bd5.html" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a> film <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Plus_One_383a.html" title="One Plus One">One Plus One</a>,</i> playing acoustic guitar, chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is generally neglected in the music making process. The film chronicles the making of the song "Sympathy for the Devil." While he played an acoustic guitar for the backing track, it is not included in the final version, though it is occasionally audible in the film through the microphones of the film crew.</p>
<p>At this time, it was becoming clear that Jones was not long for the group. Whereas before he would normally play multiple instruments on nearly every track, he was no longer a ubiquitous presence on the album, only appearing on about half of the tracks; He plays acoustic slide guitar on "No Expectations," harmonica on "Dear Doctor" and "Prodigal Son," tamboura on "Street Fighting Man" and mellotron on the fade-out of "Stray Cat Blues."</p>
<p>Jones' last formal appearance with the Stones was in the December <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_Rock_and_Roll_Circus_06c3.html" title="The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus">The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</a>,</i> a part-concert, part-circus act film organized by the band. It went unreleased for 25 years due to Mick Jagger being unhappy with the band's performance as compared to other bands in the film, such as <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jethro_Tull_%28band%29_f69b.html" title="Jethro Tull (band)">Jethro Tull</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/j/Taj_Mahal_%28musician%29_8643.html" title="Taj Mahal (musician)">Taj Mahal</a>. In the film, Jones appears uninterested, and at moments intoxicated. While introducing concert pianist <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Katchen_9c04.html" title="Julius Katchen">Julius Katchen</a>, his speech was slurred and inarticulate. During the Stones' set he appears distant from the group and his playing is inaudible except for a shaky rendition of "No Expectations."

<p>In 1966 Jones produced, played on and wrote the soundtrack for the film <i>"Mord und Totschlag"</i> (aka <a href="http://www.thevideobeat.com/store/mod-movies/degree-murder-1967.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thevideobeat.com/store/mod-movies/degree-murder-1967.html" rel="nofollow">"A Degree Of Murder")</a>, an avant-garde German film with his then-girlfriend <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Pallenberg_6b13.html" title="Anita Pallenberg">Anita Pallenberg</a>. He hired various musicians to play on the soundtrack, among them guitarist <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Page_70e6.html" title="Jimmy Page">Jimmy Page</a>. Jones and Pallenberg attracted controversy during the making of the film when Jones posed in a <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> uniform while standing on a naked doll for a photograph, along with Pallenberg. Jones was by no means sympathetic to the Nazis, however many were offended by the photographs.</p>
<p>Jones played percussion on an unreleased Jimi Hendrix' version of Bob Dylan's "<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Along_the_Watchtower_29a3.html" title="All Along the Watchtower">All Along the Watchtower</a>" together with a handful of unreleased jams with Hendrix and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Mason_14e3.html" title="Dave Mason">Dave Mason</a> of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_%28band%29.html" title="Traffic (band)">Traffic</a> in early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, in addition to playing the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alto.html" title="Alto">alto</a> saxophone on a Beatles song, "You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)."</p>

<p>Jones was arrested a second time in 1968, this time for marijuana possession. Jones claimed the marijuana was left behind by previous owners of his home, but he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty, due to his probation. Bill Wyman commented "The fact that the police had secured a warrant with no evidence showed the arrest was part of a carefully orchestrated plan. Brian and the Stones were being targeted in an effort to deter the public from taking drugs." The jury found him guilty, yet the judge had sympathy for Jones. Instead of fining and warning him, the judge said, "For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really <i>will</i> be serious." The prosecution's case was very weak, relying on testimony of police who were later found to be corrupt<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. (The same corrupt officers who harassed Jones would go on to harass Beatle <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> in 1969. (Beatles' Anthology)</p>
<p>Brian's continuing legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, sporadic contributions and mood swings finally became too much for the Rolling Stones. The Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years, however Jones's second arrest exacerbated problems with US immigration.</p>
<p>In addition, the Stones' music was heavily based on the two weaving guitars; Brian's penchant for exotic instrumentation worked to complement Richards' guitar work, however at this time Brian would rarely come into the studio, and if he did he would frequently contribute nothing musically or his guitar would be switched off by his bandmates, leaving Richards playing nearly all the guitars. According to Gary Herman, he was "literally incapable of making music: when he tried to play harmonica, his mouth started bleeding".<sup id="_ref-Gary_Herman.2C_.27.27Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Babylon.27.27_.28Norfolk:_Fakenham_Press.2C_1982.29.2C_p._44._0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gary_Herman.2C_.27.27Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Babylon.27.27_.28Norfolk:_Fakenham_Press.2C_1982.29.2C_p._44." title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>This behaviour began to wreak havoc during the <i>Beggars Banquet</i> sessions but had fully flourished by the time the band commenced recording of <i>Let It Bleed</i>. While the band was recording "You Can't Always Get What You Want", Jones meekly asked an agitated Jagger, "What can I play?". Jagger's terse response was "I don't know Brian, what <i>can</i> you play?". From this point forward he made himself scarce, rarely attending sessions. <a href="../../../r/y/_/Ry_Cooder_a10d.html" title="Ry Cooder">Ry Cooder</a> (fielded as a possible replacement) observed that the guitarist even retreated into a corner and cried on the rare occasions when he did show up. By May, he had made only two contributions to the work in progress: an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autoharp.html" title="Autoharp">autoharp</a> part on "You Got the Silver" and extra percussion on the epic "Midnight Rambler", although the latter is inaudible on the released version. Jones was duly informed by Jagger that he would be dismissed from the band if he did not appear at a photo shoot for the compilation album <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Through_The_Past%2C_Darkly_%28Big_Hits_Vol._2%29_4169.html" title="Through The Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)">Through The Past Darkly</a></i>. Looking extremely frail, he nonetheless showed.</p>
<p>The Stones decided that following the release of the <i>Let it Bleed</i> album (scheduled for a July 1969 release) they would do a tour of North America starting November 1969, a first in three years time. However, the Stones management was informed that Jones would not receive a working permit for the U.S. due to his drug convictions. At the suggestion of pianist and road manager for the tour <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Stewart_%28musician%29_8b04.html" title="Ian Stewart (musician)">Ian Stewart</a>, the Stones decided the best option would be to add a new guitarist, and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Jones was visited by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts and was told the group he formed would continue without him.</p>
<p>To the public, it appeared as if Jones suddenly left; the others told him that although he was being asked to leave, they stressed that it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">9 June</a> announcing his departure from the group. In the public statement he said, among other things, that</p>

<p>Ironically this would come just as the Stones were returning to their blues roots, which Jones had always emphasized. Jones was replaced by 20-year-old guitarist <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Taylor_939c.html" title="Mick Taylor">Mick Taylor</a> (formerly of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mayall%27s_Bluesbreakers_b4cf.html" title="John Mayall's Bluesbreakers">John Mayall's Bluesbreakers</a>), who started sessions with the Stones right away.</p>
<p>At this point Jones mostly stayed at Cotchford Farm (formerly the residence of "Winnie-the-Pooh" author <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._A._Milne_174b.html" title="A. A. Milne">A. A. Milne</a>), with intentions to form another band. He did visit Olympic studios the next week to discuss the future with his former bandmates, with Bill Wyman noting that he was "excited about his own plans".<sup id="_ref-wyman_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup> He is known to have contacted <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Stewart_0a89.html" title="Ian Stewart">Ian Stewart</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Mitchell_fa2d.html" title="Mitch Mitchell">Mitch Mitchell</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexis_Korner_627c.html" title="Alexis Korner">Alexis Korner</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Miller_%28producer%29_8d4e.html" title="Jimmy Miller (producer)">Jimmy Miller</a>. He toyed with the idea of joining Korner's New Church band, but Korner instead suggested Jones form his own band. Miller occasionally brought his family over, and Jones had invited him to do so again in early July.</p>
<p>There is great uncertainty as to the mental and physical state Jones was in at this time. The last known photographs taken of Jones, taken in June 1969, shortly after his departure from the Stones, are not flattering. Jones appears bloated with deep set eyes, although people who visited Jones (particularly Alexis Korner) were surprised by Jones's state in late June. Korner noted that Jones was "happier than he had ever been"<sup id="_ref-wyman_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup> at this time, and supposedly Jimmy Miller was surprised to find Jones in such good spirits.</p>
<p>At around midnight on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">3 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Brian Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_pool.html" title="Swimming pool">swimming pool</a> at his home in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartfield.html" title="Hartfield">Hartfield</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex.html" title="Sussex">Sussex</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, where he had been for only a matter of minutes. His girlfriend Anna Wohlin is convinced he was still alive when they took him out; she insists that he still had a pulse. However when the doctors arrived, it was too late for Brian and he was pronounced dead on the scene. The <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">coroner</a>'s report stated "Death by misadventure", and noted that his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse.<sup id="_ref-wyman_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wyman" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Anna Wohlin claimed in 2000 that he had been murdered by a builder who had been staying with them renovating the house the couple shared. The builder, Frank Thorogood, allegedly confessed to the murder on his deathbed to the Rolling Stones' driver, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Keylock_13cf.html" title="Tom Keylock">Tom Keylock</a>: however it should be noted that there were no other witnesses to this confession. In her book ("The Murder Of Brian Jones") she alleges that Frank Thorogood behaved suspiciously and showed little sympathy when Jones was discovered in the pool (he was also the last one to see Brian alive): however she also admits that she was not actually physically present at the time of Jones' death. Witnesses have been interviewed by various journalists who claim to have seen the 'murder': however, these witnesses almost always use pseudonyms, and none of them have been prepared to go on record or report what they claim to have seen to the police.</p>
<p>Many items, such as instruments and expensive furniture, were stolen from the home after Jones' death, most likely by Thorogood, driver Tom Keylock, and others who worked on the property. Rumours also exist that demo recordings made by Jones for his future projects were stolen as well, but to date nothing has ever surfaced. Several of the instruments stolen from Jones' house have later turned up on the collectors market.</p>
<p>Upon his death, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Townshend_41b5.html" title="Pete Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> wrote a poem titled <a href="http://www.classicrockpage.com/newslet/newsgrap/may01/petetownshend.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.classicrockpage.com/newslet/newsgrap/may01/petetownshend.htm" rel="nofollow">"A Normal Day For Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day"</a> (printed in The Times), <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> dedicated a song to him on US television, and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doors_4c4f.html" title="The Doors">The Doors</a> wrote a published poem entitled <a href="http://www.people.nnov.ru/thedoors/wilderness2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.people.nnov.ru/thedoors/wilderness2.htm" rel="nofollow"><b>Ode To L.A.

<p>When asked by a newspaper reporter his reaction to Jones' death, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Harrison_e25f.html" title="George Harrison">George Harrison</a> responded, "When I met him I liked him quite a lot. He was a good fellow you know. I got to know him very well, I think, and I felt very close to him: you know how it is with some people, you feel for them, feel near to them. He was born on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_28.html" title="February 28">28 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, and I was born on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_25.html" title="February 25">25 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, and he was with Mick and Keith, and I was with John and Paul in the groups, so there was a sort of understanding between the two of us. The positions were similar, and I often seemed to meet him in his times of trouble. There was nothing the matter with him that a little extra love wouldn't have cured. I don't think he had enough love or understanding. He was very nice and sincere and sensitive, and we must remember that's what he was."</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones performed a free concert in Hyde Park on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">5 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, two days after his death. The concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the new guitarist. However, critics accused the band of being callous and uncaring about their former bandmate. In response to this criticism, the band dedicated the concert to Jones. Before the concert began, Jagger read excepts from "<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adonais.html" title="Adonais">Adonais</a>", a poem by <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Shelley_2952.html" title="Percy Shelley">Percy Shelley</a> about the death of his friend <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keats_3200.html" title="John Keats">John Keats</a>. Their manager had come up with a plan to release thousands of white moths at the Hyde Park concert but, due to the extreme heat, most of the moths had already died in their boxes, and the surviving moths barely made it into the air before dying and falling on the heads of concertgoers. The Stones opened with a <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Winter_5ce7.html" title="Johnny Winter">Johnny Winter</a> song that was one of Brian's favorites, "I'm Yours And I'm Hers".</p>
<p>Jones was reportedly buried 12 feet deep (to prevent exhumation by ghoulish trophy hunters) in (reportedly) a lavish silver and bronze casket (as the casket was lowered manually by two people it is unlikely the casket was solid bronze) sent for his funeral in Cheltenham by friend <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. The Stones asked fans to stay away, and only Watts and Wyman among the group attended the funeral. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianne_Faithfull_8dfd.html" title="Marianne Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a> did not attend the funeral as they were traveling to Australia to begin filming a movie, claiming the film's producers prohibited their attending the funeral, upon threat of having their contract severed. <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Richards_53f8.html" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anita_Pallenberg_6b13.html" title="Anita Pallenberg">Anita Pallenberg</a> didn't attend Jones' funeral as they were afraid their presence would raise an uproar by the present fans.</p>

<p>In contrast to Jager and Richards, Jones was not known to write original songs for the Rolling Stones. Jones was admittedly very unsure and insecure of himself as a composer, and although reports differ as to how many released compositions he wrote, co-wrote, or even proposed to the group, Jones was by no means a prolific songwriter, and even his biggest fans concede that he didn't write or co-write more than 15-20 songs with the Stones.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>However, in the years following Jones's death, two distinct fan bases have been established. Many Stones fans feel that Jones contributed a great deal to numerous Stones songs and deserved credit which he never received for several of their earlier compositions, including the hits "Paint It Black", "2000 Light Years From Home" and "Ruby Tuesday".</p>
<p>Still other Stones fans feel that Jones's contributions were minimal, that he missed shows and was frequently replaced by session musicians due to his heavy substance use, and that he lacked the compositional talent to deserve any songwriting credits.</p>
<p>There is likely some truth in both camps' arguments - however the extent to which Jones did contribute to the writing will probably never be known with absolute certainty.</p>
<p>Allegedly, when the Stoners first met him, Andrew Oldham tried to set up a songwriting partnership between Jones and Gene Pitney, the American crooner-songwriter-pianist, but this didn't work out.</p>
<p>Bill Wyman has stated in many interviews that although Jagger and Richards were very protective to their roles as writers, they would be open to good ideas, and he names his "In Another Land" and "Downtown Suzie" as examples where you could get your own material through. Wyman commented also that Jones was "an incredibly gifted musician, but not a song writer". <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Wood_a652.html" title="Ron Wood">Ron Wood</a> has also commented in interviews that he is very proud that he was able to get about two dozen of his songs recorded and released by the Stones, and Wood also has mentioned the protective nature of the Jagger/Richards songwriting partnership. In any case, Jones wasn't supported by the band and the management, and the Jagger/Richards originals laid the foundation of the success of The Stones.</p>
<p>To date, only one officially released song is officially credited to Jones, the 30 second "Rice Krispies", jingle for the Kellogg's company, co-written with <a href="../../../j/2E/w/J.W._Thompson_5076.html" title="J.W. Thompson">J.W. Thompson</a> in 1963 and which the group performed incognito as a commercial (which was common practice for bands to earn money).</p>
<p>A second song, "Sure I Do", was written, recorded and sung completely by Jones in 1963, but the only known copy of it remains in Bill Wyman's "Sticky Fingers" restaurant. It remains unreleased and to date no one is known to have listened to it.</p>
<p>It is known that 14 Stones songs were credited to "<a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanker_Phelge_1223.html" title="Nanker Phelge">Nanker Phelge</a>", a <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> indicating that all members of the group (including Jones) authored the song. They would retire the pseudonym after 1965.</p>
<p><b>Nanker</b> was a strange face Jones and Richards would often make, and <i>Phelge</i> came from their former roommate James Phelge.</p>
<p>Among the <b>Nanker Phelge</b> (aka Jagger/Jones/Richards/<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Watts_713f.html" title="Charlie Watts">Watts</a>/<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Wyman_915d.html" title="Bill Wyman">Wyman</a>) songs are the following Stones compositions:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Stoned</i></li>
<li><i>Now I've Got A Witness</i></li>
<li><i>And Mr Spector And Mr Pitney Came Too</i> (co-written with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Spector_77a0.html" title="Phil Spector">Phil Spector</a>, not released officially)</li>
<li><i>Little By Little</i> (co-written with Phil Spector)</li>
<li><i>2120 South Michigan Avenue</i></li>
<li><i>Off The Hook</i></li>
<li><i>Stewed And Keef (Brian's Blues) (not released officially)</i></li>
<li><i>The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man</i></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best examples of the dispute is "<a href="../../../r/u/b/Ruby_Tuesday_%28song%29_9d3e.html" title="Ruby Tuesday (song)">Ruby Tuesday</a>". Brian's piano and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recorder.html" title="Recorder">recorder</a> are the key musical ingredients to this song, and some fans suggest Jones should have received a writing credit. Sources within the band (e.g. Bill Wyman, Glyn Johns) state that Keith Richards wrote the song, while one source (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianne_Faithfull_8dfd.html" title="Marianne Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a>) states Jones composed the song's basic melody as kind of a mix between medieval music and <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skip_James_bc5d.html" title="Skip James">Skip James</a> blues numbers; Jagger himself stated on Ruby Tuesday, when discussing the songs he wrote with Richards in the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> magazine "Beautiful lyrics and music, neither which I wrote", and Richards explained the title of the song being the name of a hotel he visited while on tour in the US, and the song's story actually being about a groupie. Since the song is credited to Jagger/Richards, that credit is certainly in error - although whether it was composed by Jones, Richards, or both of them remains in doubt.</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint_It_Black_88d4.html" title="Paint It Black">Paint It Black</a>" was supposedly a much different song when Jagger and Richards alone had composed it. Mick Jagger wrote the lyrics and Keith Richards the chords. It didn't become the monster hit as we know it until Bill Wyman suggested to use the bass pedals of the organ for the polka-like rhythm, and Brian Jones suggested to play the main melody on the sitar. It can be argued whether or not Nanker Phelge should be credited with the song, although the song to date remains a Jagger-Richards composition.</p>
<p>The song "Gomper" from the band's album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Their_Satanic_Majesties_Request_091e.html" title="Their Satanic Majesties Request">Their Satanic Majesties Request</a></i>, while also credited to Jagger-Richards, features Jones playing all percussive instruments, sitar, tamboura, flute, and organ in a fairly long instrumental section. An argument can be made that Jones deserves a writing credit for this song as well.</p>
<p>In addition, rumors persist that Jones himself authored the riff to "<a href="../../../h/o/n/Honky_Tonk_Women_de35.html" title="Honky Tonk Women">Honky Tonk Women</a>". While Jones was present when the very first demo's were recorded in March 1969, all Stones members have stated in interviews that the inspiration for the final electric version came from a session with Mick Taylor in early June 1969. Keith Richards claims he took the intro riff from <a href="../../../r/y/_/Ry_Cooder_a10d.html" title="Ry Cooder">Ry Cooder</a>, and that he was inspired to do so due to the country riffs Taylor was playing at the recording session. To date Ry Cooder accuses Keith Richards of "ripping him off", and Cooder refuses to talk about his sessions with the Stones. It could be possible Jones has played guitar on a very early (from March 1969) version of Honky Tonk Women, but it is impossible that he played on the released single version as it wasn't recorded until Jones left.</p>
<p>To conclude, Jones might have co-written a small number of the group's more obscure works, and may have even played a role in the composition of a handful of their more popular songs for which he was never reimbursed. However, his critics note that songwriting was not his greatest strength, and even generous estimates of how much he wrote pale in comparison to the number of Jagger/Richards songs.</p>

<p>Jones' biggest achievement, probably even more important than being a musician, was his status as a fashion icon, exemplified by his rebellious, outlandish fashion sense. As the most photogenic member of the early Rolling Stones, his style of dress and manner did more to influence the fashion scene of swinging 1960s London than perhaps any other musician.</p>
<p>He was of small stature at 5'6" (1.68 m), with blue-green eyes and blonde hair, yet he was a pioneer in molding the "rock star" image. He was known to deliberately walk in crowded streets until girls would recognize him and start chasing him, at which point he would run away as fast as he could (like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> in the film <i><a href="../../../a/_/h/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_%28film%29_c2bf.html" title="A Hard Day's Night (film)">A Hard Day's Night</a></i>).</p>
<p>Jones, along with Jagger, was very politically inclined, and stated in an interview that <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> and recreational drug use should be legal, and expressed his support for the gay rights movement. He gave interviews frequently and is often regarded as the most eloquent member of the group. His intellect, combined with his outspoken dislike of socially imposed constraints, made him one of the earliest English rock stars, and a role model for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Invasion_612b.html" title="British Invasion">British Invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Jones was a major inspiration for the band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brian_Jonestown_Massacre_d3aa.html" title="The Brian Jonestown Massacre">The Brian Jonestown Massacre</a>; the band's logo goes so far as to include a picture of his face.</p>
