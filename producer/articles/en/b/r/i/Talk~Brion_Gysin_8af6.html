<hr />
<p>What about Gysin's drawings and paintings?</p>
<hr />
<p>Biography published: "Nothing is True - Everything is Permitted: The Life of Brion Gysin" by John Geiger</p>
<hr />
<p>Born in England (Location?) of Swiss descent, raised in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Became a naturalized American, who lived most of his life in Morocco and France.</p>
<hr />
<p>How does one pronounce his name?</p>
<hr />
<p>I've seen a lot of different resources that have his name as "Byron Gysin". I was recently reading a book, <i>Acid Dreams</i>, that mentions a "Byron Gysin". Does anyone know what his real name is, or possibly why this is so?</p>
<hr />
<p>he was born in england on a army base. his grandfather was swiss and moved to england. his father born in england. his mother was canadian. he was raised in edmonton canada. born as brian john gysin,it became brion from a mistake on a passport. pornounce as brian 'guy - sin' ...went to university in england,went to france,greece,many other european places. he was a member of the surrealist group,but was kicked out most likely for being openly homosexual. joined the american army where he met a relative of the real 'uncle tom' and wrote 'to master a long good night' joined the canadian army also and studied calligraphy.he was a friend of paul bowels he went to morocco and ran a unsuccessful restaraunt,and also recorded music of jajouka,long before brian jones of the stones stones did. mostly known as a writter he was also a great visual artist as well as a sound artist. some recordings include BG special,the pool K III,music of jajouka,recordings1964-81,songs with steeve lacy and matta. and self portrait jumping. his name is misspelled alot,ive seen brian guyson,brion guysan ect. in morocco sometimes he went as brion van der gysin. the biography by John Geiger is pretty usefull and full of small details. john also wrote a book and the dreamachine,an invention of gysin and ian sommerville. a man named david woodard sells dreamachines and his web site says 'invented by a 'canadian-islamic' ... im really not sure where to say brion was 'from' england,canada,france,morocco...he usualy claimed to be swiss,but i have never read any info on brion even visiting switzerland,much less BEING swiss. but islamic. no. he had interest in theologies,but never persued with any zeal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if one ought to take advice on the pronunciation of Brion Gysin's name from someone who writes that he was a friend of "paul bowels [<i>sic</i>]." I must say, though, that <i>was</i> really funny. Wikipedia comes through again. 66.108.4.183 02:30, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, I'll have to apologise because I don't actually know too much about what sounds like a really interesting guy here. What I do know is that, despite quite a lot of searching I can find <b>no</b> link between Gysin and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop_e92b.html" title="BBC Radiophonic Workshop">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a> as was previously stated (and, in fact, is repeated on the 60 or so articles copied the material on this page). He did indeed make what would be considered <i>radiophonic</i> works, and the "pistol poem" (which was mentioned in relation to the workshop before i deleted it) was indeed made for the BBC as it says <a href="http://www.ubu.com/sound/gysin.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ubu.com/sound/gysin.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, so I can understand where the mix-up would come from. However I can find no evidence he was ever at the Radiophonic Workshop. If anyone can find any source which states otherwise (and isn't connected to the material on this page) then I truly apologise but for now I thought it was best to get rid of it. I've also deleted a couple of links because they didn't seem to link to anything concerning Gysin. I've also discussed it for too long on this page! --Thetriangleguy 19:36, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Recordings-1960-81-Brion-Gysin/dp/B000005A3N" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Recordings-1960-81-Brion-Gysin/dp/B000005A3N" rel="nofollow">Recordings: 1960-81</a> on the track "Thoughts on the BBC," he says he was invited by the BBC in the early 60's to play around with a new 32-track they had obtained. He worked with a producer named Douglas Cleverdon. He says he did the Pistol Poem with Cleverton. He doesn't, however, make it clear if it was done at the BBC Workshop. It's pretty clear he did visit the BBC at some point. I don't know enough about the Workshop to know if it's definitely where he would have visited at the BBC, or if he might have visited some other recording studio, so I'll leave the actual judgement to somebody else. Either way, I'd definitely like to see this article grow. He seems to have been vastly undercredited in his influence of Burroughs and others. From these recordings, it sounds as if he was briefly involved with Breton and the Surrealists, as well as Jean Genet. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecnilgiarc_a14a.html" title="User:Recnilgiarc">Recnilgiarc</a> 14:16, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>"He is best known for his rediscovery of Tristan Tzara's cut-up technique" This seems misleading because Gysin discovered this technique independently, and not because of Tzara (besides, their techniques had differences).</p>
<p>If you listen to Dead city radio(burroughs album) he mentions Brion Gysin afew times. He pronounces it 'guy sin' ,furthermore he was friends with Bowles, even lived with Paul&amp;Jane for a short time. It's all in the Geiger biography.</p>
