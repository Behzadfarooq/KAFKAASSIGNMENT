<dd>For as long as I have known (of) him, brian has preferred an all-lowercase representation of his name, and has consistently used it both online and in traditional print media.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"I don't think his name should be in lower case. If so, there needs to be a footnote or something parenthesized to mention his preference and how his name is generally written, and that's sloppy.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the lower case thing is to get him attention, not only by the look of the name, but also by extra explanatory text that would probably need to be written so people don't think the lower case is a typo.</dd>

<p>It is worth noting that Wikipedia as a rule does not recognize third-party style guides that mandate unusual typefaces, capitalization, colors, etc. Capitialization is a matter of usage rather than spelling, as as such while Mr. Foy may spell his name however he wishes we would then capitalize it in the proper fashion as is our custom. Therefore the page should be moved to Brian D Foy, the vote above notwithstanding. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 16:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. You are all way off. Yes, capitalization and punctuation are a matter of usage, which is precisely why you are wrong: foy is notable with his name being rendered in all lowercase with no punctuation. Indeed, most people who know of him at all don't immediately recognize his name when it is rendered, incorrectly, with capitals and punctuation. Usage reigns supreme, and usage in this case dictates lowercase and no punctuation. You can whine about Wikipedia style all you like, but nothing changes the fact that rendering his name as you have done is verifiably incorrect, and continuing to knowingly add unverifiable, incorrect, information to this entry is vandalism. <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudgenet_f526.html" title="User:Pudgenet">Pudge</a> 16:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Pudge, do you have any evidence that "most people who know of him at all don't immediately recognize his name when it is rendered ... with capitals and punctuation"? <a href="../../../d/r/h/User%7EDrHydeous_5c90.html" title="User:DrHydeous">DrHydeous</a> 21:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure. For starters, look at all the books and magazine articles he's written, the magazine that he publishes. Google him. He is <i>only known</i> without capitals and punctuation. 07:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's not evidence that those people who know of him would not immediately recognise his name when rendered as "Brian D. Foy" - or even as bRiAn FoY. <a href="../../../d/r/h/User%7EDrHydeous_5c90.html" title="User:DrHydeous">DrHydeous</a> 00:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, it's not any such evidence, but I can see that arguing with you here is senseless.

<dd>Actually, it is. Perhaps you are complaining because you do not understand how this evidence supports my case, but it is evidence. I could explain to you how the mind works in regard to language, and how our brains take shortcuts, so to speak, by using the expectation of consistent spelling and capitalization to more quickly recognize words. That would be an analysis of the evidence at hand, to support my case, but without that analysis, the evidence is still evidence.</dd>
<dd>Now, though I do not have to respond to your ad hominem attack against me, I will: yes, I have already made up my mind, because I have examined the evidence and given significant thought to it, and found that it clearly falls on this side of the argument. You have introduced no argument I've not already considered. If you do present a new argument, and it has any merit, I will reconsider my position in light of it. I agree, it would be senseless for you to argue with me here, if you have nothing new to add to the discussion that has not already been considered. <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPudgenet_f526.html" title="User:Pudgenet">Pudge</a> 16:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> An encyclopedia should be descriptive. While having a Wikipedia style guide for the rendering of names is good, because consistency is good and most folks don't care, it should yield when there is a notable preference. Wikipedia should go with the most descriptive term, or should we all be linking to <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Lewis_Alcindor_66ef.html" title="Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor">Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor</a>? This isn't a case of someone just wanting to screw with Wikipedia, he's been doing this for over a decade and has a clear style guide. There doesn't appear to be a technical reason why the canonical page cannot be changed to <i>brian d foy</i> with a redirect from the Wikipedia-style name, that would seem to satisfy all parties.

<li><b>Support</b> the suggestion that the main entry be <i>brian d foy</i> with a link entry from <i>Brian D Foy</i> seems to make the most sense. note that this kind of issue frequently comes up in library cataloging and the systems in place for hundreds of years have to accomodate this kind of indexing variety as publishers can change author's spelling or an anonymous or psudeonym author may become known later and this information is not in the actual book but is in the card catalog or it's electronic equivalent. the Encyclopedia here must have the technical ability to handle it and policies flexible to accomodate these types of situations in order to be maximally useful. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.82.19.21 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.82.19.21_0043.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.82.19.21">contribs</a>) 04:00, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd>THIS ^^ misses the point, completely. But I forgive my anon brother for his apparent lack of knowledge of the previous RM debates relating to the above reference articles and their title's capitalization.

<dd>If citing the actually correct spelling of "E. E. Cummings" "misses the point, completely," then you should not have cited it as evidence to support your case. Further, you and others who cite <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> do so incorrectly. Nothing in the MOS explicitly addresses capitalizing names that are by convention lower-cased, though there is a general style point of capitalizing proper nouns. But the MOS also makes clear that in identification, "<i>neutral point of view</i> and <i>no original research</i> policies always take precedence" over WP style conventions, and that "Where known, use terminology that subjects use for themselves (self-identification). This can mean using the term an individual uses for himself or herself."

<dd>Red herring - "Brian D Foy" and "brian d foy" are semantically identical - they are just rendered differently. We defer to the subject when deciding how we <i>describe</i> them. For instance, we have a redirect at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Dwight_7d41.html" title="Reginald Dwight">Reginald Dwight</a>, because the subject of that article prefers to be referred to by his professional name. When we look at how we <i>render</i> a title, we look at several things. We put some names in CamelCase because it's clear the term is formed from two words run together or a <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blend.html" title="Blend">blend</a>. In the case of Mr. Foy, it appears the reasoning for the lowercase rendering is "I like it better that way" - here on Wikipedia, such a reason carries exactly <i>zero</i> weight. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> <small><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_The_Wiki_Factor_8283.html" title="User:Chriscf/The Wiki Factor">cheese</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chriscf&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">whine</a></small> 04:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
