<p>Educated at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunoon_Grammar_School_2e75.html" title="Dunoon Grammar School">Dunoon Grammar School</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Dundee_7d13.html" title="University of Dundee">University of Dundee</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff_University_a727.html" title="Cardiff University">University College, Cardiff</a>, Brian Wilson was the founding editor and publisher of the <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Highland_Free_Press_430f.html" title="West Highland Free Press">West Highland Free Press</a></i> which he established along with three friends from Dundee University. Founded in 1971, the newspaper was initially based at Kyleakin, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Skye_fdfe.html" title="Isle of Skye">Isle of Skye</a>, and continues to be published from <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadford.html" title="Broadford">Broadford</a>, Isle of Skye. Its uniqueness lay in the radicalism of its political content, particularly on matters relating to the ownership of land, and its role as a local newspaper. It is widely credited with having exerted a strong influence over political debate in the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highlands_and_Islands_251d.html" title="Highlands and Islands">Highlands and Islands</a>, and - along with other concurrent initiatives such as the 7.84 production, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cheviot%2C_the_Stag%2C_and_the_Black_Black_Oil_25dd.html" title="The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil">The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil</a> and publication of John MacEwen's book <i>Who Owns Scotland?</i> - restoring the land question to a place of prominence in Scottish politics. For his early work on the West Highland Free Press, Wilson was made the first recipient of the Nicholas Tomalin Memorial Award. He also wrote widely for national newspapers and, in 1977-78 he was involved in <i>Seven Days</i>, a political weekly in Scotland which folded after a few months.</p>
<p>He was a member of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_National_Party_206a.html" title="Scottish National Party">Scottish National Party</a> for a short time in his teens, but shortly after the formation of the West Highland Free Press in 1971 joined the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> and was soon invited to stand as its candidate in Ross and Cromarty which he contested in October 1974. He stood in two other Highlands and Islands constituencies - Inverness-shire and the Western Isles - in 1979 and 1983 respectively. An opponent of devolution, which he believed would work to the disadvantage of Scotland's more periperhal areas, in 1978 he was chairman of the "Labour Vote No Campaign", which called for a 'no' vote in the Scottish <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum.html" title="Referendum">referendum</a> on whether to have a Scottish Assembly.</p>

In <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_%28parliamentary%29.html" title="Opposition (parliamentary)">opposition</a>, Wilson was spokesperson on election planning (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>), trade and industry (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>), transport (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> - <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>) - where he was recognised as an effective Parliamentary opponent of rail privatisation - and on Scottish affairs (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> - 1992).</p>
<p>In his first Ministerial role, as Scottish Office Minister for Education and Industry, he had responsibility for the Highlands and Islands which allowed him to deliver on some of the issues that he had campaigned for over a long period. He established the Community Land Unit and the Fund on which community buy-outs of crofting estates was based. He was Scotland's first designated Minister for Gaelic. Along with the Irish President, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Robinson_1447.html" title="Mary Robinson">Mary Robinson</a>, he launched Iomairt Cholm Chille in an effort to bring closer together the Gaelic-speaking communities of Scotland and Ireland. As Energy Minister, he was a strong supporter of both renewable energy - which he had long championed as a journalist - and nuclear power, not least because of his familiarity with Hunterston nuclear power stations in his own constituency. Wilson took a great deal of interest in Cuba which he visited on a number of occasions as a Minister in an effort to improve political and trade links. He has written extensively in defence of Cuba and about his meetings with <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> he formally announced his intention to step down from politics at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">2005 General Election</a>, when the Cunninghame North constituency was replaced by the new <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_509d.html" title="North Ayrshire and Arran (UK Parliament constituency)">North Ayrshire and Arran</a> seat, created in the boundary changes to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> constituencies in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Parliament_cfd8.html" title="Westminster Parliament">Westminster Parliament</a>.</p>

<p>Though now a former politician, Mr Wilson continues to publicly comment on UK government energy policy, particularly on the subject of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>, which he is a supporter of, and has written opinion pieces in national newspapers as well as appearing on television news programmes to air his views. He writes columns in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_on_Sunday_0846.html" title="Scotland on Sunday">Scotland on Sunday</a> and the West Highland Free Press. A life-long supporter of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Football_Club_c994.html" title="Celtic Football Club">Celtic Football Club</a>, he wrote the club's official cententary history in 1988 (Celtic; A Century with Honour, Collins Willow) and since leaving politics he has become a non-executive director of Celtic plc. He is also chairman of the UK Operations Board of Airtricity, the Irish-based renewable energy company, and a director of Amec Nuclear.</p>
<p>He is married with three children. One of his children has <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down%27s_Syndrome_4972.html" title="Down's Syndrome">Down's Syndrome</a>, but he has not mentioned this much, saying that he does not want to become a professional Down's Syndrome parent. However, he has occasionally critised the pressures that are placed on women to terminate pregnancies that carry the "risk" of Down's, stating that such decisions are private matters and all parents are entitled to balanced information before reaching them.</p>
