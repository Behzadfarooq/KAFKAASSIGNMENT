<p>THIS PAGE IS EVILY WRONG! The Brisbane line called for the country to be split in half horizonally, sort of. Some one fix damn it!</p>

<dd>I don't think it's right either. Every article i've ever read suggested the brisbane line was supposed to be quite a few hundred Kms north of brisbane. Why the hell would they surrender Brisbane City but defend the sparsely populated areas south of brisbane. Makes no sense at all. I'll try to find a source and if I can I will change the article. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 12:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps looking into documents from the Royal Commission in the matter of an inquiry into a statement that there was a document missing from the official files in relation to "The Brisbane Line" might help.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 14:24, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a plethora of information available on the NAA web site. It includes images of newspaper articles which were compiled into a document (I gave it as a source), court action taken by ward against the Sydney morning Herald and the Age and the original files of the enquiry.</p>
<p>There's a lot we can do with this article. There are all sorts of angles to the story. For instance, General Mcarthur's admission that the Australian defence forces did have such a policy, suggestions that Ward made his statement for political gain, the exact statements made by ward (verbatum).</p>
<p>I don't have time to do much with it any time soon but anyone else can feel free to use the links i've provided in the sources section and peruse the documents naa documents. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 15:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current pic in the article is clearly ludicrous. There is no evidence that plans for the 'line' existed let alone defensive walls. Unless someone can provide evidence to the contrary I will have to remove the photo.</p>
<p>Also the use of a time line would be a good idea. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransylvanianTwist_ec42.html" title="User:TransylvanianTwist">TransylvanianTwist</a> 02:31, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be described as evidence that the Brisbane line exists. That's why I changed the descriptor. I've heard stories about ppl claiming certain structures were evidence of the Brisbane line. As long as we can get a source that the structure in the image is claimed by someone, being quoted in reliable source, to be possible evidence of the Brisbane line i'm happy for it to stay. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 12:33, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is slightly crazy. The 'brisbane line' (if it existed) was only a plan. As I said before the pic is ludicrous. Provide evidence or I intend to remove it on the grounds of lack of any evidence. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransylvanianTwist_ec42.html" title="User:TransylvanianTwist">TransylvanianTwist</a> 05:16, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK well firstly if you vandalise this page I will report you. Secondly if you remove the image without providing evidence for its removal I will restore it. Thirdly I didn't add the image and even if I did there is no need to be rude and finally, during my research for this article I did come across claims of structures in place which were suggested as evidence of the Brisbane Line. Feel free to peruse the myriad of information I placed in the sources section. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 21:29, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just read the 'references'-they all state that the line was fictious. So to have a pic of some 'remnants' is clearly crazy. Have you read your 'references'? You are defending the indefensible. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransylvanianTwist_ec42.html" title="User:TransylvanianTwist">TransylvanianTwist</a> 04:24, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah so you read this then 'Even today, older Australians point to tank traps and the like in various parts of northern Australia that they firmly believe are physical evidence of this non-existent Brisbane Line' from here: <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/army/ahu/books_articles/brisbaneline.htm.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.defence.gov.au/army/ahu/books_articles/brisbaneline.htm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defence.gov.au/army/ahu/books_articles/brisbaneline.htm.htm</a></p>
<p>This article is not about a factually existing brisbane line. It is about the allegations made. An allegation that was neither proven nor disproven. If these structures are included in the allegation they belong in the article. It makes absolutely no difference what-so-ever if the Brisbane Line was real or not. Based on your logic none of the national archives documents should be included or sighted either because the Brisbane line didn't exist. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 09:33, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've written to Celcom requesting a source that this particular structure has been alleged to form part of the allegedly proposed Brisbane Line. I've given him 1 week to respond and at which time I will agree to the removal of the image. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 10:02, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've left out these edits as part of the reversion intentionally. Apart from being worded very poorly, the artcile as it currently stands makes it blatantly obvious that this was an alleged 'proposal'. It isn't necessary to refer to the line in this way just as it isn't necessary to refer to the tropic of capricorn as something that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as an 'alleged proposal' what was actually supposed to have been proposed is quite ambiguous. There are three separate claims i've heard. The original allegation was that the 'top part of the country' was to be surrendered. General McArthur's claims are that the line ran from Brisbane to Perth and others have claimed the line was marked by the murrumbidgee river protecting only the heavily populated areas of the east coast of Australia. So having said that I do agree that the current wording needs to change. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 10:14, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There actually is evidence of this proposal. The most compelling of which are General McArthur's remarks. You may or may not see this as 'enough' evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the line existed, however, it is still factually innacurate to suggest there is 'No' evidence that the Brisbane Line existed.</p>
<p>Nobody has added this to the article yet. I just wanted to pre-empt any attempts to do so because I can see this was used as an argument for removing the aforementioned image. <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.254.168.102.html" title="User:62.254.168.102">62.254.168.102</a> 10:36, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree but no evidence has been offered supporting this image is as much as suspected to be part of the brisbane line by anyone. I gave the contributor 1 week to provide evidence and he didn't. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 22:16, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Note to self... First section of timeline (March 1943) is based on a what may be an unreliable source. This needs to be verified by another source. We don't know exactly what was said nor do we know who this was reported to? ie. was it a statement in parliament or an interview with a journalist. Who reported it? Is the suggestion that the line ran from Brisbane to Adelaide correct? No other source seems to mention this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exactly what were Douglas MacArthur's comments to the press conference in March 1943. We know it was a press conference and that he was answering a question put to him. We know that whatever he said was in favour of Mr Ward's allegation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the 1950s or 60s MacArthur came made a public coment (or did someone else make it in a biography of MacArthur) that the line existed, he opposed it and it was to run from Brisbane to Perth. I can't remember where I read this exactly.</li>
