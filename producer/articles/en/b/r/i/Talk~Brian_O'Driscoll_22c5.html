<p>I think that the reference to the "illegal spear tackle" should be removed from the Brian O'Driscoll entry as the laws of Rugby Union do not define or mention a "spear tackle". The laws of the game are <a href="http://www.irb.com/NR/rdonlyres/8910ED80-FA98-4B60-896B-D3AC62DC7BAB/0/A5IRBLawBook2005.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.irb.com/NR/rdonlyres/8910ED80-FA98-4B60-896B-D3AC62DC7BAB/0/A5IRBLawBook2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">available for anyone to read</a>, I think that it's inflamatory and incorrect to refer to the tackle as illegal. Just so you know I'm Irish and a rugby player.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess the rules don't define or mention a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spear_tackle.html" title="Spear tackle">spear tackle</a> because that kind of contact is beyond the rules, no less than punches, karate chops or taser stuns; they could all come under the Old Testament heading of DO NOT PARALYSE. On seeing the TV replay of the O'Driscoll tackle - paying especial attention to Umaga's left-hand gesture before the lift - shouldn't you have shouted NO! <a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">shtove</a> 02:05, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
"However, both All Black players were criticised for what most fans and commentators consider a dishonourable '<a href="../../../s/p/e/Spear_tackle.html" title="Spear tackle">spear tackle</a>'" - I'm not sure about the use of "most" here. "Most" Northern Hemisphere fans and commentators probably, but I think the general view among NZ fans and commentators was rather different? Rhion 12:47, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does O'Driscoll still play domestically for Blackrock College? I'm not hugely up to speed on how the Irish domestic structure works but I thoguht since the introduction of the Celtic League players have played only for their provinces.

<dd>I Think you are right. I'm not 100% sure how the regionlisation system works in Ireland either.
