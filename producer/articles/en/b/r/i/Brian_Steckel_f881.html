	    <p><b>Brian D. Steckel</b> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">December 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> – <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>) was a convicted <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murderer</a> executed in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._state_5a68.html" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a>. He was convicted of the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> and murder on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> of 29-year-old Sandra Lee Long near Prices Corner, Delaware, near <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilmington%2C_Delaware_23b8.html" title="Wilmington, Delaware">Wilmington</a>.</p>
<p>His was the first execution in the state since Abdullah Tanzil Hameen was executed on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">September 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Brian Steckel knocked on Long's door and asked if he could use her telephone. He then unplugged the telephone and demanded sex from her. After she refused he threw her onto a couch and attempted to strangle her with some <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantyhose.html" title="Pantyhose">pantyhose</a>. The pantyhose broke, so he continued his attack with a sock. After she succumbed to the lack of <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, he penetrated her first with a screwdriver he had brought with him, and then <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodomy.html" title="Sodomy">sodomized</a> her. He dragged her to a bedroom, where he set her and the bedroom curtains on fire.</p>
<p>Steckel left the scene and went to the home of a former co-worker for a few <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer.html" title="Beer">beers</a>. The man left, and so Steckel got the man's wife to drive him to the <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquor.html" title="Liquor">liquor</a> store. The route she chose took them past Long's apartment, which was now on fire. The woman said that Steckel became noticeably agitated and became angry when she jokingly said "you look like you've killed someone."</p>
<p>At the apartment, two men tried to rescue Long, who had since regained consciousness. They could not get into the burning apartment, however, and she died from smoke inhalation and burns to 60% of her body.</p>
<p>Within hours of the fire, a man called <i>The News Journal</i> saying he was the "Driftwood Killer" and named his next victim. This woman was put into protective custody by police, where she told them that she had been receiving phone calls that were "very lurid, very sexual." The calls to the newspaper and the woman were traced to Brian Steckel, and he was arrested over an outstanding harassment <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrant_%28law%29.html" title="Warrant (law)">warrant</a>. Steckel was <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intoxication.html" title="Intoxication">intoxicated</a> at the time of the arrest and so given the night to sleep it off. The next morning, after waiving his <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_warning.html" title="Miranda warning">Miranda rights</a>, he confessed to the attack on Long. A <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic.html" title="Forensic">forensic</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dentist.html" title="Dentist">dentist</a> determined that a bite wound on Steckel's finger had been received in the last 24 hours, by Long's teeth.</p>
<p>He was convicted in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Castle_County%2C_Delaware_c173.html" title="New Castle County, Delaware">New Castle County</a> of three counts of first degree murder (one count of "intentional" murder and two counts of felony murder.) After the separate penalty phase, he was <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_sentence.html" title="Death sentence">sentenced to death</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, by a vote of 11-1. During the penalty phase he told the jurors that: "I ask you to hold me accountable for what I did … I know what I did was wrong: it was selfish [and] despicable."</p>
<p>Steckel has been otherwise unrepentant for his crime. During his trial he sent Long's mother a copy of the autopsy report attached to a note that read "Read it and weep. She's gone forever. Don't cry over burnt flesh."</p>
<p>The sentence and conviction were affirmed by a Delaware Superior Court on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">May 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. Throughout 1998 and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Steckel continued to <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal.html" title="Appeal">appeal</a> his conviction and sentences, claiming that he had ineffectual defense. This claim was rejected by the Superior Court on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, and by the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_Supreme_Court_64d7.html" title="Delaware Supreme Court">Delaware Supreme Court</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">April 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. Other appeals for the writ of <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habeas_corpus.html" title="Habeas corpus">habeas corpus</a> were denied by <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._District_Court_for_the_District_of_Delaware_cec5.html" title="U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware">U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Third_Circuit_cb81.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a>. Steckel also tried to challenge the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitutionality</a> of the death penalty laws in place in Delaware at the time of his sentencing. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, a Superior Court set an execution date of <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>.</p>
<p>For his last meal he ordered <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheesesteak.html" title="Cheesesteak">cheesesteak</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coleslaw.html" title="Coleslaw">coleslaw</a> and a <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi.html" title="Pepsi">Pepsi</a>. During his last statement he said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I want to say I'm sorry for the cruel things I did. I'm not the same man I was when I came to jail. I changed. I'm a better man. … I walked in here without a fight, and I accept my punishment. It is time to go. I love you people. … I'm at peace."</dd>
</dl>
<p>He was pronounced dead at 00:21 hrs <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Daylight_Time_1108.html" title="Eastern Daylight Time">EDT</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> after being executed by <a href="../../../l/e/t/Lethal_injection.html" title="Lethal injection">lethal injection</a> at the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_Correctional_Center_24d7.html" title="Delaware Correctional Center">Delaware Correctional Center</a>, near <a href="../../../s/m/y/Smyrna%2C_Delaware_e029.html" title="Smyrna, Delaware">Smyrna</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fordham_University_c410.html" title="Fordham University">Fordham University</a> <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> professor Deborah Denno, a death penalty expert, said that descriptions of the execution seem to suggest that there were several failures in injecting the drugs. Witnesses said several audible clicks were heard during the twelve minutes after Steckel finished his last statement. During this time Steckel was still lucid and continued to make several comments to his family members and friends who witnessed the execution. She said it appears that the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedative.html" title="Sedative">sedative</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralytic.html" title="Paralytic">paralytic</a> drugs failed to take affect as Steckel was seen to <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seizure.html" title="Seizure">convulse</a>. Delaware Department of Correction spokeswoman Beth Welch said that nothing went wrong with the execution and the length of time was just due to the Warden giving Brian Steckel more time for his statement.</p>
