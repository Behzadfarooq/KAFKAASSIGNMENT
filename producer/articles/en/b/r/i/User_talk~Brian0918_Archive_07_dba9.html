<p>Thanks for your contributions to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Henry_College_7dd4.html" title="Patrick Henry College">Patrick Henry College</a>. PHC isn't that strict in my opinion. They accept pretty much all Christians, and the statement of faith doesn't really exclude Catholics, even. There is a dress code during business hours in the academic buildings, but the code only states that we dress as if at a workplace (and modesty all the time).</p>
<p>Ms. Rosen is doing a great job reporting on the school, as far as reporters go.</p>
<p>We make fun of our sheltered status a lot, but many students didn't live sheltered childhoods (the majority did, including me). The school taught me how to think, how to reason, and to not assume what I always believed was correct.</p>
<p>Saw your comments to <a href="../../../p/a/p/User%7EPapetti_92d1.html" title="User:Papetti">User:Papetti</a> How are you interested in PHC? I'd be happy to answer any questions you have. <a href="../../../d/d/e/User%7EDDerby_76ea.html" title="User:DDerby">DDerby</a> 1 July 2005 14:35 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is the story, if you want to hear it. On the forum <a href="http://p072.ezboard.com/bsonichqcommunity" class="external text" title="http://p072.ezboard.com/bsonichqcommunity" rel="nofollow">here</a>, a user kept harrassing (sp?) me in 2003. He/She (not sure which) peeved me off so much I emailed him/her and threatend to kill him/her. I was banned from that site and I kept re-registering, and they contacted my ISP, and they contacted mom. Not long after that, I had to be sent to a psych ward, since thier were many other things at that time due to my unstability at that time, that incident was only the top of the iceburg, but was the worst infraction I committed during the time. Since then, I have not gotten into trouble. But to this day for that, I cannot get into email. --Admiral Roo July 1, 2005 17:18 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the addition of the watch list bug banner to the home page shows very poor judgement, and am pleased to see it has been removed. Moreover, defacing the home page like that cannot be considered a minor edit.

<p>Brian: Are you aware that posting a <u>Template:Test</u>-style message on the talk page of a registered user can seem aggressive and insulting. Please do not do what you did to <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossnixon_14dc.html" title="User talk:Rossnixon">User talk:Rossnixon</a> to any other talk pages. If you have a problem with the changes introduced by a registered editor, it is more constructive to describe your problems than to characterise them (even implicitly) as vandalism.—<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 2 July 2005 18:42 (UTC)</p>
<p>Brian: In my opinion the placing of such templates is <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">incivil</a>. The fact that you are not alone in so doing does not make it seem less aggressive to the recipient. Any suggestion that an editor's well-intentioned edit is vandalism is likely to be seen as insulting. Making such a charge against a registered user (who has made an implicit acceptance of community guidelines) is discourteous at best. Your request that I cite policy to support a request that you avoid behaviour that "can seem aggressive and insulting" disappoints me.—<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 2 July 2005 21:03 (UTC)</p>
<p>Brian: I am not condoning Ross's behaviour. His characterisation of evoloution as pseudoscience was inappropriate. Using a test template on him was inflammatory, however. It is possible that he would have responded as fiercely to a personal message asking him to remove the inappropriate categorisation. Now we can never know, but I feel certain that the use of the template cannot have improved things. I will ask him to apologise to you and I hope that you will apologise unconditionally to him.—<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 2 July 2005 21:28 (UTC)</p>

<li>Removed reference to unaccredited status
<ul>
<li>since PHC has only existed for 5 years and is actively working on accreditation, the reference to its status was misleading - few 5-year-old schools are accredited. However, simply removing the reference as I did was a terrible solution. My new edit discusses the whole situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"from its inception" in place of "from the start"
<ul>
<li>grammatically, the first is more precise; the second leaves a slight ambiguity about what is starting and what "starting" means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The college is non-denominational and its students have diverse denominational backgrounds."
<ul>
<li>This is supported by <a href="http://www.phc.edu/about/FundamentalStatements.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.phc.edu/about/FundamentalStatements.asp" rel="nofollow">the college's website</a>, and as a student I have observed it to be true. This information is helpful in clarifying the college's religious position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Removed textbook listings:
<ul>
<li>Most articles about schools don't list examples of textbooks they use, and it seems to be trivial information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Student life/rules
<ul>
<li>as I noted in my edit summary, the rules have changed in the last semester, and students are allowed in social lounges of opposite-sex dorms (which some may interpret "living area" to include).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the heads-up. May I ask, from a purely mechanical standpoint, how you decide when to create a list versus a category? (I've been scratching my head just today about a guy who created a category for every article relating to George Custer.

<p>I am <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Scriptorium#Remove_Tables_and_Lists_from_Wikisource" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Wikisource:Scriptorium">pushing</a> for removal of the line about accepting lists from the Wikisource documentation. If that happens, something needs to be done with all these lists. I know you would probably rather not deal with this issue again but I just wanted to give you the heads up. I think the idea of moving lists to commons is a good idea. Did anyone take it up with the commons group? <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:CSN" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:CSN">CSN</a> 01:44, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>No I agree with you completely. The list is great work and definately should not be deleted. I would just like to move it whereever it belongs long term before a precedent is set for source. Yesterday someone added <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/List_of_dead_in_Bolivian_Gas_War" class="extiw" title="wikisource:List_of_dead_in_Bolivian_Gas_War">wikisource:List of dead in Bolivian Gas War</a> and <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/List_of_%22Shit_happens%22_jokes" class="extiw" title="wikisource:List_of_&quot;Shit_happens&quot;_jokes">List of "Shit happens" jokes</a> to source. I don't think source should become the repository for lists. Shit, I already added a question to the commons village pump asking if they accept lists... Should I delete it? I don't want to stir up a hornets nest. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:CSN" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:CSN">CSN</a> 02:07, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I deleted the request from commons and changed the link on the wikipedia article to point to the commons version. I'm going to try to get this deleted from source now if you don't have any further objection, and I'll move all future lists I come across there as well. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:CSN" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:CSN">CSN</a> 02:19, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have restored my casual query. While not the most brilliant thing I've written on WP, it was friendly, relevant to the Wikipedia space content and asked a question that was mildly interesting. The most objectionable thing about it is that it is in a rather obscure location. I would be delighted if you would enlighten me as to what speedy deletion criterion your comment "unnecessary addition" refers to. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree">Tree</a> 03:43, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
