<p>Thanks for the explanation. I think a period of a few days is a little short since lots of people don't get on that often. But if there absolutely must be a merger, and I see your point about articles about dorms in every college, then it should be much more detailed than the one that was put together earlier. A list of capacities and famous alumni is of no use to anybody. Since I'm a ND student I'll try to work on it since I generally know what is relevant. Only after the List articles are finished should the others be redirected to it or deleted though, not before. And how exactly are you supposed to archive Talk material <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillywebby_1f97.html" title="User:Sillywebby">Sillywebby</a> 20:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why the hell did you merge all of the Notre Dame residence hall articles into a list?? Why would anybody want to look at a list of dorms that tells them nothing but how many people live there and what famous people lived there? That tells you nothing about the dorm itself. You could get that off the school's website. These articles had a ton of information about the unique traditions and styles of each dorm. I reverted as much as possible but at least 3 articles have been lost permanently. Idiotic decision on your part. Don't merge them again. Lots of information lost, thanks to you. It also appears that you "suggested" this merge and then did it before anybody else could throw in their thoughts about it. This place doesn't revolve around you. Do you even go to Notre Dame? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillywebby_1f97.html" title="User:Sillywebby">Sillywebby</a> 16:56, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a suggestion for an addition to the Images help material; where shall I send it? Basically, I think a warning is needed about the use of tables and images - articles frequently start with tables on the right, and if an image is used and is on the right, it ends up under the table, with any following text below and to the left - potentially creating an unsightly and potentially misleading gap. ("Hey, I guess that's the whole article... kind short, wasn't it?") I have now corrected two articles that had that same problem. It is a particularly insidious problem because if you edit an article section by section everything looks fine, <i>because the table isn't in the section you are editing.</i> --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 08:25, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been in a silly editing war over an entry for Charles de Granville, a French apple liqueur. The entry was put up by the producer, was badly written, and did not have a neutral POV. After several rounds of trying to deal with this guy, I thought my last version was about as good of an article as this subject deserves - and more - and the guy is still insisting on deleting it and replacing it with his own (which is a bit better than it used to be, but still not very good.) Could someone else chime in and help persuade this guy that Wikipedia is not for marketing? Or maybe lock down my last version of the article? You can see the extensive discussion on the talk page. (I have to admit, my first entry wasn't very diplomatic.)</p>

<dd>Hello, it's good that you have taken the issue to the talk page of the article.

<dd>Oh god, I don't know what to do about that article. I've reverted him again, on the article and talk page (where he told you to "go eff yourself"). The user seems unwilling to co-operate.

If you have time, I'd like you to examine the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Hooks_0165.html" title="Bell Hooks">Bell Hooks</a> article and talk page. It's a scholarly article about a controversial writer, someone who drew the ire of a conservative commentator. They wanted me to go get the quote from her book, and I did that. But now, they're arguing it's not notable. As a fellow AfD frequenter, you will know that of all the meaningless academic trivia included on her page, that what they wanted to exclude was really ridiculous: that she says as an opening to her book, <i>Killing Rage</i>, "I am writing this essay sitting beside an anonymous white male that I long to murder". This may in itself be notable, but David Horowitz wrote about it in 100 Dangerous Professors, and it was written about on front page mag, and all the citations are given on the page. I would appreciate your help--I'm contending with some very difficult Marxists who are attached to her work, and think that they're defending the liberal cause, but really, they're just keeping out material that is very easily notable.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 07:26, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think I should apologize for my comment in response to your pointing out my lack of prolificness in editing. I've been pouring over WP policies for what seems like forever now (though it's more like a few weeks), and I've just run across the "meatpuppet" issue, and against the posted advisory not to take it personally in <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">WP:GD</a>, I believe I did. So, I apologize for my newbie-ness, but please be aware that I do care greatly about WP policies as much as I care about freeware and the AR article, and am not just a "meatpuppet" sent to participate in an AfD. To be honest, I am just not naturally "bold" about editing other people's work, it feels a bit strange, but I know a bit about this subject, and am attempting to learn the ropes of the processes here. <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> 20:43, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again, and sorry about this, I'm hoping for some advice. At this point, I'm resigned to the possibility that the AR article will be deleted (I sort of figured it was likely after it was nominated, but that wasn't going to keep me from trying to prevent it&#160;:P) - however, there's a user who's had some... let's just say bad history... with the AR community that's rather effectively mucking up the discussion. I've tried to get the discussion back on track, but there's a lot of attacking/ranting going on, and I'm unsure how to proceed, and starting to lose my temper. Obviously, he's welcome to his opinion, but the way he's expressing it is rather inflammatory, imho. I've considered an admin alert, but I have no idea if that is acceptable, or worth bothering with for this situation. Could you please advise? Also, I've floundered around a bit with a good way to get started helping out beyond the AR article, and there's just so much, it's a bit overwhelming, which is why I never got involved before&#160;:( -- <span style="font-weight: bold; padding: 2px; background-color: white; color: purple; border: 1px solid purple"><a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/i/User_talk%7ETaikara_4a54.html" title="User talk:Taikara">Talk</a></span> 02:51, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks again, you've been really helpful, and I appreciate it. I think I'll just stop responding to him full stop, as I've already tried the "we agree to disagree, please stop" tactic. Unfortunately, I've experienced this before, and I should know from that experience that saying so much as "hello" is inviting a tirade. I think I was just caught a bit off guard by him here on WP. I think I'll try to check out things I'm familiar with as I think of them, that was an excellent suggestion! <span style="font-weight: bold; padding: 2px; background-color: white; color: purple; border: 1px solid purple"><a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/i/User_talk%7ETaikara_4a54.html" title="User talk:Taikara">Talk</a></span> 03:40, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there&#160;:) I started a new article (<a href="../../../a/_/l/A_Land_Remembered_e570.html" title="A Land Remembered">A Land Remembered</a> - it's a really good book), and it hasn't been nominated for deletion yet, yay! It's just an itsy bitsy stub right now though (was a little nervous about it getting deleted lol), so I'm planning on expanding it and adding another article about the author, Patrick Smith. I suppose he's notable enough, having been nominated for multiple Pulitzers and Nobels and a plethora of other awards. I just have to get down to the library to get some good research material for citations, all I really have at my house is the book. So, thanks again for being encouraging. As for my question - AR somehow miraculously withstood the AfD, but the person who nominated it is now hitting the article with all sorts of tags - weasel words, NPOV, merge, etc. I agree that it should probably be checked for POV, but is it "normal" on WP for articles to be tagged for merging directly after a keep consensus on an AfD? From the examples I've seen, and even another AfD I've participated in, merging is a potential consensus option. It seems to me that he's just sore that his nomination was contested and denied, but I'm not familiar enough with standard procedure on WP yet to make that assumption. If it's not normal, I'm not sure what to do about it (nevermind that I don't know what exactly to do if it IS normal, either). Sorry to bother you with this sort of stuff again, but you've been nice, and I don't really know anyone else to ask yet.</p>
<p>Also, congratulations on the new addition to your family!! (sorry if that's intrusive, I read over the AfD linked above and noticed your comment - can't learn the ropes if you don't check things out, you know) Ja ne, <span style="font-weight: bold; padding: 2px; background-color: white; color: purple; border: 1px solid purple"><a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaikara_1f91.html" title="User:Taikara">Taikara</a> | <a href="../../../t/a/i/User_talk%7ETaikara_4a54.html" title="User talk:Taikara">Talk</a></span> 20:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. You don't see my prod in the history because a) the article is under a slightly different name and b) even if it was under the same name I think you wouldn't see the history prior to the article's first deletion.

<dd>I appear to have missed a couple of examples in a list of about fifty. The fact remains: the article is <i>almost</i> entirely about highway ramps, and is currently clearly misnamed. The deletion discussion went badly for a number of reasons, including people who like that particular listcruft, and a really terrible rename concept, and a number of sources being ignored repeatedly. What we probably should have is an article on unused freeway ramps (Unused highway ramp, redirect from <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub_ramp.html" title="Stub ramp">Stub ramp</a>), an article on unused freeway road segments (<a href="../../../u/n/u/Unused_highway.html" title="Unused highway">Unused highway</a>), and shorter lists on each one (List of unused highway ramps, (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unused_highways.html" title="List of unused highways">List of unused highways</a>).

<p>A ramp and a highway are sometimes hard to tell apart - some "ramps" go on for miles. However, I suppose someone could make some criteria up and then sort the article into ramps and highways. Then, a few months down the line, the article could be split in two. Of course, as a deletionist what I would do is go through and eliminate everything that is unreferenced and sounds non-notable - which would probably reduce the article by 75% or more.

<dd>That's exactly what I was going to say - there is no clear line between ramps and highways.

<p>I agree with some of your concerns, but I would like to be given the chance to provide all my documentation before things are deleted. As you have probably noticed, I have added links to relevant info all day long, and Im not even close to being finished.</p>
<p>I do have concerns about adding categories to this, as Idont want to libelously associate possibly incriminating categories for which I have little or no direct materials backing it up. I need to be given a fair opportunity to present my argument as to why the particular categories are pertinent.</p>
<p>However, I am VERY familiar with the legal ramifications of defamation and libel and I assure you, if you can point something out to me that might be potentially libelous and that need further documentation, then I will certainly be willing to oblige.</p>
<p>Also, I really feel the need to keep the "Notice to SSH and Airola" diclaimer in the page, please advise why you think it should not be included. I do not want to give SSH or Airola the impression that this cannot be informally disputed or modified.</p>

<p>No, my opinion remains the same, and I do not concur with a merge to Mexican Cuisine since Tacos are not just Mexican any more than Pizzas are Italian. Besides that, it may be worth noting that AfD is not a vote, but an expression of opinions. Perhaps that was just a slip of the tongue on your part, but given that you did say it, I felt it was appropriate to inform you of that. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:59, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I do realize why you made that comment, having added another entry to the AfD, however, it really didn't change my opinion, and honestly, my real concern was the vote remark. That's not what AfD is about, but so many people think it is, that I, and many other people have gotten into the habit of reminding folks who do remark on votes in the AfD context that it's not a vote. I am, however, now troubled by the statement that you didn't even examine the article. Yes, I did see you're just completing a nomination, but even in that case, you should examine an article carefully, and not make statements about it. I honestly don't see why anyone would assume it was a hoax, or ridiculous. The ingredients in a given kind of food are very much definable, and while in some cases, it may be difficult to cover them(and yes, I do realize that potentially anything can be put into a taco, or on a pizza), it doesn't mean that some description is impossible. List of taco fillings was obviously meant to do that, and while I don't think it needs to be its own article, I do think the information itself is valuable. Given that <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco.html" title="Taco">taco</a> is a relatively minimal article, I say merge. It'd be one thing if that article was as complete as <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger.html" title="Hamburger">hamburger</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_dog.html" title="Hot dog">hot dog</a> or <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza.html" title="Pizza">pizza</a> but it is not. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:59, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am somewhat familiar with bundling AfD nominations, though I've never done it.

<p>It was a work in progress by myself, hence the lack of information. The church is notable being as it was formed out of the <i>oldest</i> church in Motherwell. Part of the buildings date back to the 1700s and are listed by Historic Scotland.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You have advocated keeping the above article in the current AfD debate. However, you say that "it seems to have been - <i>regrettably</i> - established that all American high schools are notable". In point of fact, nothing of the sort has been established, though there is a small claque that would certainly like this to be the case. There are many people ( of whom I am one ) who do not hold this view, but believe that normal notability criteria should apply to schools as to any other subject. If this is what you also believe, perhaps you may wish to review your contribution to the debate.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brianyoumans, today about a dozen stub articles for middle schools in Loudoun County, Virginia, were <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Belmont_Ridge_Middle_School_663a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Belmont Ridge Middle School">Multiple AfDed</a>. Apparently, when that happens, if a contributor hasn't included the single target school (<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belmont_Ridge_Middle_School_89e4.html" title="Belmont Ridge Middle School">Belmont Ridge Middle School</a> in this case) on his watchlist, then he is unaware of the AfD discussion until after the fact, even if some of the other schools grouped into the AfD are on his watchlist. Is this accurate? I reviewed my watchlist for 02/12 and nothing shows up (Belmont Ridge was not on my list, but some of the others were).</p>
<p>If so, then contributors with interests in those articles may be left out of the discussion. I don't necessarily disagree with the points made in the AfD, but I would have like to have weighed in on the issue. In fact, after looking at the discussion participants, there's not a single editor from the group of us that regularly work on Loudoun County articles. Is there another way to accomplish this so easily identifiable interested parties are not left out?</p>
<p>Also, redirecting the deleted articles back to the school system page can have advantages, but what if someone wants to re-initiate an article for one of those AfDed schools down the road? What would be the process?<br />
Thanks,</p>

<p>WEll it looks like all those FCPS middle schools get to stay, even after the deletion review, which came across to me as though some of the admins were slightly perturbed at you. NOw I dont want to get into personal attacks here, but maybe there are better things you can do with your time on wikipedia, like adding articles and improving current ones instead of just deleting as many as you can. All the Middle school articles can be made better by adding references. If you don't want to do that, may I kindly suggest a wikibreak? <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> 16:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Brianyoumans, I just removed an AFD tag from <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longfellow_Middle_School_9060.html" title="Longfellow Middle School">Longfellow Middle School</a>, but this may have been an error. I followed the link in the tag to the AFD discussion and saw that the result was 'keep' and removed it on that basis. However, after doing so I realised that the AFD discussion it linked to was actually for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Middle_School_%28Virginia%29_fa1b.html" title="Liberty Middle School (Virginia)">Liberty Middle School (Virginia)</a>. I was going to put it back and fix the link, but I notice there is not a discussion in progress for Liberty Middle School (Virginia).</p>
<p>I'm thinking, that if you intended to tag Liberty Middle School (Virginia), it is probably best just to do it again as something odd went on with the original tag. Of course I am no expert so it may have been perfectly OK and I have stuffed something up. If so please accept my apologies.</p>

<p>Which tag (on the actual page) is appropriate for disputes on a policy? Thank you. I appreciate your time. I will watch your page&#160;:) Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 01:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know, offhand. I'm afraid that I haven't really been a Wikipedia policy wonk. The "disputed" tag was obviously inappropriate, though. The answer may be that there isn't any such tag; there will always be <i>someone</i> who disagrees with a particular policy page; the question is, does a consensus of Wikipedians continue to support it? You could try running a poll by posting to various places and asking people to vote, but I suspect that you would find that most people support the idea of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> even if they may want to change it one way or another. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 01:42, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>thank you, I found the tag.</dd>
<dd>As I mentioned on the talk page, a poll on the disputetag seems a little overly bureaucratic, I did offer the tag as a comprise, personally changing the policy tag back to the guideline tag. I hope we can comprimise on this. It seems looking at the archive page, I don't really know how without involving third parties (which I really want to ultimatly avoid on this particular page), do you have any suggestions?

<li>Actually the tag is far from innocuous, and is generally used in an attempt to "bring down" guidelines if a small minority does not like the existing consensus (to be fair, it has its good uses, but it is frequently abused as such).

Any way WGO does exist.</p>

Actually, I'm pretty convinced that you are just a bored New Zealand teenager who listens to rap music and fancies himself in a gang.

<p>Hi Brianyoumans,</p>
<p>I felt kind of bad bringing up a point only tangentially related to the deletion discussion about that article on Saddam Hussein's human rights record. You point out that there have been other bad regimes in that part of the world, which is true, but I'm sure that Saddam stands out even there. Molly Ivins once wrote a column in which she had said more people had died in Iraq since the invasion than during Saddam's 24 years in power. Soon after, she apologized with another column. This was written in 2005, I think, and there have been more deaths since, and the Lancet has published (disputed) figures putting the death toll so far at 600,000 or so, but here's what Ivins said then about estimates of Saddam's death toll:</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to Human Rights Watch, Hussein killed several hundred thousand of his fellow citizens. The massacre of the Kurdish Barzani tribe in 1983 killed at least 8,000; the infamous gas attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja killed 5,000 in 1988; and seized documents from Iraqi security organizations show 182,000 were murdered during the Anfal ethnic cleansing campaign against Kurds, also in 1988. [...]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Saddam's regime left 271 mass graves, with more still being discovered. That figure alone was the source for my original mistaken estimate of 20,000. Saddam's widespread use of systematic torture, including rape, has been verified by the U.N. Committee on Human Rights and other human rights groups over the years. [...]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There have been estimates as high as 1 million civilians killed by Saddam, though most agree on the 300,000 to 400,000 range, [...]</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can read the whole column here (scroll down to "Crow Eaten Here"): <a href="http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/23493/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/23493/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>I haven't checked, and I could be wrong, but I think 300,000 is more than the Assads ever killed in Syria. It may be below the Algerian deaths (but those came from two sides in a civil war) or fewer than the Moroccans killed (which would surprise me), but keep in mind it's a low estimate. I'd add on to that the deaths of soldiers (again, Ivins was talking about <i>civilian</i> deaths) from the Iran-Iraq war. On top of that, add on the cruelty of the torture so many went through in so many different ways — something not typical of all regimes. The list of states that killed that many civilians isn't very long. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 16:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi.. I know you got some heat for the vote tally you are keeping, but I think that it is pretty good and interesting actually. Even though I am sure that people are acting in good faith in the sense that they are voting in the way that they believe is right, it is pretty revealing since maybe it reveals the sub-concious thought process that we use without even realizing&#160;:) I don't know if you have ever followed debates on that part of the world, but even for the smallest of debates it is always pretty clear where the faultlines lie, if there ever is a "final decision" point (ie vote etc). Just goes to show that at the end of the day if enough people come together they can create their own truths based on the what they have learned as "basic notions" when they were small.. And there are those who don't want to "break ranks"!! Quite fascinating frankly...
