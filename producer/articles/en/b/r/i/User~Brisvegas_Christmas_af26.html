	    <p><b>Christmas</b> (literally, the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>) is a traditional <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday.html" title="Holiday">holiday</a> in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_calendar.html" title="Christian calendar">Christian calendar</a>, celebrated in most of the Western world on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>, which celebrates the birth of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. According to the Christian <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">gospels</a>, Jesus was born to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus_3bac.html" title="Mary, the mother of Jesus">Mary</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem.html" title="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a>, where she and her husband <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joseph_8013.html" title="Saint Joseph">Joseph</a> had travelled to register in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a> census. Christ's birth, or <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity.html" title="Nativity">nativity</a>, was said by his followers to fulfill the prophecies of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> that a <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">messiah</a> would come, from the house of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a>, to redeem the world from <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">original sin</a>. Early Christians celebrated more the subsequent <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28Christian%29_4b8f.html" title="Epiphany (Christian)">Epiphany</a>, when the baby Jesus was visited by the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a>, and efforts to fix a date on which to celebrate his birth began some centuries later. The precise <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology_of_Jesus%27_birth_and_death_99cb.html" title="Chronology of Jesus' birth and death">chronology of Jesus' birth and death</a> as well as the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">historicity of Jesus</a> are still debated.</p>
<p>In predominantly Christian countries, Christmas has become the most economically significant holiday of the year, and it is also celebrated as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> holiday in many countries with small Christian populations, such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. It is largely characterized by exchanging gifts within families, and by gifts brought by <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> or other mythical figures. Local and regional Christmas traditions are still rich and varied, despite the widespread influence of American and English Christmas motifs through literature, television, and other media.</p>
<p>"Christmas" is a contraction of "Christ's Mass". It is derived from the Old English <i>Cristes mæsse</i>. It is often abbreviated to <i><a href="../../../x/m/a/Xmas.html" title="Xmas">Xmas</a></i>, possibly because the letter X resembles the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_alphabet.html" title="Greek alphabet">Greek</a> letter <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chi_%28Greek_letter%29_403b.html" title="Chi (Greek letter)">Χ</a> (Chi), which is the first letter of "Christ" as spelled in Greek (Χριστός [Christos]).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_Christmas_af26.html" title="Edit section: The story of Christmas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The story of Christmas</span></h2>
<p>The story of Christ's birth has been handed down for centuries, based primarily on the Christian gospels of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew.html" title="Matthew">Matthew</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke.html" title="Luke">Luke</a>. The gospels of Mark and John do not address the childhood of Jesus, and those of Matthew and Luke give somewhat differing accounts, Luke's being closest to the public impression of the Christmas story and the version most often read in Christmas services.</p>
<p>According to Luke, Mary learned from an angel that she was with child, by virtue of impregnation without intercourse by the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. Shortly thereafter, she and her husband Joseph left their Nazareth home to travel to Joseph's ancestral home, Bethlehem, to enroll in the census ordered by the Roman emperor, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Augustus</a>. Finding no room in inns in the town, they set up primitive lodgings in a stable. There Mary gave birth to Jesus in a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manger.html" title="Manger">manger</a>, which has been translated in various ways, most commonly a feeding trough or stall. Christ's birth in Bethlehem of Judea, the home of the house of David from which Joseph was descended, fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaiah.html" title="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>.</p>
<p>Matthew's gospel begins by recounting the genealogy and virgin birth of Jesus, and then skips to the coming of the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Wise_Men_41d7.html" title="Three Wise Men">Three Wise Men</a> from the East to the home where Christ was staying after his birth in Bethlehem. This leaves ambiguous at whose home they were staying and whether Mary and Joseph were residents of Nazareth or, as their access to a home in Bethlehem suggests, of Bethlehem. The wise men first arrived in Jerusalem and reported to the local <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Herod_6aa8.html" title="King Herod">King Herod</a> that they had seen a star heralding the birth of a king. Further inquiry led them to Bethlehem and the home of Mary and Joseph. They presented Jesus with treasures of "gold, frankincense, and myrrh", and then returned home without notifying Herod of the success of their mission. Matthew then reports that the family next fled to Egypt to escape the murderous rampage of Herod, who had decided to have the children of Bethlehem killed in order to eliminate any local rivals to his power. When Jesus and his family returned to Israel, it was then that they settled in Nazareth, where they believed they might live more anonymously.</p>
<p>Another aspect of Christ's birth which has passed from the gospels into popular lore like this visit by the wise men, or <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a>, is the announcement by angels to nearby shepherds of Jesus' birth . Like the Magi, the shepherds observed a huge star directly over Bethlehem, and followed it to the birthplace. The Magi have been variously interpreted as "wise men" or as kings; and are supposed to have come from Arabia, where they could have gotten their gifts of "gold, frankincense, and myrrh". Astronomers and historians have sought with varying success to explain what combination of traceable celestial events might rationally explain the appearance of a giant star that had never before been seen.<sup><a href="#Footnotes" title="">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The major gaps in narrative details between Matthew and Luke, the absence of any reference to Christ's birth in the other gospels, and the fact that even the accounts of Matthew and Luke were written decades later, without confirmation by eyewitnesses, have led to much speculation about the accuracy of these reports. As one of the tenets of their faith, Christians accept the veracity of the story of Christmas, apparent difficulties reconciling the different versions of events notwithstanding.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_Christmas_af26.html" title="Edit section: Dates of celebration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dates of celebration</span></h2>
<p>Efforts to fix a date for the birth of Christ began some two centuries after his death, as the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> began to establish its traditions. Christmas is now celebrated on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a> in Catholic and Catholic-derived churches (<a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodoxy_14a3.html" title="Eastern Orthodoxy">Eastern Rite</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>), and thus in most of the Western world. In the nations of the former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, and other regions where the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodoxy_14a3.html" title="Eastern Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox</a> churches are more prominent, Christmas is now celebrated on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a>. This date results from their having accepted neither the reforms of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> nor the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_Julian_calendar_9b10.html" title="Revised Julian calendar">Revised Julian calendar</a>, with their ecclesiastic December 25 thus falling on the civil date of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/9/2099.html" title="2099">2099</a>. The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Church_dbcd.html" title="Armenian Church">Armenian Church</a> places much more emphasis on the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany.html" title="Epiphany">Epiphany</a>, the visitation by the Magi, than on Christmas.</p>
<p>Dates for the more secular aspects of the Christmas celebration are similarly varied. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_season.html" title="Christmas season">Christmas season</a> traditionally runs for twelve days following Christmas Day. These <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_days_of_Christmas_8ac9.html" title="Twelve days of Christmas">twelve days of Christmas</a>, a period of feasting and merrymaking, end on <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_Night_%28holiday%29_7e72.html" title="Twelfth Night (holiday)">Twelfth Night</a>, the Feast of the <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feast%29.html" title="Epiphany (feast)">Epiphany</a>. This period corresponds with the liturgical season of Christmas.</p>
<p>In practice, the Christmas period has grown longer in some countries, including the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and the United Kingdom, and now begins many weeks before Christmas, allowing more time for shopping and get-togethers. It extends beyond Christmas Day up to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a>. This later holiday has its own parties. In some instances, including <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>'s <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogmanay.html" title="Hogmanay">Hogmanay</a>—which occurs at the New Year— it is celebrated more than Christmas.</p>
<p>Countries that celebrate Christmas on December 25th recognize the previous day as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Eve_b7d8.html" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, and some of them follow Christmas day with <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing_Day_453b.html" title="Boxing Day">Boxing Day</a>. In the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, Christmas Day and Boxing Day are called First and Second Christmas Day.</p>

<p>An enormous number of customs, with either secular, religious, or national aspects, surround Christmas, and vary from country to country. Most of the familiar traditional practices and symbols of Christmas, such as the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a>, the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_ham.html" title="Christmas ham">Christmas ham</a>, the <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yule_Log_f2ed.html" title="Yule Log">Yule Log</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly.html" title="Holly">holly</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistletoe.html" title="Mistletoe">mistletoe</a>, and the giving of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presents.html" title="Presents">presents</a>, were adapted or appropriated by Christian missionaries from the earlier <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asatru.html" title="Asatru">Asatru</a> <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> midwinter holiday of <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yule.html" title="Yule">Yule</a>. This celebration of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_solstice.html" title="Winter solstice">winter solstice</a> was widespread and popular in northern Europe long before the arrival of Christianity, and the word for Christmas in the Scandinavian languages is still today the pagan <i>jul</i> (=yule). The Christmas tree per se is believed to have first been used in Germany.</p>
<p>Rather than attempting to suppress such popular pagan feast days, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_I_7fd0.html" title="Gregory I">Gregory I</a> allowed Christian missionaries to give them a Christian reinterpretation, while permitting most of the associated customs to continue with little or no modification.<sup><a href="#Footnotes" title="">2</a></sup> The give and take between religious and governmental authorities and celebrators of Christmas continued through the years. Places where conservative Christian theocracies flourished, as in Cromwellian England and in the early New England colonies, were among those where celebrations were suppressed.<sup><a href="#Footnotes" title="">3</a></sup> After the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_b5cc.html" title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, Christmas celebrations were banned in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> for the next seventy five years. A few present day Christian churches, notably the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, some <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> groups, and some ultra-conservative <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist_Christian_fc95.html" title="Fundamentalist Christian">fundamentalist</a> denominations, still view Christmas as a pagan holiday not sanctioned by the Bible, and do not celebrate it.</p>

The concept of a mythical figure who brings gifts to children derives from <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Nicholas_1178.html" title="Saint Nicholas">Saint Nicholas</a>, a good hearted <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> of 4th century <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>. The <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch.html" title="Dutch">Dutch</a> modeled a gift-giving Saint Nicholas around his feast day of December 6. In North America, English colonists adopted aspects of this celebration into their Christmas holiday, and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinterklaas.html" title="Sinterklaas">Sinterklaas</a> became <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a>, or <i>Saint Nick</i>. In the Anglo-American tradition, this jovial fellow arrives on Christmas Eve on a <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleigh.html" title="Sleigh">sleigh</a> pulled by <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reindeer.html" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>, climbs down the chimney, leaves gifts for the children, and eats the food they leave for him. He spends the rest of the year making toys and keeping lists on the behavior of the children.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> equivalent of Santa, Père Noel, evolved along similar lines, his red and white clothing inspired by the Coca-Cola commercial drawings of Santa which spread worldwide in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930s</a>. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knecht_Ruprecht_0690.html" title="Knecht Ruprecht">Knecht Ruprecht</a>, or <i>Black Peter</i>. In some versions, <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf.html" title="Elf">elves</a> in a toy workshop make the holiday toys, and in some he is married to <a href="../../../m/r/s/Mrs._Claus_b807.html" title="Mrs. Claus">Mrs. Claus</a>. Many shopping malls in North America and the United Kingdom have a holiday mall Santa Claus whom children can visit to ask for presents.</p>

<p>In many countries, children leave empty containers for Santa to fill with small gifts such as toys, candy, or fruit. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, children hang a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_stocking.html" title="Christmas stocking">Christmas stocking</a> by the fireplace on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Eve_b7d8.html" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, because Santa is said to come down the chimney the night before Christmas to fill them. In other countries, children place their empty shoes out for Santa to fill on the night before Christmas, or for Saint Nicholas on December 5. Gift giving is not restricted to these special gift-bringers, as family members and friends also bestow gifts on each other.</p>

<p>In many countries, Saint Nicholas Day (December 6) remains the principal day for gift giving. In much of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, children put shoes out on window sills on the night of December 5, and find them filled with candy and small gifts the next morning. In such places, including the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, Christmas day remains more a religious holiday. In <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, and in countries with similar traditions, gifts are brought by the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magi.html" title="Magi">Magi</a>, fortune tellers and priests of a pagan religion, at <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feast%29.html" title="Epiphany (feast)">Epiphany</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_6.html" title="January 6">6 January</a>.</p>
<p>One of the many customs of gift timing is suggested by the song <i><a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_7ea1.html" title="Twelve Days of Christmas">Twelve Days of Christmas</a></i>, celebrating an old British tradition of gifts each day from Christmas to Epiphany. In most of the world, Christmas gifts are given at night on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Eve_b7d8.html" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_24.html" title="December 24">24 December</a>) or in the morning on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Day_0d60.html" title="Christmas Day">Christmas Day</a>.

<p>Municipalities often sponsor decorations as well, hanging Christmas banners from street lights or placing Christmas trees in the town square.

<p>In many countries, businesses, schools, and communities have Christmas parties and dances. These often take place during the several weeks before Christmas Day. Some groups put on Christmas pageants, which may or may not include a retelling of the story of the birth of Christ. Such enactments are especially common in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. Groups also may go out <i>carolling</i>, visiting neighborhood homes to sing Christmas songs. Others are reminded by the holiday of man's fellowship with man, and do extra volunteer work, or hold fundraising drives for charities.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day or on Christmas Eve, a special meal of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_dishes.html" title="Christmas dishes">Christmas dishes</a> is usually served, for which there are traditional menus in each country. In some regions, particularly in <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, these family feasts are preceeded by a period of fasting. Candy and treats are also part of the Christmas celebration in many countries.</p>

<p>The religious celebrations begin with <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advent.html" title="Advent">Advent</a>, the anticipation of Christ's birth, around the start of December, and are marked by special church services. Advent services often include Advent carols, and the period is also celebrated with Advent calendars, sometimes containing sweets and chocolate for children. Immediately before Christmas, there are many Christmas services at churches, at which Christmas hymns and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_carol.html" title="Christmas carol">Christmas carols</a> are sung. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, special services may include a midnight mass or a Mass of the Nativity.</p>
<p>The holiday's popularity is so pronounced that other faiths have emphasized their own winter holidays to serve as a Christmas surrogate. The most obvious example is <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>'s <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanukah.html" title="Chanukah">Chanukah</a>, which in the 20th century has evolved a similar tradition of family gift-giving.</p>
<p>Christmas has a reasonable amount of acceptance in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> world, as Jesus is a prophet of Islam and a celebration of his birth is not to be rejected outright. Many western, secular aspects of Christmas are becoming common in developed Muslim nations.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the celebration of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Nicholas_Day_2f6a.html" title="Saint Nicholas Day">Saint Nicholas Day</a> on December 6th resembles the Christmas of the English-speaking world. <i>Sinterklaas</i>, from whom the English and American Santa evolved, is based on the real <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Nicholas_1178.html" title="Saint Nicholas">Saint Nicholas</a>, and brings presents on the evening of December 5 to every child who has been good. He wears a red bishop's dress with a red mitre, rides a white horse over the rooftops, and is assisted by many mischievous helpers called 'zwarte Pieten' (black Peters). In some parts of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, and <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, the frightening <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knecht_Ruprecht_0690.html" title="Knecht Ruprecht">Knecht Ruprecht</a> also appears, to the chagrin of many children.</p>
<p><i>Sinterklaasavond</i> (St. Nicholas evening) remains more important in the Netherlands than Christmas, although in recent years, the Dutch have started to celebrate Christmas Eve with Santa as well. This sparks minor controversy each year over when it is "appropriate" to start celebrating Christmas, with shopkeepers preferring to start the lucrative Christmas season immediately after Sinterklaasavond (sometimes putting up decorations even earlier) while others argue that the "foreign" and "commercial" Christmas impinges too much on the traditional Sinterklaas celebrations. Considering the ancestry of Santa Claus, it has truly been said that Sinterklaas is in competition with himself here.</p>
<p>In Germany, Christmas traditions vary by region. Following <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Nicholas_Day_2f6a.html" title="Saint Nicholas Day">Saint Nicholas Day</a>, which is mostly for children, the actual Christmas gift-giving usually takes place on the night of Christmas eve, with gifts put under the Christmas tree after a simple meal. The culinary feast typically takes place at lunch on Dec. 25, and usually involves poultry (typically roast goose). The gifts may be brought by the <i>Weihnachtsmann</i>, who resembles St. Nicholas, or by the <i>Christkind</i>, a sprite-like child who may or may not represent the baby Jesus. Commercially, the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striezelmarkt.html" title="Striezelmarkt">Striezelmarkt</a> is arguably a worldwide Christmas gift production center, boasting the specialities of the <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresden.html" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> region, from ceramics and prints to various delicacies which are shipped worldwide.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, businesses traditionally invite their employees to a Christmas <a href="../../../s/m/%C3%B6/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord.html" title="Smörgåsbord">smörgåsbordlunch</a> (the julbord or jullunch) in the weeks before Christmas. In recognition of the threat of holiday food poisoning, Swedish newspapers traditionally run seasonal laboratory tests of restaurant jullunches, warning of the danger of cold meats and mayonnaise left out at room temperature. Christmas is as everywhere a holiday of food, with the central Christmas feast focused on baked ham, but there are wide regional variations as to what day it is best served. The most entrenched and nationally unifying Swedish Christmas custom is perhaps that of watching a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a> special at 3 PM on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Christmas celebration begins with feasting on Dec. 24, followed by a visit by "Julenissen", who brings gifts to children who have behaved. After a quiet Dec. 25, another large celebration follows on <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing_Day_453b.html" title="Boxing Day">Boxing Day</a>, when children may go door to door to receive treats and money from neighbors. Joulupukki (or <i>Christmas Goat</i>) is the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish_language.html" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a> Santa Claus. He travels with a sleigh and reindeer to deliver gifts to good children.</p>

<p>Modern traditions combine with holdovers from their Roman forebears in the celebrations of <i>Natale</i>, the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a> Christmas. The pagan feast of <i>Saturnalia</i> coincides with the Christian advent, and the holiday season there spans from these weeks through Epiphany. Food, religious observances, nativity displays, and gift-giving are prominent. In some regions, presents are brought on Epiphany by <i>La Befana</i>, and in others by Baby Jesus on Christmas day or eve. In recent years <i>Babbo Natale</i>, a Santa Claus-like figure, is becoming more common.</p>
<p>The blessing on Christmas Eve of the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reindeer.html" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>-<a href="../../../g/o/a/Goat.html" title="Goat">goats</a> takes place in the <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicilian.html" title="Sicilian">Sicilian</a> village of St Giacomo.

The Marchese recites the Latin blessing: "Solus balatro puto hoc quisquiliae". The villagers then cheer the Marchese while his family hands out gifts to the children. The blessing of the reindeer goats ensures for all a happy Christmas and prosperous new year.</p>

However the gifts are given a day before, on Christmas Eve, or <i>Štědrý den</i> (<i>Štedrý deň</i> in Slovak, meaning "open-handed day"). According to tradition, gifts are brought by <i>Ježíšek</i> pron. "Yezheeshek" (<i>Ježiško</i> pron. "Yezhishko" in Slovak), or "little Jesus". Many very old Christmas traditions are followed, mostly for fun. People are taught not to eat anything on Christmas Eve until a ceremonial dinner is served, in order to be able to see a "golden pig". The gifts are displayed under the Christmas tree (usually a <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spruce.html" title="Spruce">spruce</a> or <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine.html" title="Pine">pine</a>), and people open them after the dinner.</p>
<p>Other Czech Christmas traditions involve predictions for the future. Apples are always cut crosswise; if a star appears in the core, the next year will be successful, while a cross suggests a bad year. Girls throw shoes over the their shoulders; if the toe points to the door, the girl will get married. Another tradition requires pouring a little molten lead into water and guessing a message from the shapes that appear when it hardens.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, Christmas Eve is a day first of fasting, then of feasting. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star, and is followed by the exchange of gifts. The following day is often spent visiting friends.</p>

The secular customs and gift-giving in these countries are an admixture of traditions handed down from European and Native American forebears, plus the increasing influence of American culture.</p>
<p>Gift giving traditions include "El Niño Jesus" (Baby Jesus) who brings gifts to children in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>'s "Viejo Pasquero" (Old Man Christmas), and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>'s "Papai Noel", the latter two resembling Santa Claus in many ways. South American "Santas" dress more lightly in keeping with the warmer Christmas there, and have adopted a number of means, from ladders to trampolines, to enter homes at night. Gift giving in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> occurs on January 6, their "Three Kings Day", when children leave shoes under their beds to be filled with snacks or small gifts by the Magi, who stop off on their way to Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Nativity scenes are a strong feature of South American Christmas, both in homes and in public places. In regions with large numbers of Native American descendants, such as <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>, the figures are often hand-carved in a centuries-old style. As in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, village processions acting out the events surrounding the birth of Christ are also common. Family Christmas meals are very important, and their contents are as varied as the number of countries on the continent. Christmas lights are a near-universal holiday feature, and with the summery weather, fireworks displays are also found, especially over the cities of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a> is the date of the signing of the Constitution of the Republic of China in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>. The official holiday on that date is largely treated as if it were Christmas. Japan has largely adopted the western Santa Claus for its secular Christmas celebration, but their <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a> is the more important holiday. In <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, most educational institutions have a Christmas vacation, beginning shortly before Christmas and ending a few days after <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a>. Christmas is also known as <i>bada din</i> (the big day) in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, and revolves there around <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> and shopping. In <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, Christmas is celebrated as an official holiday.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> has earned the distinction of celebrating the world's longest Christmas season. Traditionally, Christmas Day in the Philippines is ushered in by the nine-day dawn masses that start on Dec. 16. Known as the Misas de Aguinaldo (Gift Masses) in the traditional Spanish, these masses are more popularly known in Filipino as the Simbang Gabi. Christmas Eve on Dec. 24 is the much-anticipated "noche buena" -- the traditional Christmas feast after the midnight mass. Family members dine together on traditional noche buena fare, which includes the queso de bola ("ball of cheese", usually edam) and hamon (Christmas ham).</p>

<p>Christmas has inspired many fictional Christmas stories that try to capture the spirit of Christmas in the form of a modern-day <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy_tale.html" title="Fairy tale">fairy tale</a>. These often involve heart-touching tales involving a Christmas <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracle.html" title="Miracle">miracle</a>.

<p>Among the most popular are <a href="../../../t/c/h/Tchaikovsky.html" title="Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Nutcracker_558f.html" title="The Nutcracker">The Nutcracker</a> ballet, the story of a Christmas ornament come to life in a young Russian girl's dream, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Christmas_Carol_7a12.html" title="A Christmas Carol">A Christmas Carol</a></i>. "A Christmas Carol" is the tale of curmudgeonly miser <a href="../../../e/b/e/Ebenezer_Scrooge_0ab4.html" title="Ebenezer Scrooge">Ebenezer Scrooge</a>. Scrooge rejects compassion and philanthropy, and Christmas as a symbol of both, until he is visited by the <i>Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future</i>, who show him the consequences of his ways. Through this and other Christmas stories, Dickens is sometimes credited with shaping the modern celebration of Christmas in English-speaking countries (tree, plum pudding, carols, etc.) and the movement to close businesses on Christmas day.</p>
<p>If Dickens shaped the anglophone Christmas traditions, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Nast_ea20.html" title="Thomas Nast">Thomas Nast</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_Clarke_Moore_51a8.html" title="Clement Clarke Moore">Clement Moore</a> provided the English-speaking countries with their popular images of Santa Claus. Nast's 19th century cartoons gave Santa his familiar form, while Moore's poem <a href="../../../a/_/v/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas_69af.html" title="A Visit from St. Nicholas"><i>A Visit from Saint Nicholas</i></a> (popularly known as <i>The Night Before Christmas</i>) supplied the rotund Santa and his sleigh landing on rooftops on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Although these Christmas icons have become widespread through television and movies, Christmas is still a time when national traditions are strong, and both Santa's appearance and the stories told vary from country to country. Some Scandinavian Christmas stories are less cheery than Dickens', notably <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._C._Andersen_1311.html" title="H. C. Andersen">H. C. Andersen</a>'s "The Little Match Girl". The destitute little slum girl walks barefoot through snow-covered streets on Christmas Eve, trying in vain to sell her matches, and peeking in at the celebrations in the homes of the more fortunate. She dares not go home because her father is drunk. Unlike the principals of anglophone Christmas lore, she meets a tragic end.</p>
<p>Many Christmas stories have been adapted to <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">movies</a> and <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_special_596f.html" title="TV special">TV specials</a>, and have been broadcast and repeated many times on TV. Since the popularization of home video in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, their many editions are sold and re-sold every year during the holiday shopping season. A notable example is the film <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i>, the theme of which mirrors <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Christmas_Carol_7a12.html" title="A Christmas Carol">A Christmas Carol</a></i>. Its hero, George Bailey, is a businessman who sacrificed his dreams to help his community. On Christmas Eve, a guardian angel finds him in despair and prevents him from committing suicide, by magically showing him how much he meant to the world around him.</p>
<p>A few true stories have become enduring Christmas tales themselves. The story behind the Christmas carol "<a href="../../../s/i/l/Silent_Night_%28song%29_3ecc.html" title="Silent Night (song)">Silent Night</a>" and the story of "<a href="../../../y/e/s/Yes%2C_Virginia%2C_there_is_a_Santa_Claus_418b.html" title="Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus">Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus</a>" are among the most well-known of these true tales of Christmas.</p>
<p>Radio and television have also aggressively pursued entertainment and ratings through their cultivation of Christmas themes. Radio stations broadcast <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_carol.html" title="Christmas carol">Christmas carols</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_song.html" title="Christmas song">Christmas songs</a>, including classical music such as the Hallelujah chorus from <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handel.html" title="Handel">Handel</a>'s <i><a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah_%28Handel%29_8974.html" title="Messiah (Handel)">The Messiah</a></i>. Among other classical pieces inspired by Christmas are the <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutcracker_Suite_777e.html" title="Nutcracker Suite">Nutcracker Suite</a>, adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet score, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_d0b5.html" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>'s <i>Christmas Oratorio</i> (BWV 248). Television networks add Christmas themes to their standard programming, run traditional holiday movies, and also produce a variety of other Christmas specials.</p>

<p>Christmas is typically the largest annual stimulus for the economies of celebrating nations. Sales increase dramatically in almost all retail areas, as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies for parties and for visiting guests. Shops introduce new products that are sold at premium prices, as customers take advantage of marketing opportunities. In the United States, the <i>Christmas shopping season</i> has lengthened such that it now begins the day after <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, known as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Friday_%28shopping%29_f994.html" title="Black Friday (shopping)">Black Friday</a> in the retail industry. For some shops and businesses, Christmas Day is the only day in the year that they are closed. The economic impact of Christmas continues after the holiday, with Christmas sales and New Year's sales, when stores sell off excess inventories.</p>
<p>Many <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist_Christians_a8ab.html" title="Fundamentalist Christians">fundamentalist Christians</a>, as well as anti-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumerism.html" title="Consumerism">consumerists</a>, decry the "commercialization" of Christmas. They accuse the Christmas season of being dominated by money and greed, at the expense of the holiday's more important values of compassion, generosity, and kindness. Frustrations over these issues and others can lead to a rise in Christmastime social problems (see below).</p>
<p>In North America, the holiday movie season often includes release of studios' most prestigious pictures, in an effort both to capture holiday crowds and to position themselves for <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> consideration. Next to summer, this is the second-most lucrative season for the industry. <i>Christmas</i> movies generally open no later than Thanksgiving, as their themes are not so popular once the season is over.</p>

<p>Because of the focus on celebration, friends, and family, people who are without these, or who have recently suffered losses, are more likely to suffer from <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> during Christmas. This increases the demands for counseling services during the period.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicides</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murders</a> spike during the holiday season.

<p>Non-Christians in predominantly Christian nations may be left bereft of entertainment around Christmas, as stores close and friends depart for vacations. The cliché recreation for them is "movies and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_food.html" title="Chinese food">Chinese food</a>"; movie theaters remaining open to bring in holiday box office dollars and Chinese (and presumably <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddism.html" title="Buddism">Buddhist</a>, et al.) establishments being less likely to close for the "big day".</p>

<p>Many different dates have been suggested for the celebration of Christmas. No explanation of why it is celebrated on December 25 is universally accepted. Theories include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> article on "Christmas"</a> offers a starting-point for Christmas, which does not appear among the earliest lists of Christian feasts, those of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irenaeus.html" title="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertullian.html" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>. The earliest evidence of celebration is from Alexandria, about 200 A.D., when <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_of_Alexandria_389e.html" title="Clement of Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> says that certain Egyptian theologians "over curiously" assign not just the year but the actual day of Christ's birth.<sup><a href="#Notes" title="">4</a></sup> ,on 25 Pachon (May 20) in the twenty-eighth year of Augustus. By the time of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicea_d0cb.html" title="Council of Nicea">Council of Nicea</a>, 325 A.D. the Alexandrian church had fixed a <i>dies Nativitatis et Epiphaniae</i>. The December feast reached Egypt in the 5th century. In Jerusalem, <a href="../../../e/g/e/Egeria_%28nun%29.html" title="Egeria (nun)">Egeria</a> the 4th century pilgrim from Bordeaux, witnessed the feast of the Presentation, forty days after January 6, which must have been the date of the Nativity there. At <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antioch.html" title="Antioch">Antioch</a>, probably in 386, St <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> urged the community to unite in celebrating Christ's birth on December 25, a part of the community having already kept it on that day for at least ten years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is an appropriation by early Christians of a day on which the birth of several pagan gods, <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osiris.html" title="Osiris">Osiris</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_%28god%29.html" title="Jupiter (god)">Jupiter</a>, and <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutus.html" title="Plutus">Plutus</a>, or the ancient deified leader <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimrod_%28king%29.html" title="Nimrod (king)">Nimrod</a>, was celebrated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is an appropriation of the pagan Midwinter festivals, such as the Germanic <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yule.html" title="Yule">Yule</a> and the Roman <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festival_of_the_Unconquered_Sun_60b9.html" title="Festival of the Unconquered Sun">festival of the birth of Unconquered Sun</a>, celebrated on the day after the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_solstice.html" title="Winter solstice">winter solstice</a>, or the Roman festival of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturnalia.html" title="Saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It derives from the tradition that Jesus was born during the Jewish Festival of Lights (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a>, the 25th of Kislev and the beginning of <a href="../../../t/e/v/Tevet.html" title="Tevet">Tevet</a>). Kislev is generally accepted as corresponding with December. Under the Old Julian calendar, the popular choice of 5 BC for the year of Jesus's birth would place the 25th of Kislev on the 25th of November.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The date of Christmas is based on the date of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Friday_4f29.html" title="Good Friday">Good Friday</a>, the day Jesus died. Since the exact date of Jesus' death is not stated in the Gospels, early Christians sought to calculate it, and arrived at either March 25 or April 6. To then calculate the date of Jesus' birth, they followed the ancient idea that Old Testament prophets died at an "integral age"—either an anniversary of their birth or of their conception. They reasoned that Jesus died on an anniversary of the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation.html" title="Incarnation">Incarnation</a> (his conception), so the date of his birth would have been nine months after the date of Good Friday—either December 25 or January 6. Thus, rather than the date of Christmas being appropriated from pagans by Christians, the opposite is held to have occurred. [See Duchesne (1902) and Talley (1986).]</li>
