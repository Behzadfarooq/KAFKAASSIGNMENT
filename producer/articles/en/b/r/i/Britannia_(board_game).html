<p><br />
Britannia is a 3-5 player game that takes approximately 4 hours to complete. The primary rules are for 4 players using the counter colours as printed in the game, but there are variant scenarios for 3 and 5 players, as well as a 3-player Shorter Game and several short 2-player scenarios. Each player controls several nations.</p>
<p>The game begins with one army in each area of Britain, with each part of the island occupied by different nations: the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgae.html" title="Belgae">Belgae</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigantes.html" title="Brigantes">Brigantes</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caledonians.html" title="Caledonians">Caledonians</a> (representing the distinctive <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broch.html" title="Broch">Broch</a> culture) and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picts.html" title="Picts">Picts</a>. A force of Romans begin in the English Channel and are the first nation to move. Through their superior fighting power and mobility the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_army.html" title="Roman army">Romans</a> will come to dominate most of the board, but will eventually the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> will withdraw their forces from Britain completely, leaving behind just the scattered <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romano-British_d0d8.html" title="Romano-British">Romano-British</a>. Meanwhile, throughout the game, further nations arrive from across the seas: the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaels.html" title="Gaels">Scots</a>, and later the <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html#Ireland" title="Viking">Dubliners</a>, from the west; the <a href="../../../v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Norsemen</a> from the north; the <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxons.html" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angles.html" title="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Denmark_4be5.html" title="History of Denmark">Danes</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html#History" title="Norway">Norwegians</a> from the east; the <a href="../../../j/u/t/Jutes.html" title="Jutes">Jutes</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Normans</a> from the south. All of these nations will compete with each other, as well as the existing nations, for turf. Some nations will be destroyed, and the recurring theme in Britannia is that nations will rise and fall. However all nations will make their contribution to a player’s Victory Point total and eventual victory or defeat.</p>
<p>At the end of the game all four players will have the possibility to become the King of England through their control of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Godwinson_e9f3.html" title="Harold Godwinson">Harold the Saxon</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William of Normandy</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harald_Hardrada_140c.html" title="Harald Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweyn_II_of_Denmark_8034.html" title="Sweyn II of Denmark">Svein Estrithson</a>. However this in itself will not determine who will win the game.</p>
<p>Nations take their turns in strict order, each taking one turn in each Game Round.</p>
<p>Each nation's turn has five phases.</p>
<p><b>Population Increase:</b> In this phase nations other than the Romans count the territory they hold and may be able to add new armies to the board through natural increase of population.</p>
<p><b>Movement:</b> In this phase a nation may move none, some or all of its pieces on the board. Distances are generally limited, but some nations may be able to move pieces along the coasts using boats. Also new forces arriving from across the sea will be able to land. Roman and cavalry forces can move further than infantry, as can forces with leaders.</p>
<p><b>Battles/Retreats:</b> Where a nation has moved forces into an area held by another nation a battle will occur. Once all movement is complete battles are resolved with the aid of dice. Battles are conducted in rounds and forces of both sides may retreat after each round. The ability of nations to retreat and fight another day is a major part of the flavour of gameplay.</p>
<p><b>Raider Withdrawal:</b> Some nations have designated Game Rounds called Raiding Turns which allow their forces to remain at sea, or return to the sea after making an attack on the land. These forces will return in later Game Rounds.</p>
<p><b>Overpopulation:</b> At the end of their turn if a nation other than the Romans has more armies than twice the number of areas held, the excess armies are removed due to overpopulation.</p>
<p>A nation is made up of several different playing pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Army:</b> These represent the fighting forces of the nation, as well as possessing some characteristics of population.</li>
<li><b>Leader:</b> These have no combat strength in themselves, but increase the combat strength of all forces they are with. Named leaders appear on various Game Rounds for specific nations throughout the game.</li>
<li><b>Fort:</b> These represent <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castra.html" title="Castra">Roman Forts</a>. The Romans build a fort in each area they conquer. These fight as normal armies and may not move. The Romans must protect their forts, as they can only score on Round V for areas that contain an undestroyed fort. If a fort is destroyed it is turned over onto its destroyed side, to show that the Romans failed to protect that area. Forts may not be rebuilt.</li>
<li><b>Burh:</b> These represent Saxons fortified settlements or <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burh.html" title="Burh">Burhs</a>. These may be built if the Saxons hold less than a set limit of areas on certain Rounds, and help the Saxons build up their strength for resisting the expansion of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danelaw.html" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a> late in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>The player whose nations have achieved the highest Victory Point total at the end of the game is the winner. Nations can score Victory Points on any Game Round, such as for eliminating certain opposing pieces or temporarily capturing certain areas, but will mostly score for holding different areas of Britain during the Scoring Rounds of Round V, VII, X, XIII and XVI. Also nations can score additional points by achieving <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bretwalda.html" title="Bretwalda">Bretwalda</a> or <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_England_5b1f.html" title="King of England">King of England</a>. Nations all have their own Victory Point objectives listed on their Nation cards, and each player colour will accumulate Victory Points at different rates through the game. This means that at any given moment who is actually winning will not be immediately obvious. Experienced players develop an idea of what typical scores are at different stages of a game and so will be able to tell what is really going on.</p>
<p>An ideal game ends with a close finish with several players still being able to win, and the outcome resting on one battle or roll of the dice.</p>

<p>This game was created by Lewis Pulsipher in 1983 under the working title of Invasions. It was first published by Gibsons Games as Britannia from 1986 in the United Kingdom in two slightly different versions after development by Roger Heyworth. A German-language version was released by Welt der Spiele and the game was later republished in the United States by <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a>. The game developed a devoted following across the world, and when in 2003, after a long break from board game work and having retained the publishing rights, Lewis Pulsipher announced he would be extensively revising the game, a great deal of player input contributed to the revision, which not only tidied up the rules, but also brought in a number of new features. Consequently the newest version is sometimes known as Britannia Second Edition, or Britannia II.</p>
