<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I found it absurd that Wikisource deleted your list--that information would have been a great contribution. Alas, there might be hope: have you tried the Wikimedia Commons page?</p>
<p>Their description:</p>
<p><i>The Wikimedia Commons is a project that provides a central repository for free images, music, sound &amp; video clips and, possibly, texts and spoken texts, used in pages of any Wikimedia project. Unlike images uploaded on other projects, images on Commons can be embedded on pages of all Wikimedia projects.</i></p>
<p>I'm sure it'll be deemed acceptable. Good luck. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhobophile_b160.html" title="User:Phobophile">Phobophile</a> 02:52, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed your bot has been moving FPC older than 14 days. Would it be possible to extend its operations on FPC? I understand that it wouldn't be able to determine if an image should become featured, but it could do the rest. What I was thinking was this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For old nominations, we can manually determine if it should be promoted, and place the phrase "PROMOTED FILENAME.JPG" or "NOT PROMOTED" on a new line in that subpage, and move the link to the subpage to the bottom of the current archive (link to that archive is determined by: [[Wikipedia:Featured pictures candidates/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}-{{CURRENTYEAR}}]]</li>
<li>Your bot could then determine if it was promoted or not, and do the following:
<ol>
<li>If FILENAME.JPG has {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} in its summary, remove that tag and replace with {{FeaturedPicture}}, else just add the {{FeaturedPicture}} tag. <b>Any other</b> images <b>displayed</b> on the subpage should have their {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} removed if present.</li>
<li>Add the following new line to <a href="../../../g/o/i/Wikipedia%7EGoings-on_f70f.html" title="Wikipedia:Goings-on">Wikipedia:Goings-on</a>, below the line which reads: <b>'''[[Wikipedia:Featured pictures|Pictures]] that gained "featured" status'''</b>
<dl>
<dd>*[[:Image:FILENAME.JPG|NAME_OF_SUBPAGE]] ({{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}})
<dl>
<dd>(where NAME_OF_SUBPAGE is the name of the subpage where the FPC took place, <b>without</b> the prefixed text: <b>Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Add the following new line to <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_pictures_thumbs_67d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured pictures thumbs">Wikipedia:Featured pictures thumbs</a>, below the first occurrence of <b>--&gt;</b> on the page:
<dl>
<dd>[[Image:FILENAME.JPG|100px|NAME_OF_SUBPAGE]]</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Determine the person who nominated the image by either grabbing their first sig on the subpage, or (probably better) grabbing the first edit of that subpage</li>
<li>Determine the person who uploaded the image (probably should use the most recent upload of the file; the one at the top).</li>
<li>Add the following new lines to the bottoms of these two individual's talk pages:
<dl>
<dd>==FPC==</dd>
<dd>{{PromotedFPC|FILENAME.JPG}}</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If the subpage says "NOT PROMOTED", remove the {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} from <b>any</b> of the images <b>displayed</b> on that subpage (people might on occasion link to an image, so be careful; [[:Image versus [[Image ).</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>One more thing... "Promoted" and "Not Promoted"... that seems kind of, well, troublesome to search for. I will need to make several clear assumptions to ensure against abuse and the like. The only assumptions I can make now are: the status of the picture will always be the last line, and before the status will be the three quotes indicating the status is bolded. Are those okay assumptions? What other assumptions can I make?

<dd>I read your addition: It may have some merit, but you'll probably have to work on it to make it seem like something other than a sophmore's poke at the establishment. It would help if you had some philosophical jargon, if there were a philosopher you could cite... It's not really an argument against God's existence, rather a meta-questioning calling the entire enterprise into question. It might grow out of an agnostic position rather than an atheist's. You have no reason to be "Sorry" since you seem to have done it in good faith... User Brian0918 seemingly has a rather strict, proprietary interest in the God article. 'e provides an important service if you go back and see the other reverts 'e's done... But 'e can seem a bit brusque, no? If you develope your addition a bit more, I suspect that it will fit in fine under philosophical considerations of God.

<dd>The inclusion of the battles in the Civil War category was confusing to me, as I know relatively little about US history. I looked for some indication that the tribes in question had some kind of alliance with the Confederates. If the US govt considers them to be part of the Civil War, it shouldn't matter to Wikipedia, since it's patently untrue. There is a case for making some battles "orphans" since some wars are one battle (e.g. <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Halhin_Gol_18c9.html" title="Battle of Halhin Gol">Battle of Halhin Gol</a>). The fact that the Union was involved is irrelevant; many countries throughout history have fought more than one enemy at a time, without it being considered a single conflict. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 09:57, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. Isn't it a bit redundant to have the spoken link on both the talk page <i>and</i> the article? I think that people reading the article itself would be more likely to want the spoken link, so IMO it should be there only. I didn't remove it from the talk page- I'll leave that up to you.</p>
<p>I've considered contributing to the spoken project...but my voice isn't particularily soothing (not that it's a cacophony either); plus, I have a blocked nose right now, so I bight talk a bittle unny. -<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrazzydee_a9f9.html" title="User:Frazzydee">Frazzydee</a>|<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrazzydee_457f.html" title="User talk:Frazzydee">✍</a> 02:02, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also think the link is better solely on the article page. For me, a useful rule of thumb is that things that primarily target the readers/users/audience of Wikipedia belong on the actual article, and things that are directed at editors belong on the Talk page. In this case, a link to a recording of the article targets the readership (er, "listnership"!), rather than editors, and would be better (IMO) just on the article page, and not on the Talk: page. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 02:13, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But the Spoken Wikipedia template links to the WikiProject, just as other talk pages have wikiproject templates at the tops of them. It's similar to the featured article template, which isn't specifically about editing the page, but has links to ways to contribute. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#000000">™</font></a> 02:17, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for your help in getting the Oppenheimer reading ready in time for its FA rollout. I tried downloading your cleaned-up copy and inserting the corrected readings in Audacity, but when I re-converted it to OGG it sounded like crap. The best thing might be for me to fix the errors in the original Audacity file and then do the conversion. Only I recall you said you'd made other corrections. If you could communicate those to me, I could repeat the fixes. Or, I could upload a high-quality Ogg file with just the two corrections if you have a way of inserting them without having to re-convert the whole file.</p>
<p>Also, I found the Noise Removal filter in Audacity. It seemed as if the second-to-the-lowest setting was sufficient. And the Normalize filter, which apparently works with the default settings. Any suggestions on post-production? Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:26, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You can try submitting the high quality ogg with the corrections, and I'll try putting them in.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I've seen that you block alot of people when doing RC-patrolling. Quite rightly so in most cases, but I have also noticed that your blockings sometimes are for minor stuff that I really don't think qualifies as vandalism. For instance your recent blocking of 203.94.130.77 seemed a little hars to me. All he did was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=12906947&amp;oldid=12906724" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adolf_Hitler&amp;diff=12906947&amp;oldid=12906724" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, and it's even an edit that could be defended by some, though I myself agree that it didn't belong there (I was the one reverting it). And thats his only edit in a month.</p>

<p>Hello Brian0918... Since you seem to have a particular interest in the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> article, and you have eliminated additions to it in the past based on the fact that they seemed to be "original research", I thought I should bring to your attention something that I find odd about the God article and get a second perspective before I do anything about it.</p>
<p>I notice that an odd word has been introduced into the article: "pandeism". This is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-logism.html" title="Neo-logism">neo-logism</a>; it does NOT appear in the dictionary; if you Google it, there are only 81 (actually 38) results, mostly in GNU free style wiki encyclopedias; if you follow the wikipedia link to find out what <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandeism.html" title="Pandeism">pandeism</a> is supposed to be you find an article that was originated and expanded by a user <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412">BD2412</a> who seems to have concocted this theological position on his own.</p>
<p>The Pandeism article seems to be articulate and has a scholarly sheen, but if you poke at it, there doesn't seem to be any real substance beyond the author's own thought. There are no real connections to historical philosophers, theologians, religions, etc. that would lend any credence to this article. There are no external links to other discussions of "pandeism"... And if you take time to track appearances of the word in other wikipedia articles, it all seems to have been done by the same people in the very recent past (i.e. since March 12, 2005.) The superficial nature of the concept and the article makes me think that it is NOT an appropriate addition to the wikipedia. The link to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandeism.html" title="Pandeism">pandeism</a> ought to be removed from the God article in my opinion.</p>
<p>What do you think? Have I missed something important in my analysis?</p>

<li>The Albuquerque Journal for Saturday, November 11, 1995, B-10 quotes a Vietnam vet-turned trappist monk who "describes his current spiritual position as "'pandeism' or 'pan-en-deism,' something very close to the Native American concept of the all- pervading Great Spirit..."

<li>Point is, the speaker used the term "pandeism" in the same context; and pandeism is no more of a neologism than <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panendeism.html" title="Panendeism">panendeism</a>, which you'll note has no more basis in the article than pandeism.

That was not a very well-written featured article. By contrast, I was able to read <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Ives_c73a.html" title="Charles Ives">Charles Ives</a> almost verbatim.

<dd>Because of my own poor wording, the matter of doing the Main Page text was left ambiguous. I assume you'll do it, as you know what you're doing. But if you prefer that I do, just tell me so and give the me the details.

<p>I apologize for having contributed the initial article without having done sufficient research to determine if it was in wide enough use to be a notable contribution. Had you asked me at the time of our initial contact, I would have immediately investigated to find out how common its use actually was. I would have concluded that it was, in fact, not notable, and would have immediately removed all the references and changed the article to a redirect to pandeism, with a note that people occasionally say pandeism when they mean pantheism. I apologize for having over-reacted in my posting of material on the vfd in an support of this not being original research, and I apologize for posting so many updates of the situation on user pages. I felt as though the vfd was initially framed as a personal attack against me, rather than addressing the content of the article, and I was excessively fervent in defending myself. I apologize for only posting notices that the page had been rewritten under votes to delete. That was impulsive and immature of me. I did not come to Wikipedia to make enemies, and I do not want to continue down this path. Can we please end this trading of derisions and accusations now. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412">8^D</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:BD2412" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:BD2412" rel="nofollow">BD2412</a><a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 16:01, 2005 Apr 30 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've been working a bit lately on <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welding.html" title="Welding">welding</a> and in my mission to bring to featured status, I'm interested in doing some diagram drawing of some of the different welding processes. Do you happen to know anything about that? From your work on <a href="../../../f/p/c/WP%7EFPC_af1f.html" title="WP:FPC">WP:FPC</a>, I know you're skilled with some photo editing software, but I wasn't sure if that's what would be the best to use for actually drawing stuff. What do you suggest? Or do you know of anyone who might know anything about this? --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer">∞</a> 02:53, May 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
