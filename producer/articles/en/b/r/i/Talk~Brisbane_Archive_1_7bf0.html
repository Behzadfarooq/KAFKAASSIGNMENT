<p>"legislation decreeing timber construction"&#160;? No, there's never been such legislation on the statute books, timber construction was simply the most cost effective. In the 19th century Brisbane was in the middle of a vast forest of timber - Rafting Ground Road in Brookfield was where logs were lashed together to float down Moggil Creek and down to Brisbane. Moggill Road and Waterworks Rds are their peculiar windy routes because they follow the old bullock dray routes that dragged the timber down out of the hills.<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddington62_5ed6.html" title="User:Paddington62">Paddington62</a> 02:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There was however legislation which effectively banned terrace housing by limiting the minimum size of allotments.<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddington62_5ed6.html" title="User:Paddington62">Paddington62</a> 02:34, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Change to the caption of the aerial shot of Brisbane - Figaro, I don't think it is relevant that the picture was taken from a Virgin Blue 737 - it could have been taken from a balloon, and it's still a pic of the inner area of Brisbane.

<p>I have to say that as a Brisbaneite, I find this article embarrassing. Twee in tone, pollyanna-ish (if such a word exists) -ever heard the song "[Everything's up to date in] Kansas City" from the musical <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma%21.html" title="Oklahoma!">Oklahoma!</a>? This article reads like the lyrics to that song. Nothing wrong in Brisbane&#160;?? What about the deteriorating traffic conditions? The Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (BTRE) says that within 10 years Brisbane will have the worst traffic in Australia. Dammit, Brisbane in the 1960's had the highest per capita usage of public transport in Australia. Now it's the worst. Reams could be written about the destruction of heritage buildings or the influence of the Brisbane town plan, (sorry car park plan) on the development of the city. But nope, nothing. Nothing about the influence of climate and topography on the unique Brisbane domestic architecture. I'm not sure where to start to rewrite it, frankly.Paddington62 13 March 2006.</p>

It's just something organised between local goverments as a feelgood exercise. I guess it allows mayors to travel overseas at taxpayers' expense.

<p>I've just reverted an addition listing a series of state rugby league teams based in and around Brisbane.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>== Land Marks ==</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Storey Bridge</b>. - A steel constructed bridge based on the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal, Canada. One of the most beautiful bridges once lit-up at night time and with a touch of fireworks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Central Plaza 1</b> - essentially Brisbane &amp; Queensland's tallest Office building with 48 stories and sits at 175m. With it's Unique looks, Central Plaza 1 is Brisbane trademark when viewing the skyline of the city.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Waterfront Place</b> - is Brisbane's second tallest building, it is a venue for many Saturday-to-Sunday markets, Restaurants, Nightclubs and coffee shops. The building sit's close to the Brisbane river, and holds commercial organisations within.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Riverside Centre</b> - Home to Brisbane's office of the Australian Stock Exchange, it sits close to the Brisbane River and like the Waterfront Place holds restaurants and markets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Aurora Tower</b> - Will be one of the tallest Residential buildings in the world, and will beat Riparian's title of Brisbane's tallest building, but it will not be Queensland's tallest because of the Gold Coast's Q1 building which is currently the tallest in the world and has just finished construction. The Aurora Tower is a 5 star Residential Hotel with Apartments and Penthouses rising into the thousands of dollars with millionaire views of Brisbane.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Riparian Plaza</b> - Will become Brisbane's tallest building. The skyscraper will be built in front of Central Plaza 1 and beside the Riverside Centre next to the river. It's built for both Residential and Commercial, 53 levels of pure comfort, and also Penthouses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>State Law Building</b> - Only 128m tall, the State Law Building remains one of Brisbane's most historic buildings. After it's refurbishment in 1995 where the top piece of the building was added, the building these days is known to many Brisbane locals as <b>Gotham City</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Brisbane City Hall</b> - From 1930 to the 1960's, the Brisbane City Hall was the tallest building in the city and the most expensive in Australia until the Sydney Opera House was built. The City hall can be seen from the sky's as a Gold Mark in the centre of the Brisbane city, it's unique design is why it's a natural attraction for tourists all over the world. It has four clock dials which sit 180 feet above the tower base, the City hall is currently Heritage listed. The City Hall is one reason why many call Brisbane City as "Bris-Vegas", because if you were to go down a couple of blocks you will find the golden palace of the <b>Treasury Casino</b>. Also, Brisbane is a construction zone for another skyscraper that is due to be developed in mid 2005, the <b>Casino Towers</b> will be built for all of Brisbane including a residential apartment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Suncorp Stadium</b> - Hugely recognised stadium which has just been redeveloped into one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world. A host for the Rugby 2003 World Cup, it also is the home of Rugby League powerhouse the Brisbane Broncos and the Queensland Lions.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>==Buildings Under Construction==</dd>
</dl>
<p>Brisbane is one of Australia's fastest growing cities in population, and also has plenty of area around the CBD to construct many buildings, may it be residential or commercial. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Riparian Plaza</b> - The Riparian Plaza will become the tallest skyscraper in Brisbane City on completion but will concede the title to the Aurora Tower. Riparian Plaza will be a staggering 200m tall with a 20m pinnacle point. The building will be used for commerce or residential use and for the money breakers it will have plenty of Penthouses for superb views and 5-star luxury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Aurora Tower</b> - Nearly completed, but once it is it will become a national importance concerning the Brisbane Skyline and it is also a trademark. The tallest building in Brisbane and one of the tallest Residential Hotels in the world along with the Gold Coast's Q1, it also boasts luxurious 5-star views and rooms at a very pricey rate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Festival Towers</b> - Structural height of approximately 135m with 42 floors will not make the residents of this apartment happy, it will be the looks. The Festival Towers due completion in late 2005, but it will be worth the wait seeing this as one of Brisbane's finest looking towers. <a href="http://www.festivaltowers.com.au/content/tower_large.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.festivaltowers.com.au/content/tower_large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.festivaltowers.com.au/content/tower_large.jpg</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Casino Towers</b> - These towers will sit at 129m tall and will contain Residential apartments. A grand total of 207 apartments with penthouses and large balconies. Casino Towers is the future and the benchmark when it is coming to world class apartments, a simply must see on completition.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">city of Ipswich was intended to be the capital of Queensland</span></h2>
<p>I was always taught that Redcliffe was the original choice. Redcliffe was the first city settled in Qld but Brisbane was chosen due to its accessibility for large ships (thanks to the Brisbane River).</p>

<p>No, it was definitely Ipswich that was to be the capital. Check any standard school history text. I don't know where margatebiz got its info from, but it's plain wrong. However Redcliffe was the location of the first convict settlement, before it was moved to Brisbane. In the 1860's The hamlet of Cleveland pushed to be considered the port, but the mud flats were too broad and would have required extensive dredging. Paddington62 3 March 2006</p>
<p>I have heard stories about Ipswich &amp; stories about Redcliffe. One of us needs to find out for certain which one or if they were <i>both</i> concidered. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAussieDingo1983_466f.html" title="User:AussieDingo1983">AussieDingo1983</a> 07:24, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The music bands you mention already have their own article page called <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_music_groups.html" title="Brisbane music groups">Brisbane music groups</a>, to which there is a link, from the Brisbane article, under the heading "<i>Brisbane culture, arts and sport</i>". <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 11:05, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The main issue I have with the Brisbane article are all these other pages with lists. We need to have actual content, or at least some, on the page before we link off. The section you mention has three links. We should at least list our sporting teams, their stadiums, and the games they play. Put those bands on the actual page. I've put the page up for peer review and I'm betting thats the first thing they mention. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Pinnell_22cc.html" title="User:James Pinnell">James Pinnell</a> 11:41, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why don't you add information to the page for Brisbane bands on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_music_groups.html" title="Brisbane music groups">Brisbane music groups</a> page. There is nothing stopping you from doing that, and developing the pages that you are interested in into something spectacular. In fact, it would be appreciated if you did so. The article page for Brisbane is already far too long, and Wikipedia has pointed out on more than one occasion about the length of the article, with requests that the length of the article be reduced in size. Also, why do you think that Brisbane bands and sports teams are of greater significance than other notable Brisbanites? Other notanle Brisbanites, who are also internationally known and acclaimed, and who are at least as important as Brisbane bands and Brisbane sporting teams, are also on their own separate pages, away from the main Brisbane article. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 22:18, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Due to the comments, by yourself and others, about the music and sports sections being put onto their own individual article pages, all information, in those article pages, has now been returned to the main Brisbane article. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 03.50, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The physical impressiveness of a building is not the only criterion by which buildings should be judged. The images which you removed are of buildings which are actually important parts of the heritage of Brisbane, from colonial times, so your judgement above about the buildings was overly hasty. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 00:50, 19 August, 2005 (AEST)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are already seven images on this page, plenty for this article. The physical impressiveness of the buildings was not the only criterion by which the buildings were judged - in fact I wasn't judging the buildings at all, rather the images themselves and their impact on the page and article. A balance between readability and illustration needs to be maintained. If we can find a relevant part of the article for the images to illustrate then they should go there, not at the top where a casual reader will expect to see an illustration of the city rather than a <b>relatively</b> unimportant building in the city. Please understand that I'm not saying the images shouldn't go on the page - but if they return they should be illustrating a relevant passage of text and not interfere with the layout of the article. Personally, I'd really like to see images of the Queen Street Mall (the busiest and most populous area of the city) and the old convict-built windmill on the page somewhere too</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pronounciation of Brisbane and IPA symbols</span></h2>
<p>Not every browser is able to cope with IPA symbols. If IPA symbols are the only means whereby the pronunciation of the name of Brisbane is given, then those people with browsers incapable of reading IPA symbols will be left in ignorance of the proper pronunciation. It is for this reason that it is important to have alternative means for these people to know the correct pronunciation. This is the reason for the inclusion of briz'b<i>u</i>n as the pronunciation of the name. Those with browsers capable of reading IPA symbols can use those symbols. Those with browsers incapable of reading IPA symbols can use the alternative that has been supplied. The reason why I am aware that some browsers do not recognise IPA symbols is because my own browser does not recognise the IPA symbols.<br />

<dd>There's something wrong with their display at present, that's true. Formerly, I was able to see them, and now I can't. But we simply can't have ad-hoc, jerry-rigged pronunciation guides throughout the encyclopedia, particularly when we're not intended only for native English speakers. I'm afraid the other pronunciation guide isn't necessarily very informative.</dd>

<p><b>- Suburbs</b></p>
<p>Information on the various areas and neighborhoods of Brisbane. Details on socio-economic problems and improvements. Nothing indepth, but at least some basic information on areas outside of the CBD. At the moment it looks like any old tiny city you'd find, we need to flesh out the areas.</p>
<p><b>- Transport section needs a complete overhaul.</b></p>
<p>The transport section is poor. We need to separate and breakdown each area of transport (Roads including freeways, bypasses and motorways), Taxis, Buses, Trains, Ferries and Airports. I've quickly amended the airport information for the time being - It's not "Brisbane International Airport" - its simply "Brisbane Airport", separated into two facilities for both International and Domestic flights as noted on the <a href="http://www.bne.com.au/content/standard_lp.asp?name=TerminalGuideIntroduction" class="external text" title="http://www.bne.com.au/content/standard_lp.asp?name=TerminalGuideIntroduction" rel="nofollow">BAC Website</a>. I didn't mention the new Shopping Mall there or the $280 million upgrade in progress just yet, I figured I'd wait for responses to this first.</p>
<p><b>- Section on Nightlife under Tourism</b></p>
<p>Details about the Valley and City clubbing, including information on the lockout and anti-smoking laws. Also, as an addition, mentioning Brisbane as a gateway between the coasts.</p>

<dd>I just revised the section on popular entertainment, to remove most of what seemed like something straight out of a tour guide. I'm also arguing once again for the removal of the list of Brisbane bands/musicians. The most significant ones can be mentioned briefly in the text, but if there's that many, they deserve an article of their own, possibly incorporating material related to Andrew Stafford's <i>Pig City: From The Saints To Savage Garden</i>. --Dalziel 86 03:20, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read an article in the Brisbane News about our film cameos - Did you know that "The Matrix" was suppost to be filmed here but the brothers decided it was too clean even though they loved it?</p>
<p>Feel free to cross check me or add anything I've missed. We missed out on a featured page because its simply too thin - definately improved over the year but still not up to the world class pages of other major cities.</p>

<dd>I agree with most of the things mentioned here. I think this article is starting to deteriorate. If you extrapolate a bit, the article will end up being nothing but a list of Wiki links to other articles about Brisbane, with the main article giving nothing substantial about Brisbane but being clogged with photos of varying quality. I would like to say though, that I appreciate some people's efforts -- I wish I had the time and inclination to put the same effort in. Some things I think should be added:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><b>Brisbane "lifestyle".</b> Nothing is mentioned about Brisbane's relaxed, subtropical atmosphere -- I know such things are subjective, but they ought to be mentioned. It's what makes Brisbane special!</li>
<li><b>Return some info put away into other articles.</b> e.g. Brisbane sport, Brisbane art and culture, etc. To see the major sports teams in Brisbane, you need to go to a separate article.</li>

Not good.

<dd>I agree with all these comments after my own - this page needs a drastic rewrite. There's already a WikiProject listed for Brisbane under the Australia section but its not being used.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Brisbane Population</span></h2>
<p>Brisbane's official metro population is approximately 1.77 million according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The 2.47 million figure includes the Gold Coast which is not in the metro, so I'm not sure why this figure is being used.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that - the greater metropolitan area doesn't include a separate city an hour away. I think the population should be changed to 1.8. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Pinnell_22cc.html" title="User:James Pinnell">James Pinnell</a> 02:40, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is the second time that the population has been listed as 2.4 million. The addition of the term 'urban agglomeration' does not change the fact that this is incorrect, since strictly Brisbane isn't the name of one. Brisbane is, however, part of the agglomeration of South-East Queensland which has a population of about 2.7 million. SEQ is the only name it goes by - to represent the entire region as 'Brisbane' a mistruth. The ABS is the most reliable source for population information is Australia, thus it is the source that should be used here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't like the way this is explained. Anyone reading the articles for other capital cities would look at this and think Sydney's population is 4 times the size of Brisbane. That simply isn't correct. Sydney's 4.3Million figure includes an entire conglomeration of cities too, yet in the Sydney article the term 'metropolitain area' is used to describe the area occupied by these 4.3 million people. The truth is, only 147K people actually vote for the lord mayor of Sydney. 950K ppl vote for the Lord Mayor of Brisane. If people are going to compare like with like we need consistent wording.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is true that there is a significant difference between Brisbane and all the other capital cities, in that much more of the metro population consists of people with in actual Brisbane. However, the people that define population (the ABS) make the rule and they say that Brisbane has 1.77 people. It is likely that in the future the Gold Coast will be included in this figure, but that is not yet the case. <a href="../../../%24/e/t/User%7E%24eti.html" title="User:$eti">$eti</a> 3:33, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The Brisbane City Council area has approximately 957,010 inhabitants, within a greater urban agglomeration population of 1.77 million people"</p>
<p>The way I understand it, is that ¨Brisbane¨, for the purposes of population, is the same as ¨Greater Brisbane¨ which includes Caboolture, Pine Rivers, Redcliffe, Redlands, Logan, and possibly one or two more, but not Gold Coast, Caloundra, Maroochy, or Noosa. I don´t think any capital cities only count the central City Council. To my understanding people from places like Pine Rivers (Shire Council) consider themselves Brisbanites, though I could be wrong. I doubt many Gold Coast residents consider themselves Brisbanites (unless they come from here). But the whole thing is somewhat controversial anyway and we´ll probably never get a clear agreeable definition, esp. with more and more places growing into one another. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAussieDingo1983_466f.html" title="User:AussieDingo1983">AussieDingo1983</a> 07:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

They are not clear, have no interest in terms of composition, and do not give any overview of the park. (I know there are several places in the park which afford panoramic views.) Removed once, they have been replaced by Figaro, who considered their removal vandalism. Should such low quality illustrations, in such numbers, stay there?</p>

Unless you have been donating photos to Wikipedia under another user name (i.e. as a 'sockpuppet'), then I cannot see what other photos, or articles, you are talking about. I also notice that you have not dated your comment above, which you wrote on 3 December - after you had donated the photo and added it to the article. Anyway, your CityCat photo is still in use - where it now resides in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Transport_1a4c.html" title="Brisbane Transport">Brisbane Transport</a> article, where it was moved to, which you would have discovered had you chosen to check the information given on the page on file links for the image that you supplied.</dd>

<dd>I think it is important to keep in mind that for people with dial-up connections, pictures take time to download, and so pictures shouldn't be included unless they are on reasonable quality, and unless they are relevant to the article, and demonstrate something about the subject matter. It isn't helpful just to upload pictures simply because you can, especially if they don't portray something relevant and not of reasonable quality. I can't actually see any pictures online at the moment (I don't know whether it is my computer being funny, or something wrong with the internet) so I can't comment on the specific pictures being discussed, but thought that this general guiding principle was worth putting forward. Also, criticising others for not contributing photos isn't helpful. Just because somebody may not have a digital camera or other hardware, may live somewhere far away or isn't able to contribute photos for whatever other reason doesn't preclude them from being able to make valid comments on the value of photographic contributions by others. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_3456.html" title="User talk:Adz">talk</a> 03:02, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is what they mean, although it was a perfectly legitimate question to ask (it could have referred to area or some other measure - although there are definitely other municipalities which are larger). They mean that the Brisbane City Council has more residents than any other local government area in the country. They probably also mean that it has a larger budget than any other Local Government in the country.

<dd>Excellent! That's the sort of information that should go into the article. I only wrote it based on what I had heard an my limited knoledge. (note I said that I'd cobbled it together and that it could do with soem work), My main point was simply to suggest that it should be in prose. As it is at the moment, it is just a bunch of lists and doesn't present very much information at all. It would be good to get some consensus on the format it should take and whether to split the bulk of it off into a separate article. ... I think that the various education sections should be merged as well and converted into prose. It might be worth having a look at how some other city articles deal with Educattion/Culture/Sport sections, such as <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan_cad1.html" title="Ann Arbor, Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 07:00, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with Adz. I noticed the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a> is in a similar situation; although there are good editors committed to working on the article, its structure is poorly formulated. The main hindrance in this article (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>) is the number of lists and the excess of headings. If the intent of all the work going into this article is to at some point have it <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured</a>, it would be advisable to follow the example set by existing featured articles on cities. <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Arbor%2C_Michigan_cad1.html" title="Ann Arbor, Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> are all good templates for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, with the latter two providing a good compromise on headings. The following is a structure I think could be easily implemented here:
<ul>
<li>History</li>
<li>Geography
<ul>
<li>Climate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governance (or alternatively Government/Politics/Government and Politics)</li>
<li>Economy</li>
<li>People (covering education and demographics)</li>
<li>Culture (with other sub-headings as necessary)

<p>Pursuant to my above comment, I have restructured the article and transfered many of the lists to separate articles (all remain linked). Much work remains to be done, particularly with regards to rewritting the culture section and trimming the infrastructure section considerably. The article is now of a more acceptable size too - it was previously touching on 60kb.

<dd>The reason why I said that I reverted the article and would take on those changes suggested which were appropriate, is because I am from Brisbane and I know Brisbane as a result of this. I am not asserting what you have referred to as "ownership" (your "ownership" insinuation is, in fact, insulting). Brisbane people know Brisbane better than non-Brisbanites. I would not presume to assume a greater authority in editing a page about a city or state in which I did not live than the residents of that city.</dd>

I refuted the mistakes in Adz's comments on 11 December, last year, long before Cyberjunkie used the incorrect comments on the page, so Cyberjunkie should have been aware that what he was writing was wrong. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 15:37, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Resolving Climate Figures - Rain Days</span></h2>
<p>I've lived in sub-tropical regions for most of my life but have resided in a temperate region for the past 5 years. A rain day in Brisbane usually means a 30 minute storm at almost exactly 5:00pm before which the sky was perfectly blue and after which the sky is perfect blue again. A rain day in Melbourne or London means just that, it rains or at least is overcast for the entire day. I'm not suggesting we do anything to the BOM figures in the article but I do believe some kind of explanation is warranted. Any ideas? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 02:55, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A rain day in Brisbane sometimes means a 30 minute storm, only, as you say, but this is not always the case. Often it rains for days non-stop (or with only brief intervals of dry weather). <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 04:17, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I realise that but typically it is a 30 min storm. At least it is during the storm season. I lived in Brisbane for 25 years. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 04:22, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK I get your point and when dealing with weather issues it can be very dangerous to go down the path of using anecdotal evidence to make a point. However, I'm sure you'll agree that a typical rain day recorded in Brisbane does not equate to a typical rain day recorded in London. The problem is that when we talk about weather, what sticks out in everyone's minds are the extreme conditions. I'm not really sure how to address this if at all.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confusing Metropolitan area and City</span></h2>
<p>I know Brisbane city itself is a particularly large municipality but satelite cities are still taken into accoutn when referring to the greater metropolitan area.</p>
<p>A casual reader looking at this article and attempting to compare it to the Sydney and Melbourne articles is going to be very confused.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge the 1363 km² figure for the cities area applies only to the municpality of Brisbane. So firstly, this figure should be replaced by the figure for the metropolitan area.</p>
<p>I take it the claim that Brisbane's surface area is the largest of all capitals is a comparison of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Council_05a1.html" title="Brisbane City Council">Brisbane City Council</a> to <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Sydney_2614.html" title="City of Sydney">City of Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Melbourne_5be3.html" title="City of Melbourne">City of Melbourne</a> (and others)?</p>
<p>Suggested Changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything relating to the Brisbane Municipality needs to go into an article called <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Brisbane_caa9.html" title="City of Brisbane">City of Brisbane</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Council_05a1.html" title="Brisbane City Council">Brisbane City Council</a> article should be an article about the Brisbane city council as oposed to the city of brisbane.</li>
<li>The Brisbane article should be an article about the Brisbane Metropolitan area and thus it should NOT contain any information about:
<ul>
<li>Sister Cities</li>
<li>Coats of Arms</li>
<li>Flags of Brisbane City</li>
<li>Statistics relevant only to the Brisbane municipality</li>
<li>Information about the Lord Mayor (metropolitan areas don't have lord mayors)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And furthermore, it should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Statistics relevant to the wider Brisbane Metroplitan area</li>
<li>General information about the city as a whole</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes will bring Brisbane in line with all of the other Australian capital city articles. It will also ease cunfusion in claims such as the one we're making about the surface area of the city. We claim it's the largest at 1363. The casual observer then goes to Sydney to see a claim of 12 145 km².</p>
<p>Lets vote on it shall we? <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> 10:56, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you make this article about the areas government by Brisbane City Council this article will be significatly different from all the other Australian capital cities whos articles discuss the statistical district. It will make the capital city articles inconsistent for Australia, which in my opinion makes this a bad suggestion.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 07:29, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right.... except for the part implying that that's what I suggested. What I said is that this article should be about that greater metropolitan area and NOT about the city council. And that there should be another article called City of Brisbane that deals with the municipality of Brisbane. At the moment this article is trying to do both. The Sydney and Melbourne articles don't do that.

But hey, to err and all, and the corresponding article (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Council_05a1.html" title="Brisbane City Council">Brisbane City Council</a>) also has inconsistent figures. <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a> When are we having that vote? <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESendai2ci_db9e.html" title="User:Sendai2ci">sendai</a> 02:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Largest Municipality (again)</span></h2>
<p>I've removed the claim that Brisbane is the second largest municipality by area. The local Gov't Association <a href="http://www.alga.asn.au/about/" class="external text" title="http://www.alga.asn.au/about/" rel="nofollow">website</a> says that East Pilbara Shire is the largest by area. If Mt Isa is also bigger than Brisbane (see discussion above), then Brisbane isn't teh second biggest. I would be very surprised if there weren't a number of municipalities - particularly rural ones - bigger than Brisbane. -- 202.161.21.191 04:44, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is it possible to say that the City of Brisbane (ie. the area administered by BCC) is Australia's largest <b>metropolitan</b> municipality in terms of area? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrightLights_99ee.html" title="User:BrightLights">BrightLights</a> 06:26, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a section within the media/radio bit about infrastructure and telecommunications. To me it fills out the section a bit more and shows that Brisbane is as technologically advanced/up-to-date as any world city out there. --58.104.223.30 13:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
