<p>Are there any references to back this article up? Who can the arguments be attributed to? If there is no attribution it looks like original work or a POV. I had a brief look on the web for "British Football League" and found nothing useful. Is the name commonly used or is it just <i>a</i> British football league that the article is about? Also, I wouldn't say Australia and New Zealand have a 'joint league system', it's more a case of New Zealand having a franchise in the top Australian league. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdEdition_9f3c.html" title="User:ThirdEdition">ThirdEdition</a> 05:52, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to say this looks to me 100% like original research. I have never heard of any serious proposals to merge the Scottish and Welsh leagues into the English league. Everything in this article seems like pure speculation and the thoughts of the original writer..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of the proposals mentioned (pan-UK league, pan-British Isles league, merged League Cups, end-of-season mini-competition, etc) have been proposed in all seriousness, hence the sources cited. That it is proposed justifies an article, even if it doesn't explain the list of arguments.</dd>
<dd>On the arguments, I also disagree. The debate is fully in the public arena (particularly in Scotland) and the pros and cons are all well-rehearsed. If the only problem is the lack of sources for the individual arguments for or against, that can easily be remedied. An unsuitable 'remedy' is to delete an article because one doesn't like a few lines of it. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 17:27, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The first three references look at merged League Cups and the like, and the fourth doesn't seem to make any reference to any Anglo-Scottish-Welsh-Irish competition at all. I say at best a proposed British league is worth one sentence on the Premiership/SPL/LoW pages. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 17:36, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't check to see which references I used; now that I have, I agree that they don't refer directly to a British league. Nonetheless, only someone living under a rock could claim that there have been no proposals for a British league, hence it is ridiculous to claim that it is OR. One minute on Google gave me these two results: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1385062.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1385062.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1385062.stm</a> <a href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=307202004" class="external free" title="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=307202004" rel="nofollow">http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=307202004</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 17:46, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think there has ever been a serious proposal to merge the home nations' leagues - the only proposals have come from the Old Firm pairing wanting a bigger slice of the cake and putting pressure on the other Scottish clubs before any tv deal negotiations. One of the two links you provide are exactly that and the other is a chairman spouting for a British Cup. Hardly conclusive proof there. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlogdroed_4bce.html" title="User:Blogdroed">Blogdroed</a> 21:39, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to remove the bit about the Football League originally intended to be U.K.-wide. In "The Story of the Football League" from 1938, there is a passage from a letter sent from William McGregor of 2nd March 1888 to the prominent clubs of the day, where the proposal includes the quote "ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home and away fixtures each season". If anyone comes up with any evidence that the league was originally intended to be U.K.-wide, please speak up. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 08:47, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"<i>A single football league for the whole of the British Isles, including the Republic of Ireland, has also been proposed; for example, in the 1990s, Wimbledon F.C. almost moved to Dublin, whilst remaining in the Football League.</i>" - this action wouldn't have created a <i>single league for the whole of the British Isles</i>, it would have just meant there was one team in the English league who happened to be based in Ireland. I suspect the Scottish, Northern Irish and Irish leagues would have continued quite happily and unaffected by this move, if it had happened.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 13:07, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
