<p>Ireland was Britain's first colony and, thus, Northern Ireland is the oldest British Colony. The consitutional relationship of Northern Ireland with Great Britain is different than, for example, the constitutional relationship between Scotland and Britain. Although Britain claims that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, Britain does not claim that Northern Ireland is part of Britain. Any discussion of British Colonies should include Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Ireland was never a colony of Great Britain. Northern Ireland is British and part of the United Kingdom. Colonies are not integrated parts of sovereign states.<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYourPTR%21_3d33.html" title="User:YourPTR!">YourPTR!</a> 15:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Does anyone known if crown colonies are different than royal colonies? This is in reference to British holdings in North American in the 17th and 18th centuries. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJengod_485b.html" title="User:Jengod">jengod</a> 22:41, Feb 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've never heard the expression royal colonies. As I understand it, Crown colonies was the general name given to all colonies administered by the British government, such as the original six divisions of Australia, the various territories in the Caribbean, the original sub-divisions of South Africa, Singapore and elsewhere. Those who had not achieved independence were eventually redesignated 'dependent territories' under the Commonwealth. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgendum_46fd.html" title="User:Agendum">Agendum</a> 00:26, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's some kind of difference between a Crown Colony and a plain old Colony. The distinction comes up in the history of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>. The Colony of Vancouver's Island was established in 1849, the Crown Colony of British Columbia was established on the mainland in 1858. The two were amalgamated in 1866 and shared the Crown Colony title until 1871, when the colony joined Canada. There's a legal difference of some kind; what the Governor's powers are, perhaps (both Colonies had very unorthodox political cultures because of the dual role of Hudson's Bay Company boss held by the Governor, and because of the Governor's peculiar way of getting things done, esp. on the mainland). <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 21:19, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A Colony is defined by the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Laws_Validity_Act_e2cf.html" title="Colonial Laws Validity Act">Colonial Laws Validity Act</a> - '1. The Term "Colony" shall in this Act include all of Her Majesty 's Possessions abroad in which there shall exist a Legislature as hereinafter defined except the Channel Islands the Isle of Man and such Territories as may for the Time being be vested in Her Majesty under or by virtue of any Act of Parliament for the Government of India.' The Crown Colonies were colonies which did not possess legislatures and were ruled directly by the Crown through the Governor, although sometimes there was an appointed legislative council. Yet another reason why we need a historical article on colonies that does not redirect to British overseas territories. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgri_a5f5.html" title="User:Algri">Alan</a> 04:00, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Strictly speaking, that definition is only valid for that Act, which was designed to regulate colonial legislation, so had to apply to colonies with legislatures. The Interpretation Act 1978, provides: "<i>"Colony" means any part of Her Majesty's dominions outside the British Islands except-- (a) countries having fully responsible status within the Commonwealth; (b) territories for whose external relations a country other than the United Kingdom is responsible; (c) associated states; and where parts of such dominions are under both a central and a local legislature, all parts under the central legislature are deemed for the purposes of this definition to be one colony</i>". The 1889 Interpretation Act read: "<i>The expression "colony" shall mean any part of Her Majesty's dominions exclusive of the British Islands, and of British India, and where parts of such dominions are under both a central and a local legislature, all parts under the central legislature shall, for the purposes of this definition, be deemed to be one colony.</i>"</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are only three instances of the use of the expression Crown colony in UK legislation, only one of which is an Act of Parliament. The Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885 defines Colonies as "<i>The colonies (including their respective dependencies) of Fiji, New Zealand, New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, and the province of South Australia, and any other colonies that may hereafter be created in Australasia, or those of the said colonies in respect to which this Act is in operation</i>" and Crown colony as "<i>Any colony in which the control of public officers is retained by Her Majesty's Imperial Government</i>". So that supports the idea that a distinction existed at that time, making Crown colonies a subset of Colonies. However, the two statutory instruments that use the expression Crown colony seem to use it as if it meant the same as colony. My opinion is that the expression Crown colony was not a precisely-defined term, e.g. one might say that in 1867 the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straits_Settlements_71ef.html" title="Straits Settlements">Straits Settlements</a> became a Crown colony as opposed to a 'colony' under the government of British India or (previously) of the East India Company. But if there is confusion on the subject, we may need to have separate pages. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 13:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree that Crown Colony was never a very precise definition and we do require separate pages. I have found no example of any of the Australasian colonies being described as Crown colonies in Australian, British or New Zealand legislation. The Colonial Laws Validity Act carries a lot of weight because it was an attenpt to regulate the confict of laws for the empire as a whole. <a href="../../../a/l/g/User%7EAlgri_a5f5.html" title="User:Algri">Alan</a> 17:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A consistent user interface within the topic, as I said in the summary. I thought that was the whole point behind them; otherwise we might as well replace them with categories. If you are researching British overseas territories, a consistent menu makes navigating easier. Also, I don't think aesthetics is a poor reason for keeping something at all. I'll turn the question around and ask how the template is detrimental to the page? (And, again, please don't flag disputed removals as minor). <a href="../../../r/l/s/User%7ERls_ca3b.html" title="User:Rls">Rls</a> 20:59, 2004 Sep 15 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The consistent user interface here only applies to the article components within the template. This means the template belongs at the individual crown colony articles. This article is on crown colonies <i>in general</i> and is not on <i>a</i> crown colony so it is in different class than, say, the article on <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory_444f.html" title="British Indian Ocean Territory">British Indian Ocean Territory</a>.</p>
<p>The template is detrimental to the page because it is out of place and useless. It accomplishes nothing so it is a waste of space. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 00:45, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The consistent user interface here only applies to the article components within the template</i></dd>
<dd>Er, no. The general page is linked to by the template as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The general article is clearly part of the topic. I find this structure useful for browsing purposes; clearly others do as well since there are several other pages in Wikipedia with this format: e.g. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communities%2C_regions_and_provinces_of_Belgium_7da7.html" title="Communities, regions and provinces of Belgium">Communities, regions and provinces of Belgium</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_and_territories_of_Australia_07c2.html" title="States and territories of Australia">States and territories of Australia</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I propose replacing the template on the grounds of precedence and that at the very worst it is only a block at the bottom of the page that does not even need to be scrolled past if it is of no use to anyone. <a href="../../../r/l/s/User%7ERls_ca3b.html" title="User:Rls">Rls</a> 23:18, 2004 Sep 16 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just because Belgium and Australia has it doesn't mean they're in the right. There is no such precendence. I would guess that most countries do not have such templates at the bottom of their articles. For example, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_divisions_of_China_4fe2.html" title="Political divisions of China">political divisions of China</a> has no template.</p>
<p>Although the general page is linked to by the template, the information contained within the template is already included in the article text. If you want to browse, you look at the list and browse from there. The template is only necessary elsewhere because it makes little sense to add a "list of crown colonies" at the bottom of each crown colony. Again, I don't see how this is in the same class as the individual crown colonies. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jia</a><a href="../../../j/i/a/User_talk%7EJiang_4fe5.html" title="User talk:Jiang"><b>ng</b></a> 23:27, 16 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is still a precedent, even if there are conflicting examples. It shows that there is some disagreement on this issue, regardless of your assertions.</li>
<li>It is rather arrogant telling me how I should browse. I personally find it useful and others apparently do too.</li>
<li>The template is not necessary, but I am of the opinion it is helpful.</li>
<li>They are in the same <b>topic</b>, which I believe is the collection of what most readers of Wikipedia are interested in viewing in one session, not the same "class".</li>
<li>It is clear that we are not going to achieve consensus on this issue since you are simply restating your arguments. Will you concede that having the template on the page is not a problem or shall we seek comments from other users? <a href="../../../r/l/s/User%7ERls_ca3b.html" title="User:Rls">Rls</a> 01:23, 2004 Sep 17 (UTC)</li>

<p>As per my comment in the section above (should I move it down here?) there appears at least in the history of my remote corner of the Empire to have been some kind of legal distinction between the status of a Colony and the status of a Crown Colony. The distinction here is that the Mainland Colony, as it's also known, was constituted as a Crown Colony, while "Vancouver's Island" was a Colony (er, um, maybe it was the other way around). The difference may have to do with the elected Executive Council on the Island and the appointed one that launched the Mainland, where Governor Douglas ruled autocratically. Part of the reason for this was the relative lack of British subjects on the Mainland at the time he declared the Colony - unilaterally, and also taking a step outside protocol by contacting Admiral Baynes at the British base in Callao, Peru, to give him a hand (Baynes declined, but eventually was sent there with orders from England in hand).</p>
<p>So Douglas had to appoint who was at hand, and there was no way to call an election, as he had been forced to do on Vancouver Island. That <i>may</i> have been part of the reason for the status and hence the title of Crown Colony, i.e. that it had been constituted by edict rather than by appointment, and the need to avoid responsible government, as such as it was in colonial councils, from functioning and getting in the way of consolidating the British grip on the until-then unincorporated but British-claimed territory, which until then had no legal land-law status within the Empire (the HBC had only a trading license, not title as they had had in the actual watershed of Hudson Bay). Ath the time of incorporation the Mainland was on the lip of American annexation and "something had to be done"; the constitutional difference between the two colonies might be at least partly a result of that.</p>
<p>So anyway, point is there's some kind of constitutional or legal difference between the two; when I find out more (it's in an old correspondence somewhere, from a friend who's a constitutional law expert/professor from years ago) I'll come back and put it here (discussion page; you tell me if it should go on the main page . . . ). But for now, that's my two bits.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 09:14, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cayman not a stage 2</span></h2>
<p>I am a citizen of Cayman and would just like to make a few comments about the information on this page. Our Executive Council (which was renamed the Cabinet in 2003) is elected from the Legislative Assembly, not appointed by the Governor. Elections are held every 4 years, although they can be postponed by the Governor (as can the prime minister of most parliamentary systems.) Also, I would say the term self-governing colony does apply to Cayman. The Governor hardly ever makes news, except when he is receiving a foreign dignitary, or little notices in the paper saying "H.E. The Hon. Gov. Bruce Dinwiddy, CMG will be away until the 23rd of November at a conference for colonial governors in Trinidad. The Hon. Chief Secretary James Ryan will preside as Acting Governor until His Excellency's return," for example." Another example is the recent spat over the EU Tax Savings Directive, to which the Government assembled a team that went to argue the Island's case at the EU Court of First Instance, with no direct involvement by the Governor. Yet another example would be the recent Euro Bank scandal, in which widespread public opinion in Cayman was to throw out our Attorney General, who is an appointee of the Governor. The Governor stood by him, but the Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a vote of no confidence in him, and he resigned soon after. Just a few examples of how Cayman does not directly fit the Stage 2 category. Also - I should note that there is currently a Constitutional Reform Committee which takes many of these events into account, and that there will be a general election in May in which one of the parties' major platform issues is further self-governance. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETravisritch_ea5d.html" title="User:Travisritch">Travisritch</a> 04:23, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, good luck to you, Cayman Islanders, but your reference to "a conference for colonial governors in Trinidad" is bizarre and anachronistic. The Governors of Overseas Territories don't attend conferences in London, much less in independent Commonwealth countries, although they are summoned for meetings with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There is an Overseas Territories Consultative Council, which Chief Ministers, the Premier of Bermuda, and whatever the equivalent is in the Cayman Islands.</dd>

<p>This article looks like it'd be a good a place to discuss the steps and when each of the territory was renamed from "colony"/"crown colonies" progressively to "overseas territory". I could only find out that the UK parliament voted in 1997 to rename all "dependent territories/overseas dependencies" as "overseas territories".

</dl>
<p>This seems like odd wording. If it was rejected in Gibraltar in 1976 it must have been seriously considered there also. The article says that in the case of Malta integration was considered by the British government, as if Gibraltar considered it themselves but the British government would not have obliged had they asked for integration.

So, was integration ever on the cards for Gib or was it really only Malta? Either way, this ought to be clarified. (It's also interesting to note that while Malta went in a different direction and became independent less than 10 years later, Gibraltar is these days probably the most integrated of all British overseas territories, even participating in elections to the European Parliament as part of the South West England regional constituency. Were it not for Spanish objections, it would be quite conceivable that Gib could be given representation a Westminster constituency (although a relatively small one) and retain its House of Assembly as a kind of devolved Parliament, as in Scotland.) — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 19:13, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Gibraltar could be more securely attached to the UK in the way you suggest, like <a href="../../../c/e/u/Ceuta.html" title="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melilla.html" title="Melilla">Melilla</a> (claimed by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>) are with Spain, but it is unlikely.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gibraltarians - UK nationals for EU purposes</span></h2>
<p>I have removed the comment "Gibraltarians are considered UK nationals for EU purposes".</p>
<p>It's a true statement - British overseas territories citizens (BOTCs) connected with Gibraltar are UK nationals for EU purposes, the only BOTCs to have that status on the basis of being BOTC.</p>
<p>However, since 21 May 2002, people in all other British territories bar the Sovereign Base Areas have full British citizenship which they hold alongside BOTC. So because of their British citizenship (and not because of BOTC), persons from Bermuda, St Helena, Cayman Islands etc are also UK nationals for EU purposes.</p>
<p>However the Overseas Territories other than Gibraltar are not part of the EU and do not vote in 'European elections'. <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 05:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The term "Overseas territory" has only been used since 2002 ... The term does not apply ... to the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus which are governed by the British military."</p>
<p>According to Schedule 6 of the British Nationality Act 1981, the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia are a British overseas territory on the same basis as any other.</p>
<p>The fact that British overseas territories citizens solely connected with the SBAs are not entitled to British citizenship is irrelevant.</p>

<li>Crown Colony in the historical context was usually when Britain dissolved almost all sovereignty in a territory. This was usually on the grounds that territories with a sovereign House of Assembly were difficult to manage from abroad. This happened in many countries, but one that comes to mind is <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominica.html" title="Dominica">Dominica</a> in 1896. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 22:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The British overseas territories are a new status invented in the last years of the last century. It's fairly hard to discuss the history fo thsoe places when you redirect to a novel class of British territory, all of them tiny.

<dd>Although Britain itself has seen immigration from these areas (over a far longer time frame), the nature, timing, and size of this non-British settlement, the resulting racial makeups of many of the populations, and both the legacies of racism, slavery, and economic exploitation, on the one hand, and the attitudes, within and without Britain and its territories, to nationality and ethnicity as they relate to race, on the other, mean that the relationship between Britain and some of its remaining settlements is often seen as more analogous to that which had existed between Britain and some of its now independent territories in Africa or Asia, rather than that with the previous North American or Australasian territories</dd>
