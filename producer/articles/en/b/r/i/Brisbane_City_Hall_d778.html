Bribane City Hall (view from <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_Square%2C_Brisbane_147c.html" title="King George Square, Brisbane">King George Square</a>)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Brisbane City Hall</b> is the seat of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_City_Council_05a1.html" title="Brisbane City Council">Brisbane City Council</a> and is located adjacent to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_Square%2C_Brisbane_147c.html" title="King George Square, Brisbane">King George Square</a>, where the City Hall has its main entrance. The City Hall also has frontages to both <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Street%2C_Brisbane_6dbc.html" title="Ann Street, Brisbane">Ann Street</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Street%2C_Brisbane_d27e.html" title="Adelaide Street, Brisbane">Adelaide Street</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>The City Hall was once the tallest building in Brisbane. The foundation stone was laid in July <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward, Prince of Wales</a> (later King Edward VIII / Duke of Windsor), and Brisbane City Hall was opened in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>. An earlier foundation stone had been laid in 1917 by <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governors_of_Queensland_5f51.html" title="Governors of Queensland">Queensland Governor</a> (Major Sir Hamilton J. Goold-Adams) in advance of the building's construction, however it was later found to be out of alignment, and it was removed. This stone, stored in a Brisbane City Council depot, later disappeared from record.</p>
<p>Brisbane City Hall has an imposing <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_tower.html" title="Clock tower">Clock Tower</a>, based on the design of the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Mark%27s_Campanile_fd83.html" title="St Mark's Campanile">St Mark's Campanile</a> in <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice.html" title="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>. The four clock faces on each side of the tower are the largest in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. The Clock has <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Chimes_3ad9.html" title="Westminster Chimes">Westminster Chimes</a>, which sound on the quarter hour.</p>
<p>Above the clocks is an observation platform, open to the public and accessible by <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">lift</a>. For many years this afforded spectacular views of Brisbane, but since the relaxation of height limits for surrounding buildings in the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, the view is now somewhat restricted.</p>
<p>The City Hall building also contains a large assembly hall located under a central <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotunda.html" title="Rotunda">rotunda</a> and several smaller reception rooms.</p>
<p>When originally built it was intended that the building would house most of the Council's administrative offices, Aldermen's (councillors') offices, the Council Chamber, a public library and several reception rooms, in addition to the main assembly hall. As the role of local government increased in the 1950s and 1960s, the reception rooms, hallways and side entrance vestibules (in Adelaide and Ann Streets) were converted to office space. Additional offices were constructed on the roof and in the basement.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> the council commenced the acquisition of the properties to the south of the City Hall, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> opened the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Administration_Centre_562c.html" title="Brisbane Administration Centre">Brisbane Administration Centre</a> (or BAC), a 20 floor tower and surrounding plaza. Most of the Council's offices then moved from the City hall to the BAC. The City Hall continues to house the office of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Mayors_and_Lord_Mayors_of_Brisbane_948a.html" title="List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Brisbane">Lord Mayor of Brisbane</a> (the Lord Mayor's office is located on the King George Square side of the building), the Council meeting Chamber (located on the Adelaide Street side of the building), and councillors' offices.</p>
<p>In the 1980s work commenced on the full-scale restoration of the building, opening up the side entrance vestibules and restoring a number of the reception rooms to their original design. These reception rooms are named for former local government areas subsumed into Greater Brisbane in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, such as the Sherwood Room, or the Ithaca Room. More recently, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Brisbane_eebf.html" title="Museum of Brisbane">Museum of Brisbane</a> (which has <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_gallery.html" title="Art gallery">galleries</a> positioned on both sides of the building's entrance from King George Square) has replaced administration offices.</p>
<p>The City Hall faces <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_Square%2C_Brisbane_147c.html" title="King George Square, Brisbane">King George Square</a>, named in honour of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a>. Originally this area, between Ann and Adelaide Streets, was much narrower than at present and was called Albert Square. In the late 1960s premises on the square opposite the City Hall were acquired by the City Council, demolished and the area levelled to form a larger square. The creation of the enlarged square was criticised in some quarters as it resulted in the removal of the original imposing flight of stone stairs in front of the building, when the ground level in front of the City Hall was raised to the level of the main entrance. To see photographs of Albert Square, which pre-date King George Square in its present form, check the photos <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23478002" class="external autonumber" title="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23478002" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23208124" class="external autonumber" title="http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23208124" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> — when Albert Square was redeveloped into King George Square, the existing fountain at Albert Square was relocated to Wynnum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:OldFountain114.jpg.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:OldFountain114.jpg.JPG" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The building is constructed of concrete, brick and steel, with a base of Camp Mountain <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granite.html" title="Granite">Granite</a>. The granite was extracted by the first builder, Arthur Midson, from his quarry at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Mountain%2C_Queensland_4910.html" title="Camp Mountain, Queensland">Camp Mountain</a> near <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samford%2C_Queensland_6e7d.html" title="Samford, Queensland">Samford</a>. This deposit was worked just for the City Hall project. Above Midson's granite base courses, the east, north and west sides are clad in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestone.html" title="Freestone">Helidon Freestone</a>, a type of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandstone.html" title="Sandstone">sandstone</a> extracted from Wright's Quarry <a href="http://www.jhwagner.com.au/product.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jhwagner.com.au/product.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helidon%2C_Queensland_e2bd.html" title="Helidon, Queensland">Helidon</a>. The sandstone cladding was constructed (together with the rest of the building) by builder Douglas Dunn Carrick. The clock tower has a steel framework, and is clad in the same sandstone.</p>
<p>The sculptured <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pediment.html" title="Pediment">tympanum</a> above the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portico.html" title="Portico">portico</a> and entrance was carved by noted Brisbane <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculptor</a> Daphne Mayo in the early 1930s. There is some controversy surrounding the theme of the sculpture, which depicts the progress of civilisation. The gown-clad female figure in the centre depicts "progress" or "enlightenment", while settlers with their cattle and explorers with their horses, move out from under her protecting arms to claim the land from the indigenous people, who are represented by an aboriginal male crouching in the left hand corner and two aboriginal figures moving away in the right hand corner.</p>
