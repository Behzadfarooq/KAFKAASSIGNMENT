<h2><span class="mw-headline">General comments</span></h2>
<p>Someone please check this! As an American I think of British English as any dialect in Britain (except Scots which may in fact be a separate language since it is mainly incomprehensible with English). Queen's English is what happens to one after public school has been inflicted on oneself. --rmhermen</p>
<p>A resident of Scotland speaking English may well use non-standard lexis and grammar and thus is speaking a British English dialect. So too a resident of Eire (Irish Republic). The page on British English British refers to it as "the different forms of English spoken in the United Kingdom." This is true but the UK is only a part of the British Isles, which includes the WHOLE of Ireland. So the entry should refer to The British isles, not the United Kingdom here. Oh yes, I also notice as I am about to submit this, that there is a warning not to submit "COPYRIGHTED" (sic) work.....oh dear!-- Freemorph</p>

<p>The British Isles doesn't include any of Ireland. The UK consists of Great Britain (the British Isles) and northan Ireland.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is an unresolved political issue - I too regard the whole of Ireland as rightfully part of the UK, and I'm not ethnically English either.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Scots English IS a distinct language from English, and always has been - it's just as old as English too.</dd>

<p>That's not true. <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scots</a> didn't become a distinct concept until the 16th century, evolving mainly from Northumbrian <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_English_5313.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 19:55, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to get a purile here, but this the above really isn't so. Scots English is dialect like Geordie or indeed RP. I think your getting your politics mixed up with your linguistics.</p>

<p>Some people do learn the Queen's English that way, but for most upper-class Britons, it's their native language, and they don't need to learn it at school, public or otherwise. As for the different dialects within Britain, I'm sure that you would find Geordie, Yorkshire or West Country just as difficult to understand as Scots. Most RP speakers certainly do. -- Derek Ross</p>
<hr />
<p>And what is Received Pronunciation? (Shows up on the rhotic page) --rmhermen</p>
<p>The term Britons, at least for most British people is fairly obsolete. It is generally only used in conection with the word ancient. This is possibly reinforced by the Monty Python sketch which inludes, "Who are the Britons?" British people use the term British people.</p>
<p>The word <i>Briton</i> has strong historical connotations, and suggests <i>Welsh person</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 19:55, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Received Pronunciation is the accent of the Home Counties of England. It's also the BBC's preferred pronunciation. An RP speaker is normally thought of as someone who speaks the Queen's English with a Home Counties accent. -- Derek Ross</p>
<p>True. The name RP is outdated, and patronising. My received pronunciation is quite differnet to any "Geoffrey" from "Sassix". It should be renamed Posh English - 'cos I think even the term "Home counties" is elitest.</p>
<p>macdaddy</p>
<hr />
<p><i>(Question for Brits: is the two-syllable form "learned" still used to mean "educated" in BrE??)</i></p>
<p>Yes it is, although not often.</p>
<p>Its most often heard in Parliament: When an MP addresses another in the house of commons, and the addressee is a barrister, the correct form of address is "My learned friend"</p>
<p>Oh, and we'll cheerfully use "fucking" as an adjective. "Bloody" is considerably milder, "this damn car" = "this bloody car"</p>
<p>Few people say "damn" - usually middle-class suburban old farts. more colloquial ones are: "sodding, bastard, shitting, cunting, and of course fucking and bloody." aaah the joy of swearing!</p>
<p>macdaddy</p>
<hr />
<p>I have never seen the word "bank" spelt "banque" here in the UK; although all this changed when I went to France! Does anyone have another example of this kind of spelling we can replace this with?</p>
<p><i>No. There aren't any (he boldly asserts). I've moved "cheque" vs "check" into the miscellany.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>I'll agree with both of the above points: I think 'learned' is usually writen 'learnèd', to put emphasis on the pronounciation, and I've never seen bank spelt banque either. I'm not sure about the fitted, forecasted, knitted, lighted, wedded bit, either. Lit, wed, forecast are British English too, but I'm not entirely sure about the context.</p>
<p>Archeology, encyclopedia and medieval are also highly acceptable variants in British English, almost preferred; upwards would be only preferred to upward. I'd personally also write 'skillful', not skilful; 'argument' not arguement, 'jail' not gaol.</p>
<p>NO WAY! NO BRITISH PEOPLE SPELL ARCHAEOLOGY, ENCYCLOPAEDIA OR MEDIAEVAL LIKE THAT UNLESS THEY'RE ILLITERATE! AND "ARGUEMENT" IS NOT A CORRECT SPELLING IN ANY DIALECT... HENCE, I DON'T THINK YOU GOT AN A IN YOUR ENGLISH GCSE! MACDADDY</p>
<p>The list should be split into cases where there are additional British English words and where the words aren't understood. Balls is perfectly unacceptable, whilst Dialling Code, fag, lorry, lounge, pissed, pudding, randy, ring someone and shag are all just alternatives... the american words are acceptable too. 'Concession' generally refers to a reduction for certain people (old people, kids... generally classed as 'concessions'), where as a discount is general. I think I'm right in saying '<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tube_fa25.html" title="The Tube">tube</a>' would just refer to the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a>. -- almost but not quite: see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tube_fa25.html" title="The Tube">The Tube</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU WHITTERING ON ABOUT?! MACDADDY</p>
<p>I think the most important thing to say is that American English and British English are growing together. With the world spanning media, within a few hundred years there will be no American English or British English - there will be only English. (Hell, by that time, there might only be one global language.)</p>
<p>BOLLOCKS! MACDADDY</p>
<p>-- I disagree <i>strongly</i> with your theory of convergence of language. English and American are becoming different languages by slow and sure degree. Also, if history teaches us anything, it is that languages are strongly culturally based entities, and that meaning will never ever be truly global. I (and most British people I know who are literate) would never write archaeology, encyclopaedia, or mediaeval in the fashion you indicate above. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Whether you disagree or not, it's still true. Since the advent of the mass media British English has become more and more similar to American English in line with our culture which is doing the same. The whole western world is becoming Americanised. This may or may not be a good thing. But it's true. I myself would certainly spell the word above 'ae' but i would often use center and color (unless it was in an exam or something) and i freely interchange different spellings where appropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And frankly, it is this kind of slackness in the use of language which debases it. Language is like currency: bad usage and spelling drives out good. If you are English you should use the orthodox spelling and not resort to the incorrect. In France the <i>Academie des Belles Lettres</i> would be down on this like a ton of bricks. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<p>YOU ARE A QUEER CHAP AREN'T YOU! MACDADDY</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I recall reading a book by Mario Pei written in about 1950 which said that American English and British English had been converging for about a century, due to improved global communications. Presumably the rate of change of langauges is sufficiently small that even relatively small amounts of intercommunication are enough to prevent dialects drifting apart. --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <i>improved global communications</i> hypothesis is an interesting one, but actually is underdetermined by the physical evidence. In 1978, Robert Burchfield, chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionaries made a speech in Chicago in which he thought that on the balance of all the evidence available that 'British' English and American English were moving so far apart and so inexorably that in 200 years they would be mutually unintelligible. This did not go down too well with the convergence theorists at the time. But in the last thirty years or so, that gap which Burchfield predicted between the implementations of the languages has actually widened by a great deal. Usage has changed significantly on both sides of the language. American English has considerably more Hispanic loan words now than thirty years ago; it has changed grammatically; it forms verbs from nouns more easily; it is altogether a more flexible language than 'British' English.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the confusuion here stems from the fact that the majority of the population of the UK do not speak 'British English' as it is defined here. We speak what could be considered American English with a English/Scottish/Irish accent. We form verbs from nouns, i.e. Text has been officially changed to a verb recently. And speak in a grammaticallt similar way. I think the American perception of the British is of people such as the Royal Family and 'well spoken' people such as Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley who do in fact speak 'British English' though these people form a small percentage of the population.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The real worry, however, from my point of view is not that the languages will diverge but that they will become one homogenous grey mess... <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>But what about the Internet? What about globalisation? The next thirty years are going to be very different from the last thirty. And even if they continue to diverge, so long as the whole world watches Hollywood movies they will still be mutually intelligible. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_J_Kissane_bb4f.html" title="User:Simon J Kissane">Simon J Kissane</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Internet will ultimately accentuate divergence more than ever before, and the prime movers will fight tooth and nail to protect their own particular implementations since they recognise that language is a key feature of self and cultural definition. Certainly the future of English as the dominant language itself is not unconditionally guaranteed. It is by no means a rational language and it is not easy for novitiates to acquire. Grammar, and usage are only to a certain extent ever going to be determined by minor cultural epiphenomena such as 'movies'. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't want to get involved in this rather silly debate, but I can't imagine anything I disagree with more than the above statement. The more the "prime movers" you mention want to protect their uniqueness, the more it will become apparent that they are completely impotent to affect the <i>real</i> users of language--you and me and the kid in the drive-through at MacDonalds, who just want to watch TV, buy stuff, and do all the other ordinary business of life that will cause us to do whatever it takes to commuicate. Nobody in the real world cares--or should care--about authority or purity in language. Language is a tool of the common man, and it will bow to what what people actually need and use to get their work done. If a Brit needs to know what "que pasa" means to understand an American sitcom, he will. If Americans need to know what "knickers" are to understand a British one, they will. Both will make it into dictionaries on both sides, and whichever new coinages are most useful will spread to the point where we won't even remember where they came from, just as most Americans have not the faintest clue that "bread" as a slang for money came from Cockney rhyming slang. "Educated" users of the language should strive for clarity and precision, but they still have to use the language that their audience will understand; they just have to use it more carefully. But they don't get to define it--their audience does. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">Lee Daniel Crocker</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>There is nothing <i>silly</i> concerning this debate about language whatsoever. As The Blessed William Burroughs once opined: 'Language is a virus'. These 'real' users of language you seem to advocate do not do whatever it takes to communicate: the preponderance of this putative polis are barely articulate, let alone literate (current estimates suggest that fewer than 5% of the US population read books). My native language (see <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_language.html" title="Cornish language">Cornish language</a>) was systematically suppressed over four hundred years and has been brought back from extinction by people who care about language, meaning and culture; if language was a matter of life and death for my forebears, then so it is for me. Let me state this one time unequivocably: languages do not converge, they diverge. The only way in which two disparate languages can possibly merge is by absorption which is not at all the same thing as convergence, and this can only be brought about by the sort of expedients mocked so effectively in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>
<p>The arguments about lexical equivalents are entirely consistent with the sort of arguments levelled at Burchfield 30-odd years ago, and it seems that the convergent hypothesis has apparently got no further in the intervening timespan. Never have languages converged in the history of humanity: what makes you think they will now? The Internet? In twenty years, let alone two hundred years time, the Internet will not exist in its present form. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>

<p>--- On the subject of the terms 'Underground' and 'Tube' British people use these terms specifically to refer to The <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> in London and would not normally refer to other underground transit systems as such. I am British and i wouldn't for example refer to the New York subway as the underground or the tube, i'd just call it the subway and i'd call the subway in Paris the Metro because that's what it's called. Am i making any sense? - <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieTheFoool_a9f6.html" title="User:JamieTheFoool">JamieTheFoool</a></p>

<dd>But what term would you use for an underground railway system in general, as opposed to a particular one? A subway? -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_J_Kissane_bb4f.html" title="User:Simon J Kissane">Simon J Kissane</a></dd>

<dd>Well, Australians like me call it what the Americans do -- we say subway, not underground. We also pedestrian passages under roads subways as well. So obviously that is an example of a case where Australian English is closer to American than British. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_J_Kissane_bb4f.html" title="User:Simon J Kissane">Simon J Kissane</a>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Outside Sydney, underground railways don't really have a name in Australia (in Melbourne the underground railway is usually called "the loop", and the rest of the system is usually referred to as "the train"). Using "subway" as a canonical example of where Australian English is closer to American English is not a particularly good choice. -- <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the cannonical example would have to be truck vs. lorry. But anyhow, I grew up in Melbourne, and I have always called it a subway. The Melbourne subway may be nicknamed the loop, but what it is is a subway. Just as that human over there is called John, but what John is is a human, not a John. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon_J_Kissane_bb4f.html" title="User:Simon J Kissane">Simon J Kissane</a></dd>

<p>I am British and have lived all my life in Britain and from this perspective (rather than an interpretation of the phrase from outside the country) I would agree with an earlier comment on this Talk page that British-English is <u>not</u> the same as Received Pronounciation (RP). I would use British-English (or more often English-English, somewhat argumentatively) to differentiate the usage of words from, say American-English (or, again, what I might, somewhat pointedly call American).</p>
<p>RP refers to the way that the language <u>sounds</u> when spoken. To my mind British English characterises things like spelling, e.g. <i>tyre</i> instead of <i>tire</i> or expressions, e.g. <i>queue</i> instead of <i>wait in line</i> and whole rafts of other differences and confusions in terms of meaning and usage, e.g. <i>pants</i> instead of <i>pants</i>.</p>
<p>I think the issue is complicated by the fact that the other 'dialects' mentioned in the article might include Scouse or Geordie or other regional uses of British English which are characterised by both particular word use and particular pronounciation. It should also perhaps be noted that Scotland and Wales actually have 'their own' languages. Although Gaelic may not be widely spoken, Welsh certainly is. The issue of the use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland probably opens too many cans of worms to even mention....oops...I just did...</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not sure what the best approach is here, but I do feel that the article as it stands is somewhat misleading or at least fudges the issue. -- <a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMazzy_beb5.html" title="User:Mazzy">Mazzy</a></p>
<p>It is difficult. I too am British and have lived in Britain all my life. I just don't like the term British English which seems to me to be a term used by people from other countries to denote a non-existent linguistic homogeneity within Britain. Scots, Geordie, Kent and West Country dialects are extremely different. That's why I'd rather title the article English in Britain. However like it or not overseas English speakers do think of an entity which they call British English so we need an article on it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yup, I think you're right. -- <a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMazzy_beb5.html" title="User:Mazzy">Mazzy</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>100% True. When they say "British English", they mean "English English" - it certainly isn't spoken like that in Scotland, Wales or Ireland!</p>
<p>As for RP, that's why I referred to it above as an accent rather than as a dialect. I normally use the terms <i>Standard English</i> or <i>the Queen's English</i> to describe the dialect, often spoken using the RP, which overseas English speakers think of as British English. It seems that you have a different slant on it.</p>

<dd>Okay, I'll maybe take a little time to gird my loins and check the lie of the land. It's a big subject, perhaps I'll wait and see how things settle and then plunge in some time with my tuppence. Having spent the past few years trying to learn American off native-speakers (mainly online) I think any suggestion (as earlier on this page) that the languages have converged to any linguistic identity is a gross simplification &amp; over-optimistic/pessimistic (depending upon your viewpoint of that end-result). Just try <i>catching up</i> an American and see how long it takes the two of you to figure out who was ahead in the first place (the phrase opperates entirely differnt in British English and American English. -- <a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMazzy_beb5.html" title="User:Mazzy">Mazzy</a></dd>

<dd>Well I've leapt in and added a paragraph about London accents, since I get the impression some outsiders think h-dropping is standard British. Perhaps I should have specifically mentioned h-dropping. Also, I've added something under the written language saying that it's basically the same in all English-speaking countries. I think these two points are where convergence and divergence come in. The written language will remain uniform, possibly being preserved like Latin or Arabic over the centuries, and films will ensure there's a continual sharing of new words; but the actual pronunciation will diverge as fast as it ever has in any other language. I often literally can't understand children who used the newest London variety. I think London speech is undergoing very fast change. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a></dd>

<p>Is it correct to say that <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_English_3b82.html" title="New Zealand English">New Zealand English</a> contains many words from <a href="../../../m/a/o/Maori_language.html" title="Maori language">Maori</a>? There are many place and bird names from the Maori language used, but I've heard of very few everyday words from Maori being used in everyday English.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many, but my godfather was born in New Zealand, and he refers to whites (as opposed to any other race) <i>pakeha</i>, which is the Maori word for a Westerner or European. He uses that word as a matter of course - I've even heard it used when he's contrasting, for instance, whites and American blacks; he doesn't even have to be talking about Maori people. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefamouseccles_063a.html" title="User:Thefamouseccles">thefamouseccles</a> 23:16 08 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>New Zealand English does contain some references to Maori, but very few are used colloqiually. Most efforts to integrate Maori into everyday life are part of government awareness schemes and are generally ignored by European New Zealanders (pakeha). A few slang words ("ehoa" used where an english person might use "oi", originally meant "friend", "hamu" for a scrounge, "tutu" for someone who fiddles too much, "nono" for rear end etc) are often picked up in the course of young education, where some exposure to Maori is mandatory, but amongst the white population, these commonly become pejorative during late teens.

<p>I do notice, and get annoyed by people saying "fill out" instead of "fill in" - but actually, I think this comes from Australian influence more than US influence - at one point there were about 9 Australian Soap Operas on in the UK. The UK and Australia are arguably as culturally close as USA and Canada; loads of people migrating and holidaying in both, and a healthy interchange of TV (rather than the less healthy relationship with America).</p>

<p>Just a quick note - "Pidgin English" (or <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tok_Pisin_54f4.html" title="Tok Pisin">Tok Pisin</a>) is <i>not</i> a dialect of English, but a creole language based upon it. The grammar is quite different, even though an English speaker can understand many of the words. Pidgin English doesn't distinguish singular and plural, <i>does</i> distinguish inclusive (<b>yumi</b>) and exclusive (<b>mipela</b>) first person plural pronouns (compare <b>Fred i bin singautim yumi long pati</b> <i>Fred invited us (including you) to the party</i> and <b>Fred i bin singautim mipela long pati</b> <i>Fred invited us (but not you) to the party</i>), and there is a transitive verb forming suffix <b>-im</b> which, for instance, can distinguish <b>em i rit</b> <i>he is reading</i> from <b>em i ritim buk</b> <i>he is reading a book</i>. Saying that Tok Pisin is a dialect of English is like saying that <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans_language.html" title="Afrikaans language">Afrikaans</a> is a dialect of <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThefamouseccles_063a.html" title="User:Thefamouseccles">thefamouseccles</a> 23:29 08 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>macdaddy This entry is offensive to British and English people. The term "British-English" is a derogatory term invented by Americans who wish to imply or even state overtly that their dialect is legitimately called "English", the correct name for American-English is not English, it is a dialect of English, but it is not English. To use the term British English - as exists on computers is to imply a. that English is a dialect of American English: denegrating this mythical language; and b. subserviency. It's tantamount to cultural theft - like the way American films are made to lay claim to parts of British history as if they were done by the Americans: the cheek! I actually want to go further - to insist that in all the code, the term "EN" refers only to the English of England - i.e. Standard English. The Americans can have "AM-EN".</p>
<p>Any native British person (like myself) will tell you that they do not speak "British-English" we speak English, and Americans do not speak English, they speak American-English. It's like Brazil turning to Portugal and saying "we speak Portuguese, and you speak Lusitanian-Portuguese"; it's derogatory, offensive; and blatently about power. Or the same with Quebec and France, Mexico and Spain, Afrikaaner South Africa and Holland. The truth is that there is no such thing as "British English" - there is not one English that applies to the whole of the British Isles. There are several layers of distinction, by nation (Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, England), and then by region. And it should be added that English dialects within Britain are far more divergant than those of America or anywhere else. (If you've ever seen a Geordie, an East Londoner, a Scouser, a Brummie, a Bristolian, a Tyke, a Dubliner, an Orcadian, an Ulsterman, and a Glasweigan having an argument, you'd swear down they were speaking different languages.) At no point is there ever the distinction of "British English".</p>
<p>I'm serious, I want the heading "British English" removed. It's not only false, it's offensive.</p>
<p>JACK, YORK, ENGLAND, GREAT BRITAIN,</p>
<p>PS: And as for the article below by Simon J Kissane, that's wrong too. a. Those who adopt Americanisms are predominantly middle-class university brats. b. In fact, the tide of the flow of words and grammar across the Atlantic has turned: Americans are adopting British-derived words and grammar: words like "whinge" for instance, and even the Hip-hop culture has decided to use "Alright" and start replacing their "d" sounding "t" with our famous glottal stop. PPS: In response to the points by Daniel Lee Crooker: We should care about the lack of national pride in supporting our own language, the way Channel 4 just shows wall-to-wall American TV, the way so-called new British movies distort the language by making British actors talk in an overtly American and UnBritish way. We have every bit as much ability to produce quality media and export our culture and language across the world aggressively - British people should have a little more pride instead of just wanting to be subsumed into either American or Globalised Euro-culture. Don't let you kids watch the plethora of cartoons which only have american accents on them, don't watch the tedious formulaic american garbage - boycott it. When we do make our own stuff it is often a superior product, and we need to send a clear message to the media warlords in our own country that we want it to predominate, instead of us becoming a faded Greece to America's imperial Rome.</p>

<p>It should be made clear that while Cornwall is officially a county of England. It is also a Duchy, and an ethnically distinct Celtic nation, with its own language, which is autochthonous like Welsh. While the article contains the term "Cornwall" when refering to dialects of English within England, it should be made clear that Cornwall (&amp; Devon) does not have the same status as somewhere like Kent or Shropshire. And a link should be provided for those interested to pursue. The term Corno-English might be appropriate, if we are going to advertise terms like "Hiberno-English".</p>

<li>I'm no language graduate, but I will be (currently studying linguistics at uni), and ricjl is right, it's probably not a good idea to make a definitive statement one way or the other. While it is a well-known fact that geographically separated languages become increasingly divergent, and that this has occurred between British and American English in the past few centuries, the advent of mass communication has caused them to exchange features and become more similar in certain respects. It would be best to not definitively say that the languages are converging or diverging, as it seems the jury is still out on this one. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Livajo</a> 11:16, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>there is a part of Britain called the "East Midlands" where people don't really have a particular accent - it's more like a watered down mix of East Anglian, RP (or Posh English), and Esturine English.</p>
<p>Mank (Manchester) is also not quite the same as Lancastrian - the dialect north of Manchester. Cumbria has it's own weird gargly drone, and Ireland has more than just two accents. Northeast Wales' and IoM English is like Scouse. The English near the Forest of Dean (The West Country) sounds like American, and is quite distinct from Cornish English and Somerset English. Likewise North Yorkshire English (especially in York) is different from urban South and West Yorkshire English (Tyke) - I know - 'cos I commute between the two. East Yorkshire (Hull) also has it's own distinct twang. There's also a difference between Newcastle Geordie, and the Tees area accent - which is softer and more aspirated. Interesting to note that most dialects in Britain and Ireland are not only based around smallish concentrated areas - like a city, but there's also a rural-urban divide. Imagine taking the train from Liverpool to Darlington: you'll pass through 5 different distinct accents in just over 1 hour! Scouse (Irish Sea southern coast, very distinctive), Mank (Southern Lancshire, somewhere inbetween Scouse and Tyke), Tyke (Urban S&amp;W Yorkshire, very distinctive: own vocabulary), and then Yorkie (Rural North Yorkshire, softer and more nasal than Tyke with some different vocab), Cleveland or Tees (very distinct from Yorkshire, soft aspirated).</p>

<p>This hasn't been addressed elsewhere, other than where I had on a couple other sites. I despise the Commonwealth, and to a lesser degree American, corruption of the simple and basic verb "have" into a meaningless and nonsensical phrase "have got". Although it may look like and be used as a hybrid of two straight sayings, it doesn't work. I want to strangle the cretins <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Oliver_b6b5.html" title="Jamie Oliver">Jamie Oliver</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Irwin_a65f.html" title="Steve Irwin">Steve Irwin</a> for their abusive language. There is no excuse for that, and I demand the explanation. Of course, the former region instigated, or enabled, this by the longstanding corruption of the past participle from gotten to got, for no reason, but this is no excuse. I want an explanation for that too. CwE moreover has been taking in too much Latin, or Latish, whilst AE too much Spanish, or Hispanic. I've been trying to withdraw from these needless wordly insteppings and if I ever get my own website will rally for a sheerer (purer for ye Latish slaves) English. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysdexia_bda0.html" title="User:Lysdexia">lysdexia</a> 08:08, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"have got" is totally natural English in England. I (as a native English speaker from England) absolutely despise the nauseating unnatural overuse of the word "have" by American-English speakers. Having said that I agree with the strangling of Jamie Oliver - I nominate his bete noir Mark Lamarr to do it.</p>

<p>They should move it to "English English". See my article below, no.13. Or perhaps someone has a better suggestion. But let us English, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish and Northern Irish pull together and sort this out.</p>

<p>These are examples I found with some quick Googling. The last one might do as a general reference in the article, if one is actually needed. I would prefer something more authoritative, commenting on this usage rather than simply exhibiting it. But the use of <i>International English</i> to mean approximately British English, particularly in respect to spelling, is not uncommon, although confusing. See <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_English_6880.html" title="International English">International English</a> for discussion of two uses of this term.</p>

<p>Hi Jallan, thanks for sending these references. However, I don't find them authoratitive or relevant. The Microsoft references don't say that Interational English is regarded as British English. They simply say there is, on the one hand, American, and on the other hand International. No mention of British. The website about Harry Potter that is run by a fan is not a good source. And your comment that, e.g. Canadian English is based on British English is not correct. It has much more in common with American English. Some newspapers (the ones that follow Canadian Press) follow some, but not all, British English spellings. But all punctuation and syntax, most of the vocabulary, and much of the spelling is American.</p>
<p>Could you please find an authoritative source that says International English means British English if that claim is to stay in the article? Sorry to be a pain, but I haven't seen this claim before. Also, other Wikipedia articles can't be used as references. References do have to be external and reputable. Are there any reputable International English dictionaries that make the same claim? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 22:24, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">English not British</span></h2>
<p>Ok, I find this article racially offensive.</p>
<p>Lets get this clear , for the benefit of the rest of the world, and then we can edit this article to remove all the offensive references.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom consists of fours countires - England, populated by a racial and national group called the English, Scotland, populated by Scots, Wales, populated by the Welsh, and Ireland, populated by the Irish.</p>
<p>Only the English speak English. We invented the language. Note that. Not the Americans, the English. The Scots, the Welsh and the Irish all officially speak Gelic, in there own variants, but they also speak out language, English.</p>
<p>The phrase 'British' is a political category that means nothing. There is no racial group that currently calls itself 'The British' and no country that is the homeland of the 'British'. Anyone can become British. All you have to do is successfully obtain a 'British' passport from a United Kingdom Embassy. On the other hand, you can only be English, or Scottish, or Irish, or Welsh by being born in that country.</p>
<p>SO, in the interests of not inflaming us, kindly do not call us, any of us, British.</p>
<p>We, the English, took our language to the undiscovered country now called the USA, and left it there, during which those persons developed a variant, American English. The implication by Microsoft that OUR language as spoken by us is a variant of American English is highly offensive, and quite frankly a damn arrogant cheek. We originated this language, and treating us like intruders into our own language is a bloody liberty.</p>
<p>Neither is International English the same as English English, thats just another bodged variant designed to make Europeans feel smug.</p>
<p>SO lets remove all the references to British and replace them with 'English' or 'Gaelic', eh&#160;?</p>

<p>Actually, the concept of Britain predates that of England, Scotland or Wales, at least in the sense of 'the Kingdoms of Britain' which were of pre-Roman, Celtic origin. While this is of course of little linguistic importance I feel it should be noted.</p>
<p>'British English' as a orthographical rather than a phonetic record most definitely does exist, moreover. The conventions which govern spelling in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the R.O.I. are for the most part identical. The term British English does I feel also have an appropriate application as a blanket term for the dialects of the British Isles; while it may be a little indelicate from an Irish perspective it certainly is used in such a way.</p>
<p>Your claim that English somehow belongs to England or that 'we invented the language' is of such massive narrow minded idiocy that I'm not even going to bother correcting you.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">It should never be called "British English".</span></h2>
<p>This language "English", originally the language of the people of England, and ought not properly to be called "British English" by anyone with even the most basic grasp of the history of these Isles.</p>
<p>Like others on this page, I find this label both inaccurate and offensive.</p>
<p>It is inaccurate because English comes from England and not from Great Britain. It is inaccurate because it creates the altogether false impression that there is a homogenous type of English spoken throughout Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England, which may be conveniently labelled as "British".</p>
<p>It is offensive because using this label shows a complete disreagrd for the fact that the original language of the Welsh people is Welsh, and the fact that the original language of the Scottish is Scottish Gaelic. It is offensive because English, to Scottish, Welsh and many Northern Irish people, is the language of those who conquered them and endeavoured to extinguish their respective native languages and cultures. It is offensive because there are strong independence movements Scotland and Wales, not to mention in Northern Ireland, and as a label it promotes a linguistic unity where in real life there is none. It is offensive because "British" is only used in these places where the adjectives "Scottish", "Welsh", "Northern Ireland" or "English" would be wrong, for example, a foreigner applies for a British visa because we only have one unified Embassy, but when did you last see the British football team play?</p>
<p>Since the popularity of Mr Gates' products necessitate such divisive labelling then I advocate that the content on our versions of this language be relocated to pages named "Welsh English", "Scottish English", "Irish English" and "English English", with a link to those pages from the former "British English" page. (I didn't employ a comma ',' after the last item in my list. That is not a grammatical error, it is a feature of English English). If those people who are in charge of these pages have any respect for Northern Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English people then this misnomer must be abandoned.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Well, I having just re-read the article I note that it says "The broader use refers to the language of the entirety of the United Kingdom.". Nonsense! Absolute nonsense! English is the language of ENGLAND, there's a little clue in the name that gives it away&#160;;)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>The 'original' language of Scotland (original from what point?) would in fact predate gaelic by several thousand years, Scots gaelic being derived from the tribe which colonised Scotland from what we now consider to be Ireland, namely the Scotti. In more recent history Scotland has been linguistically divided into three, with English being spoken in the lowlands, Scots (which may or may not be considered a dialect of English; it certainly shares many syntactic links with English - see the poetry of R. Burns) being spoken in Lanarkshire and the Lothians up towards Perthshire, and Gaelic which was spoken in the highlands. Until the 1600s a language very closely related to Norse was spoken on Orkney and Shetland, and a dialect called 'Doric' continues to be spoken in the Aberdeenshire area which retains Norse features, as well as displaying Gaelic influences.</p>
<p>My point is this: if it is so difficult to establish an 'original' language for Scotland (which you so confidently postulate above), how can you then claim that even the term English English, Scottish English etc is appropriate for the description of the vast number of dialects which exist even within these national sub-groups? British English as a term is useful in that it provides a blanket term for the orthographical conventions used in Britain where English is being written down. 'English English', 'Scottish English' and 'Welsh English' are diminishingly different from each other in terms of orthography. Your assertion that British English 'promotes a linguistic unity where in real life there is none' is plainly ridiculous. While Welsh is spoken by 20% of people living in Wales, English is spoken by all of them; less than one percent of Scots speak Gaelic as a first language; Mandarin is spoken by more people living in Northern Ireland than Irish Gaelic. You are applying political opinions to a linguistic situation with misleading and comically incorrect results.</p>
<p>Gaelic is the <i>original</i> (in its proper sense) language of Scotland, although not the first or only one. That's just like England with English, where several languages were spoken in the area before the coming of English. But both languages are "original" because the speakers of each language (Gaelic &amp; English) gave their name to each country <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 17:45, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
