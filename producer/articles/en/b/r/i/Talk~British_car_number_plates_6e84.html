<p>The Northern Ireland section doesn't look right to me, though I'm not confident enough of the actual situation to edit it. I'm pretty sure that NI plates are of the form <b>ZZZ 1234</b> - ie <i>four</i> digits. And I'm not at all sure that NI plates carry any year-denoting characters - isn't this absence one reason NI plates are often used as "vanity plates" in Great Britain? <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> 00:19, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have created a new section for Northern Ireland with county codes, as well as updating the text. In the code list I have used the current official county name, so Co. Londonderry appears as "Londonderry". This does not result from any political idealogy, but because it is actually called that. I also changed the links at the bottom to reflect the fact that the body responsible for registrations is in Northern Ireland is called DVLNI and does not have "Agency" in its name. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarethhamilton_c484.html" title="User:Garethhamilton">Garethhamilton</a> 22:21, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have seen plates with numbers such as <tt>000D000</tt> where each <tt>0</tt> may be a digit. Are these diplomatic plates?

<p>I don't have time just at the moment to incorporate any of this into the article, nor do I feel inclined to do so, since I'm not in a position to verify any of the information. But I've found a number of discrepencies with other sources which would appear to indicate errors and omissions in the Wikipedia article, which I thought I may as well document here for future reference:</p>
<p><a name="Scottish_number_plates" id="Scottish_number_plates"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_car_number_plates_6e84.html" title="Edit section: Scottish number plates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scottish number plates</span></h3>
<p><i>whilst Scotland and Ireland had special sequences incorporating the letters "S" and "I" respectively</i></p>
<p>Judging by this list of old one and two letter codes at <a href="http://www.regtransfers.co.uk/main/stories/cracking2.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.regtransfers.co.uk/main/stories/cracking2.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.regtransfers.co.uk/main/stories/cracking2.asp</a> it appears that not all Scottish codes contained an 'S', eg 'G' for Glasgow,, 'AG' for Ayrshire.</p>
<p><i>I can answer that:</i> Apart from G - Glasgow, S - Edinburgh, and V - Lanarkshire, the original 1903 scheme did indeed only allocate codes in Scotland of the form S* or *S. Only later, when all the "S" codes had been used up, were other codes issued in Scotland. Two letter codes with G or V in them were originally reserved for this purpose, but some were eventually used in England.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_car_number_plates_6e84.html" title="Edit section: Allocation of old one/two letter codes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Allocation of old one/two letter codes</span></h3>
<p><i>When a licensing authority reached 9999, it was allocated another two letter mark, but there was no pattern to these subsequent allocations as they were allocated on a first come first served basis.</i></p>
<p>Looking at the above list, it's plausible that initially they were allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, but it's clear that at some point an effort was made to introduce some kind of ad-hoc pattern. Eg most of the 'Lx' codes were allocated to London, several of the 'Nx' codes to Manchester, etc. Perhaps this is when the 'Sx' codes were allocated to Scotland?</p>
<p><a name="List_of_one.2Ftwo_letter_codes" id="List_of_one.2Ftwo_letter_codes"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_car_number_plates_6e84.html" title="Edit section: List of one/two letter codes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">List of one/two letter codes</span></h3>
<p>It would be nice to have such a list on Wikipedia. Note that there are some special cases that also need to be tackled, where a three letter code was reserved for a special use. eg based on an old list I saw when I was young (in an 'I Spy' book, IIRC) although 'MC' was allocated to London, the 'GMC' sequence was IIRC reserved and allocated to Manchester for use by Greater Manchester Council. I'm also guessing that although 'AN' was allocated to West Ham, 'MAN' might have been reserved from this sequence to avoid clashing with the Isle of Man use of this code. There may be other examples.</p>

<p>We could do with some mention of these. All the ones I've seen are either of the the form two digits, two letters, two digits, or alternatively two letters, two digits, two letters.</p>
<p>Olav's plates site <a href="http://www.olavsplates.com/great_britain.html" class="external free" title="http://www.olavsplates.com/great_britain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.olavsplates.com/great_britain.html</a> has some more information. (It appears from the comments on the photos that the first form is pre 1995, the latter form after. Also, it appears that the earliest plates used the central two-letter code to identify the branch of the military, but later plates didn't)</p>
<p><a name="Isle_of_Man_Plates" id="Isle_of_Man_Plates"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_car_number_plates_6e84.html" title="Edit section: Isle of Man Plates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Isle of Man Plates</span></h3>
<p>Judging by this site <a href="http://www.pl8s.com/i/iman.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pl8s.com/i/iman.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pl8s.com/i/iman.htm</a> it would appear that things are much more complicated than we suggest here; according to this article there have been <i>eleven</i> different styles of plate issued on the Isle of Man (twelve if you count the brief reuse of the original format in 1971). The pictures on Olav's site would tend to corroborate much of this, and certainly shows more styles than those we describe.</p>
<p>Looking at the format of the Isle of Man plates, I'm guessing that they actually exist in the same numbering space as UK plates (ie an Isle of Man plate will never clash with a UK plate). Certainly the old code list shows MN as being allocated to the Isle of Man, and I'm guessing that 'MAN' was reserved out of the 'AN' sequence.</p>
<p>This page on the DVLA web site <a href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk/faq/faq_number_plates.htm#10" class="external free" title="http://www.dvla.gov.uk/faq/faq_number_plates.htm#10" rel="nofollow">http://www.dvla.gov.uk/faq/faq_number_plates.htm#10</a> comments that a code is reserved in the new UK system for the Isle of Man so that they can adpot the scheme it they choose. I regard this as circumstantial evidence that an effort has been made to coordinate UK and IoM plates, and that they effectively exist in the same number space, but it would be interesting to know whether this is really true.</p>
<p><a name="Channel_Island_Number_Plates" id="Channel_Island_Number_Plates"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_car_number_plates_6e84.html" title="Edit section: Channel Island Number Plates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Channel Island Number Plates</span></h3>
<p>It's clear from Olav's site that the numbers can vary in lenght, eg Jersey plates don't have to be five digits, older ones are four (and presumably they started at '1'). COnversely Alderney plates at no longer three digits, they're now into four (and presumably they started at '1' too?).</p>
<p>This also suggests that Channel Island number plates exist in a separete number space and <i>can</i> clash with UK plates. In the old UK scheme 'J' was apparently allocated to Durham and 'AY' to Leicestershire. If this is true it is probably worthy of note.</p>
<p>Guernsey plates presumably cannot clash with UK plates, since they're entirely numberic, and such plates have never been used in the UK.</p>
<p>The 'GBG' with a circle round appears to be just a stylistic element on the plate. Judging by Olav's site by no means all plates have it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoybadami_2c79.html" title="User:Roybadami">Roy Badami</a> 23:09, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Guernsey 'H' plate thing is based on first-hand knowledge, but here's a third party to back it up: <a href="http://www.sandman-uk.com/guernsey/town.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sandman-uk.com/guernsey/town.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandman-uk.com/guernsey/town.htm</a> --81.86.106.14 17:00, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alderney plates are all prefixed 'AY' and are sequential from 1 upwards; as vehicles are retired the numbers are re-issued.</p>
<p>The GBG on Guernsey plates is stylistic as you say. To be legal abroad, a correct 'international oval' would be required.</p>

<p>Again having to correct this. Black plates are now permitted on all Historic Vehicles, which means any built prior to 1973. They do not have to have been registered or used prior to that date, only built.
