<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Bullets_8441.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The Bullets were established in 1979 for the foundation season of the National Basketball League, under the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28sports%29.html" title="Captain (sports)">captaincy</a> of Bruce Fitzgerald, and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_coach.html" title="Head coach">head coach</a> Bob Young. Of the 18 games played during the inaugural NBL season, Brisbane won 13 and lost five, finishing in fifth place. Brisbane's <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Bruton_f86e.html" title="Cal Bruton">Calvin Bruton</a> finished as the league's highest points per game scorer of the season.</p>
<p>The Bullets made it to the finals in the second NBL season of 1980. Dave Claxton took over as head-coach as well. Finishing in third place, winning 17 of their 22 season games, the Bullets met the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Adelaide_Bearcats_185b.html" title="West Adelaide Bearcats">West Adelaide Bearcats</a> in the second semi-final, losing 94-101. Brian Banks made the NBL First Team that season.</p>
<p>Brian Banks became the Bullets captain the following season. After making the finals in the second season, Brisbane did so again in 1981. Brisbane finished in fifth place, but first-placed <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Melbourne_Saints_48c5.html" title="Southern Melbourne Saints">St. Kilda</a> did not attend the finals, as they were in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> contesting the World Club Championship. The Bullets lost to Launceston Casino City 69-71 in the first semi-final. In 1982, with new coach Rick Harden, the Bullets missed out on qualifying for the finals, finishing eighth. The following year season they finished fifth, still out of the finals.</p>
<p>Under new coach Brian Kerle, the Bullets' first grand final appearance came about in the 1984 season, though they were not successful in capturing their first championship. However, the following season they finished in first place and were again finalists, and this time were successful, gaining their first NBL championship.</p>
<p>The success in the 1980s continued under Kerle and captain <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sengstock_7a11.html" title="Larry Sengstock">Larry Sengstock</a>, as they were again unsuccessful finalists in 1986, and then won their second championship in the 1987 season. They finished third in 1988, and made their exit at their elimination final. The following season they failed to make the finals, for the first t ime since 1983, finishing in eighth place.</p>
<p>However, the Bullets made a huge turn around the next season, finishing in third place, and going onto make it to the grand final of the 1990 season. The next season was not nearly as successful, as the team finished in ninth place, way out of finals contention. However, in 1992 the Bullets were back in the finals, making it to the quarter-finals. In 1993, Bruce Palmer became the new Bullets coach, and the team made it as far as the semi-finals.</p>
<p>From 1994 through to the 1996 seasons, the Bullets made it as far as the quarter-finals, finishing in fifth, sixth and eighth place respectively. David Ingham took over as head coach for the 1996 and 1997 seasons, with Brian Kerle coaching from 1998 to 2000.</p>
<p>The Bullets failed to get to the finals during the early years of the 2000s. The 2001-02 season was disappointing for the Bullets as they finished second last on the regular season table, winning just 4 of their 28 fixtures. The Bullets won 22 of their 33 fixtures in 2003-04 to finish in fourth place on the ladder.</p>
<p>The team qualified for the finals in the 2004-05 and the 2005-06 seasons. The Bullets finished in fifth place in 2005-06, just missing out on a quarter-final place. They hosted the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth_Wildcats_bd24.html" title="Perth Wildcats">Perth Wildcats</a> at home in game one, though they lost 96-91 and were eliminated.</p>
<p>During the 2006-07 pre-season Blitz, the Bullets won all three of their group stage games to finish at the top of Pool A and advance to the quarter-finals. Defeating the Wollongong Hawks and the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Kings_1208.html" title="Sydney Kings">Sydney Kings</a> to make it into the final, the Bullets went on to defeat the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Tigers_28ee.html" title="Melbourne Tigers">Melbourne Tigers</a> to win the pre-season title.</p>
<p>Following on from there pre-season success the Bullets easily won the minor premiership for the 2006-07 season claiming a end of season record of 28 wins and only 5 losses. This included an all time NBL record breaking 21 game winning streak marking the Bullets most successfull season since 1979. After defeating the Sydney Kings in the semis Brisbane made their first grand final in the NBL since 1990. The Bullets took the Finals series 3-1 over Melbourne Tigers to be crowned 2006/07 NBL Champions.</p>
