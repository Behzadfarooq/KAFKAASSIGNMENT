<h2><span class="mw-headline">Backlash</span></h2>
<p>No article about Britney Spears can claim to be complete without mentioning the buckets of what was supposedly urine that was thrown during an early morning recording or the series of pictures of her running for cover with a cigarette in her hand. Pretty famous fodder for the tabloids and newsgroups. Anyone going to get around to adding it? <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJarwulf_6ef3.html" title="User:Jarwulf">Jarwulf</a> 23:19, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>False</b> There were no "buckets of urine" - those supposed pictures are from the set of her video for "Overprotected (Darkchild Remix)" where they used a RAIN MACHINE for the video, thus her wet appearance. And ask yourself this: who keeps buckets of urine in their house? How convenient.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Britney's Net Worth Disputed</span></h2>
<p>Someone kepts that she is worth <b>$275 million</b>. No is she NOT. Jay-Z and Diddy are worth about that much and they are record execs. The fact is people are inflating her wealth. She is currently worth $120 million. The Fabulous of Bitney &amp; Kevin in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, stated that they are worth 100 million USD. Please provide the link for the Forbes 2004, if she is worth more. People should not invent figures from thin air!</p>
<ul>
<li>This link has been removed after a reader queried it. I have removed it from the article. It should not be included in the article until a verifiable source is provided such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes.html" title="Forbes">Forbes</a>. 01:29, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Britney is actually worth about $125 million which is I think mentioned on Vh1's Fabulous Life Of Britney And Kevin.</p>
<p>It now says $250 million... That makes no sense.. I heard it was $123 million in September 2004.</p>

<p>I can't add this obviously as the article is protected, but Spears gave birth today.</p>
<p>Yes, it is true, she has given birth via c-section (looks like her husband won't be throwing his hot dog down the hallway after all).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll unprotect the article, but I think there have been false rumors about this before and you will need to cite a source for it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:56, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Trivia" Section</span></h2>
<p>I've been thinking... Should the size of the "Trivia" section be more limited? I know I added a lot about how she ranked on all these music channel things, but maybe it should be removed, along with some other things. The only reason I'm bringing this up is because the page is already pretty long, and maybe some of the smaller facts shouldn't be included. What does everyone else think? -- Triggy, Jun. 30.</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreed, the listing of the notes she hits in her songs is a waste of space. If they were notes she hit singing *live*, then a small vocal profile displaying min and max vocal range would be in the interests of article. To list indervidual songs is too much unnecessary info. Besides, the amount of post-production done on her vocals means that what you hear in the songs probably isn't what she can really do...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of the other singers have listings of the notes they hit on record. Why shouldnt Britneys be on her page? Britney only has pro-tooling credits on one album which was her latest "In The Zone" i also want to say all vocalists use post-production and pro-tooling when they release a studio album.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="About_her_Vocal_Profile" id="About_her_Vocal_Profile"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">About her Vocal Profile</span></h2>
<p>Better you check Britney's vocal profile, because she doesn't hit 3 octaves (the same as Toni Braxton, Alicia Keys etc). Nobody can judge exactly her range through her recordings because there are many computer effects in her voice. And she has a few live performances (everytime, i'm not a girl not yet a woman etc),and she always "tune off" and her sound tends to "fail" when she tries to reach a high note in these live performances. And I don't know, but the fact that she is soubrette interfere in her vocal range? can she hit 3 octaves being a soubrette?</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm wrong and sorry for the bad english.</p>
<p>Well according to this information and her recorded music she has a 3 octave range. All singers use studio magic or "pro-tools". Since Britney didn't start pro-tooling her albums until "In The Zone" its safe to say those statistics are right. Since there aren't any pro-tooling credits on any of her other albums (Britney, Oops... and ...Baby) also are we are going by recorded songs are we not?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know about any of this, but I am tired of seeing the number change from 2 to 3 and back again every few minutes. How about we just omit the "octaves" number completely until we figure it out? Alternately, we could have it say "2 <i>or</i> 3 octaves". <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 9 July 2005 00:33 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well C3-B5 is 3 octaves</p>
<p>C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 A3 B3 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 B4 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 A5 B5</p>
<p>Don't you think its alittle weird that your comparing Britney to Alicia Keys and Toni Braxton because there both Contralto's while Britney is a Soubrette?</p>
<p>Sorry that was me who changed it to 2 octaves because I agree with you it's impossible for Britney to have the same vocal range as such singers like Alicia Keys, Toni Braxton even Beyonce'. Plus I don't think Britney even has 2 octaves. When I went to go edit the page I was blocked. And whoever is putting she has 3 octaves is completely wrong on so many levels and needs to actually listen to Britney's music and her live performances to see she can not sing a note even if it saved her life.</p>
<p>Does anybody here who knows about musical notes and singing want to actually listen to all of Britney's albums Baby threw Greatest Hits to see how big her octave range is along with her highest and lowest notes are. Cause this editing is getting annoying.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the edits aren't getting anyone anywhere. I don't particularly care about Britney either way; I've just seen all the edits going by in <a href="../../../r/c/_/WP%7ERC_d77e.html" title="WP:RC">RC</a>. Since Britney fans have an incentive to widen it and Britney detractors have an incentive to narrow it, the only thing we can really get here is <i>research</i>. Someone needs to find the points in the recording where the extremes are so someone else can verify it, or someone needs to get something from a publicist, or something like that. Alas, I haven't even been able to find the name of her management company, but I don't have any of her recordings.</dd>

<dd>It doesn't matter if one "agrees that it's impossible". <i>You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.</i> It would be an exceptional range, but she may <i>have</i> an exceptional range, and by now it seems clear that no-one editing is certain what her range <i>is</i>. Narrowing the range listed in the article because of a poor opinion of her singing ability is POV. Narrowing the range because of research is not. — <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendel_e2b1.html" title="User:Mendel">mendel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMendel_d73b.html" title="User talk:Mendel">☎</a> 02:03, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed Britney's voice type because according to the Soubrette page it says Britney is a Lyric Soprano</p>
<p>Can somebody please gaurd Britney's vocal profile i used sources to back up my information and people are still messing with it and the stuff they are putting in there is stupid like Soubrette with Lyric Soprano range. WTF! she's a lyric soprano! They also keep changing her lowest note to Db3 when it is C#3! Also the song is called "I Was Born To Love You"</p>
<p>Look, I'm a big fan of Britney and a big fan of vocals. Britney does not have a 3-octave range, nor is she a soprano. If you listen to her live peformances (when they're live, that is), you can see that there is struggle when she tries to get up there. There's nothing wrong with Britney's range. It's just fine for a soubrette. The sources you cited would be fine if it had the notes written for the vocals. The notes on those music sheets are only for the music. It doesn't count. Her highest note is somewhere around a G5. I'll have to go through her music again and find it. Where exactly does she hit the C#3 in Oops? I can't find it. Also, there is no song by Spears called "I Was Born to Love You" - that's like a mix of her songs "I Was Born to Make You Happy" and "I Will Still Love You" <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.160.116.44.html" title="User:69.160.116.44">69.160.116.44</a> (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.160.116.44_3cab.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.160.116.44">contribs</a>) 09:04, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>If it's really that frustrating to be unable to find that bit on the talk page and having to look at the history to find out what happened, let me summarize: A lot of people think that Britney's vocal range is either big or small, either 2 or 2.5 or 2 11/12 or 3 octaves, and that her low note is either C3 or E3 or something else, and her high note is either B5 or something lower than that.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As it stands it's pretty clear that none of the editors modifying that bit know what her range is (since even the high and low sides can't agree among themselves as to how high or low it is).

 Britney has a larger range than most singers in her vocal class (Soubrette) do. 
 She is able to surpass the restriction of F5 and is able to hit notes as high as G5 and A5 which most in her category cannot. 
 Spears can also hit lower notes than A3 and is able to hit notes like F3 and E3 with relative ease. 
 She arguably has the biggest range of any soubrette in contemporary music. 
 Britney is also able to sing in Middle voice, <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsetto.html" title="Falsetto">Falsetto</a> Voice and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_Voice_aa2a.html" title="Head Voice">Head Voice</a>.

<pre>
  *She hits notes A3, D4, E4 and B4 in her song "Lucky".
  *She hits note C5 in her song "Sometimes".
  *She hits note G4 in her songs "<a href="../../../f/r/o/From_The_Bottom_Of_My_Broken_Heart_8b0e.html" title="From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart">From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart</a>" and "<a href="../../../s/t/r/Stronger.html" title="Stronger">Stronger</a>".

<p>It looks like according to her sheet music her highest note is C6 in the song (I Was Born To Love You) and her lowest note is C#3 in (Oops...I Did It Again)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Her range is incorrect,this music sheet only told us the overall range of the song which is come from Guitar/Piano/Voice.It's not just her vocal range. In music,voice has been considered as one of the instruments.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually no her range isn't incorrect it tells you the range of the Piano/Guitar then it tells you the singing range of the song. It's sheet music. Its telling you the range of the song in Guitar, Piano then it tells you the notes that are hit in the song.</p>
<p>Why is Britney not credited on allmusic.com for the "I Was Born To Love You?" Eric Carmen does indeed sing this song, but it makes no mention of it being a duet. The album that the song's on was released in 1998 as well, and Britney's first single didn't get released until the end of 1998. This all seems to point to the fact that Britney didn't sing this song. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.2.100.53 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.2.100.53.html" title="User talk:24.2.100.53">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.2.100.53_d0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.2.100.53">contribs</a>) 19:13, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Then why is Britney credited for performing the song? Performed by: Eric Carmen, Britney Spears <a href="http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0035060&amp;bookmark=2" class="external free" title="http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0035060&amp;bookmark=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0035060&amp;bookmark=2</a></p>
<p>I Was Born To Love You by Eric Carmen and Andy Goldmark performed by Britney Spears</p>

<p>I do believe that Britney has demonstrated a 2.5 to 3 octave range on her recordings, but I am a big Britney Spears fan, and I have never heard of her singing a song entitled I Was Born To Love You, let alone her singing a duet with Eric Carmen. Allmusic has been around since 1991 and their website's been running since 1995, and their reviews are used by a variety of sources, such as MSN. I would consider them more reliable than a website selling sheet music. While there probably is plenty of good information on that website, there's probably some errors too. Plus, has any Britney Spears fan visiting this area ever heard of her singing this song before now? The only thing I can think of is someone mixed it up with I Will Still Love You, as mentioned above, which is a duet with a male artist that has love in the title. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.2.100.53 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.2.100.53.html" title="User talk:24.2.100.53">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.2.100.53_d0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.2.100.53">contribs</a>) 06:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Weither she is a Lyric Soprano or a Soubrette</span></h2>
<p>it is clearly impossiable for Britney to be a Soubrette with her range. Soubrettes can only sing from A3-F5 Britney can sing from C#3-C6 it insulting and wrong for her to be classified that way when she obviously isn't!</p>
<p>Also my source clearly says in Oops...!I Did It Again that she hits note C#3 not Db3 like the person keeps changing it.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? C#3 and Db3 is the same note.</p>
<p>Overall she is a Lyric Soprano it even says that on the Soubrette page!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>C3-C6 is 3 octave full but her lowest note (C#3) is 0.5note higher than C3 ,So she her range is about 2.9 octave not that 3.1 like someone said.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From the soubrette page,A lyric voice is stronger and heavier than a true soubrette, which is the lightest female voice. <b>The soubrette does its best singing in the octave between Middle C and High C or D.</b> Any higher and the voice is well into high head voice. It also <b>has no great depth in the lower register</b>, since the vocal folds are nearly always small and soprano in stature and the person slight and very young. <b>Many times a soubrette can sound so weak as if any change in vocal dynamic would cause the singer to crack.Range isn't a soubrette strong point.</b>---&gt;&gt; The definition of Brtiney Spears.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>__________________________________ It should be noted that both Cotrubas and Spears can be classified as lyric sopranos, as they have the range to execute the high lofty notes most soubrettes do not reach.----&gt; There it says on the soubrette page Britney is a Lyric Soprano. Emma Bunton and Jessica Simpson are Lyric Sopranos and Emmas Highest note is B5 while Jessica's is G6 Are you telling Me hitting C6 doesn't qualify her to be a Lyric Soprano when Emma Bunton can hit B5 and be Qualfifed as a Lyric Soprano!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please Rachelle can hit F7 but she is Contralto because her tessitura is fitting for the Contralto. And Emma'highest note is F6 in <i>Something Kinda Funny</i>.

<dd>According to Emma Buntons page her highest note is Bb5 until you changed it. According to her musicsheet she has a song called "I Was Born To Love You" and the highes note there is C6. It is a duet with Eric Carmen and Britney. check the site</dd>

<p>OK.It's my fault.Let me ask you something, what wrongs if she is classified as Mezzo.It'just range.Being soprano is not superior than others.</p>
<p>Theres not a problem but she is only one note away from a whistle register i think thats soprano material. Also britney's voice isnt as dark as a mezzo-soprano's is. Whitney and Janet have darker voice then Britneys while Britneys voice is lighter like Jessica's and Emma's</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue#Vocal_Profile" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue#Vocal_Profile" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue#Vocal_Profile</a> I think Britney has smoky tone than Kylie.But Kylie is Lyric Mezzo,I think Britney should be classified like her.</p>
<p>Yeah thats true Kylie and Britney do sound similar. But according to the Soubrette page Britney and Ilena are Lyric Soprano's.</p>
<p>I think that Britney should be classified as a lyric mezzo soprano, because her range used to be from E3 to B5 or A5(2.5 octaves for those of you who don't understand what an octave is) on the page before everyone started changing that part of the page every 10 minutes. A typical vocal range for a soprano is from C4 to A5, and for a mezzo soprano from A3 to F5, and while Britney can hit notes and sing in ways similar to both vocal ranges, she usually sings in a smokier tone as mentioned above. The claims about her being a soubrette are also very changeable. See the problem is that while Britney sometimes sings like a mezzo-soprano, she usually sings like a soubrette in her recordings. It reminds me of how Ashanti is said to have an incredible voice but that she doesnt ever sing with it, instead choosing to use a very lightweight voice. This also applies to Janet Jackson. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.2.100.53 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.2.100.53.html" title="User talk:24.2.100.53">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.2.100.53_d0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.2.100.53">contribs</a>) 19:40, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Yeah Britney sings in a lower tone with songs but she also sings in a light voice in her latest cd "In The Zone" but she sang smoker in her early recordings like those from her earlier records Baby and Oops. Then she used her lighter voice with her albums Britney and In The Zone. So do we disregard her light voice and only recognize her Dark voice or do we say she has a lighter voice? what do we classify her as since she sings both ways. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.49.12.253 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.49.12.253.html" title="User talk:68.49.12.253">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.49.12.253_b3f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.49.12.253">contribs</a>) 19:48, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Looking back now, Britney should be considered a lyric soprano rather than a lyric mezzo. For instance while Mariah Carey can sing deeper than some male vocalists,and often has a smoky tone to her voice, she is still classified as a soprano. Britney has lately been singing in a lighter voice as mentioned above so she should be a soprano. She shouldn't be considered a soubrette however. If Ashanti and Janet Jackson can be called Lyric Sopranos then Britney certainly can as well. Janet's talk page doesnt once mention any disputes about her voice, which she has been in a soubrette style since her album All For You was released. One person disputed Ashanti's range on her talk page, expressing doubt that she could hit a G6, which is justified as this quite likely talented singer hasnt demonstrated the talent she has on any of her records. Yet the claim about her voice is accepted. If these two can be qualified as sopranos or mezzos without any dispute, and if one of them has barely any recorded proof to back up these claims(Ashanti), then why cant Britney, who has demonstrated a soprano or mezzo voice in several songs, as well as in her movie Crossroads, not qualify as a mezzo or soprano? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 24.2.100.53 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.2.100.53.html" title="User talk:24.2.100.53">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.2.100.53_d0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.2.100.53">contribs</a>) 07:40, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I Was Born To Love You Isn't A Britney Spears Song!!!</span></h2>
<p>Has anybody hear ever heard of Britney singing a song called I Was Born To Love You, or a duet with Eric Carmen? There is no recorded evidence to support that she has, allmusic.com lists this as a song by Eric Carmen alone, and any Britney fan can tell you that they have never heard of her singing this. She does have a duet with a male recording artist (Don Philip) entitled I Will Still Love You and that song is on her first album. There seems to be nothing to support the fact that Britney ever sang this song, save for a page at musicnotes.com that says she has, but is this source truly as reliable as allmusic? Britney never sang this song, and therefore it can't be used for her vocal profile. I think she has between 2.5 to 3 octaves, but I'm not going to embellish how big her range is just so that she looks better. Range doesnt mean too much. Celine Dion only has 2.5 octaves to her range, and she is consistently rated about the best singers of all time. Basically I'm trying to say as a Britney fan myself, let's not lie to make Britney look better. She's accomplished a lot in her life, and whether or not she has a 2 or 3 octave range wont diminish what she's done in her life.24.2.100.53 20:23, 18 July 2005 (UTC)--- i think the song it was referring to was "born to make you happy"</p>
<p>Either way she has a 3 octave range. C#3-B5 is 3 octaves and so is C#3-C6 the only difference is C6 is a higher note.</p>
<p>SOMEBODY HELP US PLEASE!!! This is getting so frustrating! I am a huge Britney Spears fan and her range is important to me, and despite what many people think, she is a very skilled vocalist (when she wants to be) but has simply embraced the simplicty of her song arrangements and has not paid much attention to her singing like Christina and others. That doesn't mean she is not able. I think we need to look at everything she has ever sung from Mickey Mouse Club and before to the present! Live...studio...movies and TV! And finalise this information. Britney, according to my musical knowledge, is not a soubrette! And the quality of her voice varies from album to album.</p>
<p>Britney has demonstrated a 2.5 octave range in her recordings. Her lowest note is a E3 in Do Somethin' and her highest note is a B5 in Lucky. However she probably does have a wider range, as in shows about her on tv people always say she has a remarkable voice. However, she hasn't demonstrated this probable talent on her albums. Many of the other artists have demonstrated this on their albums. What I meant earlier was just that because she hasn't shown all of her talent doesnt mean that she doesnt have it. I am a huge Britney fan as well.24.2.100.53 06:25, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually Britney has hit note C#3 in Oops...I Did It Again and has hit B5 in her song I Will Still Love You her duet with Don Phillip.</p>
<p>Manolito Mystiq: About the C#3 and Db3 thing. As many have mentioned, enharmonically they're exactly the same note. It's because the song is written in C#m, that it says C#3 in the sheet music. If it's still hard to grasp. Simply play C minor on your piano (C Eb G). Then play D minor (D F A). And now play C# minor and Db minor. Although if you write it down notationwise, they're respectively C# E G# and Db Fb Ab (remember I lowered the chord from Dm to Dbm, so EVERY note is lowered) and C# = Db, E = Fb, G# = Ab. Now if the song 'wasn't' played on equal temperament measures, then yes, the C# is a littlelittlelittle lower than the Db: <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/index.html</a> But it IS, so here they're exactly the same.</p>
<p>And the fach of one person is better determined by their timbre, than their range. There are many tenors for instance who are classified as bariton's because they cannot reach for the high tenor range. But the reason for that is that they do not have completely trained their voices (yet). Also there where the power, the flexibility truly outshines is part of classifying one's range. I mean if you look at Mariah Carey. She can go as low as a Bariton range, but she's definitely not a bariton, obviously (heh, she's female). Tenor then? Alto, Mezzo? No, definitely soprano, because her POWER is there. It's the same as an instrument. A bass guitar can hit the exact same note as a regular guitar. It's still a bass guitar. EVEN if you lower the tunings of the guitar to that of a bass guitar, it wouldn't be the same. The tonal quality is very different. Not only that, a complete determination of a fach is classicaly based. Mariah Carey for instance can go very low, but relatively speaking they're worthless in Classical or Opera music, because in Opera you're not amplified.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why Britney Spears is a soubrette</span></h2>
<p>Britney is an example of a soubrette under the guidelines of her singing style (which is what a soubrette is based on), most of the others are classified (read: lumped in) because of a lack of range. To sing that softly, and mellowly, and stay melodic without cracking isn't a cake walk. Aaliyah should also properly be classified as a soubrette, but many would consider that heinous because of her rich lower register. A soubrette isn't a vocal class or fach like the traditional lines of soprano, mezzo (itself subject to occasionally scrutiny as a fach) or alto. The classification deals with the tone, pitch, and volume of a voice. In short it is more a style than a true fach. Britney's voice is soft, mellow, yet every melodic and sweet. One listen to her song Everytime and you can hear why she fits the profile of a soubrette <b>perfectly</b>. The lines of vocal classification are blurry. Being a soubrette doesn't mean you are totally incapable of vocal altitude, just where the voice prefers to be. For example, Blu Cantrell is considered an alto. The alto's high note is considered to be the F or G above High C (F or G under Soprano C). <b>OK!</b>. She can (and has demonstrated in Waste My Time) the ability to execute a pitch well in whistle register. The high (or low note) of a person is individualized. The vocal fach is a guideline, not a militaristic maximum. <a href="../../../i/l/e/Ileana_Cotruba%C5%9F_bb2e.html" title="Ileana Cotrubaş">Ileana Cotrubaş</a> is a great operatic example of a soubrette in the classical sense. She however was capable of coloratura. So Britney can (and is) both a lyric soprano and a soubrette. Many, many people are capable of sing more than one vocal fach (Pharrell Williams: countertenor and baritone), Usher (baritone and tenor), Mariah (alto, mezzo, soprano, even tenor if she really wanted). So yes, you can classify her EASILY as a lyric soprano, but because she fits the profile of a soubrette so well, that is why she should be classified as a soubrette. There is no shame to her being classified as such. Britney, like Ilena have the unique ability to truly sing in this genre. Just as it takes a skill to belt or carry notes well into the ozone layer, it takes a special gift to sing so softly in a tatering-like style, not crack, and STILL sound melodic.</p>
<p>If it were strictly up to me, the only people in the Soubrette category would be Pebbles, Nicole Parker (barely), Ciara, Ilena, and Britney. Hilary Duff is too brassy to be a soubrette in the sense of style. So is J. Lo. And Lumidee couldn't carry a tune if she moved it with a dump truck. So they only quality as a soubrette because of their <b>lack</b> of range, and <i><b>NOT</b></i> because of their great singing style, like Ilena or Britney.</p>

<p>I agree with you on the fact that on most of her music Britney sings like a soubrette soprano. However, in my opinion the voice she sings in her movie Crossroads is definately not a soubrette voice. She sounds wonderful in that movie, but her voice sounds much smokier, much more rich, and far more deep than on her recordings. It sounds heavy to me,not light like on her records. This is what confuses me most.</p>
<p>How about we just say she is a lyric soprano with Soubrette capabilities.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No complaints from me, but Britney fits the soubrette profile better. She can sing in another style, which any singer of true talent can do, but she fits the bill in the <i><b>proper</b></i> definition of soubrette. I also think the picture of her on the soubrette page should be restored, as she is the definition of a soubrette. Think about Mya. She is a lyric voice. She could be agrued into the soubrette category. But she occasionally synthesized a brassy, more dramatic voice. She just doesn't LIVE there. Blu Cantrell can hit whistle register notes, but she doesn't LIVE there. Britney doesn't LIVE in the brassier, heavier vocals. She lives in the world of the soubrette. Vocal classification is very individualized. The will always be a good debate. Tamia is classified as an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alto.html" title="Alto">alto</a>, I say she is a mezzo. When Elisabeth Schwarzkopf started training to sing, her voice coach thought she was a mezzo soprano. Her mother took her to another coach who immediately saw her as a coloratura, which she is popular and known for today. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 13:57, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually Britney hits F5 in "Toxic" you can go to britney's discography and its say so. She hits note G5 in her reality Tv Show "Choatic" in episode 4 "Magic Happens" where she mimics Opera and seranades the city. also i would be more then happy to lend my sources of sheet music as a source for Britney's high and low notes. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 68.49.12.253 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.49.12.253.html" title="User talk:68.49.12.253">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.49.12.253_b3f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.49.12.253">contribs</a>) 16:58, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</small> 68.49.12.253 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.49.12.253.html" title="User talk:68.49.12.253">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.49.12.253_b3f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.49.12.253">contribs</a>)</p>

<dd>I just read over the article, and it seems to be pretty NPOV to me. I don't see anywhere in the article where she is claimed to be a "great pop star"... As for the controversy over the bad sexual image, I can see where one may find the fact that her public image is described as "raunchy" a bit opinionated, but the descriptions all work well with what's trying to be described in the passage. I really don't see any problem with the article at the moment. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriggy_7016.html" title="User:Triggy">Triggy</a> 07:23, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is most definitely POV. It definitely reads like a fan wrote it, not like a measured encyclopedia entry. There are many, many people who dislike her brand of sexuality (but such a <i>good</i> Christian girl) and dislike "her" music even more (considering she doesn't write her own music, she's hardly an original artist). - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:57, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For your information,<a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a>, if you want to call out someone, make sure that your personal feelings do not get in the way of facts. Britney Spears does indeed write her own lyrics and even arranges the vocals and music. If you researched a little before you wrote, you would see that you are printing lies, and furthermore, your label of hardly being an original artist is strictly opinion. However, seeing as you wrote, "considering she doesn't write her own music, she's hardly an original artist," when she does in fact write her own material, you are simply describing her as a highly original artist. In my opinion (notice I clearly stated), any artist who creates music is original, be it for the way the sing (which does not necessarily have to sound amazing), the way the write, the way they market themselves, etc. They can do all or one. And it would be wise for <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicardoC_3810.html" title="User:RicardoC">RicardoC</a> to think about what he's writing, for it is a FACT that Britney Spears is an iconic pop star, whether you like it or not. It's true. Just look at the way she influenced popular culture with her music, videos, products (Curious, anyone?), and life in general. People claim to hate her yet lead similar lifestyles. They call her trashy while smoking and shoveling down Cheetos in a pair of pocket-peekers. Because of Britney Spears, the "perfect people" (the people who look down on those who are like them or even unlike them, but maybe don't get dolled up every day) of the world have come to reveal a side of undeniable hypocrisy. Just because you have issues of accepting her music does not give you authority to tell other people not to listen to it. Music does not have to be what YOU want it to be, and you would not be complaining if she were not the tremendous icon that she is. You don't have to spoil everything with your barbaric vandalism just because you loathe her. But you, another "perfect person," would never be able to accomplish half of what she did in a fifty-year career. If her voice is so terrible, then surely you could sing better. If she is so trashy, then surely you would be in a dress or tuxedo every living hour of the day as the paparrazi hunt you down. The girl has a right to make her our life choices, just as you do. Please choose to go against the trend of the ever-popular "perfect person" and let her go about her business. You don't have to support her, but why not leave her alone? By the way, I'm not saying this in an angry tone. You don't have to try to trash everything with her name on it. Doesn't that make you a smaller person? What are you accomplishing? Nothing. So keep your personal problems with her out in the street, and write facts only please. Or at least post were your opinions are. For that I will never criticize you, unless you again post out of hatred. I'm sorry if I offended you by posting your usernames. Again though, don't just edit my comment because you're mad at me. Instead, post a new comment directly after this one.

<p>This is complete crap, there are many performers who do equally or more physically intensive acts and sing too.

<p>I disagree. What other group sings live while dancing as technically, atheletically and as fastly as she does without having some form of back up vocals? There are tons of artist that do it (lip sync) when they dance. No its not our job to justify it but i think if theres going to be critism of lip syncing then we need to list both sides.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Point taken. However, Destiny's Child, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, TLC, N Sync (including Justin Timberlake and his solo venture) and Backstreet Boys are a few artists who dance just as much as Britney and <i>rarely</i> lip-sync, if ever. No one is making Britney have a dance troupe for every show that she does. Perhaps she could show more growth as an artist by taking some voice lessons and singing live on her tour.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All of the artists you have mentioned have used some type of prerecorded vocals. Which could be seen as lip syncing. Destiny's Child has lip synced there single "Lose My Breath" and have used Reverb and prerecorded vocals in there performences of "Soilder" on saturday night live. Beyonce has used prerecorded vocals in performences of Crazy In Love and Baby Boy on the VMA's and several other award shows. Christina Aguilera doesn't dance as much as Britney and Madonna has been caught several times using guide vocals in her performences. Nsync and Backstreet Boys (Justin solo included) have lip synced many times in various performences weither in concert or on TRL performences. I have never seen TLC live so i can't comment on them. But there are alot of artists that lip sync to there songs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>How the crap would you sing Toxic and not dance? I think it's the show that matters period... It'd be boring to just be sitting on a stool singing a dance song.</p>
<p>Christina half dances, Madonna only dances intensly during the parts when she is not singing (and when she does dance and sing, you can clearly hear the strain on her voice), also, madonna does uses a pre-recorded vocal track for some songs. Destiny's Child don't dance as much a Britney...plus, they also use pre-recorded vocal tracks. Nobody mentioned Kylie Minogue, but when Kylie performs live, she barely dances at all, and just moves around while the dancers dance around her.</p>
<p>I disagree Destiny's Child sing the leads to their songs all most all the time. And if they ahve backing tracks theys ing over them too. Beyonce didn't even have a mic at the VMAs and was obviously not tryna fool ppl. She sings live mostly. TLC mostly ssang and rapped lived. And if you can't sing and dance at the same time tone down the dancing on ur part a little. The backstreet boys dance and sing i kno. Christina Aguilera sings and dance maybe not asmuch as Britney but she does enough so that she can sing and dance. I think that Britney could sing and dance at the same time if she wanted. I honestly think she's a dancer more than a singer.</p>

However, it's use at the top, would be more doubtful. Generally, copyrighted images (like <a href="../../../i/n/t/Image%7EInthezone.JPG_e645.html" title="Image:Inthezone.JPG">Image:Inthezone.JPG</a>) should not be used, if public-domain options exist, even if they qualify as fair use. Most other articles, are much smaller bios, and there really aren't large separate sections, so that's no a great comparison. Also, the fact other articles do something, doesn't mean it's a good idea, since other articles have also had copyrighted images suddenly deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 23:36, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>'...Baby One More Time' and 'Toxic' are certainly pop classics and 'Oops!...

<li>On May 14, 2006, Spears was photographed driving in Malibu in her new convertible Mini with her 8-month-old son, Sean, strapped into a forward-facing car seat. It is strongly recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics that, "All infants should ride rear-facing until they have reached at least 1 year of age and weigh at least 20 pounds. That means that if your baby reaches 20 pounds before her first birthday, she should remain rear-facing until she turns 1." [2] California Highway Patrol spokesman Tom Marshall said that, "It's far safer if the seat is facing backwards to avoid head-on injuries and whiplash in case of a collision." Since CHP officers did not actually witness Spears driving with Sean facing the wrong way, they would not consider citing her. Spears' rep released a statement saying, "There is no law in California requiring rear-facing car seats. In fact, there are only ten states that require a child to be in a rear-facing car seat, and in two of those states it is not required if the infant is more than 20 lb. Britney's son Sean weighs over 20 lb."</li>

<dd>I don't know, but I put it in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_products_3d1e.html" title="Britney Spears products">products</a> page, each one has it's own small article. Would that be enough?? Maybe we should make a small reference in Bio section. We are currently trying to make this article smaller. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 19:55, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it should be put back the way it was, under the 2004/2006 section within the article. Anything's better than more subsections, as one of the pending tasks for this article is to get rid of them. 70.52.231.91 22:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
