<p>The NF was founded on February 7, 1967, under the chairmanship of <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._K._Chesterton_3d96.html" title="A. K. Chesterton">A. K. Chesterton</a>, a cousin of the novelist <a href="../../../g/2E/k/G.K._Chesterton_e29d.html" title="G.K. Chesterton">G.K. Chesterton</a> and former leader of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Empire_Loyalists_4c92.html" title="League of Empire Loyalists">League of Empire Loyalists</a> (LEL). Its purpose was to oppose <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration.html" title="Immigration">immigration</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiculturalism.html" title="Multiculturalism">multiculturalist</a> policies in Britain, and multinational agreements such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> or the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation_7a5c.html" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a> as replacements for bilateral agreements between nations. The new movement brought the LEL into permanent coalition with the 1960s incarnation of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_%281960s%29_c21c.html" title="British National Party (1960s)">British National Party</a> and a third of the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_Preservation_Society_6d44.html" title="Racial Preservation Society">Racial Preservation Society</a> led by Robin Beauclair (the remainder of the RPS—led by Dr David Brown—joined its house political party, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Party_%28UK%2C_1966%29_d0b7.html" title="National Democratic Party (UK, 1966)">National Democratic Party</a>). There was a ban on <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> groups being allowed to join the party, but members of John Tyndall's neo-Nazi <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Britain_Movement_3b41.html" title="Greater Britain Movement">Greater Britain Movement</a> joined as individual members to circumvent the ban.</p>
<p>The NF grew during the 1970s and had as many as 20,000 members by 1974. It did particularly well in local elections and polled 44% in <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deptford%2C_London_1dbe.html" title="Deptford, London">Deptford, London</a> (with a splinter group), almost beating the incumbent <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> candidate, who only won due to the split in the vote. It came third in three <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">parliamentary</a> <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-elections</a>. In only one of these instances—the Newham by-election of 1975 (where the candidate was former <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain_368e.html" title="Communist Party of Great Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> candidate Mike Lobb)—NF outperformed the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberals</a>.</p>
<p>Its electoral base largely consisted of <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue-collar.html" title="Blue-collar">blue-collar</a> workers and the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-employment.html" title="Self-employment">self-employed</a> who resented immigrant competition in the labour market. The party also attracted a few disillusioned <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservatives</a>, who gave the party much needed electoral expertise and respectability. The Conservatives came particularly from the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Monday_Club_21bd.html" title="Conservative Monday Club">Conservative Monday Club</a> group within the Conservative Party that had been founded in hostile reaction to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s "Winds Of Change" speech. The NF fought on a platform of opposition to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, support for <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionists_%28Ireland%29_90f2.html" title="Unionists (Ireland)">Ulster loyalism</a>, opposition to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Community_18c5.html" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a>, and the compulsory <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repatriation.html" title="Repatriation">repatriation</a> of new <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> immigrants that were able to come over to Britain because of its unique passport system of the period that allowed Commonwealth citizens to Britain as equal citizens.</p>
<p>A common sight in the 1970s, the NF was well-known for its noisy <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonstration_%28people%29.html" title="Demonstration (people)">demonstrations</a>, particularly in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, where it often faced <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-fascism.html" title="Anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> protestors from opposing groups, including the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Marxist_Group_e3d5.html" title="International Marxist Group">International Marxist Group</a> and later the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Workers_Party_%28Britain%29_d2ca.html" title="Socialist Workers Party (Britain)">SWP</a> supported <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Anti-Nazi League">Anti-Nazi League</a>. Opponents of the National Front claimed it to be a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Fascist_ab97.html" title="Neo-Fascist">neo-Fascist</a> organization, and its activities were opposed by anti-racist groups such as <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searchlight_Magazine_ecca.html" title="Searchlight Magazine">Searchlight</a>.</p>
<p>The NF was led at first by Chesterton, who left under a cloud after half of the directorate (led by the NF's major financer, Gordon Marshall - also known as Gordon Brown) moved a vote of no confidence in him. He was replaced in 1970 by the party's office manager <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_O%27Brien_%28UK_politician%29_3f55.html" title="John O'Brien (UK politician)">John O'Brien</a>, a former Conservative and supporter of <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch_Powell_475e.html" title="Enoch Powell">Enoch Powell</a>. O'Brien however left when he realised the NF's leadership functions were being systematically taken over by the former <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Britain_Movement_3b41.html" title="Greater Britain Movement">Greater Britain Movement</a> members in order to ensure the party was really being run by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyndall_%28politician%29_8d7b.html" title="John Tyndall (politician)">John Tyndall</a> and his deputy <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Webster_17d0.html" title="Martin Webster">Martin Webster</a>.

<p>The NF's success in the 1973 West Bromwich by-election shocked many when the NF candidate finished third on 16%, and saving his deposit for the only time in NF history. This result was largely due to the candidate <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Webster_17d0.html" title="Martin Webster">Martin Webster</a>'s own adopted 'chummy' persona for the campaign as "Big Mart", and the NF flooding the areas with hired coachloads of supporters over the four weeks of the by-election at the party's expense. The party thereafter enjoyed respectable results, even if it could not win any seats. The NF's only 'elected' councillor won in a by-election for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrickfergus.html" title="Carrickfergus">Carrickfergus</a> Town Council in Northern Ireland in 1975 when the only other candidate dropped out (there was also the temporary defection of two Conservative Councillors in Wandsworth, London, one of whom—Athlene O'Connell—was later accused of failing to have ever severed her NF links).</p>
<p>In 1974, the <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_film.html" title="Documentary film">documentary</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Week_%28Thames_Television_TV_series%29_46b4.html" title="This Week (Thames Television TV series)">This Week</a></i> exposed the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> pasts (and continued links with <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> from other countries) of Tyndall and Webster. This resulted in a stormy annual conference two weeks later, where Tyndall was booed with chants of "Nazi! Nazi!" when he tried to make his speech. This led to the leadership being passed to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populism.html" title="Populism">populist</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kingsley_Read_30b5.html" title="John Kingsley Read">John Kingsley Read</a>. A standoff between Read and his supporters (such as <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Painter_d691.html" title="Roy Painter">Roy Painter</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Pirie_b153.html" title="Denis Pirie">Denis Pirie</a>) and Tyndall and Webster followed, leading to a temporary stand-still in NF growth. Before long, Read and his supporters were forced out by intimidation tactics of Tyndall's Honour Guard, and Tyndall returned as leader. Read formed the short-lived <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_%28UK%2C_1976%29_4b83.html" title="National Party (UK, 1976)">National Party</a>, which won two council seats in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn.html" title="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> in 1976.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Front_1140.html" title="Edit section: 1979: decline and fall">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1979: decline and fall</span></h3>
<p>1979 was a disastrous year for the National Front. One view is that the rise to prominence of the newly reinvigorated <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> was a factor. Thatcher's tough right-wing stance on <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration.html" title="Immigration">immigration</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_and_order_%28politics%29.html" title="Law and order (politics)">law and order</a> caused the NF's support to haemorrhage. Many ex-<a href="../../../t/o/r/Tories.html" title="Tories">Tories</a> returned to the fold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a rash move, Tyndall insisted in using the party's funds to nominate extra candidates so the NF would be standing in 303 seats in order to give the impression of growing strength. This brought the party to the verge of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> when all the deposits were lost. Most of the 'candidates' were candidates in name only, and did no <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electioneering.html" title="Electioneering">electioneering</a> whatsoever.</p>
<p>Tyndall's leadership was challenged by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Fountaine_011f.html" title="Andrew Fountaine">Andrew Fountaine</a> after the disaster. Although Tyndall saw off the challenge, Fountaine and his followers split from the party to form the NF <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_Movement_b067.html" title="Constitutional Movement">Constitutional Movement</a>. The influential <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester.html" title="Leicester">Leicester</a> branch of the NF also split around this time, leading to the formation of the short lived <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Democratic_Party_0f74.html" title="British Democratic Party">British Democratic Party</a>. In the face of these splits, Tyndall was expelled and replaced as leader by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Brons_0ca1.html" title="Andrew Brons">Andrew Brons</a>. Tyndall formed his own New National Front, which was forced by court action to change its name. Tyndall renamed the NNF the "<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a>", which has since pushed out the NF as the dominant nationalist party in Britain (ironically, Tyndall and his acolytes had been banned from the original BNP).</p>
<p>Front deputy leader <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Webster_17d0.html" title="Martin Webster">Martin Webster</a> claimed two decades later that the activities of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Anti-Nazi League">Anti-Nazi League</a> played a key part in the NF's collapse at the end of the 1970s, but this claim runs contrary to events: for the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Nazi_League_1aa5.html" title="Anti-Nazi League">Anti-Nazi League</a> collapsed in early 1979 amid claims of financial impropriety, with former celebrity supporters such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Clough_2372.html" title="Brian Clough">Brian Clough</a> disowning the organisation. The NF stood their largest number of parliamentary candidates at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1979_73bc.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">1979 General Election</a> only a few months later. Furthermore, a damning full set of minutes of National Front Directorate meetings from late 1979 to the 1986 "Third Way" versus "Flag Group" split, deposited by former NF leader <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Harrington_eed2.html" title="Patrick Harrington">Patrick Harrington</a> in the library of the University of Southampton, revealed that during the party's post-1979 wilderness years they were in the habit of "tipping off the Reds" in order to give their activities greater credibility with the public by being attended by hordes of angry protestors. This fact was later confirmed by <a href="../../../m/i/5/MI5_b0c3.html" title="MI5">MI5</a> mole Andy Carmichael, who was <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28region%29_e8bd.html" title="West Midlands (region)">West Midlands</a> Regional Organiser for the NF during the 1990s.</p>
<p>The two most important factors in the NF collapse were <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s "swamping" speech designed to cream off the NF vote in key marginals, and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyndall_%28politician%29_8d7b.html" title="John Tyndall (politician)">John Tyndall</a>'s rash diktat on the NF standing in 303 seats.</p>

<p>The party rapidly declined during the 1980s, although it retained some support in the West Midlands and in parts of London (usually centred around the entourage of Terry Blackham). The party tried in vain to gain support in Northern Ireland on several occasions. Its opponents viewed it as a <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi-skinhead.html" title="Nazi-skinhead">racist skinhead</a> party with barely concealed <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> views — something that the Front denied. Leftist and non-political <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skinhead.html" title="Skinhead">skinheads</a> — particularly those in <a href="../../../o/i/%21/Oi%21.html" title="Oi!">Oi!</a> bands such as <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_and_the_Test_Tube_Babies_9dae.html" title="Peter and the Test Tube Babies">Peter and the Test Tube Babies</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelic_Upstarts_896a.html" title="Angelic Upstarts">Angelic Upstarts</a>, and the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Dolls_bcb0.html" title="Toy Dolls">Toy Dolls</a> — spoke out against the NF's racist views.</p>
<p>Despite popular and tabloid media perceptions (and the line propagated by <i><a href="../../../s/e/a/Searchlight_Magazine_ecca.html" title="Searchlight Magazine">Searchlight</a></i>), the NF actually lost a lot of racist skinhead support as a result of the group's support for non-white radicals such as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farrakhan_10e0.html" title="Louis Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a> and <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayatollah_Khomeini_8f1c.html" title="Ayatollah Khomeini">Ayatollah Khomeini</a>. The former supporters either moved to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a>, the rapidly declining <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Movement_9c8c.html" title="British Movement">British Movement</a>, or simply to the <i>White Noise</i> umbrella group <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_and_Honour_0854.html" title="Blood and Honour">Blood and Honour</a>. Griffin and Holland tried (unsuccessfully) to enlist the financial aid of Libya's <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_Gadaffi_3a3a.html" title="Colonel Gadaffi">Colonel Gadaffi</a>, but this was rejected once the Libyans found out about the NF's reputation as <i>fascist</i> (a third of Libya's male population was exterminated by Mussolini's <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> troops during World War II). However, the NF received five thousand copies of Gadaffi's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Green_Book_4c71.html" title="The Green Book">Green Book</a>.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The party was splitting into two halves during the 1980s. Foremost were the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Soldier_69e1.html" title="Political Soldier">Political Soldier</a> ideas of young radicals such as <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Griffin_3b7e.html" title="Nick Griffin">Nick Griffin</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Harrington_eed2.html" title="Patrick Harrington">Patrick Harrington</a>, Phil Edwards, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Holland_24ec.html" title="Derek Holland">Derek Holland</a> and, slightly later on, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Southgate_6038.html" title="Troy Southgate">Troy Southgate</a>, who were known as the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_National_Front_bfff.html" title="Official National Front">Official National Front</a> or the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Way_c043.html" title="Third Way">Third Way</a>. Under the leadership of the Political Soldiers, the NF lost interest in contesting elections, preferring a more revolutionary strategy.</p>
<p>The opposition NF <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Group_5cbe.html" title="Flag Group">Flag Group</a> contained the traditionalists loyal to Brons such as <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Anderson_%28politician%29_ae2e.html" title="Ian Anderson (politician)">Ian Anderson</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Wingfield_b08b.html" title="Martin Wingfield">Martin Wingfield</a>, Tina 'Tin-Tin' Wingfield, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Pearce_%28politician%29_1f20.html" title="Joe Pearce (politician)">Joe Pearce</a> (initially associated with the Political Soldiers) and Steve Brady, who ran candidates under the NF banner in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1987_8979.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1987">1987 general election</a>. This led to a clash at the <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vauxhall_by-election%2C_1989.html" title="Vauxhall by-election, 1989">Vauxhall by-election</a> where Patrick Harrington stood as the Official NF candidate against <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Budden_3389.html" title="Ted Budden">Ted Budden</a> for the Flag NF. The Flag faction did some political dabbling of their own, and the ideas of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Credit_67ac.html" title="Social Credit">Social Credit</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distributism.html" title="Distributism">Distributism</a> were popular for a time, but the chief preoccupation was still race relations. By 1990, the Political Soldiers had drifted away into such groups as the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Way_%28UK%29_e6c1.html" title="Third Way (UK)">Third Way (UK)</a>, and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Third_Position_3e6b.html" title="International Third Position">International Third Position</a> (ITP), leaving the Flag Group to take control. Leadership passed to <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Anderson_%28politician%29_ae2e.html" title="Ian Anderson (politician)">Ian Anderson</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Wingfield_b08b.html" title="Martin Wingfield">Martin Wingfield</a>.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the NF declined as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">BNP</a> began to grow. As a result of this, <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Anderson_%28politician%29_ae2e.html" title="Ian Anderson (politician)">Ian Anderson</a> decided to change the party name and in 1995 relaunched it as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democrats_%28UK%29_dc4f.html" title="National Democrats (UK)">National Democrats</a>. The move proved unpopular (and the name change ballot result much disputed). Over half of the 600 members continued the NF under the reluctant leadership of John McAuley. He later passed the job onto <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Holmes_7ded.html" title="Tom Holmes">Tom Holmes</a>. The National Democrats continued to publish the old NF newspaper <i>The Flag</i> for a while, and beat the NF at the <a href="../../../u/x/b/Uxbridge_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7ec0.html" title="Uxbridge (UK Parliament constituency)">Uxbridge by-election of 1997</a> in which the candidates were the respective party leaders. The NF rump launched a new paper <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flame_f4a8.html" title="The Flame">The Flame</a></i>, which is still published irregularly.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the National Front have subsequently waned, although it still exists as a small party, and fielded seven candidates at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1997_ac1f.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 General Election</a>. The party lost a number of supporters to the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Nationalist_Party_4963.html" title="White Nationalist Party">White Nationalist Party</a> when <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Morrison_793c.html" title="Eddie Morrison">Eddie Morrison</a> (who had been an NF member at various points in his career) used the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> branch of the NF to form the basis of this group and they have since saw members depart to groups such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Alliance_7a4c.html" title="Nationalist Alliance">Nationalist Alliance</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Peoples_Party_%282005%29_a2d6.html" title="British Peoples Party (2005)">British Peoples Party</a>.

<p>Singer <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrissey.html" title="Morrissey">Morrissey</a> penned a song called "National Front Disco", for the <i><a href="../../../y/o/u/Your_Arsenal_b267.html" title="Your Arsenal">Your Arsenal</a></i> album in 1992. Misinterpretation of this song resulted in much controversy, largely instigated by the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Musical_Express_a10e.html" title="New Musical Express">New Musical Express</a></i> music newspaper, with whom Morrissey had a running feud. He cleared it up in the fanzine <i>Sing Your Life</i> (Issue 5) that the song was about someone he knew who was politically naive and had gone to an "NF Disco" (one of Griffin/Anderson's many attempts to win favour with the young during their "Let A Thousand Initiatives Bloom!" phase of the 1980s).</p>
<p>NF members were mortified by the song, having lambasted both Morrissey and his previous band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smiths_5dab.html" title="The Smiths">The Smiths</a> on several occasions on the grounds of Morrissey's <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androgyny.html" title="Androgyny">sexually ambiguous</a> persona and his support for the Labour Party's <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Wedge_3f2b.html" title="Red Wedge">Red Wedge</a> project.</p>
