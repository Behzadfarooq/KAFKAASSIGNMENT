<p>All wikipedia is turning into for media figures is talking point for FAIR and Media Matters. How sad.</p>
<p>I agree. I hope the whole bloody operation falls down the memory hole. According to recent, cheerful news reports, that is now a distinct possibility. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Ties to Jack Abramoff? "Fellow" Republican? Is there any documentation that Hume is a Republican, or that he did anything other than donate to a charity?</p>
<p>And the references are all negative. Do we need 5 stories saying how liberal journalists opposed Hume getting an award?</p>
<p>I would point out that on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rather_4eca.html" title="Dan Rather">Dan Rather</a>'s article, there is a single line about some blogs considering him a liberal. Some Blogs? Conservatives have hated Rather for years for his bias. Go read the Rather article and tell me that Hume is treated fairly.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I want to make a note to the person above to please sign your posts! Anyway, I still question the amount of information against Brit Hume existing in the article and the non-existance of a counterweight of other information. The NPOV standard is held here at Wikipedia, but this article does seem mildly to have an anti-POV. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClindhartsen_3e98.html" title="User:Clindhartsen">Chris</a> 04:06, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is ludicrously weighted against its subject, in violation of NPOV policy. I have to laugh when I see <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rather_4eca.html" title="Dan Rather">Dan Rather</a>'s page in comparison. The widespread controversies are downplayed, the bias allegations are almost nonexistent.

<p>This page does look a bit as though it is sponsored by Media Matters for America. It is though, a lot less biased than it was about 18 months ago. I was pretty disgusted with how it used to be - everything Brit Hume ever might have said, thought or done that wasn't totally banal was on there. It was ridiculously long with all the salacious gossip out there. So it is much better now. It is still too critical though. Compare it also to Bill Maher's entry.</p>
<p>This is a biased article-- the solution is to add positive information to balance it. What makes people think they are contributing something meaningful by slanting their writing against someone they disagree with? Slanting is always so obvious that it rarely has the desired effect.</p>

<p>From the Manuel of Style: "There is normally no need to put quotations in italics unless the material would otherwise call for italics (emphasis, use of non-English words, etc.).... Note that italicising text can make it harder for people with visual or cognitive disabilites to read."</p>

<p>Regarding the "War in Iraq" section, a recent edit concluded with this statement: "Critics charged that Hume's statement was offensive to the families of soldiers who died during the Iraq war."</p>
<p>To state only the critics' POV is not NPOV. I have added information about noted journalists who defended Hume. Let's be neutral, shall we? "Defenders of Hume's statement included journalists Ceci Connolly of The Washington Post, Alan Colmes of Hannity &amp; Colmes, Joe Klein of Time, Tim Russert of NBC News and Juan Williams of NPR. Williams characterized the criticisms as "petty."</p>
<p>Under "Social Security reform," the following is not NPOV:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Olbermann said that that Hume and Fox News committed "premeditated, historical fraud" in distorting FDR's policy [8]; on Olberman's program, James Roosevelt, Jr., said that Hume's "outrageous distortion" of FDR "calls for a retraction, an apology, maybe even a resignation" [9]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Neutrality requires that defenders also be mentioned. To give only these critical points of view is biased. This isn't a simple black-and-white issue. In some respects, FDR's original proposal was similar to what Bush has proposed; in other respects, it is not similar. I made revisions to clarify these points.</p>

<p>This article in its present state comes off as hyper-crtical of Brit Hume, surely he has supporters as well as detractors. More importantly his work should be presented in a more NPOV fashion. The fact that he is controversial is not incorrect or disputed (at least by me) but there must be other viewpoints of his work considering his position in the Fox News Networks programming schedule. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArminius_74cf.html" title="User:Arminius">Arminius</a> 04:47, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've made some attempts to give opposing views to the critics in the controversy section. Some may say that I am giving bias out myself but I don't think so. I have merely tried to give some balance through correctives. I have tried to be objective, and non-partisan, in tone and fact. The article is still way to biased though. The media matters people have way too much influence in the account. As a suggestion for one improvement someone should find a link to the journalism award Hume won this year.

<p>But for anyone who has watched Brit Hume's broadcasts, it is quite clearly the case that he is a biased, talking-head masquerading as a journalist. He is definitely no Ted Koppel and his news presentation is full of POV. The article fairly portrays Hume. We need not bend over backwards to portray Hume in a more positive light because that would be an inaccurate portrayal if we did that.</p>
<p>--</p>
<hr />
<p>It is not obvious to anyone that Brit Hume is a talking-head masquerading as a journalist. That is an opinion and as such is not objective. Like I said, or should have said more clearly, this article was biased from the ground up. It needs to be re-written entirely. I am not going to waste my time doing so though. Some other responcible poster with better writing skills needs to. That said I am considering removing the revisions of my revisions. I need guidance on this from the authorities. This change by the unnamed poster seems like vandilism in the name of ideology. Can someone tell me what the rules are on this. I don't want to be unfair or break the rules myself. I might not even bother removing the revision revision's, because I care more about other entries, so if someone knows what the rules are please do it for me. I just don't feel right changing them immediatlly right now. I might change my mind in a few hours or weeks. Brit Hume is an acomplished and succesful, popular reporter and broadcaster. He worked at ABC for something like twenty years as a top correspondent. You may hate the evil Fox but ABC is not exactly known as very conservative. It is an admirable achievement to get top cable ratings for a hard news, political junkie type, show which Special Report is, even if it has a conservative tilt. Go get a blog if you want to attack Hume this is an encyclopedia.--Case 01:44, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Casey, what's fair on Wikipedia is to display all facets of a story on a person, event, thing, etc. When one editor/user writes from one POV, saying - for example - "Doofus McSteady was criticized for not walking his grandmother across the street yesterday" and offers no other views on the matter, it's entirely reasonable within Wikipedia to have another editor/user write "Supporters of McSteady noted that he was incapacitated with a bad back that day" or similar. In that way all views can be represented in the article, and the readers of Wikipedia can make up their own minds about what kind of person McSteady really is. Any questions regarding this can be placed on my user discussion page - I'd welcome that.

<p>Before I am assailed with charges of bias for adding some references to the Brit Hume article allow me to defend myself. The whole article is a little biased against Hume focusing mostly on criticisms, while he is a revered and respected journalist with a large following. I added the external link to Special Report and one to his national press foundation award. I put these in the list before the links to critics because the article is organized in this way.</p>
<p>I am planning to expand the first part of the article by adding an Awards section listing his awards and links to external sites and, I plan to create a heeding for his Personal Life. There is currently information under Career that is clearly about his personal life and not his career. If you object to these changes, please post specific objections.

Someone vandalized my user page in response to my post above. They claimed that Hume was not "a revered and respected journalist" and asked me to "prove it". Because it is hard to "prove" doxastic mental states of others, I will merely point to his awards and the fact that he holds one of the most powerful positions in media news. This however is not a value claim. I don't with to discuss with anyone on wikipedia whether or not Hume ought to be "a revered and respected journalist.” That is not the concern of an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The vandal also claimed that Hume is not a journalist because he has hurt the country. (Exactly "And be awware that because Brit Hume is not a journalist, he has done his country an enormous amount of damage, and ill-served us all in the process.") This makes no sense. Don't confuse fact claims with value claims. I guess that I should reiterate the point, that is made on this and the main article page, Brit Hume is controversial. He is fervently hated by some, adored, and loved by others. I will not weigh in on the issue here.</p>

<p>Wow, this article is enormously slanted against Brit Hume. Apparently, the entire focus of his career is to be controversial. It should be noted that the majority of this article is centered on disagreements of his broadcast by liberal commentators. The neutrality of this article should be disputed.</p>

<p>I reverted the addition of the following information:</p>
<p><i>(level 2 headline)Relationship between "Special Report" and The Weekly Standard</i></p>
<p><i>Commentators from The Weekly Standard are regular guests on Brit Hume's program, including panelists Charles Krauthammer and Fred Barnes. On the Thursday, December 1, 2005 addition of Special Report with Brit Hume, Hume referred to The Weekly Standard as his program's "sister publication", raising eyebrows due to the fact that the Weekly Standard is an openly partisan Republican publication.</i></p>
<p>This information was reverted for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The information is about Special Report and The Weekly Standard, subjects for which pages already exist.</li>
<li>Hume's claim is a fact. Both Fox News and The Weekly Standard are divisions of the parent company <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Corporation</a>. This is information public and widely known. In fact, the Weekly Standard wikipedia page states, in the second sentence of the article, "It(The Weekly Standard) made its debut on September 17, 1995 and is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation."</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus of this page ought not be "media watch". Rather, it should be an relevant, informative, unbiased, encyclopedia article.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECollingsworth_5cee.html" title="User:Collingsworth">Collingsworth</a> 00:27, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Brit Hume, along with the rest of Fox News, is regularly accused of Republican bias. His close working relationship to the Weekly Standard is entirely relevant because you can barely tell where the Weekly Standard ends and where Special Report begins. It is therefore relevant and going back in. It isn't about news watch, it's about Brit Hume bringing his Republican partisan publication's writers, commentators and point of view into his program. Additionaly, it is not even mentioned in the article for Special Report with Brit Hume that the Weekly Standard holds such an influence over his segment. Hence all the more reason to mention it here.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Perhaps it would be less awkward and irrelevant to come out and say that Brit Hume has been accused of bias in this article. Writing an article on wikipedia that argues for the claim that Brit Hume is biased is not in line with the purpose of wikipedia. The <b>many POVs</b> should be represented and considered. For instance, should the article mention the Weekly Standard and not National Public Radio, or Roll Call, or The Washington Post? Additionally, claiming that something, that is common knowledge, was "raising eyebrows" comes off as ignorant of the facts that wikipedia is supposed to contain.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a secret that "Brit Hume bring(s) his Republican partisan publication's writers, commentators and point of view into his program." In fact, Brit Hume introduces all commentators with their name, organization and their position within the organization before comments and opinions are stated. Anyone who watches his show or reads the article on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Report_6d47.html" title="Special Report">Special Report</a>, can see this.</p>
<p>This particular comment, the one that I reverted, is unlike the other <i>controversies</i> because it is not grounded in an opinion that Brit Hume voiced or an argument that Brit Hume made. To make the case that Brit Hume is biased, it would be more convincing to use things that he said on Special Report and on Fox News Sunday.</p>

<p>Interesting how Brit Hume is politically criticized on Wikipedia but not Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, etc. Dan Rather is criticized, but NOT for political reasons. These three have made factual errors during their career, and made political comments. My point? A more active effort exists to discredit Hume so as to discourage viewers from watching his news, than exists to discredit the other more traditional news sources with their traditional biases. Many have pointed out the NPOV here, but it is worth pointing out the motivation behind it.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then if you feel that way why don't you edit those other articles? Providing more info isn't a bad thing. There's arguably more info on, for example, South Park, then there is for George Washington, Richard Nixon, Joseph Stalin or a lot of other major topics. That's just how wikipedia works.</p>

<p>User:Starlight7777 added an external link to Media Matters, which lists what it considers controversial or biased comments made by Brit Hume. This is an excellent way to provide the critical POV of Hume without bogging down his page. It would be ludicrous to go on positing each individual comment that Media Matters might find misleading or biased, most of which are contended and would thus require the opposing POV. Perhaps, the criticisms should be generalized (and attributed to sources) for the sake of clarity and succinctness. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Is there such a thing as too much info about a person? Brit Hume is a miniscule man when considered in the history of the world. Shouldn't this entry just explain the relevant information? If one disagrees with a perceived political bias, wouldn't that be more appropriately noted on the Fox News Network page as opposed to a lengthy exposition on the Brit Hume page? This entry as it currently exists lessens the credibility of Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree. This page seems needlessly bogged down in critcisms of Hume that, quite frankly, read like press releases from MediaMatters and other leftist groups. Some effort has been made to balance those, but I really wonder whether these items are that memorable (I watch Hume frequently, and I don't remember but one instance listed). I question whether this laundry list of forgettable issues has a place in an encyclopedic article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I edited the article to remove some obvious POV problems (referring to FNC as a conservative news channel and Hume as a right wing panelist on Fox News Sunday), and added descriptive remarks about James Roosevelt Jr, whom I'm surprised hasn't posted his own bio as an article on Wikipedia.&#160;:-) Many other changes, but only to fix typos and style or wikify names and dates.<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 00:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <i>Ties to Jack Abramoff</i> section should be removed for the following reasons:</p>

<li>Hume has said that he does not know Abramoff. This section implies otherwise. (There exists a burden of proof on the part of the editor)</li>
<li>The information is vague and seemingly irrelevant. What group? What was Hume's role in this group? Why would the average reader care or need to know?</li>
<li>Not everyone with ties to Jack Abramoff is involved in a scandal as this link seems to suggest. I know a non-political person who worked with Abramoff at Preston Gates and Ellis, for instance.</li>

<p>I added two paragraphs on Hume's exclusive Cheney interview, which will go down as a very important event in Hume's career. I also added (probably not in the proper format) a link to the Hunting Incident itself, ONLY because I know someone will want to add 12 paragraphs on this event to this article, and if so, I will revert it immediately. I do have to say that I find this article to not be very chronological. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 03:42, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my opinion, the controversies in the "Controversies" section of this article are not real controversies. They are more, again in my opinion, critizisms rather than controversies. There is a difference between the two. I apologize for my early statement that I have deleted from this page where I wrote that Brit Hume Claimed to be a republican during the "night broadcast" of the 2004 election. I should'nt have wrote being that it was based on my memory. I do remember him saying it around that time but my memory might be wrong. <a href="../../../j/m/f/User%7EJmfh3733_3111.html" title="User:Jmfh3733">jmfh3733</a></p>
<p>Agreed that the "controversies" recieved no mainstream attention or outrage. They are merely criticisms and are out of place in this article</p>
<p>Controversies section should be changed.</p>
<p><br />
Ties to Jack Abramoff? "Fellow" Republican? Is there any documentation that Hume is a Republican, or that he did anything other than donate to a charity?</p>
<p>And the references are all negative. Do we need 5 stories saying how liberal journalists opposed Hume getting an award?</p>
<p>I would point out that on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rather_4eca.html" title="Dan Rather">Dan Rather</a>'s article, there is a single line about some blogs considering him a liberal. Some Blogs? Conservatives have hated Rather for years for his bias. Go read the Rather article and tell me that Hume is treated fairly.</p>

<dd>I want to make a note to the person above to please sign your posts! Anyway, I still question the amount of information against Brit Hume existing in the article and the non-existance of a counterweight of other information.

<p>I'd agree. And, it's worth noting, the most pathetic thing is the "controversy" over the remarks about negative ad. It just says he was criticized for it. Nothing more.

<p>Regarding the "War in Iraq" section, a recent edit concluded with this statement: "Critics charged that Hume's statement was offensive to the families of soldiers who died during the Iraq war."</p>
<p>To state only the critics' POV is not NPOV. I have added information about noted journalists who defended Hume. Let's be neutral, shall we? "Defenders of Hume's statement included journalists Ceci Connolly of The Washington Post, Alan Colmes of Hannity &amp; Colmes, Joe Klein of Time, Tim Russert of NBC News and Juan Williams of NPR. Williams characterized the criticisms as "petty."</p>
<p>Under "Social Security reform," the following is not NPOV:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Olbermann said that that Hume and Fox News committed "premeditated, historical fraud" in distorting FDR's policy [8]; on Olberman's program, James Roosevelt, Jr., said that Hume's "outrageous distortion" of FDR "calls for a retraction, an apology, maybe even a resignation" [9]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Neutrality requires that defenders also be mentioned. To give only these critical points of view is biased. This isn't a simple black-and-white issue. In some respects, FDR's original proposal was similar to what Bush has proposed; in other respects, it is not similar. I made revisions to clarify these points.</p>

<p>This article in its present state comes off as hyper-crtical of Brit Hume, surely he has supporters as well as detractors. More importantly his work should be presented in a more NPOV fashion.

<p>I've made some attempts to give opposing views to the critics in the controversy section. Some may say that I am giving bias out myself but I don't think so. I have merely tried to give some balance through correctives. I have tried to be objective, and non-partisan, in tone and fact. The article is still way to biased though.

<p>But for anyone who has watched Brit Hume's broadcasts, it is quite clearly the case that he is a biased, talking-head masquerading as a journalist. He is definitely no Ted Koppel and his news presentation is full of POV. The article fairly portrays Hume. We need not bend over backwards to portray Hume in a more positive light because that would be an inaccurate portrayal if we did that.</p>
<p>--</p>
<hr />
<p>It is not obvious to anyone that Brit Hume is a talking-head masquerading as a journalist. That is an opinion and as such is not objective. Like I said, or should have said more clearly, this article was biased from the ground up. It needs to be re-written entirely. I am not going to waste my time doing so though. Some other responcible poster with better writing skills needs to. That said I am considering removing the revisions of my revisions. I need guidance on this from the authorities. This change by the unnamed poster seems like vandilism in the name of ideology. Can someone tell me what the rules are on this. I don't want to be unfair or break the rules myself. I might not even bother removing the revision revision's, because I care more about other entries, so if someone knows what the rules are please do it for me. I just don't feel right changing them immediatlly right now. I might change my mind in a few hours or weeks. Brit Hume is an acomplished and succesful, popular reporter and broadcaster. He worked at ABC for something like twenty years as a top correspondent. You may hate the evil Fox but ABC is not exactly known as very conservative. It is an admirable achievement to get top cable ratings for a hard news, political junkie type, show which Special Report is, even if it has a conservative tilt. Go get a blog if you want to attack Hume this is an encyclopedia.--Case 01:44, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Casey, what's fair on Wikipedia is to display all facets of a story on a person, event, thing, etc. When one editor/user writes from one POV, saying - for example - "Doofus McSteady was criticized for not walking his grandmother across the street yesterday" and offers no other views on the matter, it's entirely reasonable within Wikipedia to have another editor/user write "Supporters of McSteady noted that he was incapacitated with a bad back that day" or similar. In that way all views can be represented in the article, and the readers of Wikipedia can make up their own minds about what kind of person McSteady really is. Any questions regarding this can be placed on my user discussion page - I'd welcome that.

The whole article is a little biased against Hume focusing mostly on criticisms, while he is a revered and respected journalist with a large following.

Someone vandalized my user page in response to my post above. They claimed that Hume was not "a revered and respected journalist" and asked me to "prove it". Because it is hard to "prove" doxastic mental states of others, I will merely point to his awards and the fact that he holds one of the most powerful positions in media news. This however is not a value claim. I don't with to discuss with anyone on wikipedia whether or not Hume ought to be "a revered and respected journalist.” That is not the concern of an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The vandal also claimed that Hume is not a journalist because he has hurt the country. (Exactly "And be awware that because Brit Hume is not a journalist, he has done his country an enormous amount of damage, and ill-served us all in the process.") This makes no sense. Don't confuse fact claims with value claims. I guess that I should reiterate the point, that is made on this and the main article page, Brit Hume is controversial. He is fervently hated by some, adored, and loved by others. I will not weigh in on the issue here.</p>

<p>I reverted the addition of the following information:</p>
<p><i>(level 2 headline)Relationship between "Special Report" and The Weekly Standard</i></p>
<p><i>Commentators from The Weekly Standard are regular guests on Brit Hume's program, including panelists Charles Krauthammer and Fred Barnes. On the Thursday, December 1, 2005 addition of Special Report with Brit Hume, Hume referred to The Weekly Standard as his program's "sister publication", raising eyebrows due to the fact that the Weekly Standard is an openly partisan Republican publication.</i></p>
<p>This information was reverted for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The information is about Special Report and The Weekly Standard, subjects for which pages already exist.</li>
<li>Hume's claim is a fact. Both Fox News and The Weekly Standard are divisions of the parent company <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_Corporation_d115.html" title="News Corporation">News Corporation</a>. This is information public and widely known. In fact, the Weekly Standard wikipedia page states, in the second sentence of the article, "It(The Weekly Standard) made its debut on September 17, 1995 and is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation."</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus of this page ought not be "media watch". Rather, it should be an relevant, informative, unbiased, encyclopedia article.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECollingsworth_5cee.html" title="User:Collingsworth">Collingsworth</a> 00:27, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Brit Hume, along with the rest of Fox News, is regularly accused of Republican bias. His close working relationship to the Weekly Standard is entirely relevant because you can barely tell where the Weekly Standard ends and where Special Report begins. It is therefore relevant and going back in. It isn't about news watch, it's about Brit Hume bringing his Republican partisan publication's writers, commentators and point of view into his program. Additionaly, it is not even mentioned in the article for Special Report with Brit Hume that the Weekly Standard holds such an influence over his segment. Hence all the more reason to mention it here.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Perhaps it would be less awkward and irrelevant to come out and say that Brit Hume has been accused of bias in this article. Writing an article on wikipedia that argues for the claim that Brit Hume is biased is not in line with the purpose of wikipedia. The <b>many POVs</b> should be represented and considered. For instance, should the article mention the Weekly Standard and not National Public Radio, or Roll Call, or The Washington Post? Additionally, claiming that something, that is common knowledge, was "raising eyebrows" comes off as ignorant of the facts that wikipedia is supposed to contain.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a secret that "Brit Hume bring(s) his Republican partisan publication's writers, commentators and point of view into his program." In fact, Brit Hume introduces all commentators with their name, organization and their position within the organization before comments and opinions are stated. Anyone who watches his show or reads the article on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Report_6d47.html" title="Special Report">Special Report</a>, can see this.</p>
<p>This particular comment, the one that I reverted, is unlike the other <i>controversies</i> because it is not grounded in an opinion that Brit Hume voiced or an argument that Brit Hume made. To make the case that Brit Hume is biased, it would be more convincing to use things that he said on Special Report and on Fox News Sunday.</p>

<p>Interesting how Brit Hume is politically criticized on Wikipedia but not Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, etc. Dan Rather is criticized, but NOT for political reasons. These three have made factual errors during their career, and made political comments. My point? A more active effort exists to discredit Hume so as to discourage viewers from watching his news, than exists to discredit the other more traditional news sources with their traditional biases. Many have pointed out the NPOV here, but it is worth pointing out the motivation behind it.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Then if you feel that way why don't you edit those other articles? Providing more info isn't a bad thing. There's arguably more info on, for example, South Park, then there is for George Washington, Richard Nixon, Joseph Stalin or a lot of other major topics. That's just how wikipedia works.</p>

<p>User:Starlight7777 added an external link to Media Matters, which lists what it considers controversial or biased comments made by Brit Hume. This is an excellent way to provide the critical POV of Hume without bogging down his page. It would be ludicrous to go on positing each individual comment that Media Matters might find misleading or biased, most of which are contended and would thus require the opposing POV. Perhaps, the criticisms should be generalized (and attributed to sources) for the sake of clarity and succinctness. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Is there such a thing as too much info about a person? Brit Hume is a miniscule man when considered in the history of the world. Shouldn't this entry just explain the relevant information?

This entry as it currently exists lessens the credibility of Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>I tend to agree. This page seems needlessly bogged down in critcisms of Hume that, quite frankly, read like press releases from MediaMatters and other leftist groups. Some effort has been made to balance those, but I really wonder whether these items are that memorable (I watch Hume frequently, and I don't remember but one instance listed).

<dd>I edited the article to remove some obvious POV problems (referring to FNC as a conservative news channel and Hume as a right wing panelist on Fox News Sunday), and added descriptive remarks about James Roosevelt Jr, whom I'm surprised hasn't posted his own bio as an article on Wikipedia.&#160;:-) Many other changes, but only to fix typos and style or wikify names and dates.<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERealkyhick_ef0f.html" title="User:Realkyhick">Realkyhick</a> 00:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps you could point to specific statements that make it biased? Simply saying "it's biased against" Hume is a meaningless criticism.</p>

<p><i>Hume helped raise money for a group run by admitted felon, Republican attorney and lobbyist Jack Abramoff. See Jack Abramoff lobbying and corruption scandal [10]</i></p>
<p>The <i>Ties to Jack Abramoff</i> section should be removed for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The information is not cited. There is no mention of Hume at the given internal link.</li>
<li>Hume has said that he does not know Abramoff. This section implies otherwise. (There exists a burden of proof on the part of the editor)</li>
<li>The information is vague and seemingly irrelevant. What group? What was Hume's role in this group? Why would the average reader care or need to know?</li>
<li>Not everyone with ties to Jack Abramoff is involved in a scandal as this link seems to suggest. I know a non-political person who worked with Abramoff at Preston Gates and Ellis, for instance.</li>
</ol>
<p>This section should either be expended to clearly explain what is the case and why it is encyclopedia worthy, (and not, as it stands, try to implicate Hume in a scandal with a guilty by association argument) or it should be deleted. Unless it is shown that the expanded information is not trivial I will delete this section.</p>

<p>This piece on Brit Hume was clearly designed to impart a particular point of view about the man and to impugn Hume's integrity as a journalist.

<p>After seeing the warning at the top of the page and seeing only the second sentence of the piece on Hume (which referrred to his draft deferrment), I was prepared to read a left-wing attack. But after getting further into the piece, I found it to be mosly balanced. It did go into his controversies at some length, but also quoted important people defending Hume. I am a Hume fan and found nothing terribly objectionable in this entry.</p>

<p>"Rather confusing?" It's less than 500 words written in the most simplistic form possible. Simple chronological facts. But, you can't deal w/ it simply because it is in one lump???</p>
<p>What better source could I possibly have than well know news reporters who witnessed the whole thing and were actually physically involved on a daily basis????</p>
<p>Your excuses for deleting the entry are BS. You just want to protect Brit from real criticism. as if the Roosevelt quote 'controversy' is actually a big deal. Do ya think social security is going to be privatized because Brit mis-quoted Roosevelt? Well China flooded America w/ 'illegal' AK-47s, and stole nuclear technology partly because Brit kept quiet.</p>

<dd>I've got two problems with this entire section:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>First, its sources, which state, <i>"-- Bill Plant, Wendall Goler and Brit Hume would verify it also. - toddouellette@mail.com"</i>. I'm not sure but I don't think "oh, and these guys would verify it also" are appropriate sources for an encyclopedia. Also, does anybody else think a source list ending in the email address signature of the subject matter of the article makes the source list (and perhaps even the entire section) dubious at best?</li>
<li>My bigger problem, though, is even if the entire incident occured as alleged, it simply isn't notable. If every demonstrator/activist who thought a member of the press did a hatchet job on "their story" was included in every press member's bio in wikipeida, you'd have no room for the bio. While Ouellette may be notable for his demonstration and meeting with the president, there is nothing notable about what Hume did in relation to him. When you google "Brit Hume" and "Todd Ouellette" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2005-09%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=%22Todd+Ouellette%22+%22brit+hume%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2005-09%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=%22Todd+Ouellette%22+%22brit+hume%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> together, you only find this wikipedia article and a topical summary of the ABC World news tonight program where Hume mentioned Oulelette. Apparently the rest of the world doesn't think Hume's actions with regard to Ouellette were notable either. The whole section is more about Ouellette (and his cause) than Hume and really smells like an excuse to be mentioned. I'm removing it. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 14:02, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Lawyer2b decided to delete the commentary about Todd Ouellette because he didn't think illegal weapon sales to the Chinese Communists was a big deal. So here it is again. Next time you delete it, at least be man enough to include your full name so readers can judge you the way you judged this entry. Don't delete it just because you can't understand what it all has to do with Brit Hume. Rupert Murdoch does business with China. Brit Hume and Wendall Goler were rewarded with cushy jobs after they kept quiet during the 1996 'election'. Certainly that deserves to be in the bio. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.163.205.147 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.163.205.147.html" title="User talk:24.163.205.147">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.163.205.147_6e74.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.163.205.147">contribs</a>).</small> The above comment was left in the actual article space.

<dd>User:24.163.205.147, both reasons you ascribe as why I deleted the section are incorrect. As I said above, I don't see how these events (even if they occurred as described) are worthy of mention in Hume's article. So Hume didn't meet with or report on Ouellette's issue the way he wanted...what's the big deal? That happens all the time in the journalism business. It sounds like the reason you think it is noteworthy is you believe it shows Hume helped covered up illegal weapons sales to China. If so, then what you need are some independent sources that state that specifically rather than try to make a case for that by simply stating what Hume did. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 13:31, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>User:24.163.205.147, I appreciate the suggestion to call Brit up. If I thought I could get through to him (and/or warrant a reply) I'd probably do it.

<p>Reading through the article as of late, I would have to say that it has definitely made some improvements from the past, including the cleaning up of some sections and addition of counter information.

<dd>Just so we're clear, I think Hume was more than partly correct and you did a great job finding this info which I would love to see included as you want in his article. That being said, though, I honestly don't know wikipedia policy allows it. The first thing is I don't think the INDCJournal can be included as a source because it is a blog. The second thing is after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research#Synthesis_of_original_research" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research#Synthesis_of_original_research" rel="nofollow">the description of "synthesis of original research"</a>, I think you might have to take out the part of your edit that says he was partly correct since the material you can quote doesn't actually mention Hume. I think, however, we can leave the actual SSA material as it stands.

<dd>You headed off to the library on a whim to check an obscure version of someone's name just to prove a point to a random IP you decided to trail for a bit? That's a little strange. When was this change first introduced into the article? I am curious as to why it seems to have been an issue all of a sudden when there are so few references to it. 129.71.73.248 23:15, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's bizarre is complaining that someone used the library to improve an article, as well as making numerous unknowable claims (headed off, on a whim, just to prove, decided to trail). If you want to know when a change was introduced, check the article's history. -- <a href="../../../j/i/b/User%7EJibal_6b94.html" title="User:Jibal">Jibal</a> 03:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
