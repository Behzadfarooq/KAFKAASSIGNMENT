<p>Wolverine is a mutant with a number of natural and artificial physiological enhancements.</p>
<p>Wolverine's primary ability is an accelerated healing factor. This enables him to heal from injuries such as multiple gunshot wounds, puncture wounds, slashes, and severe burns within moments. (These healing powers fluccuate, depending on the artistic team writing the particular comic he appears, some cases severe injuries are healed instantaneously and then in another story a similar injury takes much longer to heal with little or no explanation). It is unknown whether he can regenerate missing limbs, but he has regenerated eyes and brain tissue. He has virtual immunity to drugs, toxins, tranquilizers, and the natural fatigue poisons generated by his own body. Theoretically, large enough amounts of such destructive agents in his body could kill him, but it would require an amount far greater than what it would take to kill an ordinary human. This healing factor also retards Wolverine's aging process to an unknown degree. It has been strongly suggested by writers that he is well over 100 years old. His near immunity to the natural fatigue poisons generated by his own body grants him adequate stamina to perform at peak effeciency for several days without exhausting himself. All of Wolverine's other superhuman abilities are derived from his accelerated healing factor.</p>
<p>Wolverine also possesses superhumanly acute senses that are comparable to those possessed by certain animals, such as cats or wolves. Wolverine's eyesight enables him to see things with perfect clarity at a much greater distance than ordinary humans. His sense of hearing is only slightly less developed than that of the vigilante hero Daredevil. With concentration, Wolverine's ears are able to detect the rhythm of a normal heartbeat within a distance of 200 feet. Arguably, Wolverine's most developed sense is his sense of smell, which often aids him if tracking a specific target whether the target is organic or mechanical. His sense of smell has been developed to such a level that he is able to tell the miniscule chemical difference between items of different brands, such as deodorants, cigarettes, alcohol, etc, despite being advertised as having the same scent. His hieghtened senses are a side effect of the constant cellular regeneration of his mutant physiology.</p>
<p>Wolverine's skeleton has been completely infused or laced with an extremely rare, man made alloy known as Adamantium. Adamantium is virtually indestructible, a sufficient mass can withstand the devestating impact of multiple ground zero nuclear blasts without so much as a scratch.</p>
<p>Housed within each of his forearms are three twelve-inch long bone claws which can be extracted, at will, through the skin and tissue between the knuckles of his hands. The natural curve of these claws provides them with a natural sharpness that can rend most conventional materials like flesh, bone, wood, cinderblock, and even some kinds of metals. Wolverine's claws have also been coated with the virtually indestructible alloy and which only served to greatly enhance their natural sharpness. As a result, Wolverine's claws are capable of slicing through any known substance, with the probable exception of Adamantium itself.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wolverine's strength, agility, and reflexes are enhanced just slightly beyond a range attainable by normal human beings (or even humans in absolute peak physical condition such as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>), but they are not truly superhumanly developed as is the case with <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>. Although earlier editions of the handbook stated otherwise, The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition, issue 4, printed in 1991 clearly and explicitly states that Wolverine's strength, agility, and reflexes are in the enhanced range (just inferior to the superhuman range). The profile currently on the Marvel website correlates with this and this is the official consensus of Marvel writers.</p>
<p>An example of Wolverine's strength, which is infrequently demonstrated, can be shown in Wolverine, issue 1 of the monthly series published in 1988 when Wolverine easily hoisted half a dozen men over his head (with one arm) during a brawl and ran through a wall with them. Assuming each man wieghs an average of 150 lbs the total wieght combined with thier weaponry would be between 900 and 1000 lbs and indicates that Wolverine is capable of lifting, military pressing at least somewhere within that range. It is theorized by some writers that his enhanced strength is due to his metalic skeletal reinforcement and that without it he would not be able to lift such wieght without compromising the integrity of his bones. As with his superhuman senses, his physical aptitudes are not a seperate mutation but a logical consequence of his body's constant cellular regeneration. Wolverine's physical strength is rarely evident since he relies on a combination of raw ferocity and superb martial arts technique, rather than brute strength. Wolverine is only about half as strong as his arch enemy, Sabertooth.</p>
