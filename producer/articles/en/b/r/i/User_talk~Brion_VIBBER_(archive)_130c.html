<dd>Don't thank me too soon, the bug was my fault too.&#160;:) In the function that strips out unwanted HTML tags, there's a buglet that causes the whole process to stop dead if it found too many closing tags -- there was an extra &lt;/font&gt; tag in there which set it off. D'oh! Hopefully Jimbo will install the patch soon, but until then just make sure you have at least as many opening tags as closing tags...</dd>

<p>Fair enough. So all the text was still there in the edit mode then? If that is the case, then I owe you an apology - I should have looked first before I threw a temper-tantrum.

<p>Are you sure that Soderbergh's Solaris is remake? I heard that this will be new adaptation of the book. That's why i decided to put two Solaris (movie), one for Tarkowsky (with future intention of added wikipedia contains spoilers etc) and second for future Soderbergh. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">szopen</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I consider it a remake in that it's another movie based on the same story. I consider the recent Tim Burton <i>Planet of the Apes</i> movie to be a remake, even though it's not really closely based on the 1968 film, but both are based (loosely) on the book <i>La Planète des singes</i>. Of course, even the first movie was a remake of the book, when you think about it.&#160;:) In general I think it's preferable to keep multiple incarnations of the same thing on the same page where appropriate, particularly when there's roughly zero information on at least one of them. If and when there's a reason to separate Soderberghe's version, we can do so. --BV</dd>

<p>one more thing - could you possibly look at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislaw_Lem_1bd3.html" title="Stanislaw Lem">Stanislaw Lem</a> entry?

<dd>Yeah, as I mentioned at the bottom of <a href="../../../b/u/g/Wikipedia%7EBug_reports_020d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bug reports">wikipedia:Bug reports</a>, I accidentally broke that feature such that inter-wiki links with % signs (used for url-encoding as a hack until we move to UTF-8) are rejected.

Although I have to admit that the funniest experience I think I had at those things was on the New York subway when a guy asked us what language we were speaking: "Well, we're all really Americans, but we're speaking the international language, Esperanto!" and the guy replied, "What?

<dd>Well, I've always loved those old Twilight Zone and Outer Limits episodes, and Incubus feels just like one, <i>krom ĝia esperanteco</i>. As well it should, having been made by the same people that did The Outer Limits. For a real hoot though, run William Shatner's commentary track on the DVD sometime. Sadly, the commentary's not in Esperanto.&#160;:) --BV</dd>

<p>Nice Brion putting in the main page a link to Slovene Wikipedia. As for now I am the only one Slovene wikipedian and I do hope this will change soon, 'cause Wikipedia really means something.

<p>Hi Brion, God-of-Wiki-Tech&#160;:) Maveric said I should copy this note here because you'd be better able to help me with it. I have no idea why but I had a big problem with the Bug Report page:</p>
<p>Maybe you can help me? I'm getting very frustrated by things that don't work today and I don't know if it's because I'm doing it wrong or not... I tried to search for 'May 23' to see if anyone else had done a birthdate fill-in, but I got a Boolean error because 'May' is less than four letters long!' So I thought I'd report it on the bug reports page, only when I loaded the screen and hit 'edit' it loaded the appropriate window - but then it wouldn't let me add any new text to the page! It it locked? Or at maximum length? Maybe somebody who knows what they're doing needs to make a 'Bug Reports Page 2'... or maybe I've just totally screwed up because I'm an ignorant newbie! Also, when I typed 'help' into the search box to see if there was another help page to give me a clue, I got no results... I find it hard to believe that no articles anywhere in the entire Wikipedia use the world 'help' in them! I'm bewildered... <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaren_Johnson_02f6.html" title="User:Karen Johnson">KJ</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as searching, there are some problems with the search function (short words break, and some words just don't come up with any results) and we're working on fixing that. After the next upgrade, it should automatically fall back to a slower, but more thorough, search method if it doesn't get any results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for editing long pages... what browser, what operating system, and what version of everything are you using? The longer pages seem to be particularly troublesome for some people; there've been some reports about Internet Explorer 5.5 on Mac OS giving some kind of beeping noise when trying to edit (unfortunately I can't test this, as I don't have a Mac), and there are known problems with Mozilla 0.9.9 (can't submit long pages) and in general (editing is very very slow when the sidebar is enabled, especially for longer pages).</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>For the Mozilla problems, you can work around it by upgrading to a nightly build that has the submit bug fixed (see <a href="http://mozilla.org/" class="external free" title="http://mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">http://mozilla.org/</a>, down in the right-bottom corner) and by disabling the sidebar in your Wikipedia preferences for the slow-edit bug. For the Mac IE bug, I don't know.&#160;:( For anything else, I also don't know yet! But I'll try to help... Knowing exactly what the problem is should help with that; does your browser refuse to let you type text? Or can you type, but saving your changes doesn't work? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a>, Sunday, April 7, 2002</dd>

<dd>I'm using Netscape and I think the problem MIGHT have been with my computer. I had a similar incident with my diary a few hours later, where keyboard apparantly stopped responding. I restarted netscape and it was fine. During the problem I couldn't type any text into the textbox. Hopefully it won't recur! I just worked with a wiki page that was every bit as long as the bug reports screen and it worked fine. KJ</dd>

<p>Hey Brion -- Do you know if there is a way to prevent Google from indexing and displaying wikipedia edit-links in google searches? As it is right now, even these pages (which shouldn't really exist -- right?) are indexed by Google and presented in search results. Not sure if this is a bug, mis-feature or even a feature in somebody's mind, but this may be the main source of many of the "Describe the new page here." pages come from (which has been a major maintenance issue that is eating up the time of several sysops). I’ve been tracking many of the IP's that create these pages and most never return. So I don't think that these people are purposely creating these pages as a kind of vandalism, they are just understandably confused when they click on a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=California+State+University&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=www.wikipedia.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=California+State+University&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=www.wikipedia.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">link from google</a> titled <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/California+State+University&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/California+State+University&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">Editing California State University</a> and are presented with a text box with the words "Describe the new page here." -- hell, I might even have hit the Save button a couple of times in my pre-wiki days.

<dd>Yeah, that's possible... Okay, the issue is that currently the edit links look like this: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/User_talk:Brion_VIBBER&amp;action=edit" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/User_talk:Brion_VIBBER&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/User_talk:Brion_VIBBER&amp;action=edit</a>. A web search crawler has no way of knowing that that's a dynamic page that it shouldn't be messing with. If we used the full URL, ie <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Brion_VIBBER&amp;action=edit" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Brion_VIBBER&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Brion_VIBBER&amp;action=edit</a>, it might be clearer... maybe. Leastwise, looking in google, I don't see edit pages showing up in my google searches when checking the perl-based wikis, where the URL is like <a href="http://eo.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=edit&amp;id=Brion_VIBBER/Priparolu" class="external free" title="http://eo.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=edit&amp;id=Brion_VIBBER/Priparolu" rel="nofollow">http://eo.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?action=edit&amp;id=Brion_VIBBER/Priparolu</a>. On the other hand,&#160;?-ed URLs for <i>viewing</i> articles do show from both on the perl- and php- wikis (look for things on the meta wiki, it's still running on all-explicit URLs without the /wiki/ alias); perhaps google is playing some kind of guessing game, where "something=edit" in a URL with a query string gets ignored? I don't know... arrrgghh... <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a>, Friday, May 3, 2002</dd>

<p>Hey Brion,</p>
<p>I got into a bit of trouble awhile back by accidentally deleting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_German_Ideology_22f3.html" title="The German Ideology">The German Ideology</a> from the database. This page was created as a blank page by a newbie back when the server was moving VERY slowly. I hit delete several times over the period of an hour and kept getting timeouts. Apparently, somebody was actually working on the article at the same time, saved, and then I deleted that version without knowing somebody spent time creating an article out of the blank page. Is there a way to recover deleted material that was deleted within minutes of being created? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if it still works this way, but a couple of weeks ago I found that if you recreated a deleted page (for example, if you were to go to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_German_Ideology_22f3.html" title="The German Ideology">The German Ideology</a> and just type in random junk then save it), the history link would then allow you to access the prior history of the deleted page. I'll test and see if that's still the case... <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a>, Saturday, May 18, 2002 -- Nope, sorry, doesn't appear to work any more. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a>, Saturday, May 18, 2002</dd>

<dd>There's not an explicit 'undelete' function yet, but the delete function is set up in anticipation of one; the deleted page is still (or at least, should still be) kept in the old versions table, but unlinked so it doesn't show up in the regular page history list. Poking around in the old table, I do see a "Describe the new page here." page for The_German_Ideology dated April 21, but I don't see a more recent version (or one with content). If there was in fact a more recent version saved, it seems to be gone now, sorry. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a>, Saturday, May 18, 2002</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the info -- maybe the article wasn't saved correctly in the first place because of the ridiculously slow performance of the server that day (there was much weirdness going on that day). Perhaps I did only delete the "Describe the new page here." page like I thought... Perhaps some of the performance issues caused something unexpected to happen with eithe the save or delete... Perhaps... Anyway I tried. Thanks again for your help. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></dd>

<p>Hey Brion, I just had an interesting idea (well, at least I think it's interesting) about how we could track IPs after they are removed from the <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_blocked_55fa.html" title="IP blocked">block list</a> or on some kind of "warning list". We could place the offender's IP into a "probation list" such as the one I've started at <a href="../../../i/p/_/Wikipedia%7EIP_probation_watchlist_28b1.html" title="Wikipedia:IP probation watchlist">Wikipedia:IP probation watchlist</a>. My question is this: would it be possible to change the way IP numbers on such a "watchlist" would show up in RecentChanges? As it is right now, there really is no practical way to have such a watchlist -- unless you are a phycho like me and compare IPs on my own list with ones on RecentChanges (I don't like blocking IPs, and when I do I try to limit the time period of the block which means I have to periodically check the IPs contribs). A lot of IPs seem to have been kept blocked for longer than really are warrented by the limited damage that was done (well, that's my view anyway). This is especially troubling since so many IPs are dynamic and change after a few weeks (if not the next time the person dials-up to their ISP). Just wondering if this would be possible, I'm not advocating it yet. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>

<dd>Sure, I suppose that could be done pretty easily.

BTW, do you think it would be possible, or even desirable, to write a script that automatically removes entries from the "Votes for deletion" page when a listed entry is deleted? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>

<dd>Sure, sounds reasonable to me. There's a potential to eat up extra text if the page has been manually misformatted just so...

<p>Hey Brion, you are probably already aware of this, but when a page is administratively moved the history of the moved page gets majorly truncated usually only leaving who created it and the person that last edited it before the move. Is this a feature or a bug? If it is a bug do you know when it will be fixed? Also, if it is a feature I would like to request that the entire history of pages be moved -- which only makes sense to me (esp. on pages that have extensive histories such as the improperly named <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tables_of_Chinese_Sovereigns_c317.html" title="Tables of Chinese Sovereigns">Tables of Chinese Sovereigns</a> -- I don't want to move this unless I can be sure that the complete history will also move over). Later! --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>
<p>Yep, I was talking about the moved history. For example I just made a few edits to the improperly capitalized and pluralized <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette_Cards_57e9.html" title="Cigarette Cards">Cigarette Cards</a> article and then administratively moved it to <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette_card.html" title="Cigarette card">Cigarette card</a>. Here is a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/maveric149-tempfile.png" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/upload/maveric149-tempfile.png" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a> of the history before the move and here is a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?title=Cigarette_card&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?title=Cigarette_card&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">link</a> to the histoy after the move. Minor edits as well as regular ones are lost inbetween the first and last edits. Notice that the creation and edit times have also changed (dates are also affected). For the mass majority of the articles in the database this isn't too important but for some that have alot of edit activity this may become an issue. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></p>

<dd>As I just explained on your talk page and on wikipedia-l, the edits are not lost, only the dates. The items being missing from the history list is an artifact of the sorting used in retrieving items for display. Exact dates of older edits that have been munged by this bug can be manually restored, if and only if they're recorded elsewhere.

<p>Hey Brion,</p>
<p>I just cam across an interesting bug for you and want to know if it is affecting anyone else; I tried editing <a href="../../../r/l/e/User_talk%7ERlee0001_d1de.html" title="User talk:Rlee0001">User talk: Rlee0001</a> and got this error:</p>
<p>Fatal error: Call to a member function on a non-object in /usr/local/apache/htdocs/w/Article.php on line 1003</p>
<p>Which is the exact same thing that pops up to anybody trying to edit a page when their IP is blocked (try it yourself, this version allows you to unblock your IP afterwards). Trouble is that it only has occurred for me on that particular talk page (your's too) - and no I didn?t have myself blocked at the time (but I did for most of the week for my work IP though? I'm currently at work). Weirder still is that nobody else seems to be having trouble editing that page. Also, replacing the 'R' of Rlee0001 in the edit URL of <a href="../../../r/l/e/User_talk%7ERlee0001_d1de.html" title="User talk:Rlee0001">User talk:Rlee0001</a> with an 'r' provided me with an edit window (had to do the same thing here). But then I didn't have any problem editing <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">user:the Anome</a>'s talk page or my talk page (both are user names that were created with lowercased starting letters) or any other one I tried.

<p>Is there anything wrong with my doing it in the other order? Because I do graphics on a different computer from the one that's on the Internet, I often process six or more images, put them on a floppy and then upload them one after the other, I find it more efficient to put the link to the article in on this computer when I write the JPG file to the floppy on the other one, so I don't have to remember what the names are or which ones I've connected to articles -- they just go where they're supposed to as soon as I upload them here. If that's a problem, I can not do it, but I find it a lot easier than when I tried it the other way. So do you mind if I keep doing it backwards from the way you do?

No problem. (BTW I worked for E. F. Hutton when they did the infamous check-kiting where they didn't deposit money until after the checks had actually cleared the bank, and I'm still suing them for firing me for whistle-blowing, so that example cut a little close to the quick.)<br />

There's a link for Ben V in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence_f3f2.html" title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>, but it goes to Pres. Ben.

<p>Are we waiting for language.php to be translated before announcing the fact that the Japanese wiki is now on the Phase III software? If that is the case, why don't we just move all the other active wikis to the new software (with permission from the participants of course). That is one sure way to motivate people to translate language.php -- each language.php could be pasted onto a page in each of their respective wikis for community translation. Just a thought -- it may not work. But posting of the language.php text on wiki-editable pages would be a good idea. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<p>This does need to be explained to the other language wikis. Otherwise I forsee much unnecessary angst in the non-English wikipedias without both of your explanations. But such a statement needs to come from a developer. Is there any technical reason why language.php can't be community translated (I don't buy Lee's maintenance argument -- "if you build it developers will come", along with a boatload of new contributors)? If the text of that file is on the respective wikis and nobody does anything with it, then they only have themselves to blame for not being upgraded to Phase III. Also, is there a set of translations that <i>must</i> be done before any upgrade can be done at all (namespaces such as "talk", "user" and combinations therefore spring to mind as being absolutely necessary)? A priority list would be great to have. I'm sure having some links in English won't hurt so long as the really important stuff is already translated (in fact, it probably wouldn't even hurt to keep certain URLs in English -- so long as the displayed link is eventually translated). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no reason they can't do a community translation... just like the French did in preperation for phase II upgrade. Unfornately, by the time they finished, phase III is online and my suggestion to do intermediate phase II upgrades using the existing translations for Esperanto, German, Spanish, Polish, and French was rejected in favor of "wait and go straight to phase III". --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 21:00 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think some effort on our part is justified to kick-start growth, then I suggest making a post to intlwiki-l asking someone on each of the foreign wikis to post a note on their front page asking for translators. We can use that to judge interest--those that actually make the change will show some interest; those that actually come up with a translator are even better. Best of all are those that come up with a translator skilled enough to deal with CVS and check in the code himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there is an abolute minimum set of tranlations needed to get basic functionality for the wiki, with all the remaining text in English (and things like American date formats): the namespaces "Special", "Talk", "User", "User talk", "Wikipedia", "Wikipedia talk", "File", and "File talk" (yes, I know that's not even in the English wiki yet--but it will be soon), and the special link prefixes "Image" and "Media". --LDC</dd>

I think we have a little issue here as some french people seem to have a quite different definition from the english wikipedia on what neutral point of view is. Substantially, their point of view is that on every moral, ethical and political issue, the "united nation point of view on human rights" should prime on the neutral point of view. And should be clearly stated as such. You may see what the consequences could be on articles such as excision for instance. Since you wander on other international wikis, do you know whether the issue of what neutral point of view is, has been brought up&#160;? Do they follow the en.wiki point of view&#160;? Can we consider the fr wiki to be part of this global project if it differs so much on what neutrality is&#160;? Any ideas&#160;? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">user:anthere</a></p>

<dd>I've added links to the french, german, and esperanto NPOV pages. (I'll take a look through the others later.) I just finished reading the <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Wikipedia-La_Neutralité_De_Point_De_Vue/Discuter" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Wikipedia-La_Neutralité_De_Point_De_Vue/Discuter" rel="nofollow">french discussion</a>, and I must say I'm pretty bemused by the suggestion about the convention on human rights -- I simply don't see what it's to be used as the base <i>for</i>. Certainly it can be cited in an article on a subject that is forbidden or required by the convention (as a major facet of international law it's quite important!), what more is being asked for? For the encyclopedia to say "torture is bad"? What does that provide that "torture is outlawed by international convention X, and violations by countries such as Y, which claims to require such methods to combat criminal element Z are condemned by organization W" does not? The latter (which conforms to the conventional NPOV policy) is informative and encyclopedic, while the former is an empty opinion. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding; if I could see some examples of articles written in the suggested style, it might make more sense. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 07:05 Sep 16, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>it is more than bemusing, Brion, it is a disastrous idea imho. With the recent issue of "les six" (discussion <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Ligne_Du_Temps/Discuter" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Ligne_Du_Temps/Discuter" rel="nofollow">Ligne du temps</a>, it appeared obvious to me we had several problems that I tried to sum up on the int.wiki mailing list (if only people were not stuck by "gros mots"...), among which the notion of "neutral point of view" appeared somehow misunderstood by several (along with cooperation, respect of other people, patience, acceptance of different propositions...). It seemed to me the neutral point of view was badly leaning on the "scientific point of view" side. So I decided we needed to make that clearer, together. And you read what was written.<br />
Only two people chose to comment what I translated and adapted to our situation. You saw that.<br />
If french people decide that the "united nations point of view" comes above the "neutral point of view" as stated in the en.wiki, it is a breach with neutrality as the en.wiki defined it. It means considering our moral views are superior to these of other countries that do not follow human rights.<br />
Consider a wikipedian who decides to write an article on excision that says <i>Excision is a mutilating operation practiced on women in some countries. Excision is to be considered wrong as it is infringing with human rights as defined by the united nations declaration on human rights. However, some people think excision is acceptable for these and these reasons, and many countries go on with that practice...</i> (I agree I force a bit the idea, but basically, that is what is proposed in</p>
<p><i>--&gt; Parce qu'il existe une échelle dans les valeurs&#160;: je préfère mettre le respect des personnes et de leur intégrité physique AVANT les raisons qui expliquent les pratiques de mutilations sexuelles, qui doivent bien sûr être présentées.</i></p>
<p>or in</p>
<p><i>Le référentiel adopté par Wikipedia est la déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme de l’Organisation des nations unies&#160;: les points de vue contraires à cette dernière sont considérés comme nuisibles.</i>)</p>
<p>Would you consider it neutral&#160;? probably not. I would not. The en.wiki has an answer to this kind of article, it does not fairly represent point of views. That's final. Hence, the article must be reworked. If the french wiki considers human rights above neutral point of view, there is no answer to this kind of article, as the author can state it is acceptable along the policy rules. Adopting this policy would only state some moral views are acceptable while others are plain wrong. And this, I believe, is not neutral. Fortunately, no, no article really has been done that way yet, but it would be an open door. I would like very much other people to state what they think, otherwise, it will be tough to defend what imho is the idea of neutrality. That was why I asked you whether other int.wiki had been working on that issue. I'm a bit troubled right now. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">user:anthere</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed; that seems so completely unlike an encyclopedia that I can't conceive of someone wanting to write one like that! On the Esperanto wiki, we're not always as neutral as we should be (especially on the pages about other constructed languages&#160;;) but we try -- certainly no one is considering that the UN's official point of view is "neutral" (it's not!) or should be implicitly considered correct. It should instead be explicitly stated and assigned to the UN, the Declaration of Human Rights, etc. IMHO, if what is intended by the troublemakers <i>is</i> pushing the (officially) internationally accepted viewpoint, citing the convention or organization that holds the view will carry a lot more weight than a bald assertion from an anonymous author! I'll try to drop a few words to that affect into the discussion when I have a moment. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>

<p>Hey Brion - it looks like there is some consensus on having a more conservative definition for what the software considers to be artciles. However I still haven't heard either you or Lee jump into the discussion yet on the list. I think that it is important to change this before we hit 50,000 articles. What do you think? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<dd>From the other side of the screen articles and non-article pages look exactly the same -- they take up space, have edit histories, link and are linked to -- so it makes little difference to me.&#160;:) As long as there's a consensus and the measure is straightforwardly quantifiable, I have no objection. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 23:31 Sep 20, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brion,</p>
<p>Just a few words to tell you that I did put the text for the php translation on the french wiki.<br />
How are the other wikis doing&#160;?<br />
On the mailing list, Aoineko said he would take care of that, but he seems to be still on holidays. Buzz declared himself interested to do it, and I hope he will, but he is rarely around these days...My previous call for translators didnot raise any reaction.<br />
As I already stated, the phase II translation was not a community work; I did it alone, didnot even succeed to convince the others to check what I had done (I am no developper in the least). I spent quite a lot of time on it. So I have decided I will do the barest minimum this time, and if nobody does the effort, I will consider, as LDC stated, that they are not interested really.<br />
The neutrality issue is bugging me quite a lot (thank you for your comment over there); it seems the pro-scientific point of view chose to bury the head in the sand and not to discuss it at all. Avoiding discussion when there's an issue to discuss, or getting rude as with the six is not the way I see wikipedia.</p>

<dd>It's much preferred to use the "move page" function. This changes the name of a page while keeping its edit history completely intact under the new name, so it's easier to keep track of changes to the article over its entire existence.

However, we don't really want random vandals to be randomly renaming pages, so at the same time there was pressure to limit who can use it.) So, feel free to create a login for yourself (it can be random letters and numbers for all I care&#160;:) and you will then find "move page" listed in the sidebar. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 00:17 Sep 27, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Brion; I suppose you've noticed all of the county entries that I added (if not, just look at one). Now I am in a position to create the exact same sort of entries for any or all of the cities in the U.S. FYI, that would make 35,000 or so new articles at ~2000 bytes per article. It would take me a good chunk of time to add that much data, so my question is, is there some way that we could automatically generate some of the articles? Clearly there would be some specifics to work out (naming conflicts, whatever), but I can prepare the data/articles in a MySQL database. I don't mind adding the entries myself as it will go really fast since most of the entries currently don't exist, but it would obviously be faster if there were an automated way. Tell me what you think. -- Ram-Man</p>
<p>I am not even going to try to get any kind of web interface going on. I am *not* a very good web developer (my main programming "weakness", as I don't enjoy web work too much). I can provide the data as a MySQL database, a text file dumped from MySQL using a "INTO OUTFILE 'textfile.txt'", a tab delimited text file, or a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a></p>

<p>Brion - I need some help. Earlier I blocked 194.117.133.196 after somebody who is using that IP went on a vandalism rampage. However, after reviewing all the edits by this IP I saw that most were in fact good edits. Just now I got an email stating "194.117.133.196 (cache-haw.cableinet.co.uk) is the ISP cache I'm behind. I'm finding life a little difficult tonight&#160;:-/". So it looks like both a valid user <i>and</i> a vandal are using the same IP at the same time. What should I do? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<dd>The page doesn't exist.

<p>Brion, has there been any complaint on Windows 98 avec Internet Explorer 5 (5.00.2614.3500). AGiss says that pages do not reload when he clicks on the reload button; the only way is to empty the cache, or to do a Ctrl+Alt while reloading. He is afraid he will tend to destroy changes, as he might forget to reload a page each time he wants to edit it. Does anybody complained about that&#160;? <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikip%E9dia:Rapport_d%27erreurs&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=0" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikip%E9dia:Rapport_d%27erreurs&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=0" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikip%E9dia:Rapport_d%27erreurs&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=0</a> [[user:anthere]</p>

<p>I had to do that because he kept deleting my changes. why did he remove a link to a relevant NYTimes editorial?</p>
<p>Why did he remove relevant info about ACSH's funding?</p>
<p>Why did he say 'nominally' independent??? That is libelous!</p>
<p>Why did he simply REVERT to old version, when the old version was misleading?</p>
<p>If he wants to take out POV stuff, fine, but a clarification regarding funding issues????</p>
<p>Removing a NYTimes editorial that agrees with ACSH?</p>
<p>When even the left wing editorial page of the Times agrees with ACSH, he should probably give up his unscientific advocacy and conceed that there is no longer a controversy--in the scientific community- about this issue.</p>

<dd>Unless they were viewing recent changes from a month ago, yes. None of the errors that people have recently given me were about the current bot run. So it appears as if most people are ignoring those entries. That said, I understand the purpose of the RC. Nevertheless, I just wish there was some way that I could do my work without bothering others. It is also a (minor?) annoyance to have to slow the bot down this much.

<p>Brion, was sent to you from the Village Well. I am a new Israeli ... (insert whatever you like to call your newbies), and since the heb site is empty I was wondering what could one do to help.

<p>Hi, Brion, I was looking at the LanguageIt.php versions on Sourceforge and I found that I probably made a mistake in sending you the last file. Sourceforge version 1.3 is in fact reverting all the changes I had made in version 1.2 and it should be quite similar to 1.1, if not the same. If you wish, I could prepare a 1.5 restoring 1.2 and including the <i>"math" =&gt; 1</i> string added in 1.4. Please, forgive my confusion, and<br />

<dd>We've changed the sidebar behavior so that there are links to the article, talk page etc. on screens where they were previously missing. For example, when you click on a user page that doesn't exist User:Foobarbar, you can now directly visit their talk page, or contributions, without having to put some text there first. The errors probably relate to your sysop status (I suppose these would be "Protect" and "Delete" links), I didn't test properly with sysop status enabled.

<dd>Fixed, but should be double-checked for correctness.

<p>Brion,</p>
<p>is there a reason we are using a different set of code files for each Wikipedia? It's fairly simple to use the same one for each, I have hacked this for the <a href="http://openfacts.berlios.de" class="external text" title="http://openfacts.berlios.de" rel="nofollow">OpenFacts</a> project: just use different wiki.phtmls which include different Setup.phps which include different LocalSettings.phps. All other PHP files are then shared among the different languages. Wouldn't this make updating a lot easier? (On a different note, I have also hacked OpenFacts to use a common user table for the two languages, this took me only a couple of hours, but merging the existing user DBs would be tricky for WP.)--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 20:34 Jan 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not so sure that would be an advantage; as it is, I can synchronize all the common source files with a single call to a simple update script, so it's no trouble to have separate directories -- modifying the wiki.phtml and Setup.php for each language would cause <i>more</i> work for me whenever those files happened to change. If we reenable PHP caching with a more recent and less crashy version of APC, I'm not sure how it would be affected by running the same files with different include dependencies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd like to combine the user tables, but we need charset conversion (or a common charset, preferably), a one-time remapping of user id numbers, and a one-time check for duplicate names that aren't the same people. Further, I haven't heard any concrete ideas on how broadly user options and sysop rights should extend; the same for all languages, or partitioned into sections? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 01:45 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you have a script that's fine; when working on de I noticed it seems to be a relatively dated version of the code, though (I miss my backlinks&#160;;). As for perms, yeah, we'll probably need a more complex mechanism here. Either we try to push it all into one column, or we'll create a separate perms table. Opts could be global for the time being, IMHO -- if at all, you would probably only want single opts to be different in different local versions. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 04:00 Jan 18, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brion,</p>
<p>I've been having trouble editing a couple pages here. I can click in the edit boxes, I can select in the edit boxes, I can delete in the edit boxes, but cannot type or paste in the edit boxes. The only two pages (that I know of, of course) on which this happens are <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_8c56.html" title="Talk:Evolution">Talk:Evolution</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMaveric149_2ca8.html" title="User talk:Maveric149">User talk:Maveric149</a>. As far as I know, there is no other unprotected page that I cannot edit.</p>
<p>Several people, and in particular Koyaanis Qatsi, have tried to help, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Other info:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have an ISP. I have ethernet locally going out a T1 eventually at a college.</li>
<li>I have my own IP. It's dedicated to the sole computer in my office.</li>
<li>My IP is almost certainly not banned. Otherwise, I couldn't have written this message--unless there is such a thing as a page-specific ban. However, I've never written to Maveric's page, so unlikely I'd be banned there.</li>
<li>I've never seen a <b>ban message</b>. Only the symptoms I described above.</li>
<li>Maveric149 said that <b>large pages</b> might be giving me trouble. Perhaps. Both the bothersome pages are fairly large.</li>
<li>I'm using Netscape 4.75. (I know. It's old, but I like it.)</li>

Namely, that the ~~~syntax links to the user page. You put in your word expressing your conservatism on the matter; eg against my suggestion that ~~~ actually link to the user_talk page instead. I immediately gave a reply saying that an even less major change is to have the notifier (no longer the '*' but now the 'You have new messages', to also be activated whenever the user page is edited). This needs to be done,so as to make communications better.</p>

Hi Brion, is there a way to link a small image to a big one&#160;? <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The cleanest way is to include an explicit text link to the big image, with [[media: instead of [[image:, and call it 'click fo rbigger image' or 'magnify' or 'expand' or what have you. You could also put the big image into the description page of the small image (so clicking the small image itself shows the big image), but present consensus is against it. (One admitted problem is that if the big image is really big, it still doesn't fit well into the wiki page.) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 00:26 Jan 27, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Salut Brion! I had some days "off" and used the time to learn more about what I am actully doing. Put up some 4 wikis and learned more. Fun, thanks!</p>
<p><b>Reg Swedish Wikipedia:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>When I search on Google for some words Google points to "old" sv.wikipedia.com articles, which are impossible to edit, and doesnt lead to the the new site. Is this OK? (only temporarily or a permanent problem?</li>

<dd>Oops, the DNS records need to be updated to point the .com address to the new server; that must have fallen through the cracks. I'll go bug Jason about it. And yes, interlanguage links on the recentchanges are a good idea -- right now I there's something funny about interpretation of lang links on special pages that would keep it from working in the normal way, but we can slip in some links into the intro text (like on meta). --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 19:23 Jan 27, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed the Danes has removed their lan links on RecentChanges. By the way, why did the dot com articles turn up upon request with googles, it seems like UseMod were playing better with Google, may that be? (and now when I checked, I see theres no meta keyword or description in th head:</p>
<p><br />
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Stockholm bloodbath - Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta name="robots" content="index,follow"&gt; &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"&gt;</p>
<p>How come? I think even that "simple" chiq-chaq has automatically $title implemented in the meta keywords. Has something happened which i dont know? Isnt description and keywords used anymore to attract search engines? Enlighten me, poor soul since I now had ants in my head... A wikipedia must be supposed to seriously brabe search engines like Google, or? The .org files comes several pages after the .com, Tryit if you can find living pages on the old server?</p>

<dd>Well, the new server is only partially indexed on Google because about a month or so ago I goofed up with the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robots.txt.html" title="Robots.txt">robots.txt</a> file and accidentally forbid bots from indexing articles; in early January we got re-spidered and previously indexed articles got <i>dropped</i> from Google. (*cough* *cough*) It's been corrected, and we've been at least partially reindexed since. The rest should continue to fill in over time... As far as meta keywords -- I know we <i>used</i> to do include the title and I think links as meta keywords on the phase 2 software; this may have gotten accidentally (or intentionally by LDC) left out of phase 3.

<p><b>Esperanto question</b><br />
Brion, I added the following to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_Franca_8f12.html" title="Lingua Franca">Lingua Franca</a> earlier today, based on something I read some time ago in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> about the popularity of Esperanto among translators:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Esperanto is said to have gained currency as a lingua franca among translators however.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought maybe you could confirm, or add to it. It isn't mentioned in the <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> article, but as I recall, the idea was that because lots of translators spoke Esperanto, they could eliminate chains of translation from language to language using Esperanto as an intermediate form, so the Korean could talk to the Finn without going through Japanese and French first. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I would be surprised to hear that. While there are certainly individual translators and interpreters who think highly of and themselves speak Esperanto (eg <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Piron_a75a.html" title="Claude Piron">Claude Piron</a>), having "gained currency as a lingua franca among translators" implies a level of use significantly out of proportion with anything I've heard of. Of course the point of Esperanto is that the Korean and the Finn could talk to each other <i>directly</i>, without the need for interpreters.&#160;:) But a three-language chain is better than <i>more</i> than three, and Esperanto does sometimes get proposed as an intermediate language for both human and machine translation, in part due to its flexible yet robust grammar and relative ease of learning. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 06:43 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That was the burden of the WSJ article, that they were using Esperanto as an intermediate form. To me, that is a classic lingua franca. Finn speaking Esperanto to Korean speaking Esperanto means that Finns and Koreans have a better communications path than otherwise. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></p>

<p>Hi Brion, a question. I was in the middle of a major re-write on a page on the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Late_Show_5411.html" title="Late Late Show">Late Late Show</a> when my browser crashed. Is there anyway of tracking down that re-write? It had not been saved; I was in the middle of previewing it. It was quite different to the saved page. I would hate to have to re-do the whole damn thing again if at all possible. Is it possible to salvage something previewed but not saved when the crash occured. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 04:55 Feb 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>

The text was typed in and laid out correctly. It showed up accurately in the preview but when I went back up to look at the version before saving, it was garbled, with some grey boxes cropping up in the middle of the text, the final paragraph mixed up and the first paragraph gone completely. I saved it, hoping the preview version would be the one that was saved, but instead only a bit of one line ended up saved. I left a note on the summary saying 'Help Brion' but that too didn't show up. (Other summaries I have made elsewhere don't show up.) Is there a bug somewhere?

<p>The Swedish wikipedia is suffering from several editing wars with neonazis. 194.152.96.72 changes pages several times a day and acuses people for threatning him/her/it.

<p><b>Esperanto Etymology</b></p>
<p>I notice that you write Esperanto quite fluently. I've been slowly trying to learn the language as well, since I discovered it four years ago and has been ever since fascinated by its universality and hopefulness. But sadly to sad, my Esperanto is still at a very very basic level, mainly because my studying has been sporadic at best due to the lack of motivation. (I've yet to meet an Esperanto speaker/writer in my <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_life.html" title="Real life">real life</a>.) I wonder if you know any Esperanto etymology dictionary (or a dictionary that contains etymology) on-line or in print? I don't know enough of all the European languages to get where the word comes from. I mean, "jes" obviously comes from "yes", but some words are unclear to me, for example, "edzo", "suko", "pregxejo", and "kortbirdviando", etc. For me, understanding etymology has always been an important and fun part of language acquisition. Dankon. --<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenchi_e72d.html" title="User:Menchi">Menchi</a> 15:21 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Mapmaking</b></p>
<p>I really admire the maps you made. They're beautiful, like those by Scipius. I've always loved map gazing since I was a kid. I'd stare at them on and on like it's a treasure map. I asked Scipius how s/he made the maps and s/he said that s/he first trace the outline of a real map, and then digitalize it (colouring, labelling). How about you? How do you make your most lovely maps? I'm thinking of making some myself as well. --<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenchi_e72d.html" title="User:Menchi">Menchi</a> 15:49 Feb 28, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'd like to use wikipedia software on my computer as a personal knowledge base. I don't understand how to get the software. In sourceforge the files section has only a wiki.tar.gz dating from 2001. Documentation seems to indicate that we should download directly from the CVS sources but, since I never did that, wouldn't we need a sourceforge account to be able to download?</p>
<p>Will it be a lot of work to get wikipedia to work? I would like to use it, to benefit from the support that the software gets.</p>

<p>Brion, Mav is opposed to setting a clear box size for images &amp; embedding images in text. I think this fundamentally wrong, making images take up entire columns when the don't need to (giving an image excessively strong visual emphasis), is causing problems with my browser and makes pages seem amateurish. I have done graphic layout for advertorials for years and embedding pictures is text is always seen as a fundamental requirement.

Bloody hell, Brian!!! How come different browsers show pages so completely differently on wiki??? I'm on Netscape 7.0.2. right now and on my screen now this is typing in courier font (NEVER saw that on explorer!). The Mugabe picture is in a different location in Netscape and Mozilla to where it is on explorer. (I don't know how to 'capture' that image and show it to you. I'll try something here.</p>
<p>On netscape/mozilla the image is aligned to the right in the second paragraph and has a clear thin line outline around it.</p>
<p>On explorer, the page looks</p>
<p>opening paragraph.</p>
<p>Image (without a box) dead centre of page with white space all around.</p>
<p>second paragraph.</p>
<p>That page you sent to me replicates that. On explorer, the image is dead centre on its own. On netscape it is right-aligned.</p>
<p>I've looked at other pages. On explorer, if you set the command at .1px the text box itself is invisible, leaving the picture and caption unboxed (which looks very clean and neat). On netscape, no matter how small you set the command, you <i>still</i> see the textbox (which can look clumsy. I looked at the page on the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Tiara_a10b.html" title="Papal Tiara">Papal Tiara</a> and on explorer everything looks neat and well aligned, on netscape ugly great boxes appear around the picture. Yuch!</p>
<p>I've just tested out the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Tiara_a10b.html" title="Papal Tiara">Papal Tiara</a> page by taking out the width command from around two pictures. On netscape the picture remains in location (right aligned) with a box closely fitting it (though the border set at .1px still shows the line.) On explorer, .1px hides the border, but without the width page, the picture jumps to the centre of the page and screws up the text alignment below it (the next paragraph runs four letters longer to the right than everything else on the page, but perfectly aligned on the left. If you will pardon me for a moment (f@*k. S€*t. Damn. Coclklffu!) In other words, I am pissed off. What do you do? Put in width to keep images aligned on Explorer, or leave it out to keep netscape happy? And whichever you do will screw up the other!!! And all the time I evidently wasted getting images in various articles <i>perfect</i> on explorer, onto to find them screwed up in netscape, and vice-versa. Is this exclusively a problem with browsers or is there some way the geniuses in wikipedia can solve it?

<p>My hero! *swoon*.&#160;:-) Yep. Your changes to the Bobby Mugabe pages have worked a treat. Explorer and Netscape are seeing the same thing (for once). Salutations and congratulations. You really should be getting paid for this. (We all should. Heck, I'm paying by the minute for being on wiki, as there is no alternative due to a scam by the Irish service provider, which thankfully they have been ordered to change by June!)

<p>Yeah I know, but there were <i>so</i> many annoying features - slow moving pages, blurred screen images with lines repeating and repeating and repeating<br />
<br />
repeating and repeating and repeating<br />
<br />
repeating and repeating and repeating . . . as a page formed, typing slowing to a crawl (as a reasonably quick typist I'd have typed one and a half lines and find it had only got the first two words a n d t h e n b e c a m e a c r a w l!) I was just mentioning the courier in a tongue in cheek example of Irish sarcasm as the easiest way to explain how much I HATED NETSCAPE. I've just taken on safari (and camino!) and OHMYGOD what an improvement. I have had half an hour of wiki pleasure after four hours of Netscape 'AAAAH - fuck this . . . ' So far Safari has been quick, (very quick, quicker than anything I have used!), neat looking, quick typing. And none of explorer's tendency to suddenly decide after about an hour that you had to hit 'return' <i>twice</i> to get it to work, muttering "I said 'return' you f****** thing". About the only minor problem is that the font size is the smallest I have used. But I can certainly recommend safari as <i>bloody brilliant</i>.</p>
<p>On another point: do currency symbols cause problems, or is it just the&#160;? sign (euro sign). Everytime I did a <i>show preview</i> it would become a&#160;? on both explorer and safari. (Yup - done it here too. The first question mark was typed in as euro sign). <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a> 00:51 Apr 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Referring to audio file question on village pump. Not even the midi version of any song is allowed? or as long as the artist's voice is not heard.<a href="../../../k/t/2/User%7EKt2_1cff.html" title="User:Kt2">User:kt2</a></p>
<p>Copyrights on music are fairly complicated. (I am not a copyright lawyer, just a film student. Consult a real lawyer for legal advice.) Suffice to say that not only is the <i>recording</i> copyrighted, and the <i>lyrics</i> are copyrighted, but also the <i>sequence of notes</i> is copyrighted. If you hum a copyrighted song in public, technically you're probably liable for paying royalties.&#160;:) Certainly a MIDI representation of the tune of an entire copyrighted song would <i>not</i> be acceptable for Wikipedia (unless that copyrighted song is also licensed under the GFDL, which is not very likely...) Brief extracts as samples may be acceptable under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>, however fair use is a tricky thing and I don't personally recommend it.</p>
<p>Complete MIDI files (or recordings as OGG or similarly compressed audio) of songs that are in the public domain are A-OK. National anthems... Some countries may copyright them, I don't know. I would imagine most are safe, though particular recordings may be under copyright -- this is true also of classic music! -- so it's safest to sequence or record them yourself unless you know the recording or file is in the clear. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 08:38 Apr 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brion, there is a weird problem on the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_XII_dc66.html" title="Pope Pius XII">Pope Pius XII</a> page. At the bottom of the page is a link to Pius's predecessor and successor. The link to the former, Pius XI, has gone haywire. Everytime I type in [[Pope Pius XI]] it comes out as [[Pope Pius XI] on a preview . WHen I removed the square brackets, the next box, with [[List of Popes]] suddenly became [[List of Popes] . I did a cut and paste from <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXIII_ce7b.html" title="Pope John XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a> using the same textbox. When I installed it on the page and changed the predecessor/successor names, the same thing happened. Two ]]s became one ]. When the predecessor's square brackets were removed, one disappeared from the centre List of Popes box. (Earlier, the 'signature' image on the page went weird as well, throwing text after it to the left. I did a cut and paste of the commands and installed them with the image and it worked perfectly. As far as I could see, the <i>new</i> commands were <i>identical</i> to the ones originally there.

<p>Hi Brion - I've just made a bit of a mistake: I tried to upload a .png with a # in the name. I know #s aren't allowed, I just cocked it up. It said it was renaming it to something else (it truncated everything after the #), and I OKed the rename before I noticed what I was doing. The thing is showing in the <a href="../../../u/p/l/Wikipedia%7EUpload_log_59e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Upload log">upload log</a> (23:37 Apr 13, 2003), but clicking on the link for the image (Image:E with) brings a "(There is currently no text in this page)". I'm going to re-upload the image with a proper name, but I just thought I'd mention it in case it was of interest to you for some reason (I don't know why it would be, but I felt I should tell somebody about it, anyway - it seems odd that it's in the upload log but isn't there). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p>Hi Brion, I'm sure you know the saga of Susan Mason/Dietary Fiber (who inadvertently admitted to being one and the same, and on the evidence is Adam/Bridget/Lir/Vera Cruz of not so fond memory!). An anonymous user visited one of the 'war zones' the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_3bdf.html" title="History of the Soviet Union">History of the Soviet Union</a> page and something about their tone immediately rang a bell as being rather similar to the Adam family contributions. I presume that you can check IPs. It might be worth seeing if this user is using the same IP address as the Adamses. Their IP was 131.247.157.115. The last thing we want to do is presume that that user is the dreaded twice-banned Adam under <i>yet</i> another new identity, ready to screw up new articles ('Susan Mason' calling King James VI of Scotland <i>english</i> was an all-time classic; it is a wonder wiki didn't get firebombed by irate Scots over such a 'slur'!). But given the Adam/Bridget/Lir/Vera Cruz/Susan Mason/Dietary Fiber behaviour on a wide range of articles in the last few months, <i>if</i> this is Adam trying yet another entry point onto wiki, it is worth knowing straight away, rather than people having to chase around fixing muck ups in the dark. Between SM/DF and Michael crapping all over articles recently and provoking edit wars, wikipedia is begining to feel like Iraq. Should we let Donald Rumsfeld loose on one or other? *grin* <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a> 01:39 Apr 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brion, I am having some strange <i>technological</i> problems on wiki in the last 24 hours. Last night I went to enter an older version of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a> to do a revert (someone kept rewriting the page without following the naming conventions). But when I entered the previous version (which was under my own name) it <i>didn't enter</i> the proper article but threw up <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_II_of_Russia_ba70.html" title="Alexander II of Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>. It took me a moment to work out what was going on. My first thought was "Jesus, this version is different". It was only after a close reading of it that I copped on I was in the wrong page. There is a link within the Nicholas II page to Alexander II, so my guess is it jumped into the page and then into an internal link. I did notice that wiki did seem to be running very slow suddenly. I don't have the exact time but I guess it somewhere in the region of 5am Saturday morning. (BTW I am using safari on an eMac!) Also, on <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> the image of the euro coin seems to be causing all sorts of problems. It is using a different font for the caption. When I went to rearrange photos because one was interfering with text by pushing a headline out of space, everything went wrong <i>from the euro image on</i>. All the text began to run in a column from the image down the page, and began to over-write the subsequent image. I cut the image out altogether and reinstalled it and everything ran fine (except for the font which I cannot change. I thought it might be related to the euro sign commands in the caption, but even when I removed them the font remained the same.) No commands on that image had been removed or touched before the whole thing went wonky, and the image and commands put back were identical to the ones cut. But the problem . . . just came and then after the cut and paste . . . went.</p>
<p>Tonight I hit my watchlist command on the left side bar to be thrown into the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanov.html" title="Romanov">Romanov</a> page in an edit stage. I had just finished that page <i>and saved it</i> before hitting watchlist so I hadn't a clue why that happened. Are there some other similar experiences out there, or am I some 'X Files' type wiki?&#160;:) Oh, I've just remembered something else. On netscape (split! Got I hate netscape) the &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; commands don't seem to have a blind bit of difference. As a result, images that fit when a subcaption is small on other browsers are thrown out of place when looked at on netscape, because the text is all shown the one size. On I Explorer, text put in using those commands seems to become smaller and uglier than shown on safari. Hence my preference for safari. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 23:34 Apr 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS - one final final point (it has just happened again so I better mention it) it may not be something wiki can do anything about on safari, if for whatever reason a <i>save</i> didn't work (eg, the modem just cut out while you were doing it, an edit conflict, etc) hitting a <i>save</i> a second time does not work. You have to hit the <i>back a page</i> button on the browser, then when the earlier version of the page is shown, hit the forward a page button. Only then, when you are back in the edit page you were originally working on, can you hit <i>save page</i> and actually have the page saved. Strange, huh. Has anyone ever manufactured a browser that doesn't have its own quirky faults? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 23:34 Apr 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>How do I make myself clear, so that you will quit misrepresenting what I'm trying to say? As I have said, over and over and over and over and over again, I have no problem with people making changes to what I write. My problem <i><b>in this particular case</b></i> is that Egil went in behind me and moved, without explanation, photos that I had had spent hours uploading and installing, and changing the captions. And his only explanation is "because it looks better." He and I got off on a bad foot from the very beginning when he started creating empty articles than attacked me without any introduction when I suggested that they be deleted (and I did not delete them, I merely listed them in the votes for deletion page), and I have a feeling that there is more to this than simple desires to be bold in editing, I think it's personal with him. I haven't even bothered looking at any of his posts since his initial foray into Wikipedia, and have had no communication with him, so as far as I am concerned, we had no further problem, until Saturday night, when he went into virtually every page I had put a photo into, and made changes. If he had bothered to let me know why he thought they needed to be changed, then I might have been mollified. But he couldn't even let me know what it is about them that he didn't like, nor did he point to any page which tells us that what he's doing is some sort of standard. No, it's just his personal feel for what is "looking better". One wonders if he would have done the same thing if it had been anyone else who had contributed those changes. But again, as I keep saying to deaf ears, yours as well as others, <i><b>I don't care if people change what I write.</b></i> Just, please, let me know <i><b>why</b></i> you're doing it, so I can maybe not do it "wrong" the next time? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>

<p>Hi, Brion.</p>
<p>I'm a sysop in the Japanese Wikipedia (well, as you might remember), and I know some, including myself, are interested in knowing distribution of article sizes. I found this particular seemingly useful database query from <a href="../../../d/a/t/Wikipedia%7EDatabase_queries_48db.html" title="Wikipedia:Database queries">Wikipedia:Database_queries</a>.</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cur WHERE LENGTH(cur_text)&gt;1500 AND cur_namespace=0</p>
<p>But I have no idea how burdensome this query is to the server.</p>
<p>If no problem is expected, I may try the following format, with perhaps several different sets of values in places of "1500" and "2500".</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cur WHERE LENGTH(cur_text)&gt;1500 AND LENGTH(cur_text)&lt;2500 AND cur_namespace=0</p>
<p>Any advice is appreciated. But I'm not in a hurry. Please take your time.

<p>Hello Brion.</p>
<p>With the translation, our deletion log is now called Wikipédia:Trace des effacements (that is a perfectly stupid name imho, I should have followed the translation file&#160;:-(((). The new deletions are going in that new file, while the old ones are still in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_log_d5b8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion log">Wikipedia:deletion log</a>. Can we move everything out of the old page&#160;? Should we keep it, or may we delete it&#160;? Is it sure there will be no problem in terms of maintenance&#160;?</p>
<p>hum...I really hope there will be an answer for my question on the mail list about how people get admin. I have absolutely nothing against Alvaro, but when I see a weird process, I always feel a *weight* on me (how can someone be sysop with less than 50 edits, most being international links or talk pages&#160;?) Is it again a little "arrangement"&#160;? Anthere</p>

<p>I obtain copyright free maps and fair use maps from universities etc. on the Internet as well as scan them in at the local public library who has every historical map that ever existed copyright free and who are not required to provide each library user with a copyright certification certificate. That is one of the reasons why, under the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> et al (See Alex 756’s good work) Wikipedia is not obligated to check each photo posted and has no legal liability whatsoever except to remove it when notified by a claiming party. So, my question is why is this particular one being singled out by you? First, I had a sysop revert my very detailed and factual work without reason, now suddenly this inquiry. Coincidence? I too am very concerned about Wikipedia being harmed. I have a list of about 120 photos on Wikipedia that I have doubts about. So, seeing as you are saying I should post each of these on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>, I shall do so ASAP.</p>
<p>I have over 300 maps on my computer. The two I posted on Weikipedia are available in about 50 different formats. Some come from:</p>
<pre>
<a href="http://historymedren.about.com/library/atlas/natmapwestemp843.htm?once=true&amp;" class="external free" title="http://historymedren.about.com/library/atlas/natmapwestemp843.htm?once=true&amp;" rel="nofollow">http://historymedren.about.com/library/atlas/natmapwestemp843.htm?once=true&amp;</a>
</pre>
<p>There are hundreds of maps put on the Web by About.com and others and in About.com’s case each map is labeled as follows or similar: "This map is from the Atlas to Freeman's Historical Geography, edited by J.B. Bury, Longmans Green and Co. Third Edition 1903. It is in the public domain and you may download it or print it for any use. Click it to return to the smaller version."</p>
<p>I frequently download these copyright free items, resize them, convert them and label them if necessary. I’m telling you this to save time in the future, but if you wish, I will provide proof each time I post, subject to being advised by the owner, Mr. Wales, that I am an exception to the fixed legal policy and required to do so.</p>
<p><br />
As to the two specific images you refer to, I would like to know why Ms. JHK, a Wikipedia sysop, contravened your policy and deleted one of them from the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_I_25db.html" title="Clovis I">Clovis I</a> article? Is there two standards here. One for Ms. JHK and another for us “obtuse”, “misrepresenters”, and “liars” as she called a contributor to this page?</p>
<p>Image:ClovisDomain.jpg and&#160;:Image:843-870 Europe.jpg?</p>
<p>For these two images go to:</p>

<p>TennesseeBob Peckham Director, The Globe-Gate Project University of Tennessee-Martin</p>
<p>At his website he has these two specific maps you refer to that you will see come from Paul Halsall, Ph.D. history. (You might suggest Ms. Hemp go to this website and learn FACTS about Merovingian History from an expert) - It is part of the Fordham University website to aid researchers. The University of Tennessee links to Fordham University, the Government of France service departments and other education places who in fact put these historical documents on the web and WANT places like Wikipedia to have these maps (assuming that the intellect level is high enough to ensure the written input has narrative based on fact, not personal opinions). Now, Mr. Vibber, I trust this meets with your satisfaction. Would you please inform Ms. JHK that she should not vandalize pages by deleting peoples maps/photos etc. before following Wikipedia procedure. Perhaps I’m wrong, but don’t they ban people from Wikipedia for deliberate deletions of photos without proper authorization? Maybe you could advise me on this, please. While you are at it, suggest also to Ms. JHK (and someone called sysop Tannin who reverted my FACTS from the good Professor) not to delete my text additions when I support them with facts that contradict her unfounded opinions. I welcome improvement to my miniscule efforts to contribute, but not vandalism by someone with a personal agenda who asserts baseless opinions on the Internet claims of personal accreditations.</p>
<p>Thank you, I am appreciative of your concern and great diligence in seeing that Wikipedia operates properly and fairly. I hope this meets with your satisfaction, should you have need of any further information, please do not hesitate to ask. Have a lovely day.

<hr />
<p>Just a small PS re fair use. I wasn't aware you were a lawyer. As I said, Wikipedia has no obligation to verify photos/maps posted. Anyone may in fact claim "fair use" when items are found on the Web without copyright claim. There is no legal requirement of any kind for a person to go searching for copyright. That is why the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> was created, it was new and huge as well as multi-country. If someone inadvertently has copied an unidentified copyright photo, they have no liability except to remove it when provided with PROPER notice. That is the law. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriton_8995.html" title="User:Triton">Triton</a></p>

<p>Thank you. I am not the lawyer for Wikipedia.org. nor are you. The copyright issue is well documented, if Mr. Wales plans to change the legal requirements for posting photos I will be glad to follow them but I certainly will not act contrary to the policy that applies to all contributors. I believe it is referred to as equality under the law. I take personal exception to your insinuations because if you read the issue being debated here with myself and Ms. JHK, you would clearly see that it is about me working hard and posting facts while she deletes them with her unfounded theories thatr are definitely not even close to a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Please read her text on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_monarchs_03f6.html" title="List of French monarchs">List of French monarchs</a> and tell me this is NPOV and encyclopedic. Then, please tell me why you allow her deletions without justification of my documented facts on <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_I_25db.html" title="Clovis I">Clovis I</a> AND why she could refer to users as "Obtuse", "misrepresenters" and "liars" and you, Mr. Vibber say not one word. Now, I am asking one more time that you put an end to her abusive conduct. Is that a reasonable request? My behaviour has been most tolerant given the situation. And yes, I most certainly could be a lawyer or a clerk at Sears. Now, please take a moment and read those articles and check out Ms. JHK's conduct before you insinuate anything with me.

<dd>Triton, you haven't been exactly nice to Julie from the start, calling her edits "unfounded whims" and telling her to learn more about a subject that she teaches. I think it is understandable that she got aggravated. If you both calm down, it might be possible to work out an agreeable solution. Just try to understand her point of view, and then try to find a solution that would be acceptable to both of you. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 00:26 27 May 2003 (UTC)~</dd>

<p>I must beg to differ. User Ms. JHK belitted another user at <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_I_25db.html" title="Clovis I">Clovis I</a> a few weeks ago. That condescending attitude, calling that erstwhile contributor a liar was not tolerable to me. I happen to know a tiny bit about the Merovingians, so I objected to her deletions that were made solely because she says so. No facts, no substantation. Only because she says she is this or that. Yet, I can't find one single publication by "Dr. JHK", even if she could prove she is who she says she is. Encyclopedias are supposed to be books of facts, not books of opinions or theories. Read my article today on Clovis I that she deleted. She then accused me of copyright violation of the text (no proof) then belittled my very precise, accurate and 100% factual work. Why? Then she accused my maps of being copyright violation. WRONG! But, I proved it, I didn't just say it. And, what does she teach. This is the Internet. Identity theft, claims of education, occupation, mean nothing. What does though, is the content of ones work and I challenge Ms. JHK to find one fault in mine -- with proof. Now, look at her work and attitude. With all due respect, what I see is unlike any teacher I ever had, and quite often I swear I think I'm Einstein, Joe that is.<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriton_8995.html" title="User:Triton">Triton</a></p>

<p>I don't want sympathy. That's rather a hilarious thought on this site with all the outbursts like poor old Andre today. I already pointed out Ms. JHK's conduct. Did you tell her to be nice? Please show me where I was less than tolerable of a difficult situation I most certainly did not cause. AND, why do you allow sysop JHK to delete this picture AFTER YOU posted its validity? Put an end to the crap and you won't hear rrom me other than quality input which you are totally cognizant of. I just don't get it. Did you even look at how she belittled someone on the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clovis_I_25db.html" title="Clovis I">Clovis I</a> talk page. She drove away other sincere users who were actually trying to make a contribution.

<dd>Thank you for referencing <a href="../../../c/l/o/Talk%7EClovis_I_1d1d.html" title="Talk:Clovis I">Talk:Clovis I</a>. I find Julie's messages there to be entirely appropriate and well-reasoned. Nothing she did involved use of any sysop powers, much less <i>ab</i>use. She mentions particular sources and authors, and offers to double-check those sources. You, on the other hand, come in flames a-blazing, refuse to cite sources, don't respond to requests for more details on sources, make constant accusations of abuse of sysop powers that are completely unsubstantiated, and have some weird fixation on "a detailed procedure required for deleting photos" (no photos were deleted, but indeed the procedure for deleting them involves first putting notes on talk pages and removing the image reference from articles, exactly what Julie did). --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 02:05 27 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please cite my misconduct and define it. According to you the following from <a href="../../../c/l/o/Talk%7EClovis_I_1d1d.html" title="Talk:Clovis I">Talk:Clovis I</a> is perfectly acceptable conduct by someone deleting another persons work without reason or proving supporting evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>The statement about all prominent scholars considering the Merovingians to be French is at best a sad demonstration of obtuseness by a well-meaning amateur, at worst, a deliberate misinterpretation and/or outright lie.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Where every decent person comes from Mr. Vibber, it is reprehensible conduct. No one making an honest effort to Wikipedia wants to be put down like this. It smacks of intolerance. And again, please dear sir, read before you speak. The contributor left this site months ago because he was degraded and belittled for trying. And what, you want me to come along, accept Ms. JHK's false articles and congratulate her for belittling the contributor? Sometoimes, we need to tell people the truth. Also, Mr. Vibber, look at the bottom of this page at what the honorable <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> has said. It is a diatribe by someone bordering on paranoia. You made no reprimand here, nor did you respond to his spreading this lie despite you being the key party to the truth:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Same refusal to say where the images come from</i></li>
</ul>
<p>So, I assume insinuations, unproven allegations, and derogatory remarks are acceptable to you too. If not, please speak out. Mr, Vibber try and deal straight up and above board. Treat all users equally. And yes, I read a great deal of the sysop wars over Fred's stuff and others. Where is the manners you claim you want in that kind of diatribe? Thank you. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriton_8995.html" title="User:Triton">Triton</a></p>

By the way, Paul Halsall states on the Internet Sourcebook home page that he reserves copyright on electronic versions he has posted -- does that mean that, if he scanned and resized the picture at Clovis I, he now can claim a new copyright on that version? Fortunately, he also states that permission to use is granted if no financial gain is to be made -- so I guess we're in the clear if Bomis isn't making money -- but what happens if it does become a commercial venture?

<p>Hi, Brion. Sorry, Tuf-Kat has derived me to you because of a message I post on the Village pump, for my loggin isn't working right or I AM NOT WORKING RIGHT (I have been an anonymous user and contributor since some time ago, but I've created the account yesterday night), the fact is that I can get logged in "my" page, but I'm not logged in when using then Wikipedia; the username and Log out words do not appear at the corner of the screen, and a little contribution I have made to see if it could be registered was saved but not registered on my historial. I have received a message about 22 hs before to notify I wasn't logged, but I don't know what to do. I tried to re-create the account, but it is already created (by me); anyhow, at any time I try to log in again it is accepted by the program. I was warned that I interfere with other users if that happens, so I'd like to solve this problem for I'd like to stay here. If you have any solution, an explanation or what to do, or need more data about me, please leave me a message on my page; anyway, I'm going to visit your talk page later or tomorrow.

<dd>While we're talking ru: anyway, a couple of weeks ago (around the time of the server change? might not be just a coincidence), the should-be-Unicode on ru: started not quite working right for me. I still see most of the characters correctly, but some of them come up as garbage of the "?,?"?&gt;?." kind. I can't be entirely sure I didn't screw things up somehow on my own browser, though. If it would help, I can show you over on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JohnOwens/Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JohnOwens/Sandbox" rel="nofollow">my Russian sandbox</a> exactly what I see instead of the correct characters. For what it's worth, the relevant meta tag from the source is &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;. I'm using the Russian version of Mozilla to do that, with a separate user account with LANG=ru_RU set and all that. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 06:05 16 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My Mozilla 1.3.1 seems to grok ru.wiki okay; I suspect browser trouble on your end. Do you only have trouble when editing, or does it show garbage on existing pages as well? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 17:42 16 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I had meant to mention that, but I guess it slipped past me. It's the same on existing pages too. Still not all the characters, just a few. My main concern is my vanilla Russian version of Mozilla-1.3, but pretty much the same issue comes up on my regular English Galeon-1.2.10/Mozilla-1.3 installation, except instead of seeing question marks I get the square boxes with the hex code "FFFD" in them, generally followed by a punctuation character. So I'm about as ready to suspect font issues as browser trouble. But both were working fine for a while after I installed some more fonts, and figured out what to use for the encoding setting. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 09:36 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More followup: I just noticed that the characters that aren't showing right most places, do show up right when <b>I</b> enter them into an edit window. However, if they're in the edit window because they were already on the page I'm editing, they still come up borked. So at least I know my browser's doing <i>something</i> right, even if not everything. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 21:08 18 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another note: on IE at a friend's house now, I can see the correct characters, and if you look at <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JohnOwens/Sandbox" class="external text" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JohnOwens/Sandbox" rel="nofollow">my Russian sandbox</a>, what I see here (after having edited the page in Mozilla, where the characters looked funny) is the first keyboard layout diagram showing up correctly, but the second showing what I got instead for the error characters. It shows all the characters correctly in the older versions.</dd>
<dd>Any idea whether this would be a Mozilla issue or a XFree86 fonts issue? I'm not real clear just where the one ends, and the other begins. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 23:34 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brion, I would like to explain a bit why I object to the words "our" and "we" on the meta-pages: The person who reads this is proabably contributing to the project to some degree, so he/she <i>is</i> a part of this project. Using such words creates the illusion that there is some separate, established elite ("we") that governs the project, which I'm afraid may exist in part (<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>), but that's not the point. The point is to encourage casual, knowledgable contributors to participate and avoid the false perception of wikipedia being distant, idiosyncratic aim of some closed group of followers.

<p>Are we still running the slow query log? I strongly suspect that out of control sysop queries are responsible for the occasional slowdowns we have. What else could there be? Most of the special pages are disabled, the search load should be distributed equally over time. Last time we ran the log, we saw queries that took many minutes. IMHO they should be disabled except for developers. Important queries could be run by them. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 17:56 24 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I sent some feedback to Apple about the Safari bug causing Non-western characters turn into quesionmarks. Let's hope thay can fix it quickly. Thanks for reproducing the bug in 1.0, because they wouldn't have investigated a beta bug having just released "the real thing". --<a href="../../../j/u/x/User%7EJuxo_4169.html" title="User:Juxo">Juxo</a> 08:54 26 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Brion! If it's not too much trouble, could you see about increasing the difference in heading sizes in the standard stylesheet? It's pretty hard to tell some of them apart. I've left a note on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a> about it. Thanks! -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 21:43 27 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, I wondered if might be a historical reason for the current heading sizes. I agree that letting the lowest-level headings get smaller than the normal text is dumb, and shouldn't really be an option (though, are there browsers that actually do this with default sizes? I haven't personally encountered it).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think using other stylistic alterations may be the best solution. Normally, I would suggest different colors, but I don't think that's the best course in this case. Underlining may work, but I've always found underlined text to be confusing, since it's almost automatic to assume that underlines mean links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Variation in weight may alone be enough. Since level 1 is already more or less fixed (and since we should really only see one of those per article, namely the title), that leaves 5 levels. Perhaps 3 distinct sizes, distinguished by weight, something like:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>h2 { font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; }</dd>
<dd>h3 { font-size: 130%; font-weight: normal; }</dd>
<dd>h4 { font-size: 115%; font-weight: bold; }</dd>
<dd>h5 { font-size: 115%; font-weight: normal; }</dd>
<dd>h6 { font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold; }</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The distinction between h2/h3 is probably the most important, since articles rarely go any deeper than that. Italicization may also be helpful in making the different levels distinct, but there it becomes less obvious which levels are higher than others (is italic "higher" or "lower" than bold?) If we could rely on browsers to implement all of CSS2, we could have even more freedom, and do things like font stretching, small-caps, etc., but that's probably not going to be the case anytime soon. Let me know if you think the above suggestion would work. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 01:14 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. - This shouldn't be taken as holy scripture or anything, but the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props" class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props" rel="nofollow">CSS2 spec</a> suggests that 1.2 is a good scaling factor between adjacent font "levels" (they're referring to the context of small/medium/large, but I think it applies here too). So it should probably go something more like 100%, 120%, 144%... -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 01:21 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but this isn't the first time I have had a problem with Anthere on the Gaia articles. I and others have tried to work with her before, but she refused to discuss anything; she again is just using reversions. No talk or discussion, mind you. Just reverts. And worst of all, Anthere has no regard for how thousands of other English speakers and scientists use these terms.</p>
<p>English speakers just do not use the terminolgy she uses. I have read books on this subject, articles on the subject, and followed Google links to a huge number of websites. The result is always the same: She doesn't know she is talking about. This isn't about science, mind you. It isn't about NPOV. Its only about Anthere's perculiar terminology. This isn't the French Wikipedia, its the English one. If she doesn't like, she can go elsewhere. But her reversions, and refusal to even admit that English speakers *might* be misled by her private terminology only proves that she is not a team player. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:02 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any reason to? The reason we recommend unblocking IP addresses after a while is that they are not tied to people; many IPs are dynamic (either on a short cycle like PPP connections, or a long cycle like most DSL users, who may end up with a new IP every couple of months) or may be shared by multiple people more directly (proxies, public workstations). A login account is different, because only one person uses it (or, hypothetically, a group of people sharing a password might use one account together). Blocking an account doesn't prevent <i>other</i> people who never used that account and never will from editing, while blocking an IP may and sometimes does block other people who happen to use the same net provider. In that case, unblocking an IP after a while reduces the chance that we're blocking innocent people, while at the same time there is a much reduced chance that the problem person would come back with that IP in any case: the utility of an IP ban decreases sharply over time. A login account, though, can only be used by that problem person. Unblocking an account that was only used once during a vandalism spree by someone inserting the goatse.cx image and other sophomoric sexual humor into a serious encyclopedia is unlikely to benefit anyone. Nor is leaving the ban in place likely to harm anyone. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 19:12 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Something funny has happened with one of my edits. Is it ok to tell you here or should I have done a bug report? I made an edit and clicked save but it was taking ages to save so I pressed stop on my browser because I decided to write more about it. Then I realised it had saved (as it was in recent changes). However, <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> noticed that the edit logs <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=1097487" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=1097487" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=1097488" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=1097488" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> lead to the same edit--the one he made.

<p>Brion,</p>
<p>I think the version of the code running on test.wikipedia.org is not the latest CVS version. I cannot reproduce the escaping bug on one of the test pages with my version.</p>

<dd>You're quite right; when I put that version up I couldn't get to the CVS server, so installed my slightly outdated copy.</dd>

<dd>We just need to make sure we can upgrade all wikis easily from CVS, then we have to set up branches for stable/unstable development, auto-update test from unstable once per day and manually update the non-English wikis to stable regularly. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 01:55 3 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>*cough* Could you replace Article.php on test.wiki with CVS? That contains an important bugfix that caused top sections to overwrite the article when saved in preview mode. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 02:16 3 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Making LinksUpdate faster should not be too hard. Right now it's really, really dumb and evil. I think this is a case where a data comparison should be done on arrays, the old link status and the new one, and then two loops should be run to 1) insert new links 2) delete removed links. To do the comparison, maybe we could keep a backup copy of the Links Cache object before we overwrite it. Otherwise we would just have to read in the state of the Links table; SELECTing is fast, INSERTing is not.</p>
<p>Even locally saving a page with many links takes very long because of our current braindead process. Someone on one of our wikis is probably saving such a long page every few minutes, at which point the entire wiki would always slow down slightly.</p>
