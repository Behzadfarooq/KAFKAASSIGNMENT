<p><b>Brickwork</b> <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masonry.html" title="Masonry">masonry</a> is produced when a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bricklayer.html" title="Bricklayer">bricklayer</a> uses <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brick.html" title="Brick">bricks</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28masonry%29.html" title="Mortar (masonry)">mortar</a> to build up structures such as <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall.html" title="Wall">walls</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge.html" title="Bridge">bridges</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimney.html" title="Chimney">chimneys</a>. (Brickwork is also used to finish openings such as doors or windows in buildings made of other materials.) Where the bricks are to remain fully visible, as opposed to being covered up by <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaster.html" title="Plaster">plaster</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stucco.html" title="Stucco">stucco</a>, this is known as <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facade.html" title="Facade">face-work</a>.</p>
<p>Bricks are laid to expose their ends (Header bricks), or sides (Stretcher bricks). As the work progresses, the bricks are laid in rows called courses. The manner in which the bricks overlap as they are laid up is called the <i>bond</i>. Types of bond include English bond, Flemish bond, and Herringbone bond, but the most common type of brickwork seen these days is the simple stretcher bond, showing only the long side-surface of the brick.</p>
<p>Because only the outside of finished brickwork is visible, cheaper grades of brick are commonly used for the hidden parts of a wall. In an old red-brick house, behind the front of red, the rest of the walls are often made of softer yellow bricks. The colour situation may be reversed if the house was built when red bricks were out of fashion. So with certain types of bond (e.g. garden wall bond) it is possible to use a higher ratio of cheaper bricks to more expensive bricks, making for a cheaper wall of the same dimensions. On the same house, sometimes a more economical "garden wall" bond has been used at the side and rear compared to the front.</p>
<p>The thickness of brickwork is measured in units of brick. If bricks are put down end-to-end with the long side facing you (stretchers) and then another row on top, the wall thickness is half a brick.</p>
<p>There are rules of bonding, which have some exceptions. These specify the overlap between courses that is visible outside the wall, and also the overlap which must be made within the wall, for walls which are more than half a brick thick.</p>
<p>Brickwork, like unreinforced <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete.html" title="Concrete">concrete</a>, has little tensile strength, and works by everything being kept in compression.</p>
<p>Brickwork <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arch.html" title="Arch">arches</a> can <a href="../../../s/p/a/Span.html" title="Span">span</a> great distances, and carry considerable loads.</p>

<p>When laying <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brick.html" title="Brick">bricks</a>, the manner in which the bricks overlap is called the <b>bond</b>. A brick laid with the longest side exposed is called a <i>stretcher</i> brick, as opposed to a <i>header</i>, where only the smallest end of the brick is exposed to the weather. The length of one stretcher is the same as two header bricks, side-by-side, including the 10mm joint between.</p>
<p>The thickness of a brick wall is measured using a unit of length known as 'the brick'. This standard can be used consistently with the wide variety of brick sizes available ("modular, "Norman" brick, etc.). The length of the longest face for a particular size of brick equals "one brick", for the purposes of measuring a wall built from such bricks.</p>

Stretcher bond</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Stretcher bond</b> (also known as <b>running bond</b> or <b>monotonous stretcher bond</b>) is the most common bond in modern times, as it is easy to lay, with little waste. Entirely comprised of stretcher bricks, set in rows (or "courses") that are offset by half a brick.</p>
<p>Running bond uses no header bricks, allowing for a thin wall of one layer (half of a 'brick' unit). Two such walls may be built close together with a gap between. The two "skins" are usually tied together at regular intervals using wall ties. For this reason this bond is sometimes known as "<a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavity_wall.html" title="Cavity wall">cavity wall</a> bond", although it is possible to give the appearance of other bonds in a half-brick cavity wall, either through extensive brick-cutting or the use of purpose-made half-bricks. In some climates the cavity may be filled with cavity wall <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermal_insulation.html" title="Thermal insulation">insulation</a>.</p>
<p>Stretcher bond may also be used to build a single-<a href="../../../w/y/t/Wythe.html" title="Wythe">wythe</a> (one brick thick) wall without a deliberate cavity. In this case, wall ties are used to hold the two wythes together. The main advantage of this technique is that it allows walls with both faces visible, such as domestic dwarf walls, to be built using low-cost bricks that have only two fair faces, called "face bricks". Laying any such brick as a header would reveal a poorly finished header face on one side of the wall. These walls are also used in situations where stronger load bearing capacity is required than that given by a single stretcher bond wall with engaged piers.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

English bond</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This bond is made up of alternating courses of stretchers and headers. This produces a solid wall that is a full brick in depth. English bond is fairly easy to lay and is the strongest bond for a one-brick-thick wall. If only one face of an English bond wall is exposed, one quarter of the bricks are not visible, and hence may be of low visual quality.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

Flemish bond</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Flemish Bond, also known as Dutch Bond, has historically always been considered the most decorative bond, and for this reason was used extensively for dwellings until the adoption of the cavity wall. It is created by alternately laying headers and stretchers in a single course. The next course is laid so that a header lies in the middle of the stretcher in the course below. Again, this bond is one brick thick. It is quite difficult to lay Flemish bond properly, since for best effect all the perpends (vertical <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28masonry%29.html" title="Mortar (masonry)">mortar</a> joints) need to be vertically aligned. If only one face of an Flemish bond wall is exposed, one third of the bricks are not visible, and hence may be of low visual quality. This is a better ratio than for English bond, Flemish bond's main rival for load-bearing walls.</p>
<p>A common variation often found in early 18th Century buildings is Glazed-headed Flemish Bond, in which the exposed headers are burned until they vitrify with a black glassy surface. The resultant wall has a 'polka dot' look to it.</p>
<p>Monk bond is a variant of Flemish bond, with two stretchers between the headers in each row, and the headers centred over the join between the two stretchers in the row below.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

Rat-trap bond used in a garden wall</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These bonds are variations on normal bonds. They use a high proportion of stretchers, and hence require fewer facing bricks than normal bonds. This makes them less sturdy, but cheaper to lay. As such they are most commonly used for garden- and other non-load-bearing walls.</p>
<p>Rat-trap bond is a type of garden wall bond in which the stretchers and headers are laid on their sides, with the base of the stretcher facing outwards. This gives a wall with an internal cavity bridged by the headers, hence the name. The main advantage of this bond is economy in use of bricks, giving a wall of one brick thickness with fewer bricks than a solid bond. Rat-trap bond was in common usage in England for building houses of fewer than 3 stories up to the turn of the 20th century and is today still used in India as an economical bond, as well for the insulation properties offered by the air cavity. Also, many brick walls surrounding kitchen gardens were designed with cavities so hot air could circulate in the winter, warming fruit trees or other produce spread against the walls, causing them to bloom earlier and forcing early fruit production.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

<p>American common bond is made by laying the courses of headers where they are separated by approximately five to seven courses of stretchers. On occasion American common bond can be found with nine courses of stretchers between courses of headers. The stretcher courses are most often an uneven number. English common bond is an early variation with only three courses of stretchers between header courses.</p>
