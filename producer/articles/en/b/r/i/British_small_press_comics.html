<p><b>British small press comics</b> is a term used to describe <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic books</a> self-published by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoonist.html" title="Cartoonist">cartoonists</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book_creator.html" title="Comic book creator">comic book creators</a> within the UK. It also serves to describe the loose community of creators, publishers and facilitators involved in their production and distribution.</p>
<p>A "small press comic" is essentially a <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zine.html" title="Zine">zine</a> predominantly comprised of comic strips. The origins of the term is uncertain but probably emerged in the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and serves to distinguish them from zines <i>about</i> comics.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_small_press_comics.html" title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
<p>Traditionally, a <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_press.html" title="Small press">small press</a> publisher was literally a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher.html" title="Publisher">publisher</a> who operated on a small scale, often with a manual printing press in-house, producing limited print-runs of publications that larger more commercially inclined publishers would reject.</p>
<p>The history of British small press comics is tied up with the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_press.html" title="Underground press">underground press</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> with publications such as <i><a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_%28magazine%29.html" title="Oz (magazine)">Oz</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Times_8f44.html" title="International Times">International Times</a></i>, the British underground comix scene led by Nasty Tales and <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knockabout_Comics_04a0.html" title="Knockabout Comics">Knockabout Comics</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and with the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_zine.html" title="Punk zine">Punk zine</a> explosions of the late <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. The latter was probably more significant as it was born of cheap and accessible <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photocopying.html" title="Photocopying">photocopying</a>. This dramatic lowering of technological <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barriers_to_entry.html" title="Barriers to entry">barriers to entry</a> meant anyone could produce a publication with a print run as low as one regardless of commercial potential. Although sometimes small press comics are a good "stepping stone" to the mainstream. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andi_Watson_13ad.html" title="Andi Watson">Andi Watson</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Grist_9caf.html" title="Paul Grist">Paul Grist</a> both broke through to commercial fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Within the British comics <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fandom.html" title="Fandom">fandom</a> of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> there were many zines <i>about</i> comics, mainly concentrating on American <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a> titles. Since high-street retailers of comics were scarce these zines ran <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail_order.html" title="Mail order">mail order</a> services and relied on the postal service for distribution. The first and most famous being <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_Advertiser_51f4.html" title="Fantasy Advertiser">Fantasy Advertiser</a>. There were also regular <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market.html" title="Market">markets</a> or "marts" which also served as a social meeting place for aficionados. This gave a backbone for small press comics to emerge and in many cases react against.</p>
<p><a name="Formats" id="Formats"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_small_press_comics.html" title="Edit section: Formats">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Formats</span></h2>
<p>Due to the popularity of photocopying as a means of production, the dominant format for British small press comics is the A5 booklet comprising of any number of double-sided A4 photocopies folded and stapled across the middle. Variations on the <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_216_03c7.html" title="ISO 216">ISO 216</a> paper size system are frequent with sizes under A6 commonly known as "minis" after American <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minicomics.html" title="Minicomics">minicomics</a>. Minis have been known to go as small as 4.5cm² though A6 and A7 are more common. A4 is the second most common size though A3 (single sheets bound without folding) has been known. Creative forms of folding and cutting exist producing odd shapes have been tried out by Rich Holden in his "chain mesh" and "mini mesh" series of minis.</p>
<p>As it has become cheaper and short print-runs viable, many small press comics are being printed professionally.</p>
<p>Small press comics have traditionally been black and white due to technological and financial limitations, though in recent years cheap <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkjet_printer.html" title="Inkjet printer">inkjet printer</a> cartridges have made full colour more viable, especially for covers.</p>
<p>A common trait for small press comics is to be collated and stapled by hand and often extra flourishes will be added such a hand colouring or decoration making the comic something of an <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work_of_art.html" title="Work of art">art object</a>, the perfect example being <a href="../../../r/i/a/Rian_Hughes_65b1.html" title="Rian Hughes">Rian Hughes</a>' early small press comics.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_small_press_comics.html" title="Edit section: Distribution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The predominant form of distribution for small press comics is by <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail.html" title="Mail">mail</a>. Most publishers will post individual copies direct to the reader with orders coming from <a href="../../../r/e/v/Review.html" title="Review">reviews</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classified_advertising.html" title="Classified advertising">classified adverts</a>, websites/email lists or <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_of_mouth.html" title="Word of mouth">word of mouth</a> from flyers which arrive with other small press comix. If a creator has a regular series they may take <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subscription_business_model.html" title="Subscription business model">subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>Creators who live in the same area or share similar goals will sometimes group together as a loose <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective.html" title="Collective">collective</a> to share resources, often bringing their titles together in a catalogue/website or under an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imprint.html" title="Imprint">imprint</a> and sharing tables at conventions and marts.</p>
<p>There is usually one or more mail order service, commonly known as a "distro", operating in the UK. These will hold a wide range of titles and take a cut of the cover price. The main distro at this time is <a href="http://smallzone.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://smallzone.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">SmallZone</a>.</p>
<p>Comics conventions and festivals will often have a small press presence where publishers are able to display their wares at a reduced rate. There are also events specific to small press comics such as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Caption_%28comics_convention%29.html" title="Caption (comics convention)">Caption</a> in <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and the <a href="http://www.ukwebcomixthing.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.ukwebcomixthing.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Web and Mini Comix Thing</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>
<p>Distribution into comic book stores via traditional distributors (such as <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_Comic_Distributors_e0cb.html" title="Diamond Comic Distributors">Diamond</a>) is rare. Stores will often stock titles by local creators though some, notably <a href="http://www.goshlondon.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.goshlondon.com/" rel="nofollow">Gosh!</a> in London and <a href="http://www.page45.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.page45.com/" rel="nofollow">Page 45</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham.html" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, stock a wider range and deal with small press comics on a level playing field. In recent times small press titles have sold in larger bookstores <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borders_Group_eb88.html" title="Borders Group">Borders</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/y/Foyles.html" title="Foyles">Foyles</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>
<p>Creators will often make international links to these forms of distribution in other countries and vice versa.</p>

<p>Given the <a href="../../../d/i/y/DIY_ethic_b8ba.html" title="DIY ethic">DIY</a> nature of producing and distributing small press comics there have been countless organisations, setups and collectives operating in the last 30 years. Some significant ones past and present include:</p>

<p>With communication mainly taking place by post or online, there is no geographical centre for British small press comics. However, creators who discover they live in the same town will often meet up. In doing so they form a local scene. Some significant local scenes have included:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Birmingham&#160;</dt>
<dd>The Birmingham Arts Lab was an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_Council_of_Great_Britain_80be.html" title="Arts Council of Great Britain">Arts Council</a> funded organisation in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> that was in effect hijacked by <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunt_Emerson_233b.html" title="Hunt Emerson">Hunt Emerson</a> and other local cartoonists from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> producing <i>Large Cow Comix</i>, <i>Street Comix</i> and <i>Thunderdogs</i>. In 2006, a new comics festival took place at the Custard Factory in Central Birmingham, organised by Smallzone's Shane Chebsey and team. The festival is intended to be a regular feature in the UK comic book calender.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Brighton&#160;</dt>
<dd>As the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> capital of the UK it is unsurprising that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton.html" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> has been home to many small press cartoonists. The distro and publisher <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slab-O-Concrete_8b40.html" title="Slab-O-Concrete">Slab-O-Concrete</a> was based here and during the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> a regular art show and anthology, <i>Sofa</i>, featured local cartoonists.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Liverpool&#160;</dt>
<dd>The Liverpool Cartoon Workshop run by Ian Herring had a significant influence on the regions small press output which continues to this day. The reviews zine <i>Zum!</i> was based in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>London&#160;</dt>
<dd>Given the size of the capital there has always been a significant small press presence in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> but it has usually been amalgamated into the general comics scene. Events such as the Westminister comics mart and the annual <a href="../../../u/k/c/UKCAC_ec99.html" title="UKCAC">UKCAC</a> convention had a strong small press presence throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> and the Cartoon Art Trust embraced the small press, especially when Paul Gravett was the curator. The London Cartoon Centre ran regular classes in comic art during the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> which produced a number of small press anthologies. The <a href="http://www.ukwebcomixthing.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.ukwebcomixthing.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">UK Web and Mini Comix Thing</a> is a yearly event combining small press and webcomics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Oxford&#160;</dt>
<dd>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> a number of members of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford University</a> comic book society became interested in the British small press comics scene and started the yearly Caption convention which continues to this day.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Other Regions&#160;</dt>
<dd>Many other regions of the UK have had significant concentrations of small press comics creators including <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading</a>.</dd>
