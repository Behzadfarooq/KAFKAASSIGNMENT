<p>The first link did not work. The second link was not only a biased source, but specificially stated that BBC "aimed to be" so. The survey that was brought up did not cover a wide geographic region, and made no mention of other news stations. The third link just discusses BBC's popularity in Kabul. Regardless, no matter how many surveys you provide, this statement cannot be proven since you are assuming all these surveys are valid. I think it should be changed to: "The British Broadcasting Corporation or BBC is one of the most widely respected broadcasting organisation in the world." Just as their are praises, there are attacks <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/tories/story/0,10475,953560,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/tories/story/0,10475,953560,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>Note that <i>not even the page you linked to</i> suggests that there is a <i>more</i> widely respected broadcasting organiation. "The most widely respected" does not mean "perfect", it simply means "more respected than any other" - and of this there is no question. Even here in Australia, where we have the superb ABC (which is quite possibly better than the BBC, all things considered), the BBC is known for what it is: the best-respected broadcaster in the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are two sins one can commit when writing. One is to say something that isn't true. The other is to <i>not</i> say something that <i>is</i> true. Our job is to tell it like it is - and the BBC is <b>not</b> "one of the most widely respected" broadcasters. No other broadcaster has anything like the same credibility as the BBC. It is <b>the</b> most widely respected, on all five continents. (All 6 if you count Europe as a continent too.) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 04:44 23 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You still don't have sufficient proof. Statistics can lie or be made to lie. Do you have links to other surveys not done by the British government, which polls more than a small fragment of the world's population in a few select cities? You may think BBC is credible, but I know people who think otherwise. Try posting the BBC report on Jessica Lynch (and how the story was fabricated by the US) on a conservative American forum and see BBC get shot down in a second. How's adding the phrase "is widely regarded as the most respected..."? Otherwise, you're just endorsing a single govt survey, and that's both illogical and POV.</dd>

<p>The difference is, few people take commercial johhny-come-latelies like CNN seriously - not as credible, <i>respected</i> broadcasters. And CNN <i>only</i> does news - i.e., they are not a full-service broadcaster at all. On the world stage, they are just wannabes. <i>Especially</i> everywhere except the USA. And <i>Reuters</i> isn't even a broadcaster, for the love of Mike! Reuter's is an <i>agency</i>. The statistics you claim are the "proof" are merely icing on the cake. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Saying "few people" take CNN seriously is just a personal opinion, and also unprovable, but that's besides the point...If those statistics are merely "icing," what other studies <i>prove</i> that the BBC is "most widely respected"? I'm modifying the statement with a perhaps, because even if the evidence <i>suggests</i> this to be true, it can never be fully proven. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 09:41 23 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is simply no question on this issue. There are no rivals. CNN is simply a news organization broadcasting in English. The BBC is much more than this. The <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_World_Service_bff7.html" title="BBC World Service">BBC World Service</a> broadcasts in 43 languages. The BBC World service website has interactive content in English, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish. It is the radio station of choice for a vast number of people outside of the UK, many of whom, in places like <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwe.html" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> don't trust their own broadcasters. BBC News is widely regarded as the premier news organization of the world with more correspondents (un-syndicated) worldwide than any other organization. It is well known throughout the world for its lack of commercialism, unbiased even-handed reporting (although some will always dispute this). Forgetting about news for a moment, BBC produced television programmes (particularly drama, comedy and natural history) are without question extremely highly regarded throughout the world. On to the web, look at Alexa, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBCi_ad50.html" title="BBCi">BBCi</a> sites on sport, history, education, science, technology, languages, news, the arts, health, DIY, H2G2, children's activates, finance, business, gardening, cooking, fashion, natural history etc etc etc. regularly feature in the top five of all these categories. It consistently rates as the #1 site outside of the USA for every category. Various arms of the organisation consistently win awards for excellence in many countries throughout the world. There are so many ways in which the BBC has gained international respect that "without question" it is the most respected broadcaster in the world. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 11:31 23 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I certainly count BBC as my favorite and one I respect, I'm not sure how folks here who honestly strive for NPOV can make the outright claim of BBC being "the most widely <b>respected</b>." Might this group consider "the most widely <b>regarded</b>" which Merriam-Webster defines as "to pay attention to&#160;: take into consideration or account" which is closer to what most of the people here have argued, and is more NPOV. It's more subtle, but more accurate. For those who still like "respect", the third definition of "regard" in Merriam-Webster is "to show respect or consideration for" so perhaps there is something in this word for everyone? - <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 23:03 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Respect, regard - I'm happy either way. I'm <i>not</i> happy when out of an overdose of (perfectly laudable) desire to make the 'pedia factual, we water down known facts of which there cannot be any reasonable doubt in order to replace them with bland vagueness. Where does it end? "Many people believe that water usually freezes at zero degress Celsius"? The BBC has a unique position and an unmatched reputation. Any <i>factual</i> article on the BBC must say so, otherwise it's a waste of space. (And not that I am <i>not</i> from the UK and, in general, take a pretty dim view of the place. (Yeah, yeah, freezing point isn't exactly 0 degress, but you get the idea.) - <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 23:36 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is generally accepted that the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_World_Service_bff7.html" title="BBC World Service">BBC World Service</a> is the worlds most respected radio news service across the world, Its probably a bit of a stretch to say that the whole BBC is <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 23:53 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fact that water freezes at 0 degrees C is <i>proven</i> through empirical data time and again. The word "respect" is a matter of opinion. No matter how many surveys you pull up (only one so far) you cannot <i>prove</i> that it is true. The sheer amount of people in the world just makes the margin of error too large. Even if the BBC is most prominent, you cannot prove that it is <i>respected</i>. Some people have no faith in the BBC. How many? Who knows? How is there no reasonable doubt? This is something you fail to prove. You can spice up <i>your</i> opinion, but BBC's ubiquitous presence does nothing to say that is has a good reputation. The fact is your opinion, not mine. Maybe you are right, but I cannot be sure because there will never be data to prove it. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 01:05 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jiang, in your desire to achieve NPOV, you are losing the plot and throwing out the baby in order to keep the bathwater. So far in this discussion, there has been ONE and ONLY ONE suggestion that any <i>other</i> broadcasting organisation is the most respected - and the CNN suggestion was laughed out of court. (See above.) Unless you count the Reuters suggestion of course - but that one is even more absurd, as Reuters aren't even a broadcaster, they are (of course) an agency. In other words, no-one in this thread has even managed to suggest ONE credible alternative to the BBC. That in itself is very powerful evidence indeed, were more evidence needed, which it is not. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not arguing that BBC is not most prominent/well known. However, you keep trying to explain how it is. Prominence does not equate with respect. Respect is an opinon that cannot be proven. Just because BBC is around more than other broadcasters doesn't make it respected. That has not been proven and never will be. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 13:01 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jiang, I cannot prove that you exist, but without conclusive evidence I am willing to believe that you do and that you are a reasonable guy. The question that Tannin puts is the acid test for this question. Who else can rival the BBC in this regard. Please name some alternative candidates for the position of "most regarded/respected" broadcaster in the world. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 14:33 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)~</p>

<dd>Ask yourself, given Wikipedia's dedication to NPOV, is it at all appropriate to be fighting so hard to declare BBC "most widely respected?" There are over 1 billion people in China who don't get BBC and consider People's Daily the final word on matters. Should we put down People's Daily as the "most widely respected" Chinese publication? Be proud of BBC, but let's stick to the spirit of NPOV. - <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 14:40 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly the point. No-one bar the BBC - and I mean <i>no-one</i> has that kind of respect around the world, in all sorts of places. NPOV requires that we report the facts. Leaving important facts out is a gross violation of NPOV. (And what have <i>I</i> got to be proud of about it?

<dd>No contradiction -- there are indeed BBC viewers/listeners in China, but a tiny minority. That's why it stated "over 1 billion" and not all 1.3 billion. And even though I'm not British, I <i>am</i> proud of BBC, as the highest example of what Western values can produce -- a multilingual, fair, accurate and globally aware news organization. But that is my opinion, and I am not about to assume the other 5 billion people outside of the immediate Western influence would agree. - <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 23:25 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Most respected" or "most trusted" are better, I think.

" which was reverted by Tanin. Not that I believe in this solution--it's just a note.</p>
<p>There is no certainty behind something unmeasured such as "respect." If "regard" is taken to mean respect, this article is still not factual. Maybe BBC is the best available alternative for some people, but is that respect? That just shows a comparative preference, but no definate statement of certainty. Is the US military respected just because it is stationed throughout the world and Liberians are now asking for US intervention? I'm not saying it's not respected; it's just impossible to be sure. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 09:23, 2 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is the website of a coalition petitioning the BBC to retain shortwave World Service broadcasts to North America and the Pacific (which the BBC's accountants believe are adequately covered by other methods).

<dd>American public broadcasting is underfunded and small-scale compared to the BBC. This is why it is not well known, not necessarily because it has bad journalism.

<dd>The power-cut is only the top because the events are listed chronologically and it's the earlist event anyone has bothered to put under that heading.

<p>Sorry guys, but the first paragraph of the article now says, 'the most widely regarded broadcasting...' which cannot be claimed to be either true or untrue as it's actually meaningless. It SHOULD say either 'highly regarded' or 'widely respected'! DOH! <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisjj_d9e1.html" title="User:Chrisjj">Chris Jefferies</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Old wounds. It should be neither, but we've been wrangling over this for a while. How about "a highly regarded" rather than "the most highly regarded"? I'm not happy with the former either, but certainly "the most" is inappropriate for NPOV. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 13:45, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A "whole host of people" is not a plurality of people. Just because another broadcaster with similar amount of cheer squads cannot be found does not prove how BBC is respected.

Here's some logic. The statement is - "The BBC is the most widely repected broadcaster in the world" - For this NOT to be true another broadcaster must be equally or more widely repected.</p>
<p>Therefore. - The question is NOT - Is the BBC respected more people than those who do not respect it? - The question is - Is the BBC respected more than any other broadcaster?</p>
<p>In order for the statement to be proven untrue you must provide an alternative. Please provide an alternative. If there is no alternative.

<dd>Well spoken, Mintguy. It is our job, as 'pedia editors, to report known facts in plain language, and to avoid weasel terms like "according to some". When there is genuine doubt or controversy, it is our job to say so. When there is a clear and well-attested fact, it is our job to say that too. Note well, in all the months that this debate has been running, there has not been one single credible alternative to the BBC as "most widely respected broadcasting organisation" suggested. The BBC has a special place in broadcasting and has done for many years. Outside of the narrow and often trivial interests of UK citizens watching Faulty Towers re-runs, the importance of the BBC World Service as a trusted source of news is crucial. Any article about the BBC that does not mention this key aspect of the BBC isn't worth the paper it is written on. It would be like writing about George W Bush and not bothering to mention that he is the President of the USA. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 08:36, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What we find is there are major problems using these citations as evidence. Immediately, <b>12 of the 21 can be ruled out</b> -- they are either written by the BBC <i>themselves</i> or are public relations announcements from folks who do business with BBC. Three are simply in a list of links to news Web sites, so not exactly strong proof either. So we're left with six legitimate articles or personal web logs.</p>
<p>Three of the writers work in the UK or have worked in the UK, and the two Web loggers are from California. The last article had no byline, but reads more like a press release. So in the end, we're left with five viewpoints all of whom are males from either UK or US. (Not to specifically bash males or anything.) Not very convincing evidence of the universality of BBC being the "most respected" in the world, to say the least.</p>
<p>The breakdown summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public relations (8) - cases of member stations announcing they are carrying BBC, or a company who worked in conjunction with BBC</li>
<li>BBC authored (4) - BBC describing itself as "the most"</li>
<li>Articles (4) - of these, three are associated with UK, one has no byline</li>
<li>Personal weblogs (2) - two bloggers, both from CA, no comment :)</li>
<li>Lists (3) - news source lists, listing BBC and a brief tagline of "the most..."</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not constructive simply to refute others, so what evidence do we see out in the real world, and what alternatives are there?</p>
<ul>
<li>Being "most respected" is cloudy enough that we should not use it. Other outlets have cited unusual sources as having more "respect". From Onlinepublishingnews.com (Google result #3), March 12, 2003, "World's most respected international news site: Guardian Unlimited?": <i>The busiest news sites are US-based. But which non-US news source do Americans use most? According to new research the answer is the UK's Guardian Unlimited.</i> <a href="http://www.onlinepublishingnews.com/htm/n20030312.235546.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onlinepublishingnews.com/htm/n20030312.235546.htm" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> Is Guardian worthy of this title? Probably not, but herein lies the danger of making these claims.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Other journalistic writings don't use absolutes when talking about BBC. We should strive to do the same. From Atlanta Journal Constitution (Google result #9), BETH GARDINER, Associated Press, July 20, 2003, "BBC confirms dead scientist was source of Iraq report": <i>"The BBC, one of the world's most respected news organizations, would not comment on its reason for making a rare exception to journalists' normal practice of refusing to name anonymous sources."</i> <a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:jcpiyZgJkzEJ:www.ajc.com/news/content/news/0703/20irbrit.html+bbc+most+respected+news+-doctors&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:jcpiyZgJkzEJ:www.ajc.com/news/content/news/0703/20irbrit.html+bbc+most+respected+news+-doctors&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[47]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After the first 14 Google results cited above, the next three relevant results #15, #16 and #17 all use phrases that have been reasonably proposed here -- "one of the most respected" or "one of the world's most respected." They may be on to something. They are indeed <b>credible alternatives.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>We're all here because we believe in making a better Wikipedia. Avoid hyperbole and go for credibility. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 08:39, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<b>Name an alternative</b>. The Guardian, for the love of Mike, is a <i>Newspaper</i>. Now, let's name a <i>broadcasting organisation</i>, shall we? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
