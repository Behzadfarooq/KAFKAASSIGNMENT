<p>Apeloverage removed the following statement: “While legend should not be mistaken for scientific fact, folklore has often been shown to contain seeds of truth. Regardless of the accuracy of the details of these legends, each of them are evidence of a belief by British people and those descended from them for hundreds and even thousands of years in a tangible genetic connection between the people of Britain and the people of the Holy land.”</p>
<p>Apeloverage justified this removal by suggesting this paragraph was “editorialization”.</p>
<p>As I understand it, an editorialization is “expressing opinion in the guise of an objective report.”</p>
<p>An example would be writing an article about “Big Foot” and presenting evidence that native Americans have preserved legends of a large beast that resembles the descriptions of modern day “Big Foot” sightings, so because the Native Americans have these legends we should beleive big foot is real. This is an editorialization.</p>
<p>Presenting the information, and then suggesting that the fact that Native Americans have this legend is proof that Americans have held a belief in a “Big Foot” for centuries, is not editorialization, it is a statement of fact. Suggesting they believe it and have for years doesn’t in and of itself make their beliefs true, it only helps to establish a time frame and the perspective of the believers.</p>
<p>Any rational scientific presentation of information must also give a rendering of the point of view of the testimony or of the evidence. All objective analysis must take into account the POV of the testimony or evidence, and then attempt to compare this information with the rest of the information gathered on the subject without attempting to “lead the evidence” through subjective “proof texting”. The statement removed by Apeloverage, was attempting to point out that this belief has been around for quite some time, and these legends provide evidence to that effect. If we are to truly understand it, then its origins and the POV of the adherents must be accurately reproduced. In previous versions of this page some suggested that this belief was a rather recent incarnation. The evidence of these legends tends to say otherwise.</p>
<p>The idea that these legends have been around for quite some time is not an opinion, but a deduction from the evidence available.</p>
<p>This information by itself does not “editorialize” the facts at hand, only presents them. I suggest that the removal of the majority of that paragraph represents editorial censorship, a type of editorialization. If Apeloverage has evidence to contradict these statements (i.e. the age of the existence of these legends), perhaps it would be more constructive to produce that evidence in the critic’s section.</p>
<p>I rolled back the alteration made by Apeloverage, but would like to see any evidence he or she might have contrary to the statements expressed there or herein.</p>

<p>In order to attempt to maintain a neutral POV and allow an accurate presentation of differing POV's on the idea I included a "Critic's" Section and took many of the objections found in the text and relocated them to this section. I do not have any citations to support these claims, so I simply noted that citations were needed.</p>
<p>I also fleshed out the information on Modern Adherents and early builders to the ideology from content already on Wiki.</p>

<p>As a follow up to my comment above, the LDS Church does not teach British Israelism...it NEVER has. People (this means you, Arline, and apparently only you) claiming otherwise (including Mormon missionaries who are NOT the arbiters of LDS Church doctrine and make errors like any other human and of whom more than 90% have never even heard of the phrase "British Israelism") simply misunderstand the Church's doctrines regarding Israelites, chosen people and patriarchal blessings. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a> 16:23, Apr 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the following text under "Advocates" because it was inaccurate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most visible advocate of this doctrine was probably <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._6e1d.html" title="U.S.">American</a> <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelist.html" title="Evangelist">evangelist</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_W._Armstrong_da6a.html" title="Herbert W. Armstrong">Herbert W. Armstrong</a> of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worldwide_Church_of_God_693c.html" title="Worldwide Church of God">Worldwide Church of God</a>. Armstrong frequently used his broadcasts, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_World_Tomorrow_8705.html" title="The World Tomorrow">The World Tomorrow</a></i>, and particularly the church's <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazine</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Plain_Truth_7a94.html" title="The Plain Truth">The Plain Truth</a></i>, to advocate this doctrine. However, in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> the church publicly renounced Anglo-Israelism and repented for having advocated it; however, certain breakaway groups from this church still proclaim it, as do some other small evangelical groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know who originally wrote this text but it does not reflect the teachings (as they were) of Herbert W. Armstrong, or the splinter groups that came to life after his death. What can be said of the Worldwide Church of God today (2004) is that the only thing that it has in common with the church under Herbert W. Armstrong, is the name and it may be changing that. It has closed its colleges, sold its grounds and is even moving from Pasadena, California. The same is true of the magazine, it is the same in name only, not in content nor in purpose or distribution. Its broadcasts have also been terminated.</p>
<p>There is documentary evidence to show what these beliefs were and it will take some time to find them and create new text. This entire article needs rewriting because it seems to be a hodge-podge that is not well written (which is probably the result of endless changes and edits.)</p>
<p>The problem begins with the opening line which identifies these beliefs with "Germanic peoples", because <b>Armstrong believed that the Germans were not Israelites but Assyrians who were the enemy of the Israelites</b> - old and new. His booklet <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_Prophecy%21_2c95.html" title="1975 in Prophecy!">1975 in Prophecy!</a> dealt with a German led <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_Europe_3420.html" title="United States of Europe">United States of Europe</a> destroying the USA and UK in a World War III sometime between 1972 and 1975. For this reason alone the present article is a <i>total contradiction</i> of anything that Armstrong taught, no matter how off-beat his actual teaching was. Since this is an encyclopedia the information should at least be accurate. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 04:02, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was on the article page under the heading of "Origins". This is guilt by association and it does not belong in this article. This is the misleading text:</p>

<p>There seem to be an awful lot of crackpot ideas in this article which is fine by me as it's more about people's beliefs than about truth.

<p>IMHO the paragraph "British Israelism often coincides with British Unionism, but it is worth noting that the Declaration of Arbroath, which declared Scottish independence in 1320 not only mentions a Scythian origin for the Scots, but also a Biblical one, which is used to justify Scotland's sovreignty over itself", besides being badly written, doesn't seem to quite fit in with this section. The <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_Arbroath_f631.html" title="Declaration of Arbroath">Declaration of Arbroath</a> does <b>not</b> explicitly claim descent from the "people of Israel" - the reference could be (and, on the face of it, without further evidence, probably is) just flowery language making a comparison between on the one hand, the Scots making an exodus across a sea from the barbarism of Spain, and entering their own "promised land" of Scotland, and on the other, the Biblical exodus of the Jews from Egypt across a sea into the promised land of Israel.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterR_b418.html" title="User:PeterR">PeterR</a> 13:53, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above comment is correct as far as it goes. However, as this is a discussion of British Israelism, it should be noted that some proponents of this idea point to the Scythians as being the offspring of Israelites carried off by the Assyrians. See, for example, the works of contemporary author Steven M. Collins in his four volume series on the lost tribes of Israel (www.israelite.info). I don't claim to know enough of the ancient history of the Mideast to evaluate the claims of Collins and many earlier writers on this topic, but it seems to me reference to it should be included here for the sake of a fuller exposition of the claims of British Israelism proponents.</p>
<p>A reader enquired about DNA testing in ref to British-Israel topic. I contacted the Brian Sykes DNA testing lab, Cambridge, England after I read his book 7 Daughters of Eve, based on a serendipitous DNA discovery. He was working on DNA of Otzi the Austrian iceman and surmised that Otzi had redhair, for a DNA lab control for redhair, Sykes tested his redhair Irish lab tech and not only got a redhair confirmation he got a matrilineal, mitochondrial genotype allolele match as well. This find lead to further studies that led to 7 Daughters of Eve. My request to Sykes if they have a DNA specific screening test for female semitic-hebraic, so a person could establish their semitic-hebraic connection, the response I got was they were working on a patrilineal screen for semitic DNA but it included arabs since they have the preponderance of this genotype. Since men can disseminate their DNA into multiple ethnic populations, this doesn't help me. Women tend to be very conservative and selective in their partners and produce only 1 baby at a time, usually confined to the ethnic group she is in. There are exceptions and I present one as follows. Twice in antiquity semite-hebrews were enslaved and set into Diaspora. I assume human nature then was no different than now in that fertile, fecund semite females were crossbred, interbred by their captors just like fertile, fecund, female african slaves were in the Americas. Offspring of these crossbred, interbred semite-hebrews were part of multiple waves of migration that crossed Asia and Europe. I surmise that the mark of Cain was redhair, Cain got from Adam, which means ruddy man, otherwise why would Cain be so concerned about being readily identified. The ethnic groups that have the highest incidence of redhair are, Jews, Irish, Scandinavians. Its due to these Diaspora migrations redhair spread like it did. It accounts for how Otzi got his redhair, how Sykes' lab tech got her redhair and her DNA match to Otzi. Bible is the story of the Adam/Noah family, it doesn't mention a momma Shem, if one goes out from the notion one is a jew only if the mother is a jew, Yet the notion of semitic and hebrew stem from a patrilineal source, and the only way a viable population could arise from offspring of Ham, Shem, Japeth it stands to resaon these offspring intermingled with each others' offspring. The idea of a single, solitary non-blended familial lineage of just offspring of Shem is genetically impossible to sustain for 5,000 years, the ergo is we are all semite-hebrews, that is why Sykes can not single out which of the 7 Daughters of Eve is solely from momma Shem. In regards to the British-Israel discussion author Michael Tsarion reverses the entire process and claims that ancient Irish disseminated their culture and civilization to the Mideast, Egypt, just like they did to Europe when the Roman Empire there collapsed. He bases it upon Celtic-Gaelic language and druidic religion. I can't reach Tsarion to ask him where is his proof the Irish had redhair before Adam/ Noah generation. If there is a reader or wiki editor who can contact Tsarion and get his DNA track record to match Brian Sykes, it would lend credibility to Tsarion's theory.Jaako 01:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These are the nutcases who came over to the Hill of Tara in Meath and started digging it up between the years 1899-1902. They believed there was some Ark of the Covenant there. They destroyed the place, the seat of the ancient High Kings of Ireland. That is what the British Israelites are best known for in Ireland. There is a new book on their role in Tara writted by Mairéad Carew called 'Tara and the Ark of the Covenant'. There is loads of information online about it. Here's an article about it from The Irish Times, July 28, 2005: <a href="http://www.indymedia.ie/article/71184" class="external free" title="http://www.indymedia.ie/article/71184" rel="nofollow">http://www.indymedia.ie/article/71184</a> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 05:52, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'd suggest that the answers to your questions are, in order - it didn't, the product of your imagination, and nowhere. --<a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApeloverage_bf3a.html" title="User:Apeloverage">Apeloverage</a> 21:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The stone might not be the product of his imagination, but then it ain't "precious Israelite treasure" either.</dd>
