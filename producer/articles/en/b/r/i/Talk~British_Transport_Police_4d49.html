<p>A bit of an editing war may be about to break out regarding this issue between myself and Richio. So in an effort to try and sort it out I suggest we discuss here first. The large legislation quote that keeps being added is trying to be used to evidence that BTP officers have the same jurisdiction as Home Office police officers. In fact if you look at the legislation closely and are familiar with criminal law and policing it actually supports my contention that BTP officers do not have the same jurisdiction as Home Office force officers.</p>
<p>Home Office police force officers have jurisdiction throughout England and Wales in any situation, at any time, with regards to any criminal matter.</p>
<p>BTP officers normally only have jurisdiction on railway property or off railway property with matters pertaining to railways i.e. theft at a train station, BTP officers go to home address of offender and arrest off railway property.</p>
<p>The legislation which I keep deleting has extended BTP officers jurisdiction off railway property but <b>only</b> if certian conditions are met. I.e. if asked to assist by a Home Office force officer or if a BTP officer off railway property <b>believes</b> an offence has been committed or is being committed there and then and he/needs to act because no local force officer is there and action needs to be taken straight away. Home Office police officers only need to <b>suspect</b> an offence which is a major legal difference, suspicion being a lower threshold then belief. Also this legislation pointedly says it only extends BTP officers jurisdiction for a particular incident not a coverall extension of jurisdiction to match Home Office officers.</p>
<p>Another major difference is that a constable is a constable in a Home Office force even if he is in not in uniform and doesn't happen to have his warrant card on him. This conditional extension of BTP officers jurisdiction actually stipulates that they must be in uniform or have a warrant card on them to use these conditional powers.</p>
<p>I could go into more detail , but by reading the legislation it can be readily seen that BTP officers have not had their jurisdiction extended to match that of Home Office forces.</p>
<p>The aricle may need to be altered to outline this conditional extension more clearly but to those not involved in policing its probably not relevant. In practise the alteration in the 2001 Act has allowed BTP and MDP officers to act in an emergency if there is no Home Office officer to hand but it has not extended these specialist force officers jurisdiction to match that of the Home Office forces of England and Wales. <a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDibble999_6603.html" title="User:Dibble999">Dibble999</a> 08:26, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dibble, don't stress it not the beginning of an editing war merely my belief that a minor alteration would improve an</p>
<p>essentially a good page regarding BTP.</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your passage "</font><i><b><font size="2" face="Arial">BTP constables have the powers of a constable off railway property if they are investigating crime which was committed on railway property or if they come across an emergency situation, where waiting for a local police officer to attend would be impracticable.</font></b></i><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>&#160;</i> is where my disagreement lies. This statement does not adequately explain the BTP's powers away from the railway infrastructure.&#160;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The boring bit:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br />
<u><b>Section 100(2) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001</b></u> states: Members of the British Transport Police Force have in any police area the same powers and privileges as constables of the police force for that area:-</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(a) in relation to persons whom they <b>suspect</b> on reasonable grounds of having committed, being in the course of committing or being about to commit an offence, or</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(b) if they <b>believe</b> on reasonable grounds that they need those powers and privileges in order to save life or limb or to prevent or minimise personal injury.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">What you have written in the discussion here only reflects the Note attached to Subsection (2) <i>"The legislation which I keep deleting has extended BTP officers jurisdiction off railway property but <b>only</b> if certian conditions are met. I.e. if asked to assist by a Home Office force officer or if a BTP officer off railway property <b>believes</b> an offence has been committed or is being committed there and then and he/needs to act because no local force officer is there and action needs to be taken straight away. Home Office police officers only need to <b>suspect</b> an offence which is a major legal difference, suspicion being a lower threshold then belief. Also this legislation pointedly says it only extends BTP officers jurisdiction for a particular incident not a coverall extension of jurisdiction to match Home Office officers"</i></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">And finally...</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree that this is mostly irrelevant to persons with no knowledge to policing and the law, but should someone read this by clicking a link intentionally or by mistake, I feel they would be better informed if it was more accurate. If I click on a page containing a subject of which I know nothing about, I would hope that it was fully correct. I would be pleased to help should there be anything you would like to know regarding BTP or Essex Pol.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, I've said my piece and in truth my main issue is the perception that would be given of the jurisdiction where you have written that BTP constables have powers of a constable when investigating railway offences on someone else's patch. To me this seems misleading. Sapient, thanks for the sig tip. New to all this, I've been stuck down tunnels for too many years!!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yep, I think your suggestion above is great and would be better. Just re-read what I put at the top and I come across as a bit uperty. Sorry about that, must remember not to edit after finishing a bad night shift! The dealings I've had with BTP in my area (GMP) have all been good and I wasn't intending to have a dig at the BTP. Richo, just out of interest, I've heard rumours that the Met want to take over BTP within the M25 like they did with the Royal Parks Constabulary. Any truth to this? <a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDibble999_6603.html" title="User:Dibble999">Dibble999</a> 15:41, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I Know the feeling of a bad night shift!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Met absorbing the BTP rumour has been floating around for about 25 years now, what I've heard most recently is from the reports that have emanated since the July bombings. At the moment L Area which is the section funded by London Underground &amp; DLR is policed by around 600 officers in total. Metpol said to cover the area effectively they would need around 2500-3000 officers. Ken Livingstone is pushing desperately for London to have 1 police force, London underground would never agree to the funding that would be needed to meet the Met's requirements. City Pol have also been mentioned and have threatened to relocate the businesses in the corporation of London (which fund City Pol) to Germany should the the City be forced to merge, essentially destroying Britain's financial sector.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The reports also made note that it benefited to have a specialist railway force, this has somewhat been backtracked under pressure from Livingstone. If the BTP within the M25 went to the Met also absorbed would be large parts of H Area (London South) and B Area (London North) which bring in the majority of revenue for those areas within the London stations, now baring in mind H Area covers also Kent, Sussex and Surrey. The BTP outside the M25 would not make enough money to exist and those officers stationed there would most likely be amalgamated into local forces as specialist sections, which would deal with railway problems primarily, the BTP would then cease to exist.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I spoke to the Chief Constable in February and his belief is that the merger realistically is so difficult to co-ordinate that it will continued to be talked about yet never actually take place. Personally I don't believe it would make a great deal of difference to merge or not as I enjoy working with Met units and we most of the time end up dealing with as many jobs of there's as they do our's. I would be disappointed however as another piece of history would be lost.</font></p>

<dd>Any rumours that I may have gone into the back yard of a certain BTP station in London and wound-up a probationer that I was 'checking to see where we would put things when we took over' are wholy without foundation. Honest. But seriously, I've not heard anything from the met side, aside from one rumour saying that the BTP were going to be unable to police Crossrail and that we would have to do it instead... <a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESapient_6a20.html" title="User:Sapient">Sapient</a> 22:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Crossrail policing I've also heard would be undertaken by MPS, most likely be some new addition to TOCU's tasks. Other than the funding I can't understand why MPS would be interested in it really. BTP would be able to manage it would just mean more new recruits. As for the wind ups, that's what makes this job worth doing sometimes, truthfully I should say most of the time.</p>

<p>Not sure what this section is trying to convey. It states, "BTP officers can deal with..." then goes on to list a number of different crimes?! This is a bit misleading as BTP officers can deal with any crime as any other police officer. Not sure why it is there. <a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDibble999_6603.html" title="User:Dibble999">Dibble999</a> 21:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've now removed the strange list. It is pointless and not accurate. BTP officers can deal with all crime and bye laws on the rail network so the list was somewhat misleading. <a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDibble999_6603.html" title="User:Dibble999">Dibble999</a> 13:30, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>The BTP's reputation was further lowered following a low-speed train derailment near Glasgow, caused by the track spreading because of thermal expansion in unusually hot weather, when the BTP insisted on treating the accident as a scene of crime, detaining hundreds of passengers for many hours while statements were taken.</i> Says who?
