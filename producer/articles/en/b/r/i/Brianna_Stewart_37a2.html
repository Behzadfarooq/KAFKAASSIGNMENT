<p>Treva Joyce Throneberry was born <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> in <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wichita_Falls%2C_Texas_b2c5.html" title="Wichita Falls, Texas">Wichita Falls, Texas</a>. Her family later moved to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electra%2C_Texas_2675.html" title="Electra, Texas">Electra</a>. Her uncle molested her and her sisters, though later Treva told the police it was her father.</p>
<p>Throneberry left Electra for Wichita Falls in December 1985 when she was 15 years old, enrolled in the local <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> and cut contact with her family. She began tell stories how she had been abducted and raped by <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satanist.html" title="Satanist">Satanists</a>. A year later she was in a local <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_hospital.html" title="Mental hospital">mental hospital</a> for five months and refused to speak with the family when they visited. Later she was sent to Lena Pope Home for troubled girls in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth%2C_Texas_7bf1.html" title="Fort Worth, Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>. She kept a distance from her family, sending only a letter now and then. She graduated from <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_Heights_High_School_5622.html" title="Arlington Heights High School">Arlington Heights High School</a> in 1987 and moved to <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington%2C_Texas_b1be.html" title="Arlington, Texas">Arlington, Texas</a>.

<p>For most of the 1990's, Throneberry wandered around the country using various names and identities. She said she was a teenager with an abusive background, lived in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeless_shelter.html" title="Homeless shelter">homeless shelters</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster_home.html" title="Foster home">foster homes</a> and enrolled in local high schools. She said that her Satanist father had raped her and killed her mother or sometimes accused her foster parents of abuse police could not find a shred of evidence for. All cases were dismissed.</p>
<p>In 1996 Throneberry appeared in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altoona%2C_Pennsylvania_56d9.html" title="Altoona, Pennsylvania">Altoona, Pennsylvania</a>. She said that her name was <i>Stephanie Danielle Lewis</i>, that she was 16 and was fleeing her Satanist parents with the help of the religious underground. After 18 days of investigation, police contacted a girl she had known in Texas and found out who she really was. She was arrested, charged with giving false information and sentenced to 9 days in jail. After her release she disappeared again and continued her wandering.</p>

<p>In 1998 she lived in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver%2C_Washington_85bd.html" title="Vancouver, Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a> as 16-year-old <b>Brianna Stewart</b>, attended <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evergreen_High_School_%28Vancouver%2C_Washington%29_ffe1.html" title="Evergreen High School (Vancouver, Washington)">Evergreen High School</a>, and lived in various foster homes. She found a boyfriend and told him about her alleged abuse. First she claimed that she originated from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham%2C_Alabama_0973.html" title="Birmingham, Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a> and later from <a href="../../../d/a/p/Daphne%2C_Alabama_7f00.html" title="Daphne, Alabama">Daphne</a>. Sympathetic benefactors gave her money and shelter but she eventually abused their hospitality by claims of abuse. In hindsight, many of the foster homes said they began to suspect that she was not a teenager. One dentist noticed that Stewart had no <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisdom_teeth.html" title="Wisdom teeth">wisdom teeth</a> any more.</p>
<p>Stewart graduated from Evergreen High School with the class of 2000 and enrolled in Clark College. She said that she planned to become a lawyer and children's advocate.</p>
<p>In January 2001 she tried to get an official <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_certificate.html" title="Birth certificate">birth certificate</a> so she could obtain a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_security_number.html" title="Social security number">social security number</a>. Check of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingerprints.html" title="Fingerprints">fingerprints</a> revealed her original identity and the arrest in Altoona.</p>

She had defrauded the state for foster care and college <a href="../../../t/u/i/Tuition.html" title="Tuition">tuition</a> worth $4670. She could not raise <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail.html" title="Bail">bail</a> of $20,000. Other charges around the country also increased the load.</p>
<p>Throneberry continued to insist that she was Brianna Stewart and refused to acknowledge her parents. Authorities proved her original identity with fingerprints and DNA testing. Psychologists and lawyers began to study her, trying to find out if she was a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Con_artist.html" title="Con artist">con artist</a> or delusional.</p>
<p>Her trial started in November 2001 in Vancouver. State prosecutors charged that Throneberry was a con artist who had intentionally taken advantage of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_security.html" title="Social security">social security</a> system for personal gain. Throneberry fired her court-appointed lawyer and decided to defend herself in court. She was not successful and received 3 years and 2 months for fraud and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perjury.html" title="Perjury">perjury</a> and was sent to the Washington Correction Center for Women. The judge recommended that she receive <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> in prison.</p>
