<p>Sabretooth has come to use the name Victor Creed, but it is unlikely his original name. Sabretooth's memories have been tampered with by clandestine organizations such as <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a> and so much of what appears to be his past is not of credible account. His strongest and earliest memory is of being cruelly abused by his father. It is likely this at least is a real memory as Creed's criminally psychotic personality seems to be, in part, a product of such an early developmentally destructive experience.</p>
<p>According to the limited series, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_%28comics%29.html" title="Origin (comics)">Origin</a>, it seems possible that Sabretooth was once actually <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Logan_705b.html" title="Dog Logan">Dog Logan</a>, who killed <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine.html" title="Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s (probably adoptive) father. As an adult Dog was Sabretooth's hieght, wieght, build, and had about the same hair color as well as leaf shaped ears, sharply pointed nails, and amber colored eyes. All characteristics shared with Sabretooth. Dog was superhumanly strong and demonstrated enhanced senses, but had not yet developed a regenerative healing ability (possibly a secondary mutation, or the result of later genetic augmentation). It was implied in this story that Dog and James Howlett (Wolverine) were half brothers and that James was the illegitimate son of Dog's father, Thomas Logan, who happened to look <i>exactly</i> like Wolverine. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Logan_df28.html" title="Thomas Logan">Thomas Logan</a> did indeed physically abuse his son. James Howlett was raised in a wealthy household, while Dog Logan lived a life of abject poverty as a servant. These factors are significant because Jame's resemblence to Dog's father and what Dog would probably perceive as an unfair social advantage of James could easily lead to inmity toward Wolverine (even if Sabretooth cannot clearly recall the events).</p>

<p>Sabretooth is known to have sired an offspring, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graydon_Creed_9cd0.html" title="Graydon Creed">Graydon Creed</a>, with another mutant, <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystique.html" title="Mystique">Mystique</a>. Graydon was normal human who founded an anti-mutant organization and ran for president but was assassinated by his own mother. At one point, Sabretooth believed himself to be Wolverine's father, a situation that was intended by some writers. The writers changed thier minds and decided to disprove this years later by genetic testing performed by <a href="../../../s/h/i/SHIELD_fa21.html" title="SHIELD">SHIELD</a>. If Sabretooth is actually Dog Logan, might have (or had) sibling, John Howlett lll, who was shown alive in alternate future and also resembles Sabretooth's father rather than John Howlett Jr.</p>

<p>In Sabretooth's first appearances as an <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Fist_537e.html" title="Iron Fist">Iron Fist</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Cage_e371.html" title="Luke Cage">Luke Cage</a> villain it was not clear that he had a superhuman regenerative healing factor. During a period when he was murdering women under the persona of the Slasher, he was confronted by Misty Knight and punched by her cybernetic arm, shattering his rib cage. This took several months to heal; a seemingly ordinary recovery rate. However, this might be explained by the possibility that the damage was actually more extensive (that his internal organs were somewhat pulverized) and that his ribs healed too quickly and as a result were not set correctly (this has happened to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadpool_%28comics%29.html" title="Deadpool (comics)">Deadpool</a> at times), which would require special surgery and would account for the time. It is also possible that he didn't have a regenerative healing factor at the time at all.</p>

<p>Several years later, Sabretooth was a member of the mutant team of mercenaries known as the Marauders, under the employment of Mr. Sinister. Sabretooth was reportedly killed a number of times while working for <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Sinister_25cb.html" title="Mr. Sinister">Mr. Sinister</a> and Sinister himself said that he had in fact created genetically identical clones of Marauders that had fallen in battle. It is possible that he improved upon the superhuman abilities of these clones, granting them powers the originals did not have, such as Sabretooth's regenerative healing powers. It is also possible that he augmented the original Marauders as well as the clones. Though he is generally assumed to be the genuine article, it is not even known if the current Sabretooth is the original Sabretooth or a clone of him.</p>

<p>Sabretooth is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial enhancements to his physiology. He regenerates and heals hundreds of times faster than a normal human. Thanks to this regenerative "healing factor," he has been able to completely recover from injuries which would prove fatal to most humans, even those with superhuman abilities. It has been suggested by writers that Sabretooth's healing factor may be greater than that of Wolverine, possibly due to genetic tampering by various clandestine organizations. Meaning that he may actually be able to regrow limbs and organs (<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metahuman.html" title="Metahuman">metahuman</a> regenerative). It is known that all of Sabretooth's other superhuman abilities stem, at least partially, from his enhanced healing powers.</p>
<p>Other benefits of the healing factor include an immunity to <i>most</i> toxins (except in massive doses) or diseases and greatly improved stamina (he can exert himself at peak levels for days before feeling fatigue). His healing factor retards his aging process to an unknown degree. It has been implied in various stories that Sabretooth and Wolverine have a history that extends back at least half a century.</p>
<p>Sabretooth possesses <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman.html" title="Superhuman">superhumanly</a> acute <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senses.html" title="Senses">senses</a> that are comparable to those of certain animals, enabling him to <a href="../../../s/e/e/See.html" title="See">see</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hear.html" title="Hear">hear</a> distant objects more clearly than a normal human, and identify and track someone purely by <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scent.html" title="Scent">scent</a>. Most notably his eyesight is so keen that he can see in almost complete darkness, just as a nocturnal cat. This may be a result of being able to see into the infra red and ultra violet spectrum.</p>

<p>Sabretooth possesses an unspecified degree of superhuman strength. Some of Sabretooth's more impressive displays of strength include twisting an iron barbell into a knot and tossing Wolverine 60 feet into the air and through the roof of Xavier's mansion with only one hand. Since the time those feats were demonstrated, Sabretooth has undergone surgical procedures to further increase his strength but it is unknown exactly how strong he is.</p>
<p>Sabretooth's reflexes and agility are enhanced somewhat beyond the range attainable for a normal human being, but not to the degree of say, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>. This entails being able to perform gymnastic and acrobatic feats superior to that of any Olympic athlete who has ever competed, but still in a somewhat comparable range.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Panel from <b>Uncanny X-Men #222</b>. Art by Mark Sylvestri.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sabretooth's physical appearance also displays number of animal - like mutations, most notably, two canine teeth among his others and retractable claws where ordinary humans have fingernails. His eyes also have no visible pupils. Sabretooth is an enormous physical specimen at a hieght of roughly six and a half feet and wieght of 275 pounds (excluding adamantium). His claws and teeth (without adamantium) are sufficiently strong enough the rend and tear substances as strong as human bone.</p>
<p>At times Sabretooth's skeleton has been molecularly laced with nigh-indestructable metal <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">Adamantium</a>, including his finger nails, which are really retractable claws. At one time the adamantium was removed by Apocalypse and later it was reintroduced into his body by the Weapon X program. It has not been specified if the new adamantium Sabretooth possesses is <i>True Adamantium</i> or <i>Secondary Adamantium</i>. The former is virtually indestructable and the latter is not quite as durable. The enhanced tensile strength of his skeleton increases his already superhuman strength. His blows are weighted (similar to using brass knuckles) due to the presence of this metal.</p>
<p>Sabretooth is an excellent hand to hand combatant, having been trained by various organizations such as the C.I.A. and HYDRA. He is also an expert hunter and tracker, even without the use of his heightened senses. Sabretooth also has resistance to telepathic probing.</p>

<p>In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Sabretooth was a mutant soldier and commando for Weapon X, under the direction of a man by the name of Colonel Wraith. He appeared to be the only mutant in the program by choice, due to his high-ranking position, and his high authority in the operations. He was practically the same as the original <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabretooth.html" title="Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a> of Earth 616, having accelerated healing and keen senses, with the exception that he had four additional <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a> claws released from the back of each of his hands, much like the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a> claws that <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine.html" title="Wolverine">Wolverine</a> possessed. He had a burning hatred for Wolverine, and also, as he stated to Wolverine, in the encounter with Wolverine at Weapon X, for the primitive <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homo_Sapiens_b3ef.html" title="Homo Sapiens">Homo Sapiens</a>. He felt that his cruel, psychotic, nature was a natural part of being a <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant.html" title="Mutant">mutant</a>.</p>
<p>His presence in the Ultimate Marvel Universe was very brief compared to that of his regular Marvel counterpart. He gave the cruel boast of how he murdered a wife and child of Wolverine's. He then commenced battle with Wolverine outside the Weapon X compound, initially holding the upper hand, but Wolverine managed to score a critical hit, followed by sending him off the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>Following Sabretooth's loss to Wolverine, the Weapon X program was dismantled with Colonel Wraith being shot dead by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Fury_36c8.html" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a> Sabretooth did not die from his encounter with Wolverine, but rather returned as a high-ranking follower to <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto.html" title="Magneto">Magneto</a> in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. His encounter with Wolverine while with the Brotherhood was his final underestimation of the man. While following a boast that he could survive any wound or injury, and could always return to fight and haunt <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a>, Wolverine gave a vicious answer: he decapitated <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabretooth.html" title="Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a> on the spot.</p>

<p>In an alternate universe in Marvel comics depicted in the Age of Apocalypse story line and the Exiles comics there is a different version of Sabretooth. This version of the character has the same origin as the one in the normal continuity but has a different moral alignment. He is actually one of the X-Men and a role model for other mutants in this alternate reality.</p>
<p>This version of Sabretooth became a hero and even adopted another character as his daughter. He became the leader of an extra dimensional band of characters who slide into alternate realities, known as "Weapon X". For a time he was also the leader of the Exiles.</p>
<p>This version of Sabretooth has no adamantium in his skeleton, but is still superhumanly strong and possesses a regenerative healing factor. In this alternate reality Sabretooth has gained control of his feral tendencies, which has granted him a higher level of self discipline and therefor greater competence than the one in the normal marvel continuity who is "evil."</p>
