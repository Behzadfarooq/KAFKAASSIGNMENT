<p>Westbrook played high school varsity football at <a href="../../../d/e/m/DeMatha_Catholic_High_School_b97c.html" title="DeMatha Catholic High School">DeMatha Catholic High School</a> in Hyattsville, Maryland. The private, Catholic all-boys prep school has a storied tradition of athletic achievement, and Westbrook's play added to that legacy during his secondary school years.</p>

<p>After <a href="../../../d/e/m/DeMatha_4fc4.html" title="DeMatha">DeMatha</a>, Westbrook became a standout running back at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villanova_University_d98e.html" title="Villanova University">Villanova University</a> from 1997-2001 and wore the number 20. Though he battled through several injuries, he holds the all-time <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> record with 9,512 all-purpose yards, breaking the 9,301 yards accumulated by Brian Shay of Emporia State. In 46 career games, he scored 542 points with 84 TDs, carried the ball 725 times for 4298 yards (6.2 avg.), caught 219 passes for 2,582 yards and gained 2,289 yards and 4 TDs on kickoff returns. Along the way, he established 41 school, 13 <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ten_Conference_6795.html" title="Atlantic Ten Conference">Atlantic Ten Conference</a> and 5 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> records.</p>
<p>He became the only player in I-AA history to score 160 or more points twice in a career and the first player in the history of college football at any level with 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards in one season (1998). He is one of only two players in Villanova history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season and he accomplished that feat three times.</p>
<p>He was a consensus All-America and two-time A-10 offensive player of the year and was the 2001 recipient of the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Payton_Award_6fda.html" title="Walter Payton Award">Walter Payton Award</a> (as the top player in NCAA Division 1-AA). As a senior, he amassed 2,823 combined net yards and scored 29 touchdowns.</p>

<p>Despite his dominance in college, NFL teams were hesitant to draft him in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_NFL_Draft_e89a.html" title="2002 NFL Draft">2002 NFL Draft</a> for three reasons: his small size (he listed at only 5'8", 200 lb (91 kg), his injury history (he missed an entire college season with a knee injury), and the fact that he did not play college football for a <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Division_I-A_068b.html" title="NCAA Division I-A">NCAA Division I-A</a> school.</p>
<p>The Eagles took a risk, and picked the hometown favorite in the third round of that draft, and he has since blossomed into one of the NFL's most elusive players. Westbrook saw limited play in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_NFL_season_218b.html" title="2002 NFL season">2002</a>, but he made his mark in the NFL in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_NFL_season_4b50.html" title="2003 NFL season">2003</a> season with a fourth quarter punt return for a touchdown to defeat the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> 14-10 in the closing minutes on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">October 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. The play managed to turn the Eagles season around as they went to the <a href="../../../n/f/c/NFC_Championship_Game_bc6c.html" title="NFC Championship Game">NFC Championship Game</a>. Westbrook, who scored eleven touchdowns by ground and air, missed the playoffs that year after injuring his biceps muscle in the final game of the season against the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>.</p>

<p>After the departure of previous starter <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duce_Staley_0e39.html" title="Duce Staley">Duce Staley</a> and a pre-season injury to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correll_Buckhalter_3f61.html" title="Correll Buckhalter">Correll Buckhalter</a>, Westbrook became the starting running back for <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_NFL_season_cf8a.html" title="2004 NFL season">2004</a>. He rushed for a career high 812 yards, led all NFL running backs in receiving with 73 receptions for 703 yards, and scored 9 touchdowns, creating numerous problems with opposing teams' defenses and helping to propel the Eagles to a 13-3 season. He went on to have a solid performance in Philadelphia's <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXIX_e869.html" title="Super Bowl XXXIX">Super Bowl XXXIX</a> loss to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, rushing for 44 yards, catching 7 passes for 60 yards, and scoring one touchdown.

<p>Westbrook signed a 5-year contract extension with the Eagles in November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_NFL_season_0904.html" title="2005 NFL season">2005</a>, after holding out of training camp and months of hectic negotiations. With over 1,200 yards rushing and receiving, it was announced on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, that Westbrook would miss the rest of the 2005 season due to a mid-foot injury he sustained during a 42-0 <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">MNF</a> loss to the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Seahawks_2af6.html" title="Seattle Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>.</p>

<p>Westbrook resumed his productivity in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NFL_season_05ef.html" title="2006 NFL season">2006</a>, despite early injury concerns over knee swelling. With a season-ending injury to McNabb on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Westbrook stepped up and became the keystone of the Philadelphia offense.

<p>He set a career-high in rushing yards with 1,217, topping 1,000 yards for the first time in his career. He also lead the team with 77 receptions with 699 receiving yards. His eleven total touchdowns (7 rushing and 4 receiving) were also tops on the Eagles. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> Westbrook set a career-postseason rushing record, rushing for 141 yards on twenty carries against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Giants_d193.html" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a>.</p>
