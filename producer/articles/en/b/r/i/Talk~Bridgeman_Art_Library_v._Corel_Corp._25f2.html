<dd>I think there is solid footing that this image is public domain. In Bridgeman, the court said, "The Court of Appeals affirmed a district court order compelling the defendants to cancel a recordation of copyright in the plastic reproduction on the ground that the reproduction was not "original" within the meaning of the 1909 Copyright Act, holding that the requirement of originality applies to reproductions of works of art. Only "a distinguishable variation" -- something beyond technical skill -- will render the reproduction original."<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/36_FSupp2d_191.htm#para_22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/36_FSupp2d_191.htm#para_22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. See also the courts reasoning that the change of medium is immaterial. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/36_FSupp2d_191.htm#para_37" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/36_FSupp2d_191.htm#para_37" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Finally, the source is clearly identified on commons, and no copyright is asserted by the owner to dispute its public domain status which is notable since pbs claims copyright on many of its other pages.</dd>

<dd>Although, the wikipedia article says that the decision applies only to photos of paintings, I could find no dictum limiting the ruling to paintings. Other than the fact that paintings were at issue int he case, there is no support for such a limited reading. In fact just the opposite is true - relying on this is reasonable (and in fact preferable). FYI Corel had a <a href="http://www.emsps.com/photocd/corel/99000.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.emsps.com/photocd/corel/99000.htm" rel="nofollow">Religious stained glass Photo CD</a> (see also <a href="http://www.fotosearch.com/corel/religious-stained-glass/COR362/" class="external text" title="http://www.fotosearch.com/corel/religious-stained-glass/COR362/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) available at the time the decision was made. <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>•<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#F0F">talk</font></a> 23:16, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the 2-D comment per the discussion above and because the case is not limited to 2-D art. <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">User:Fastfission</a> restored and rewrote the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The case would likely not apply to photographs of three-dimensional objects, as the photographic arrangement would plausibly require some creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree - this is not supported by the courts ruling. Although, an attorney representing a photographer of three-dimensional objects could make that argument in good faith. For us to draw this conclusion before the question has been presented before a court is pure speculation. Additionally, the court in Bridgeman, relied upon Batlin where the object was 3-D and the new art was also 3-D, so the court makes no 2D/3D distinction that this sentence implies. If I were to sum the holding I would say, "The court ruled that originality must consist more than merely technical skill in determining whether a reproduction of a copyrightable work is itself copyrightable independent of the original work." or something more elegant with the same idea&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>•<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#F0F">talk</font></a> 15:18, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual ruling discusses this a number of times though of course does not resolve it in all instances. For example, <i>Most photographs are "original" in one if not more of the three respects set out in the treatise and therefore are copyrightable. Plaintiff's problem here is that it seeks protection for the exception that proves the rule: photographs of existing two-dimensional articles (in this case works of art), each of which reproduces the article in the photographic medium as precisely as technology permits. Its transparencies stand in the same relation to the original works of art as a photocopy stands to a page of typescript, a doodle, or a Michelangelo drawing.</i> It is fairly clear to me that the implication is that a photograph of a three dimensional object would likely not "stand in the same relation" to the original work of art.</li>
<li>The use of <i>Batlin</i> only reinforces this: it was a 3-D reproduction of a 3-D object. There is nothing at all in the ruling to imply that a 2-D photograph of a 3-D object would be non-copyrightable, and there is in fact much to the contrary. If one did a 3-D sculpture based on a 2-D photograph, I imagine it would have copyrightable claims as well under this ruling. Anyway I do not think it is much of a stretch to make these interpretations as you are implying.</li>
<li>Of course the question of something like stained glass is something very thorny which is not at all addressed in this ruling (whether stained glass is 2-D or 3-D is up for interpretation, in my opinion), and any speculation along those lines would be simply speculation. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 16:45, 24 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that it is not directly addressed, and stained glass is very tricky. I think to assert so definatively that there is a bright line between 2-D and 3-D nature of the work does a disservice to the main holding, which is that it is the originality that counts. Additionally, your example that a 3-D sculpture based on a 2-D photograph is not a good one, because, in most cases, the sculpture would have to introduce significant originality into the work as well as interpretation. It is the very opposite problem of the 2D photo of a 3D public domain work - normal photographs of a 3D work require little originality from the photographer, although I can see situations where the photographer could introduce originality and assert copyright. However, I think it is safe to conclude that in general normal photos taken of 3D works absent an assertion of originality would not be copyrightable. For example, if I took pictures of public domain scupltures at a museum, they would, IMO, not be copyrightable by me, because I have no artistic talent. Additiionally, if a case were brought on a stained glass work it would probably hinge on the originality of the photograph not the 2D or 3D nature, i.e. the artistic originality in the way the light shined through, and other original ideas of the artist.</li>
<li>We should reword this sentence to make it not so definitive, because the issue is not that simple.

<p>I noticed the outdated generic copyright statement for flags state they may be considered under this law. While I expect this is true, what a number of people are forgetting about is that a fair number flags are new and therefore the flag design it self could potentially be copyrighted. If it is, this issue is irrelevant. We can obtain a accurate representation of the flag anywhere but if the flag is copyrighted why does it matter? <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 13:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Per 1(b) and 1(c) there should not be sections made up of only one or two lines. These should either be expanded or folded into other sections.</li>
<li>Per 2(a) and 2(b) if you are using only in-line citations, there should be more citation than currently exists in the article. At the least, the references section should include the mention of one or two umbrella sources that could be assumed by the reader to support the information not directly addressed by an in-line citation.</li>
<li>It might eb useful to have some sort of image beyond the seal, although that is not necessary to meet GA standards.</li>
