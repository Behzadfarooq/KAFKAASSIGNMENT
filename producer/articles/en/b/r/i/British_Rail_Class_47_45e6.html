<p>Numbering 512 examples when built, after more than 40 years of front line passenger and freight operations, fewer than 40 examples still regularly operate on the National network. Among rail enthusiasts, they were nicknamed 'Duffs', although the origin of this nickname is unclear. One <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_UK_railfan_jargon_34da.html#D" title="List of UK railfan jargon">explanation</a> is that because these locomotives were so common, from the perspective of <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfan.html" title="Railfan">trainspotters</a>, they were not very exciting sightings. Nowadays they are far more interesting finds, due to a mixture of rareness, variety of liveries and the usage on the prestige trains like the Blue Pullman.</p>
<p>A small number of 47s actually used to be designated as Class 48s, as these were fitted with different engines. All were later refitted with standard Class 47 <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulzer_%28manufacturer%29.html" title="Sulzer (manufacturer)">Sulzer</a> engines. One of these locos is preserved at the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Central_Railway_afed.html" title="Great Central Railway">Great Central Railway</a>. Another example was 47114. An attempt was made to save this loco, however it was scrapped at <a href="../../../c/_/f/C_F_Booth_516a.html" title="C F Booth">C F Booth</a>, Rotherham in March 2005.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_Rail_Services_54e8.html" title="Direct Rail Services">Direct Rail Services</a> (DRS) has a fleet of three active Class 47s: 47237/501/802. 47298 is presently out of service and is rumoured to be donating parts to 47829 (see below). All are overhauled and painted in DRS blue livery. Use of these locos is rare, and one has been hired to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Trains_b928.html" title="Virgin Trains">Virgin Trains</a> on several occasions over the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, both for standby duty and, on a couple of weekends, for use on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Wales_Coast_Line_3756.html" title="North Wales Coast Line">North Wales Coast Line</a>. Sporadic use sees them deployed on route-learning duties and tripping other locomotives to the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brush_Traction_c10a.html" title="Brush Traction">Brush Works</a> at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughborough.html" title="Loughborough">Loughborough</a>. Use on freight is unusual. DRS have also recently purchased 47306 'The Sapper' from EWS, and 47829 from Riviera Trains. Both of these locomotives are currently out of service.</p>
<p>It is expected that 47829 will be repaired using parts from stored 47298. Meanwhile 47306 was confirmed as having passed into preservation on 25th February in a statement released by the Bodmin &amp; Wenford Mainline Diesel Group. The locomotive moved from from St Blazey to Bodmin in March 2007.</p>
<p>The company acquired 47790 from <a href="../../../e/w/s/EWS_59c8.html" title="EWS">EWS</a> in February 2007.</p>

<p>This operator no longer uses Class 47 locomotives, with the final two withdrawn in June 2004.

<p>The company offered all but one of their stored Class 47 locomotives for sale in January 2007. The details of the tender process were revealed in late February 2007. The locomotives were sold as follows</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_47_45e6.html" title="Edit section: First Great Western">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Great Western</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Great_Western_5266.html" title="First Great Western">First Great Western</a> inherited a fleet of Class 47/8 locomotives, which were primarily used to haul the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Riviera_62c7.html" title="Night Riviera">Night Riviera</a> sleeper and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorail.html" title="Motorail">Motorail</a> trains. They were employed on day passenger trains from the capital to the West Country at times when there was a low availability of other traction. The fleet consisted of seven locomotives, namely nos. 47811/813/815/816/830/832/846.</p>
<p>Locomotives were painted in a green-based livery, which was later embellished with a gold bodyside stripe. Several of the fleet were named after local attractions or place, such as nos. 47813 '<a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_Great_Britain_57c4.html" title="SS Great Britain">SS Great Britain</a>' and 47832 '<a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Tamar_7ed7.html" title="River Tamar">Tamar</a>'.</p>
<p>From 2001, First Great Western decided to replace the Class 47 fleet with re-engineered <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_57_748f.html" title="British Rail Class 57">Class 57</a> locomotives. A prototype, no. 57601, was extensively tested by First Great Western, and resulted in an order for four production locomotives, numbered 57602-605. These started to replace the Class 47 fleet from 2003 onwards. Most of the 47s were transferred to other operators, although one, no. 47846 '<a href="../../../t/h/o/Thor.html" title="Thor">THOR</a>', was rebuilt to a Class 57. To commemorate the retirement of the Class 47 fleet, the final locomotive, no. 47815 '<a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Abertawe Landore</a>', was specially repainted into its original British Railways two-tone green livery.</p>
<p>The final two locomotives, nos. 47811 and 47815, were retired after working a London-Penzance and return special train on 11th December 2004.</p>
<p>However, in April <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, FGW hired no. 47840, to cover for the non-availability of Class 57 locomotives as they underwent modifications. After this too failed while working an empty stock train, 47s were briefly hired in from Cotswold Rail to maintain the service, with 47813 and 47828 seeing service. All 57s soon returned and the brief revival of 47s on the Night Riviera was ended.</p>
<p>Continuing availability issues with Class 57s saw locomotives from Cotswold Rail hired in to work the Night Riviera service on more than one occasion in January and July 2006.</p>
<p>47703 hired in from <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotswold_Rail_3157.html" title="Cotswold Rail">Cotswold Rail</a> CRHH sector was commandeered to work the Night Riviera service from <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penzance.html" title="Penzance">Penzance</a> to <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddington.html" title="Paddington">Paddington</a> on 31st January, the first such incident since July 2006.</p>

<p>Freightliner were once a very large user of the Class 47, using the locomotives to haul intermodal 'freightliner' trains across the length and breadth of the country. In recent times, the class have played much less of a role with Freightliner as the company shifted the diesel traction used on their trains. First a batch of 12 class 57s were converted from 47s. A decision was made to shift the main diesel traction to Class 66s from General Motors in Canada. As the new 66s arrived, the 47s' days were numbered, with the majority being withdrawn from service. Deadlines for fitting of <a href="../../../t/p/w/TPWS_2ea7.html" title="TPWS">TPWS</a> to the fleet also hit the 47s, with just a small fleet of the original Freightliner 'no-heat' 47s left. A necessity for Class 47s with electric train heat (ETH) however did arise, and some locomotives were hired from Porterbrook leasing. These were 47805, 47812, 47829, 47847 and 47848. When the lease on these locos expanded they passed on to Riviera Trains, leaving a gap in the Freightliner fleet. 47811, 47816, 47830 and 47841 were acquired from Porterbrook to fulfill the continued need for ETH fitted locos. Locomotives still in service as of April 2006 are: 47150, 47811, 47816, 47830 and 47841.</p>
<p>Freightliner offered a number of its stored locomotives for sale on 5th February 2007. Included in the tender are&#160;: 47197 47270 47279 47292 47302 47303 47309 47358 and 47370. It was reported that all the locos have been sold to TJ Thompson and are all likely to be scrapped. 47270 has since been resold into preservation at the <a href="../../../n/e/n/Nene_Valley_Railway_ce52.html" title="Nene Valley Railway">Nene Valley Railway</a>, this once hybrid locomotive was the test bed for the first class 57/0s.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/m/_/FM_Rail_0602.html" title="FM Rail">FM Rail</a> (previously Fragonset Railways) operates the largest Class 47 fleet of the spot-hire companies. Fragonset was formed in 1996, and is based at <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derby.html" title="Derby">Derby</a>. In the early days the main contract was the hire of locomotives to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Trains_b928.html" title="Virgin Trains">Virgin Trains</a>. However, since then, Virgin has ceased using locomotive-hauled trains. Therefore Fragonset has diversified into the charter market, and also hires locomotives to freight companies, such as <a href="../../../g/b/_/GB_Railfreight_9de4.html" title="GB Railfreight">GB Railfreight</a>, at short notice. Locomotive livery is black, with either a red bodyside stripe, or large 'Fragonset' lettering.</p>
<p>The operational fleet currently comprises nos. 47145/355/709/712/716/832, with nos. 47053/375/488/701/710/715/780 undergoing repairs. Fragonset also own many stored locomotives, which could be repaired if demand increases. Two of the operational locomotives- 47709 'DIONISOS' and 47712 'ARTEMIS' have recently been repainted in the striking 'Nanking Blue' livery and are often seen working with the 'Blue Pullman' charter train for Hertfordshire Railtours (which is owned by FM Rail).</p>
<p>FM Rail went into receivership on 11th December 2006 and has subsequently seen a lot of assets sold including locomotives and coaching stock.</p>
<p>47703 was sold to Cotswold Rail on 29th January 2007. The following have been sold to EMR (European Metal Recycling) and are expected to be cut up shortly&#160;: ex Barrow Hill 47053 and 47717, ex Derby&#160;: 47710 and ex MOD Kineton&#160;: 47186 47201 47219 47226 47228 47280 47293 47307 47313 47314 47335 and 47360.</p>
<p>Locomotives 47145, 47709 &amp; 47712 were moved to Carnforth on 22nd February for storage. They are embargoed from working at present. 47355 also moved to Carnforth on 3rd April 2007, its to be seen what is to happen with this locomotive.</p>
