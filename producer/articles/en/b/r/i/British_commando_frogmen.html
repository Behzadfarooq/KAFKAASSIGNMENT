<ul>
<li>April: The British Navy formed the "Experimental Submarine Flotilla", initially based at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. It was led by Commanders G.M.Sladen and W.R. "Tiny" Fell, who began to train frogmen in secret. The Navy called their manned torpedoes <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manned_torpedo.html" title="Manned torpedo">Chariots</a>. Many of their frogmen's breathing sets' oxygen cylinders were German pilot's oxygen cylinders recovered from shot-down German <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> planes. Those first breathing sets may have been modified <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davis_Submerged_Escape_Apparatus_a93e.html" title="Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus">Davis Submarine Escape Sets</a>; their fullface masks were the type intended for the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siebe_Gorman_Salvus_6730.html" title="Siebe Gorman Salvus">Siebe Gorman Salvus</a>. But in later operations different designs were used, leading to a fullface mask with one big face window. One version had a flip-up single window for both eyes to let the user get <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binoculars.html" title="Binoculars">binoculars</a> to his eyes when on the surface. They used bulky thick diving suits called <a href="../../../s/l/a/Sladen_suit.html" title="Sladen suit">Sladen suits</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li>1942 June: The Experimental Submarine Flotilla moved to "Port D" on <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Erisort_3a78.html" title="Loch Erisort">Loch Erisort</a> in Scotland<a href="http://www.hebrideanconnections.com/Details.aspx?subjectid=38913&amp;relationship=associated~with~location%E2%80%A6&amp;caller=38002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hebrideanconnections.com/Details.aspx?subjectid=38913&amp;relationship=associated~with~location%E2%80%A6&amp;caller=38002" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. They got their first powered manned torpedoes, the "Mark I Chariot". Its hull was 21 inch diameter. It could make 2.9 <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_%28speed%29.html" title="Knot (speed)">knots</a> and could dive safely to 20 feet depth. The nose was a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhead.html" title="Warhead">warhead</a> with 600 pounds of high explosive. Training was hard. The men often suffered from <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen_poisoning.html" title="Oxygen poisoning">oxygen poisoning</a> because of the use of pure oxygen at depth, burst <a href="../../../e/a/r/Eardrum.html" title="Eardrum">eardrums</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinus.html" title="Sinus">sinus</a> trouble. The strangeness of the Chariots added to their problems. They were trained to ride and steer for a long time under water, and to then cut through harbor defence nets. The hardest part was learning to work with the Chariots' warheads.</li>
<li>August: The British charioteers went back to Base HHZ on <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Cairnbawn_4fba.html" title="Loch Cairnbawn">Loch Cairnbawn</a> in Scotland to train to attack bigger better-defended places. One died in training.</li>
<li>September: The Norwegian Navy officer <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leif_Larsen_0899.html" title="Leif Larsen">Leif Larsen</a> told the British Navy that he wanted to attack the German battleship <i><a href="../../../t/i/r/Tirpitz.html" title="Tirpitz">Tirpitz</a></i> in Asenfjord, a branch of the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trondheimfjord.html" title="Trondheimfjord">Trondheimfjord</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>.</li>
<li>Operation "Title":-

<li><a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a>: A storm broke the fastening bolts of the chariots, which were lost. The attack was called off.</li>

The ten members of the operation set off for Sweden in two groups. Nine reached Sweden; Germans captured one and later shot him as a spy.
<ul>
<li>This operation was later portrayed in the 1955 war film, <i><a href="../../../a/b/o/Above_Us_the_Waves_%28film%29_4023.html" title="Above Us the Waves (film)">Above Us the Waves</a></i>, featuring <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mills_3410.html" title="John Mills">John Mills</a>, which was based on Operation Title and the later <i><a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Source_1083.html" title="Operation Source">Operation Source</a></i> <a href="../../../x/_/c/X_class_submarine.html" title="X class submarine">X-Craft</a> midget submarine attacks on the <i>Tirpitz</i>.</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>late November: Britain sent 26 Chariots to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a>, and they became part of the "Tenth Submarine Flotilla". Three submarines received containers on their decks to carry the Chariots.</li>
<li>Operation "Principle":-
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>: The British submarine <i>P-311</i> carrying 3 Chariots and 10 Charioteers left Marsamxett on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> to attack <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Maddalena_4a00.html" title="La Maddalena">La Maddalena</a> on <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardinia.html" title="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, but struck a <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_mine.html" title="Naval mine">naval mine</a> near Sardinia and sank with all hands.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>: The British submarines <i>Thunderbolt</i>, and <i>Trooper</i>, and <i>Unruffled</i> (P46), left Malta carrying Chariots.</li>

<ul>
<li>Operation "Principal":-
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">January 3</a>:The submarines HMS/m <i>Thunderbolt</i> and HMS/m <i>P311</i> carrying two chariots each and HMS/m <i>Trooper</i> carrying three, with their respective crews, left to carry out this operation, the first by Britain involving the use of chariots. <i>P311</i> was scheduled to attack targets at La Maddalena, while the other two submarines headed for the coast of <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> near <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palermo.html" title="Palermo">Palermo</a> in a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaufort_scale.html" title="Beaufort scale">Force 5 wind</a>.</li>
<li>One of the chariots which the <i>Trooper</i> carried, was ridden by Sub-Lieutenant Rodney Dove and Leading Seaman Jimmy Freel. As it was launched, a big wave washed it over the submarine, causing the loss of its limpet mines and the gear to attach the warhead to a ship.</li>
<li>The chariots put mines on ships and patrol boats and sank some of them, but none of the mines exploded.</li>
<li>One chariot put its warhead on the Italian cruiser <i>Ulpio Traiano</i> (under construction), and afterwards smaller explosives on four ships. <i>Ulpio Traiano</i> sank.</li>
<li>Dove's chariot (Chariot XVI) put its warhead on the Italian troop ship <i>Viminale</i> (formerly a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Liner.html" title="Liner">liner</a>), by tying it to the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sternpost.html" title="Sternpost">sternpost</a> with ropes, causing severe damage but not sinking it. While being towed from the harbour for repairs, it was torpedoed by a British submarine and damaged again. Later in the year, while en route for repairs for the second attack, it was sunk by American torpedo boats.</li>
<li>Because of bad weather two chariots did not reach the harbour.</li>
<li>All the chariots were lost; either scuttled, through equipment malfunction or human error. One charioteer died in the attack. The British submarine <i>Unruffled</i> recovered two others. Five had to land and were taken prisoner. Two of these prisoners later escaped from guards in Rome and hid in the <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_City_edb3.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a> until the Americans liberated Rome in 1944. Two others, involved in a quite separate operation,see below escaped from guards in Libya. In the middle of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripoli.html" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> they found a British Army unit and were returned to England.</li>
<li>Dove ended up in a <a href="../../../p/o/w/POW_17fa.html" title="POW">POW</a> camp at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bremen_%28city%29.html" title="Bremen (city)">Bremen</a> in Germany, and got home in May 1945. He received the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">DSO</a>. He died on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">30 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> aged 84: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/20/db2001.xml" class="external text" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/20/db2001.xml" rel="nofollow">obituary</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This left eight charioteers with two Chariots on Malta.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">January 18</a>-19: These two chariots were carried by submarines to attack ships that the Germans were going to be used to block <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripoli.html" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> harbour. The frogmen arrived too late and a blockship was sunk in the harbour mouth. None of the men or chariots returned to Malta.</li>
<li>January: At Loch Corrie and Loch Cairnbawn in Scotland more charioteers were being trained.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/p/r/April_16.html" title="April 16">April 16</a>: Britain sent 14 new charioteers to Malta. In the days following they sent the new Chariot Mark II, also called the "Terry". Its riders sat back to back. It could manage 4.5 knots . The warhead was 1100 pounds of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpex.html" title="Torpex">Torpex</a> high explosive.</li>
<li>June: During this month, the British submarine <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Unseen_aec3.html" title="HMS Unseen">HMS Unseen</a> carried three chariots from Malta to Sicily. The divers surveyed 100 miles of coast, examining beaches to find dangers for armies who would be landing there later.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">June 11</a>: The other British charioteers went to Loch Cairnbawn.</li>
<li>Late June: Britain sent six more charioteers to Malta, for an operation to attack <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranto.html" title="Taranto">Taranto</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>: <i>Mussolini was replaced by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietro_Badoglio_2d41.html" title="Pietro Badoglio">Pietro Badoglio</a> as the head of the Italian government.</i> As a result, the attack on <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taranto.html" title="Taranto">Taranto</a> was called off, and the British frogmen were all sent to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. After this, there was only one British chariot attack in the Mediterranean.</li>
<li>July: At Loch Cairnbawn a charioteer died through an accident.</li>

The <i>Grecale</i> launched the boats, which then carried the chariots and their charioteers and released them three miles from La Spezia harbor.

This thwarted a German plan to sink the <i>Bolzano</i> and the <i>Gorizia</i> where they would block the harbor entrance.
