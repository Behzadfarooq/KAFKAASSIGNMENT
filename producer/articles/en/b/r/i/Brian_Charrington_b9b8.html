	    <p><b>Brian Charrington</b> (b. 1957) was a British <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_trafficker.html" title="Drug trafficker">drug trafficker</a> and owner of a car dealership in <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesbrough.html" title="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a> who, along with <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_Warren_%28criminal%29_2cde.html" title="Curtis Warren (criminal)">Curtis "Cocky" Warren</a>, operated in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_East_England_39af.html" title="North East England">North East England</a> during the late-1980s and eventually built a criminal empire with links to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> as well as connections in South America, Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>Using his personal yacht, the two sailed to France on visitor passports and, with 10-year passports, traveled to <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> in September 1991 where they arranged with neighboring Colombian drug cartels to smuggle large amounts of cocaine in steal boxes concealed in lead ingots into Great Britain. Although one ingot was examined in the first shipment, customs officials allowed the shipment to pass through.</p>
<p>However, later notified by Dutch police, customs stopped a second shipment which contained 907kg of cocaine and had Charrington, Warren and twenty-six others placed under arrest in early 1992. Despite Charrington's status as an informant for the North-East Regional Crime Squad, customs officials went forward with their prosecution despite protests from his "handlers" Harry Knaggs and Ian Weedon. Eventually, through Tory MP <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Devlin_7aa8.html" title="Tim Devlin">Tim Devlin</a>, a meeting was arraigned in which Customs was ordered to drop charges against Charrington on January 28, 1993 (several months later, Knaggs was clocked by customs officials driving a £70,000 BMW registered to Charrington) <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,2763,220590,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,2763,220590,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Although British authorities were unable to bring him to trial in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> on his involvement in the smuggling of cocaine worth an estimated £150 million, Charrington was deported to Australia, where his visa was revoked shortly after his arrival. Traveling to Spain, he resided at the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costa_Blanca_0e64.html" title="Costa Blanca">Costa Blanca</a> resort in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calpe.html" title="Calpe">Calpe</a> and later, from a fortified villa, laundered millions of pounds which he used to bring hashish from <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> across the border which he continued to sell.</p>
<p>During the late-1990s, Charrington would continue to be in court when, while at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Crown_Court_6328.html" title="Bristol Crown Court">Bristol Crown Court</a>, he was acquitted of charges after it was found customs officers had illegally boarded his boat carrying 4 tons of hashish worth £80 million in 1999. Illegally reentering the country to see his family in 2002, he was arrested by police near <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeter.html" title="Exeter">Exeter</a> and faced another trial at Leeds Crown Court involving two suspended detectives and a former detective which would be dismissed when the judge refused to admit phone tap recording as evidence.</p>
<p>Soon after his court appearance, a warrant was issued by the Bow Street Magistrates for his extradition to Germany and, in July 2003, Charrington was sentenced to seven years in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt%2C_Germany_cd42.html" title="Frankfurt, Germany">Frankfurt, Germany</a> for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into Germany (phone recordings linking Charrington to a smuggling operation run by his son Brian Charrington, Jr., who is serving seven years and three months, were used in his conviction).</p>
<p>Following his scheduled release in 2010, he will face extradited to France to serve a two year prison term after 650 kilos of <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashish.html" title="Hashish">hashish</a> were found in his possession on his yacht in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>.</p>
<p>In a civil suit filed by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assets_Recovery_Agency_a7a2.html" title="Assets Recovery Agency">Assets Recovery Agency</a> (ARA) in 2004, the government agency ruled that assests seized from Charrington and Warren follownig their trial in 1992 had been acquired as a result of criminal activity, specifically <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money_laundering.html" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trafficking_in_human_beings.html" title="Trafficking in human beings">people trafficking</a>. Although both men claimed ownership of the estimated £3.6 million, each had earlier denied ownership following the seizure of the original £2.2 million from Chaarington's residence in Middlesbrough by HM Customs &amp; Excise in 1992.</p>
<p>After Charrington's claim that the money had been earned from legitimate diamond dealing was rejected three months earlier by the High Court (who believed he had been laundering the money for Mario Halley), Warren was allowed additional time to provide evidence to back up his claim, however, his appeal was also rejected on October 6. Subsequently, the ARA was granted its largest Civil Recovery Order with the proceeds going towards funding government crime reduction programs <a href="http://www.assetsrecovery.gov.uk/TargetsandResults/CaseStudies/CurtisWarren.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.assetsrecovery.gov.uk/TargetsandResults/CaseStudies/CurtisWarren.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
