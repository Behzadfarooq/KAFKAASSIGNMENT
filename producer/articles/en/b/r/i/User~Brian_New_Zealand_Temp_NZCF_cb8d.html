<p>The NZCF is a disciplined and well structured youth development and leadership-training organisation, with units comprises from <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerikeri.html" title="Kerikeri">Kerikeri</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invercargill.html" title="Invercargill">Invercargill</a>, which provide male and female teenagers from 13 – 18 years old, with an opportunity to experience a wide range of outdoor activities and develop leadership qualities.</p>

<p>The structured training provides a 3-year programme and promotes teamwork, self-reliance, resourcefulness, perseverance and an ethic of community service. The training is developed by using the processes developed by and for the NZDF, modified to be implemented by civilian cadet force officers and undertaken by young and developing adults.</p>
<p>The NZDF provides assistance to the NZCF within the limitations directed by the Government. The policy for the use of this limited assistance is largely established in consultation with the recognised civilian support organisations, but facilities and resources of the NZDF are available in support of cadet activities provided defence priorities permit.</p>
<p>Members of the NZCF are, by definition in the Defence Act 1990, not members of the NZDF but the aim is to train cadets for citizen leadership in the communities, through training courses and programmes similar to those used in the NZDF.</p>
<p>The NZCF is a youth training organisation governed and supported by the NZ defence Force dependant on community support and volunteer Officers. Young adults with respect for themselves and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community.html" title="Community">community</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment.html" title="Environment">environment</a> are the products of this system, which, in its present form has existed since <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>.</p>

<p>The Defence Act 1990 gives the Minister of Defence discretion to raise a Cadet Force. The organisation is not part of the NZDF but is controlled by the NZDF and is supported in partnership by the Government, through the NZDF, and the community.</p>
<p>Training programmes emphasise personal development. The organisation offers a quality, nationally coordinated training programme which aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conduct of training courses or training programmes similar to those undertaken by the Armed Forces;</li>
<li>The promotion of an appreciation among members of the Cadet Forces of the functions and operation of the Armed Forces; and</li>
<li>The development of good citizenship among members of the Cadet Forces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NZCF is a youth programme sponsored by the NZDF. Cadets have great fun challenging themselves. Mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Teenagers, aged 13 (or above) or in Year 9 at a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> Secondary School can join the NZCF, the NZCF is open to both girls and boys. It costs between: $10.00-$20.00, per school term; (each unit sets its own fees). The <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority.html" title="Majority">majority</a> of cadets serve for up to three years. After that, senior cadets, can serve until their 20th birthday; however, as the NZCF is <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntary.html" title="Voluntary">voluntary</a>, they can leave at any time.</p>
<p>There is no requirement to meet a specific level of fitness to join the NZCF. However, like many activities, if cadets are fit they will get greater enjoyment from their experiences.</p>
<p>There are over 100 Units across New Zealand, <a href="http://www.cadetforces.mil.nz/locations/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cadetforces.mil.nz/locations/index.html" rel="nofollow">See here for the locations of cadet units, around New Zealand</a></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> Defence Act, established the NZCF, as a volunteer organisation, for which the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Defence_3423.html" title="Minister of Defence">Minister of Defence</a> was responsible. The open units were required to be initiated and funded by the community and the Chief of Defence Forces was authorised to “direct and supervise” the NZCF and provide military support which was initially confirmed as uniforms, training and some equipment at a cost of no greater than $400,000.</p>
<p>Centralised supervision was established by the Chief of Defence Force of all three Corps and a Commandant appointed with Regular Force Defence personnel, under the control of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commandant.html" title="Commandant">Commandant</a>, provided at 5 locations around New Zealand to support units. Cadet Force officers were appointed by the Minister of Defence with Cadet Force commissions, on a voluntary unpaid basis with authority to wear military uniform and rank.</p>
<p>The role of the NZCF ceased being primarily of military training and the preparation of young men for the Armed Forces and became predominantly adventure and development motivated with a military flavour and about 50% military subjects associated with providing knowledge of the roles and functions of the NZDF. The new thrust was to provide “good citizenship skills” to young men under the training methods used by the Military Forces. Female cadets were accepted from approximately 1978 and although the service flavour and well tried and tested services training methods and character was retained, additional training was introduced by units, which were desired by them and the community supporters.</p>

<p>The loss of Government financial support and turbulent social change in the 1970’s caused school units to be abandoned such that by 1985 there were only 9 remaining units, including the two earliest formed at Christ’s and Nelson Colleges. Meanwhile the Sea Cadet Corps had increased to 17 units and the ATC to 50 in the open community units. A significant development saw the introduction of Cadet Corps Units into the open community to satisfy the demand which the schools had abandoned, the first open Cadet Unit being City of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porirua.html" title="Porirua">Porirua</a> unit in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October.html" title="October">October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>
