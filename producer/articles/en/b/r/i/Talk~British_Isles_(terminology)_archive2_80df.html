<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Intro</span></h2>
<p>The format of this new introduction is good, but I have a few problems with some of their content:</p>
<ul>
<li>When does Ireland ever mean ROI and NI as a political term? It is used for the two (sparingly) in sport, but this is not a main point for the introduction. If anything, Ireland as a political term is the ROI only, this being the translation of the state's official Irish language name, Éire.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Britian as a political term is not necessairily inaccuarate for the UK. A citizen from the United Kingdom is 'British' after all. Equally, I'm not sure if 'Britain' really means 'Great Britain' geographically. I think the word is a very ambiguous term, and such a claer cut definition is not really available</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.234.4.10.html" title="User:129.234.4.10">129.234.4.10</a> 13:35, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>O, one other thing, Ive replaced country with state in the intro; its too ambigous for an encyclopedia <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:49, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>1) I agree, "Ireland" meaning ROI and NI isn't politically meaningful. The use of "Ireland" as in sport for the island of Ireland (a.k.a. "the 32 counties") is common, but <i>not</i> political (except in its connotations/evocations of the notion of a united Ireland).</p>
<p>But we now have two lines which mean the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ireland (as a political term) = Republic of Ireland</li>
<li>Ireland (as the name of a country) = Republic of Ireland</li>
</ol>
<p>One should be removed.</p>
<p>2a) Yes, "British" denotes UK nationality, but "Britain" <i>is</i> inaccurate when substituted for UK. Perhaps a similar situation obtains for <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, whereby citizens are "American", but don't necessarily describe themselves as "from America", "America" presumably denoting either the mainland US, or anywhere in the continents of the Americas.</p>
<p>In either case, someone from <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> isn't likely to describe themselves as "from Britain". So yes, I suppose "Britain" is not "necessarily" inaccurate, it just happens to be inaccurate for about 1.7 million people out of 59.5 million&#160;:)</p>
<p>2b) I'll quote this, which I quoted on the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> discussion page.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/AboutBritainArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10012517&amp;chk=loPvDs" class="external free" title="http://www.direct.gov.uk/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/AboutBritainArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10012517&amp;chk=loPvDs" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/Gtgl1/GuideToGovernment/AboutBritain/AboutBritainArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10012517&amp;chk=loPvDs</a></p>
<p>"The full title of this country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Great Britain (or just Britain) does not include Northern Ireland. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK."</p>
<p>Britain is a typical abbreviation for Great Britain.</p>
<p>3) Changing country to state still leaves us with two identical entries for "Ireland".</p>

<ul>
<li>The official name of the<b>Republic of Ireland</b> in its constitution is <b>Ireland</b>. Therefore Ireland is a political term, in fact it's probably the most political term of the whole lot. The constitution of Ireland until the good friday agreement explicitly stated that the country of Ireland encompasses the whole island and that Northern Ireland should be regarded as occupied territory. After the good friday agreement the offical name of the state is still Ireland, however it's terrotorial boundaries are somewhat fudged. Either way Ireland is very much a political term Bandraoi 17:23, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi Bandraoi. The word "political" in the intro of this article doesn't indicate that the term referred to is contentious, or the subject of political debate. It just means that the definition given is the political sense of the term. It's like the difference between a relief map and a political map. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 01:59, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should also be remembered that ROI has dropped its official claims to NI <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's right. I may sound like one of those American journalists who has "never met anyone who voted Republican", but I never met anyone from ROI who thought the claims to Northern Ireland in the constitution were anything but an embarrassment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, I should also have commented that the territorial boundary of Ireland (Republic of) is far from fudged. It is perfectly well defined. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 14:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is that embarrassment political or historical? I mean people might not want to be bothered with it anymore (especially now that Ireland is going so enormously uphill economically), but if you specifically ask them if the English (or rather Scottish (or should I say British...&#160;:) )) have a historical right to Northern Ireland, you'd probably hear a different story. At least, based on my experience there about ten years ago. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We're probably getting a bit off-topic here. But for the record, I disagree with much of what you say.</p>
<ul>
<li>The embarrassment isn't "political or historical", it's the embarrassment of empty triumphalism. The *claim* is, of course, political, based perhaps on certain readings of history.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Economic growth in Ireland didn't bring about the removal of articles 2 and 3 (the claim to Northern Ireland), the peace process did. Some people do like to throw in every success of Ireland over the last decade under one heading (e.g. "Celtic Tiger"), but there are in fact different, independent forces at work shaping Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Not sure who you spoke to ten years ago, but I think for both of us, what people say to us depends on what questions we ask, how free people feel to speak, etc. Oh, and whether you're in a city or not.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>In the cities, there is a kind of muted dislike of "the English" in some circles (especially soccer fans&#160;:) ), even though, as you say, the "occupiers in the North" are probably more Scottish than English. This wouldn't fit in with a simple view of Celt versus Anglo-Saxon, and seems to be ignored! I have less experience outside the cities, but anti-English sentiment seems to get stronger, in my anecdotal experience.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If you ask "do the X people have a historical right to Y territory" most sane, informed people will answer no. The Celts "replaced" (murdered, one guesses) the previous inhabitants of Ireland. They were then murdered, raped and pillaged by waves of invaders. So who has the historical "right"? I would answer no to your question, but I would also rule out historical precedents for any other territorial claims, such as those removed from the Irish constitution. (c.f. Israel.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 15:52, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also usually make the comparison with Israel. That country should not have been created, but now that the majority of people there have been born there, they've got an equal right to the land as the Palestinians did at first. And the Palestinians are equally losing that right. Same for Northern Ireland. By the way, I didn't have to ask for opinions. They were volunteered. The best example was when I was on an Irish bus that passed through Northern Ireland. When we passed a bunch of British military training in mock battle you should have seen the anger on the faces of the people on the bus. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 18:00, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can somebody do something about that image? Sorry, but it doesn't represent the shape of the British Isles very well at all. It look as if there's been some terrible disaster - the area between Newcastle and Edinburgh has been devastated, as has East Anglia, and Cardiff and the Scottish islands aren't there anymore.... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 17:00, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>"Great Britain (as a geographical term) = the largest island"</li>
<li>"Ireland (as a geographical term) = the second largest island"</li>

<p>I'm not convinced - does this mean that the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_ca39.html" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a> isn't, geographically, part of Great Britain, and that <a href="../../../i/n/i/Inishmore.html" title="Inishmore">Inishmore</a> isn't, geographically, part of Ireland?

<dd>Um, yes. Inishmore is an island off the island of Ireland, I would have thought that's fairly unproblematic. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 00:28, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. In what sense would the Isle of Wight be part of Great Britain? It isn't part of the island called Great Britain. Do you mean it is politically part of it? (If so, that is covered by the second line, which gives the political meaning of Great Britain.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 21:44, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A geographical unit <i>can</i> consist of more than one island. The British Isles are an example of that. It would complicate the neat overview further still, though, and the purpose of this article is to present a simple overview to those who are confused. I somehow hope that this is sufficiently disputed, so we can say it falls under the 'disclaimer' below the first overview. But this <i>should</i> be mentioned further down, at least for the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_ca39.html" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, because it's a fairly well known island (if only because of the festival). An interesting phrase from the article: "it became the last part of the United Kingdom to convert to Christianity - almost a century after the rest of the mainland". So it's part of the mainland?</dd>
<dd>Hold on. The Isle of Wight isn't mentioned at all! That won't do of course. Neither is <a href="../../../i/n/i/Inishmore.html" title="Inishmore">Inishmore</a>, or, rather the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aran_Islands_e885.html" title="Aran Islands">Aran Islands</a>, but they're a bit too small and little known to be mentioned here. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:44, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it's important to use language correctly here. It's not accurate to describe Ireland as an island, since it's clearly more than one island. I suspect that the same is true for Great Britain. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 07:46, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An island can include (much) smaller islands. Surely you would agree that Brownsea Island, or Lindisfarne, or any of the islands in the Thames, are part of the island of Great Britain? Almost every island reasonably sized island has islets round its edge; e.g. the Needles are part of the Isle of Wight, which is part of the island of Great Britain. <a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdC_ca7a.html" title="User:EdC">EdC</a> 17:14, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While that page is detailed and well written it does include Ireland in Great Britain (CORRECTION: I mean in British Isles! Paulc1001 ). Whether you like it or not, this is not an agreed fact.

<p>To be honest, I think that the majority of people, especially outside of Ireland, would accept 'British Isles' as a reasonable term for the islands. This is not to say that we should ignore the possible confusion or connotations that this term brings; but acknowledge taht it remains the most common <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:01, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rob, I appreciate your attempt for balance, but I think the point is still being missed (no offence to you). For one thing, it's a little more than confusion that's caused, more like downright anger and offence in all honesty, sorry. And I'm afraid the idea of the majority outside Ireland doesn't really stack up; do the Chinese or South Americans use the term? I can't find any reference in the Spanish side of Wikipedia (e.g. <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Islas" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Islas" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Islas</a>) to some "Islas Britanicas" for one thing. And a quick scan of the french side seems the same I think. I think that people outside the UK don't really think that much of articially lumping these islands together. Let me ask you in all seriousness, why do you or any Briton feel the need to shoe-horn another independent country into an artificial amalgamation in which you are the "senior partner"? No offence, seriously, but really, why? The "junior partner" doesn't generally welcome or accept the term. I think in reality, that many if not most Britons when it's pointed out reasonably to them, would see that "ok, yes, I can see how that would rankle... I don't think I'd like to be labelled as living in 'Islands off France' or something". Paulc1001 19:45, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're overstating this a little. I know there are those who don't like the term, but I can't say I've ever encountered "downright anger and offence" (other than on the Web, where it's easy to be angry and offended&#160;:) ). Also, it sounds as if you are disputing the term's very existence, but there is no doubt that it has currency as a geographical term - we certainly used it in Inter Cert Geography. Like it it or not, there is no other term to describe these islands as a group which has gained currency (I quite like "These Islands" myself). The only problem occurs when British people decide that because the islands are called the "British Isles" that the <i>people</i> of the islands can be described as "British" also - see elsewhere on this talk page. This may be a legitimate reason to look for an alternative term, but as of now "British Isles" is the only one in general use. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 20:51, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ryano, no I'm not disputing the existence of the term (though I wouldn't be unhappy if it didn't!) I think it should be referred to and discussed of course, but I would like the discussion to include all aspects, and a fair acknowledgment of those to take offence to it as well as the illogicality of it. I don't really think what you describe is the 'only problem' either to be honest. As for alternative terms, 'these islands' is not too bad, as is Britain &amp; Ireland, but I often wonder why there is such an urge amongst some to create <i>any</i> label. As I seem to have found, other languages don't seem to, and we don't refer to New Zealand as part of the Australian Isles!&#160;:-) Paulc1001 21:24, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if there's a dispute over the term we have a responsibility to characterise this fairly, and not go over the top. My impression is that most Irish people are not too bothered by the term, i.e. they don't go out of their way not to use it. My own personal opinion is that it's in the same category as "Irish Sea", or "Indian Ocean", i.e. a convenient geographical term which has no political status.</dd>
<dd>As for the urge to create labels, it appears to be pretty strong - we have a label for Australia and New Zealand after all - the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipodes.html" title="Antipodes">Antipodes</a>. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 22:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think its artificial to geographically lump the islands together... after all, they are a distinct archipalego off the French coast. I think it really is confusion thats the problem with the term - mainly from non-British/Irish who, when using the term, presume that the islands must be a political whole. This is then what causes offence.</p>
<p>The use is far from British only, and is not created to suggest a 'senior partenr' or a 'junior partner' - the name comes from the largest of the isles, in the way the Canary Isles are anmed after Grand Canaria.</p>
<p>As for the lack of use of British Isles abroad; the first result of 'Iles Britaniques' in google is the French Wikipedia page <a href="http://www.google.fr/search?hl=fr&amp;q=iles+britanniques&amp;spell=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.fr/search?hl=fr&amp;q=iles+britanniques&amp;spell=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>; which opens with [my translation] 'The British Isles are an archipalego situated to the north-west of the European continent, consisting principaly of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as numerous smaller islands'. In fact, the term gives us a total of 1 730 000 results in google.fr. A search in google.es for the Spanish 'Islas Británicas' returns over half a million results, including that Wikipedia article you were looking for <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islas_Brit%C3%A1nicas" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islas_Brit%C3%A1nicas" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which again describes the British Isles as the traditional name for the islands off the north-west coast of Europe inclusing Great Britain and Ireland... which is the term now used in the article</p>
<p>Yes 'British Isles' can cause offence, especially if used politically. But no it is not used by 'some', it is used by a majority to describe the islands as a whole, when it is useful to do so geographically. Thus the article should describe the geographical term as the common one for the islands, but note that this can cause confusion leading to offence, or is offensive if used politically. As a result alternatives have been sugested, but none of these have ever really taken off. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 23:11, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"(Sovereign) state" versus "Country"</span></h2>
<p>Rather than reverting each others edits and writing rediculosuly long edit comments, how about a little healthy discussion re: the state/country debate? Now my understanding of the situation is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people prefer <b>country</b> as they see it as the most neutral term, and that the subtle meaning of state would be lost on most people</li>
<li>Those prefering <b>state</b> argue that it is the most accurate phrasing over the unsepcific country and that it is not a loaded word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, for my part, I beleive that the word 'state' would be better as it is a more accurate description of the UK. Country is a synonym for state, but it can also be a synonym for other words, notably nation - which is where Scottish/Irish nationalists would start to get angry.</p>
<p>What is mroe important however, is that the point of this article - claryfying the terms - is not lost in a debate over semantics. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:21, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I more or less agree with your comments above, once you substitute <b>sovereign state</b> wherever you say <b>state</b>. In theory this means I should insist on <b>sovereign country</b> instead of <b>country</b>, but that is unidiomatic. It is overwhelmingly usual to think of a country as a self-governing (a.k.a independent) <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_politic.html" title="Body politic">body politic</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a> is the best word to describe the <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_politic.html" title="Body politic">body politic</a> of the UK, and that of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>. I have two kinds of reason.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First: <b>style</b>. The Wikipedia, and any encyclopedia, should be written in the least technical, clearest, most jargon-free language possible. In a geopolitics article it would, no doubt, be necessary to define, contrast, and carefully use the words <i>nation</i>, <i>state</i>, <i>nation-state</i>, <i>country</i>, etc., along with subtle explanations of whether a member of the EU, for instance, is really independent. This is not necessary in this article and therefore the most common term, if correct, should be used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second: <b>precedent</b>. As I have noted elsewhere:</dd>
</dl>

<dd>"The full title of this country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Great Britain (or just Britain) does not include Northern Ireland. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>... this official UK government web page uses the word <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a> to describe the UK. The <a href="../../../e/u/_/EU_f2e6.html" title="EU">EU</a> considers all of its members to be countries, including the UK.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Arguments that <i>country</i> is "too vague" for an encyclopedia are setting a bar of precision that is too high. Any article could easily be ruined by including technical jargon. In one article I replaced the technical term <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> with the much more common word <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbreviation.html" title="Abbreviation">abbreviation</a>. More specific than that wasn't needed. In another article I replaced "ident" with "logo". Again, the more technical word is correct, but confusing and unnecessary. The principle applies to <i>country</i> versus <i>sovereign state</i> too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I defined myself as a "human being", would the precision pushers claim that was "unencyclopedic"? Would they scream that "human being" is vague mumbo jumbo, and start arguing over which of <i>homo-sapien</i>, <i>male human</i>, <i>male human being</i>, <i>male hominid</i>, etc., etc. was "correct", even though they all are, along with "human being"? If they wouldn't, they should think clearly about <i>country</i> versus <i>sovereign state</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Precedents on Wikipedia: if <i>country</i> is too vague to describe a sovereign state, then we would have to change hundreds of articles, including: <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The status of UK as a country" is not in question, despite the comments that may be found on the UK talk page. The dictionary definition of country is "a nation or state", so the UK is clearly a country since it is a state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The only question is whether <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a> is a suitable word for use in this encyclopedia article, and whether <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereign_state.html" title="Sovereign state">sovereign state</a> is inferior. I have put my reasons why I think <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a> is superior. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 06:17, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, I see no problem using the more specific <i>sovereign state</i> later on in the same article, if the context calls for extra precision. This happens in the UK article, and someone claimed that all occurrences of either word needed to be made the same as one another. That is unnecessary. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 06:21, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Country tends to be used for England, Scotland and Wales as well though, the so called "Home Nations", which are all within the UK. A UK Passport refers to the UK as the "issuing state". We are talking about a country made up of countries, which surely makes little sense. - <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurwellian_eed9.html" title="User:Burwellian">JVG</a> 09:15, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I don't find your points compelling.</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of "issuing state" on any document doesn't make "country" wrong</li>
<li>There's no problem with a country made up of countries. Here for your reference are some definitions from my Collins Dictionary</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>country</b> 1) an area distinguished by its people, culture, language, or government. 2) the territory of a nation or state.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(The UK falls under definition 1) since it is distinguished by government and culture, or alternatively under definition 2) since it is a state.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>state</b> 3) a sovereign political power or community. 6) one of a number of areas or communities having their own governments and forming a federation under a sovereign government.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have added meaning 6) for <b>state</b> because this ambiguity could be confusing for American readers. The American Heritage Dictionary entry at dictionary.com gives:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>nation</b> 3) A people who share common customs, origins, history, and frequently language.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is how England is a country — because it is a nation. The UK is a country for a different reason, because it is a state. There is, for sure, a certain amount of false precision when using definitions in such a formal way. The important thing is that the usages I see every day, and which I would like to see on Wikipedia, do not contradict dictionaries; moreover, they are supported by dictionaries.</p>
<p>Since the use of "issuing state" on a passport, or the concept of "country of countries" both pose no problems to the use of "country" to describe the UK, and since the website quote I gave earlier demonstrates the common usage of "country" to describe the UK, do you have any other reasons why "country" should not be used, or will I go ahead and change it? My reason for changing it, by the way, is that it is the most common word used to describe sovereign states both in every day discussion <b>and on Wikipedia</b>. (Look up a few countries and see. As you are no doubt aware, you could start with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbyrne_04f4.html" title="User:Robertbyrne">Robertbyrne</a> 15:48, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i><b>On behalf of the Duchy in its successful action against the Crown, which resulted in the Cornwall Submarine Mines Act of 1858, Sir George Harrison (Attorney General for Cornwall) makes this submission.</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>2. That it was held by the Earls of Cornwall with the rights and prerogative of a County Palatine, as far as regarded the Seignory or territorial dominion.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>3. That the Dukes of Cornwall have from the creation of the Duchy enjoyed the rights and prerogatives of a County Palatine, as far as regarded seignory or territorial dominion, and that to a great extent by Earls.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>4. That when the Earldom was augmented into a Duchy, the circumstances attending to it's creation, as well as the language of the Duchy Charter, not only support and confirm natural presumption, that the new and higher title was to be accompanied with at least as great dignity, power, and prerogative as the Earls enjoyed, but also afforded evidence that the Duchy was to be invested with still more extensive rights and privileges.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>5. The Duchy Charters have always been construed and treated, not merely by the Courts of Judicature, but also by the Legislature of the Country, as having vested in the Dukes of Cornwall the whole territorial interest and dominion of the Crown in and over the entire County of Cornwall.</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>3) Why did the Duchy of Cornwall Management Act confirm that the Duke possesses seignory and territorial rights befitting a king in 1863 if the Duchy is just a landed estate?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4) Why did the Kilbrandon Report into the British constitution in 1969-71 recommend that Cornwall (the territory of) should be referred to as a Duchy in light of its constitutional position?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>5) Why does the Duke of Cornwall have rights of governance and honours over the whole territory of Cornwall but not Duchy lands outside Cornwall? For instance the right of wreck on all Cornish shores, the right of Bona Vicantia / treasure trove for the county of Cornwall, the right to Swans and Sturgeon caught in Cornwall, the duty to appoint the Sheriff of Cornwall and preside over the Stannary Parliaments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>6) Why does the Duchy have its own exchequer and other arms of governance and indeed why is the duchy described in law as a body of governance if it is just a landed estate?</li>

<dd>It is incorrect, as there really isn't anything called "Celtic" which is spoken. There's English, Scots Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish, and possibly some Irish Gaelic. Gaelic and Welsh are related, for certain, but then so are English and German. Your sentence does imply two languages, English and Celtic, not a variety of Englishes and a variety of Celtics.

<p>I'm from Dublin. The simple fact is that we Irish do like this term and find it incredibly insulting. Nobody here uses it and in fact, the Irish government does not recognise it AT ALL. It became out-dated when we became a soverign state.</p>
<p>People who argue that it is a geographical term say this as an excuse to use it as a political term.</p>
<p>It is out-dated, old-fashioned and highly insulting. I am not a nationalist or republican, and have nothing against the British. I am simply an Irish citizen.</p>

<dd>It is a largely redundant term, but it still deserves a article not least for all cognitiations. Something which is uneccessary though is two articles <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> - both of these are largely a rehash of concepts surrounding "British Isles" and the second particularily to terminology of the islands of the isles. We should have one article. We might as well have a Europe (terminology) which gives a blow-by-blow accoount of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> related terminology, how boring? <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 13:48, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I am not calling for the deletion or dilution of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, on the contray. As this article is structured at the moment it is essentially a long <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28disambiguation%29_45b5.html" title="British Isles (disambiguation)">British Isles (disambiguation)</a> article and as such maybe better suited to a short page of links to relevent articles or even not at all. A simple numbered map would go a long way to clearing any ambiguity as to what country/island/region/etc is where in British Isles. We should not assume that people are so dumb that we require a whole article article simply to define the terms, remembering in particular <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not</a> a dictionary or link farm. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 16:07, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I heard an Irishman use the expression "British Isles" I really would have no choice but to wonder just how warm his bedclothes were in 1916. Nobody here uses it! It's just another product of British claims to this country. Oddly enough that sort of thing doesn't go down to well with the natives. Similarly nobody uses the term "Éire" in the partitionist sense that the British, and they alone, use it. Béal Féirste and Doire are in Éire in precisely the same way that Belfast and Derry are in Ireland.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know about the Irish bit, so I won't get involved in that discussion. But I created this article because I wondered about all those confusing terms like United Kingdom, Britain and Great Britain. I already knew that calling 'Great Britain' 'England' was wrong, but then I found that calling it 'Great Britain' was wrong too because I was really thinking about the UK. This turned into a bit of a study and then I thought I might as well write an an article about the terminology because I sure won't be the only one who is confused. The most important part is the top, which gives a quick overview of the terminology. That (or something similar, as long as it's a short overview) should be at a location that will be linked to from all the articles that relate to the British Isles (or whatever they should be called). That's the main point as far as I'm concerned. Whether this overview is given in a seaprate article, I don't care much, but it does make sense. Maybe much of the rest of the article could be merged with <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. But the overview should be at an easily found location - ie linked to at the top of the related articles. At the moment I'm trying to get other things done, so I won't be doing any of this myself. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 08:43, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe, officially, in the Republic of Ireland, <i>Éire</i> does now have the meaning <i>Republic of Ireland</i>. In other words: it is the official name in Irish for a republic which does not include Northern Ireland. This is one effect of constitutional reform which followed the Good Friday agreement. <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurel_Bush_dd09.html" title="User:Laurel Bush">Laurel Bush</a> 11:37, 15 December 2005 (UTC).</p>

<p>Can anyone who speaks Welsh confirm or deny the explanation of the name Lloegr as "the lost country"? (I don't think it does actually mean that, but I'm not a native speaker.) 66.92.237.111 03:22, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm a native speaker and I don't think it means that either. I don't know what it does mean though - it's a very old word. I'm deleting "the lost country" - if somebody has a good reference for the meaning they can put it back. Rhion 09:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Weirdly, <i>Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru</i> (a massive massive Welsh dictionary which includes etymology) does not include the term <i>Lloegr</i>, although it includes all the derivatives. But looking through it, there's only one country name I found in it at all (guess which). This is the only Welsh dictionary I know which does etymology. So I went to the local university library and spent some time down in the Welsh and Celtic periodicals section. Lots of conjecture about the origin (with entire articles devoted to it) but I didn't find a definite answer. It's probably also worth noting that I didn't come across a single suggestion that it means "lost". --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> 16:35, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm... I think the problem here is that the noun for a person from the United Kingdom is 'British'; so, someone from Northern Ireland or the Isle of White could be British without being from Brtiain itself.

<p>Nope, Britain is a loose term with 2 meanings. It can refer to either Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or the British Isles (All islands including all of Ireland). The term Britain is not used a lot in Ireland due to the terms usual association with the UK.

The info on the GB page is right; the info on the UK page is misleading as it suggests that it wouyld be wrong to say that Northern Irleand is part of 'Britain' - which it is as our many soruces have shown that Britain is used as a term for the UK.</p>
<p>British would be used very rarely for someone/thing from the British Isles, and it is this use that would be consdired offensive by most Irish, I think. Britain cannot refer to the British Isels itself</p>
<p>So, Britain = UK; Britain = GB (however, given that all of Great Britain is in the UK anyway, it seems a bit of an odd debate); British = some from the UK or (technically) Great Britain <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:31, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with all three of your paragraphs. Extending this to incorrect assumption that GB = UK One thing that I do not see much of is the idea of habit (or some equivalent word). I hear it all the time in the US and I think it is part habit and part due to the extensive repetition of historical events in the 1700s. It seems common for well-intentioned but incorrect use of GB to mean UK. People will then sometimes use weird justifications e.g. by saying that President Bush did actually visit GB so why would people object to saying that. Perhaps if GB were actually called 'Lesser Britain' or 'Partial Britain' it would not be so well used. I did once suggest a guideline for foreigners: <i>Great Britain does have a meaning today. But in most cases it is not as good as saying Britain or United Kingdom. In some cases it is much worse. Unless you know what you are doing, stop using Great Britain for events and places today and you won't go far wrong</i>. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 13:21, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Portugal <i>is</i> part of the Spanish Peninsula. Thank you for providing me with a counterargument.&#160;:) I don't get the Canada-bit, though. Anyway, it's all explained in the article and the first sentence makes clear that there is a lot of confusion about it and then that gets restated again in the intro, so I'd say it's clear enough that one should be careful what to call what here and that opinions differ. Better to include all opinions than to erase one in favour of the other. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:52, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Murphyweb, your belligerant attitude sucks. If you actually READ the article, you will see it is sensitively and dispassionately written, and explains the distinctions between geographical and political entities, and how the names arose historically over *millenia*. Using the geographical term "The British Isles" to refer to all the islands in the group, including the island of Ireland, is the most common usage and therefore must certain be listed as so in the article. The article already explains what toes this treads on. I suggest you dry your eyes. If you vandalize the article, others will only revert it back.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 10:57, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You can avoid the term "British Isles" if you don't like it, but you can't redefine it to mean the islands belonging to Great Britain, changing over time as Britain's historical boundaries change, because it never meant that. The term British Isles is far older than Britain, Britain is named after the archipelago, not the other way around, and its meaning has never been dependent on the extent of Britain. This article clearly states that many people in Ireland are understandably uncomfortable with the term, and mentions alternatives. Politically sensitive people will note that and possibly avoid using it. That's as far as you can go with the Irish perspective on this question. You don't do the Irish any credit by pretending the term means something which it never meant. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 12:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

If the Republic of Ireland is geographically part of the British Isles (and am inclined to think it is), then it would seem fair to call the citizens of the Republic "British." That, however, might get a few people upset. Then again, wasn't <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bono.html" title="Bono">Bono</a> just named one of the 100 greatest British people alive today, or something like that? (20 February 2006).</p>

<p><a name="Legal_Term" id="Legal_Term"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legal Term</span></h2>
<p>The only legal term recognised by both the UK and Irish governments when referring to the Archipeligo is 'these Islands.' Strand Three, The Agreement, 10/04/1998. There are many precedents for geographical terms (e.g. Benelux, Central Europe, North America etc.) being legally and politically recognised - the 'British Isles' is not one of them. The term is not used in legislation in either jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The term 'British' Isles is not purely geographic no matter how hard one may attempt to protest that it is - it has geo-political implications. Ireland is NOT a British Isle, however, it is a part of the same archipeligo as Great Britain. The term 'British' Isles is unacceptable when referring to Ireland under any circumstances; whether they be purely geographic, political, legal etc.</p>
<p>One cannot escape the English language definition of British i.e. of or relating to the island of Great Britain or the United Kingdom, or to its people or language. Under this basic definition how can Ireland be deemed a British Isle? It is a complete non sequitur. Ireland is not British thus is not a part of the 'British' Isles. Ireland's identity is Irish and European - it certainly is not British.</p>
<p>Also, I have removed the reference to non-usage of term in Ireland being determined by political viewpoint and replaced it with: The term is deemed anachronistic in Ireland (Republic of) and use of same is generally avoided.</p>
<p>It's non-usage in Ireland is not determined by a particular political viewpoint, unless being an Irish citizen is a political viewpoint. Since merely being born on the island of Ireland entitled one to Irish Citizenship up until the Irish Nationality &amp; Citizenship Act, 2004; I do not believe that Irish Citizenship constitutes a political stance. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a></p>

<p>I would sign in, however, wikipedia isn't allowing me to do so today. Where are the emotive language and value-judgements? You are judging me. My opinion is not political -it is legal, thus I do not have or require a 'political soapbox.' The only legal term used in both jurisdictions i.e. UK &amp; Ireland, is 'these Isles.' Stating the definition of the adjective 'British' in English (the de facto official language of the UK)is hardly emotive, nor is stating the only legal term in both jurisdictions. I don't think anyone could claim that the Oxford English Dictionary and an intergovernmental treaty are wrong.</p>
<p>It is rather naive to believe that the term does not have geo-political connotations. The reference to non-usage in Ireland being determined by political stance was extremely biased, untrue and definitely PoV.

<dd>I don't think anyone is saying that "British Isles" is a legal term or holds any particular status. The fact that "these Isles" is used in the Good Friday Agreement doesn't confer any legal status on that term either. The only question is whether either of the terms has currency as a descriptive term for the geography in question. Personally I quite like "these Isles" and hope that it catches on, however until then we must acknowledge that "British Isles" has greater currency. --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 11:05, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'These Isles' is not just used in the Agreement (the correct term for it), it is defined and that definition was used in the establishment of the British-Irish Council, which does confer it with legal status.

<dd>If you were trying to make it less POV your replacement text wasn't much of an improvement <i>"The term British Isles is deemed anachronistic in Ireland (Republic of) and use of same is generally avoided."</i>. Do you have any sources to back this up? I have lived in Ireland all my life and have never heard anyone object to the use of the term "British Isles" as anachronistic. In any case, the original statement, a version of which I have re-instated, refers not to "British Isles" but to all the names used for the various territories. It is hard to dispute that usage of these names is not politically influenced in many cases, e.g. "Northern Ireland" vs "Six Counties". --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyano_6ec4.html" title="User:Ryano">Ryano</a> 15:27, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added the word 'often' to the sentence 'Furthermore, to some extent the choice of terminology, especially in relation to Ireland, is often influenced by political stance,' which thus reads 'Furthermore, to some extent the choice of terminology, especially in relation to Ireland, is often influenced by political stance.'</p>
<p>In relation to use of the term 'British Isles' being anachronistic hence its non-usage, it was Dick Spring's view as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1995. It is the view of Dermot Ahern as the current Minister. It is more correct to say it is anachronistic than offensive - I have lived in Ireland all my life and have yet to come across someone who finds it offensive or repugnant. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a></p>

<li>Irish people? All of them? Even the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Unionist_37b4.html" title="Ulster Unionist">Ulster Unionists</a>?? Its an over generalization to claim that all Irish people reject a term.

<li>The article explains sufficiently the number of problems and critcisms of the term</li>
<li>Such a claim cannot be made unsourced</li>

<li>Nice diagram but it is not entirely correct. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands collectively are within the United Kingom not outside of it.

<p>A mere glance at the map should be enough to show that the Channel Islands are not part of the British Isles, which is a purely <i>geographical</i> term. As UK dependencies in close proximity, they are indeed among the British <i>Islands</i>, but that is a term invented in the 1950s are very rarely, if ever, used. As for the Shetlands, they are on the same bit of continental shelf as the rest of the British Isles, so must be included, regardless of whether they happen also to be politically part of the UK (which they are, of course). The Faeroes, on the other hand, have their own fragment of continental shelf, so are not included (regardless of the fact that they are part of Denmark). Rockall, which was annexed to the UK in 1972, likewise has its own segment of continental shelf, and so ought not to be included in the British Isles - but is so small that it hardly matters.</p>

<p>Without wishing to stir up more argument, I must opine that the reason why many Irish people object to the term British Isles is because of a basic linguistic confusion. In most instances the term "British" has a political meaning - i.e. of or pertaining to the UK. But it also has a <i>geographical</i> meaning that predates the political meaning by many, many centuries. The political meaning can hardly have existed before 1707, but the geographical one has existed since at least Classical times. When the British state was created in 1707 (or, at a stretch, 1603), its rulers chose the term "British" to describe themselves, precisely <i>because</i> it already existed as a geographical term. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:15, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Linguistic confusion</i>!! Hardly; more like linguistic accuracy and logic. <i>British</i> never ever ever refers to Ireland. I understand that Ireland is deemed an inconvenience due to this but that fact cannot be escaped. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a></p>

<p>The article says <i>Many encyclopaedia in use today prefer the terminology 'British Isles and Ireland'</i> . Quite apart from the missing "s" on "encyclopedia", I don't actually believe this for one moment, as it makes no sense.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definition of Irish</span></h2>
<p>I have added a definition for Irish that incorporates the language; citizenship; and adjective. In common parlance the term has ambiguity attached to it - often people in the UK regard the Northern Irish as Irish irrespective of their citizenship. "British" - a less ambiguous term is defined, thus it is appropriate to define "Irish." I think that both adjectives that refer to the sovereign states should be defined. The argument that English and Welsh aren't defined is irrelevant - neither refer to sovereign states nor are they confusing terms. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 12:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
