<p>Sorry, but <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blain_%28distemper%29.html" title="Blain (distemper)">Blain (distemper)</a> is a new one for me. All I can suggest is maybe putting it in the context of an outdated medical term (maybe even creating a new category for that). Thanks for thinking of me, though. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 22:08, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is nothing I can think of exactly like that. There are tumors that will grow in that area and block the larynx, but they wouldn't be called a bladder, which would seem to indicate the structure is hollow, like a cyst. There is something known as a <a href="../../../m/u/c/Mucocele.html" title="Mucocele">mucocele</a> which is a abnormal growth in the mouth filled with saliva and is found in dogs (and probably other animals as well, I don't know). If it gets big enough, it can block the larynx, and therefore the trachea, or windpipe. When it is under the tongue it is called a <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranula.html" title="Ranula">ranula</a>. I guess that's the most logical answer to your question; a blain is probably a mucocele or a ranula. Of course it has nothing to do with heat in the stomach, and I don't know what chaffing is ... --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoelmills_0f99.html" title="User:Joelmills">Joelmills</a> 03:01, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>E questi lieto alle dolci parole, che in altr'uomo avrebbero eccitato lo sdegno, toglieva per sè il carico d'indirizzare il poema della guerra di Fiandra a Chiapino Vitelli, illustre generale al soldo di Spagna, scrivendogliene nel febbraio del 1551, e parlandogli del dotto giovane e dell'ingegno che teneva proprio e sì grande che di sè grandissimi ed immortali effètti prometteva; quindi colla più sciocca adulazione, scrivendone al Maggi stesso in novembre del 1554 (2).</p>

<p>And made happy by those sweet words, which would have angered any other man, he took upon himself to address the poem over the Flanders War to Chiapino Vitelli, the well-known Spanish mercenary general, by writing to him in Febraury 1551. On that occasion, he spoke about that learned youth whom he held to possess such great skills as promised immortal fame; and thus he wrote to Maggi himself in November 1554 in the silliest and most sycophantic of manners (2).</p>

<p>Hi There Brian!</p>
<p>Why isn't www.gamepolitics.com a reliable source, or is this more information that we aren't allowed to know?</p>
<p>It is a news site, run and managed by a well-known(in the gaming community(an expert in his field) at least) Journalist About page is here: <a href="http://www.gamepolitics.com/about.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gamepolitics.com/about.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamepolitics.com/about.htm</a></p>
<p>I still don't understand how a site on which Mr Thompson posted his own news releases can be considered a non-viable source.</p>
<p>Thanks Brian</p>

<p>Hi. About that Italian translation: it's a bit harder than I thought: it uses many obsolete expressions and *very* long phrases, it looks more like German phrase structure, rather than Italian.&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A little after he returned to Bologna, in which he stayed part of the year 1553, he lectured and tutored Giulio Vitelli, son of a certain Alessandro, to which the Medici were almost indebted for the throne, to Sebastiano Regoli who professed Latin litterature, and to three legal advisers Arietini. From there, he went to Ferrara where he frequented Cinzio Giambattista Giraldi, a very knowledgeable man, where he saw a anepigraphical Greek codex about war machines, taken from Maggi given to the real author, Heron, already knownledgeable with Sebastiano Corradi and Giannandrea Sartori, another he had seen in the bookstore of S. Salvatore in Bologna. Giraldi presented him to Duke Ercole II, to which he offfered that part of the treaty of engineering military art, which he already written with the title "Della espugnazione delle (...)" He received from the Duke a golden necklace and this was the first fruit of his works (literally <i>vigils</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Returning to his town/country in the same year or in 1554, he became again a lawyer, in the same time he had well-educated disputes of case law with a friend, Anglieri, judge of the troops of Marquese of Marignano at the camp of Siena. Like this, between studies, the clients and the taking care of the family, of Lisabetta di Francesco Maggi, his blood relative, which he married, he lived in Anghiari since the protection of the Vitelli House brought him both <i>bread</i> and honour, by making him to be a judge of Amatrice, land of Abbruzzo, with which Carlo V had awarded the <i>chosen</i> services of Alessandro Vitelli.</dd>

<dd>Codesto, eccellente ingegno, del quale fu egualmente da ammirarsi il saper vario e la moltiforme operosità, che da compiangere la sventura perpetua terminata da una fine infelicissima, nacque non già in Anghiera sul lago Maggiore, siccome dal De Thou e da altri fu asserito, stimando essere una cosa sola <i>Anglarium</i> ed <i>Angleria</i>, meno ancora in Brescia od in Milano od in Bologna, come si ha da scrittori male informati, bensì in Anghiari, borgo di Toscana, tra Città S. Sepolcro ed Arezzo, della qual cosa egli stesso rende apertissima testimonianza in tutti i titoli ed in moltissimi luoghi, delle opere sue.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is one piece of sophisticated Italian. Indeed, any single sentence spanning all these lines - in any language whatsoever - will end up rather complicated. This makes it a bit difficult to understand what is meant in some parts, especially without a context. Maybe this is overkill, but I prefer to be precise. I'll have a few Italian friends take a look at it when possible, so I could possibly make some corrections.</p>

<dd><b>This man</b> <sup>(1)</sup> <b>of excellent ingenuity</b> <sup>(2)</sup><b>, of whom was also admirable the wide knowledge and multi-faceted meticulosity</b> <sup>(3)</sup><b>, {pause/and} for whom one commiserates his perpetual ill fate ended horridly</b> <sup>(4)</sup><b>, is born, indeed, not (!) in Anghiera on Lake Maggiore, as asserted in the De Thou</b> <sup>(5)</sup> <b>and by others who treat as one <i>Anglarium</i> and <i>Angleria</i></b> <sup>(6)</sup><b>, nor</b> <sup>(7)</sup> <b>in Brescia or in Milan or in Bologna, as given by ill-informed writers, but (indeed) in Anghiari, a suburb of Tuscany</b> <sup>(8)</sup><b>, between Città S.

<p>Notes:</p>
<p><b><sup>(1)</sup></b> "Codesto" is a midway between "this" and "that" (as to proximity). Being applied to a human subject of a biography, it is supposedly just a sophisticated way of refering to the person.</p>
<p><b><sup>(2)</sup></b> Can also mean "intelligence", "creativity" and similar adjectives.</p>
<p><b><sup>(3)</sup></b> Actually the word used is the noun equivalent of "the being hardworking/busy". I think the word I used should give the right impression. In substance, this guy liked to do a lot of stuff, all the time - a busy bee.</p>
<p><b><sup>(4)</sup></b> The text translates to "very sadly", so maybe "dismally" would be the most correct translation, but from the tone of the sentence the meaning of the word could be changed slightly to refer to an even worse tragedy. You should decide between the two by referring to any part covering the person's death -- was it a <i>sad</i> death or a <i>tragic</i> (painful?) death?</p>
<p><b><sup>(5)</sup></b> Possibly a famous source book?</p>
<p><b><sup>(6)</sup></b> i.e. The De Thou et al. give Anghiera as the birthplace on the wrong assumption that the two Latin words refer to the same place.</p>
<p><b><sup>(7)</sup></b> As in "even more improbable".</p>
<p><b><sup>(8)</sup></b> This needs verification of what Anghiari actually is in relation to Tuscany, as the text wording can have an alternate meaning of "(in the) district of Tuscany" (like when one says "Tampa, Florida") as opposed to "(which is) a suburb [which may be too exact since it could also simply mean 'village', 'town' or similar as in <i>-burg</i> used in Germany, Russia, etc.] of Tuscany" as I assumed for the translation.</p>

<dd>I have compelling reasons to believe that in the year 1560, or the next, he went to Venice, in which city he became a print corrector. This is reported by Sweert, who wasn't so distant in time from then, and then repeated by Bayle, though without supplying any proof. However, his frequent visits to the shop of the bookseller and printer Ziletti, the beatiful, correct and numerous editions that originated there, the many learned men that performed such work, for the good fortune of the writers, and among which shines the example of Paolo Manuzio, the <i>inopia</i> of Maggi, are all reasons that, even if they do not provide us with certainty, the do make it quite probable. It is certain, that notwithstanding his proteiform intellect and his tireless work, he did not have great success at firsts in Venice, as in the summer of 1562 he was negotiating about going to Maximilian, king of Bavaria, when due to the request of a certain Cadamost and a Cornelius of Bergamo he was convinced to stay for some time and shortly after found a mecenas in the senator Giovanni Donato. <i>Acgemento</i> ("I will add"? or is it a typo for "Argomento": Reason?) that in those days he hardly did any work for Ziletti, seeing that the two works from him, after the poem, printed up to then, are due to the presses of Enrico Petri of Basel, as he did not begin to print for Ziletti before 1563.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I did what I could. It is old Italian and quite difficult to understand and render. There were some things I couldn't find, like "Inopia" (could be "without work" or "penniless") and "Acgemento" (which I suspect to be a typo), that I have indicated in the text. Please check it carefully, also wrt my English, some sentences could be a bit awkward. I have seen that you also posted a request on the Italian "Bar", I'll get to that now.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlo.Ierna_b45a.html" title="User:Carlo.Ierna">Cat</a> 09:35, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a young man he studied rhetoric/eloquence? with Pierantonio Ghezzi from Laterina, a master of Latin, I do not know whether in his homeland or elsewhere. Afterwards, to proceed with the then popular studies, he went at first to the nearby University of Perugia, then to that of Pisa, and finally to that of Bologna. In Pisa he attended the lectures of the famous professor in Latin and Greek language/eloquence? Francesco Robertello, who taught there from 1543 to 1549. Anyway, Maggi, who beyond his native Tuscan, had mastered Latin and was erudite in Greek and Hebrew, and also in Spanish, availing himself of such endowments, he applied himself to jurisprudence, more to inquire into its spirit than for its profession: at first he studied the method of Alciato, then that of Bartolo and the school of the XIV and XV century.</dd>

<p>Old text, difficult to render. May sound awkward and old-fashioned, but should convey some of the tone of the original. Hope this helps. I'm not sure how to translate "eloquenza", but gave two suggestions, I guess it just means "mastery of the language". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlo.Ierna_b45a.html" title="User:Carlo.Ierna">Cat</a> 09:53, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that you have asked about fifteen different people to translate parts of a certain article which you have never identified to any of them. Is this some kind of test? What's the point of asking different people to translate different parts of an artcile when they donìt even kknow the context of what they are attempting to translate? You will probably end up with an extremely incoherent jumble of paragrpahs each with a different style, tone and diction (translation involves great deal of subjective considrations of taste and preferences). A far better approach would be to give over the whole thing, along with all background information, to one person to translate and then have others check on the original translation. Your current approach is truly bizarre.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 09:41, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Lacatosias. I understand that you'd like to have that text translated and you can't really ask one person to traslate it all, but that text is written in a quite arcaic Italian, so the translation is more difficult... --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptex_e18c.html" title="User:Cryptex">CRYptex</a> <a href="../../../../it/c/r/y/Discussioni_utente%7ECryptex_8e86.html" class="extiw" title="it:Discussioni_utente:Cryptex">talk</a> 11:08, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>It seems that you were the original author of the article, "History of Sudan (1884-1898)" and I noticed when reading it that it was exactly the same text as Mohammad Hassan Fadlalla's "Short History of Sudan" published in 2004. The specific chapters are the sixth, 6.1, and seventh, entitled "The Mahdiyah (1884-98)", "The Khalifa", and "Re-conquest of Sudan" found on pages 27-31.</p>
<p>I am not sure if permission was obtained for the use of Dr. Fadlalla's work, but it would seem that at a minimum, his book should be listed as a source and the permission disclosed with the citation.</p>
<p>The book's ISBN is 0595314252.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mohammad Hassan Fadlalla copied the text from the same <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> source that I did. See at the bottom of the page, it says, "This article contains material from the Library of Congress Country Studies which, as a US government publication, is in the public domain."

Fair enough. I was struck by finding the same text and the fact that Fadlalla does not cite the LOC. I see that it is in fact in the LOC public domain and I apologize.</p>

First, the original text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><cite>Intanto, la fama in che era venuto per le sue opere od impresse, o tenute in pronto per la stampa, la protezione del Donato, l'amicizia rinnovata o stretta con parecchi chiari uomini, quali il dotto tipografo tedesco Arnoldo Arlenio, Girolamo Ruscelli, Jacopo Menochio, con altri di minor nome e coi patrizi Andrea Badoaro ed Antonio Giustiniano, gli furono strada a più comoda vita ed a più liete speranze. Stimolato dal Sigonio a mandare in luce le sue Miscellanee, sì il fece, dedicandole all'ambasciator di Polonia, per veder il quale portossi in Padova nell'ottobre del 1563: l'anno stesso offriva al suo protettore Giovanni Donato i libri de Fato del Bresciano Giulio Sirenio: nel 1564 stampava il Trattato della Fortificazione, indirizzandolo al Re di Spagna.</cite><br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, here's my translation of it into English:<br /></p>
<p>Then, the fame that he had achieved for his work or prints, readily available to the press, the protection of Donato, the either close or renewed friendship with several prominent men, amidst which the knowledgeable German typographer Arnoldo Arlenio, Girolamo Ruscelli, Jacopo Menochio, with others of less importance and with countrymen Andrea Badoaro and Antonio Giustiniano paved the way for a more comfortable life and higher hopes. Encouraged by Sigonio to make public his Miscellany, he did so, dedicating it to the Polish ambassador, whom he went to see in Padova, in October of 1563: in the same year, he presented his protector, Giovanni Donato, with the <i>libri de Fato</i>, by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Brescia_cc03.html" title="Province of Brescia">Brescian</a> Giulio Sirenio: in 1564 he published <i>Trattato della Fortificazione</i> (Treaty on Fortification), addressing it to the King of Spain.</p>

<p>A not very good translation, but I guess you'd understand what it means.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Codesti cinque primi canti in verità non sono tali da farci desiderare che venissero seguiti da altri pochi o molti: dirò anzi, che se a qualche cosa giovano, gli è appunto a convincerci che il Maggi non era poeta.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it was not desired that these first five songs to be followed by others, few or many: in fact, I'd say that that if it has something young, they are especially to convince that Maggi was not a poet.</dd>

<dd>I have surfed the web for the Belgium copy right laws.

What I am pointing out is this &lt;q&gt; 4. Where a Member State provides for particular provisions on copyright in respect of collective works or for a legal person to be designated as the rightholder, the term of protection shall be calculated according to the provisions of paragraph 3 &lt;/q&gt; So if it is true that the "Institut International de Physique Solvay" is copyright holder, then the copyrights expired 70 years after *publication* and not 70 years after the death of the author. <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 01:33, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is slightly more complicated than that; articles 4 continues to say that even if copyrights are owned by a "legal person" (=legalese for an institute or company) that if the the name of the actual person who in fact made the picture is always published together with the picture itself that then also the clock starts ticking after that person passes away. <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 01:51, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the standard/rule/guideline on living biographies? It seems that after the fiasco where a bio claimed that a person was involved in the Kennedy assassination, there should be great care in insinuating involvement in a crime. Personally, I think that any mention of Klausutis in the Scarborough article in the context of her death being mysterious or unexplained or tainted or in any way connected with Scarborough on his bio page is a disservice given that there is no evidence whatsoever to link him to that nor any ongoing inquiry. It is a form of smear and POV even if the statements are true. Almost every bio can have smearing statements that are "true" but are not worthy of an encyclopedia entry. For example: "There are no written accounts that Jesus physically tortured Mary Magdalene" is a true statement but unworthy of inclusion because of what it implies by simply being written. Even if there was ample evidence that Magdalene suffered physically at some point in her life, adding the comment like the above is unwarranted. And to add that "some of the written accounts may have been destroyed by incompetent archaelogists" has even further unwarranted implications. Giving Jesus an alibi does not unburden the article of a under-handed accusation. It's a smear.</p>
<p>The same is true with Klausutis. Making a statement that opens up her death as even being significant in Scarboroughs life has implications. Bringing in controversy surrounding the circumstances of her death or the people investigating it even though "true" are not worthy of entry in his biography. Where does Wikipedia draw the line? I would think that living biographies would have special rules and guidleines because of the prior incident and the Wikimedia Foundation would be very careful to be very neutral with living biographies. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 21:02, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I won't disinvolve myself, since I think it unconstructive to protect the main page article and then move it, delete it, move it back again all the while people see a bizarre editing behaviour and can't edit the highest-profile page on the project. And just because I don't revert the page doesn't actually mean I'm not trying and getting beaten to it. I think the process of cleaning up the history is unnecessary until the day is finished, and I really don't see the need even then since it does no harm in the history. If Jimbo cared about that kind of edit summary, I'm sure he'd say so. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:18, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If Jimbo has asked you to remove those edit summaries so that a mere 1000 people can read them, then he is thinner skinned than I thought. I'm entirely aware that some troll is toying around with the FAs etc in that way, and I don't think he's worth spending time on. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:33, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The large changes are due to an expansion on the term <i>Japan-ized,</i> which is the only explanation given as to why 'rock' is transliterated into Japanese as 'roku'. I felt that it required a better explanation, since it explains the reasoning behind the naming of the album.</p>

<p>I haven't found anything else so far that really compares, but I'm still looking. I found <i>Kunstformen der Natur</i> while browsing the science library at Yale, looking for books I could check out to put the scanner I found by the side of the road to good use. This is Yale's worst copy (out of about 5) and the only one available to check out (notice the stains at the bottom of many of the images). When I have more free time this summer, I'm going to dig up some more cool stuff to scan; there's plenty of illustrated natural history books, but most of it is rather bland in comparison and the good stuff is generally harder to access.--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 00:50, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>My name is Fernanda Viégas and I have been studying Wikipedia for a while now (you can see a paper I published on the subject <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~fviegas/papers/history_flow.pdf" class="external text" title="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~fviegas/papers/history_flow.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I would like to ask you a few questions about your activities as a Wikipedia image creator. I am fascinated by the pictorial side of Wikipedia and it would be great to hear about this community from one of its members. Would you be available to participate an email survey this week?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to get the Wikipedia toolbar's "#R" redirect button working on Wiktionary. Since you were the one who uploaded the "#R" image, perhaps you could tell me how? Or whom to ask? Thanks in advance,</p>

<dd>Yes, I had added that to my personal Monobook.js to test it, but it fails. I've copied the .png image from Wikipedia to Wiktionary, in case that was the problem, but still nothing. I do not seem to be getting any errors in my Javascript console. Viewing source of a Wiktionary edit page shows the element "'toolbar'" is identified as expected. If you have any other hints, they'd be appreciated. (There isn't any special image restriction for Javascript pages that require the Javascript to be in the MediaWiki namespace, is there?) --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnel_MacKenzie_91fe.html" title="User:Connel MacKenzie">Connel MacKenzie</a> 17:16, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hi there. for things like 'san fransisco' (should be 'san francisco') is what you are talking about? i thought Martin's policy was against single spaces and underscores etc. should i skip spelling mistakes with only one letter off? should i just make one big regex with my whole misspelling list so as to catch maybe multiple words an article? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBot_e8e1.html" title="User:JoeBot">JoeBot</a> 22:21, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As it turns out, there are a boat load of single character misspellings, and only one per article with the list of misspellings I am working with (some 80-90 of the most common). I shouldn't just leave them because of the tax fixing them puts on the server. Wikipedia always works towards better quality; thats why I am trying to fixing all of these words quickly and efficiently.

<p>You blocked my monniker for 48 hours from editing for a "revert" violation that didn't seem to have happened. Indeed, I was involved in an ArbCom case where I was given a penalty of one revert per page per day. In the case of the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Metal_c57b.html" title="Gothic Metal">Gothic Metal</a> page, the reverts were made on 04/4, 04/05 - how is that a violation? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 17:02, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still think that's pretty ify, but that's just me. On the 3RR board I've seen many 3RR cases slide only because the "4th revert" didn't fall in the same day as the 3rd. If you thought this was a good idea, more power to you. I rarely edit, and no administrator intervened in this incident (and many administrators continue not to intervene re: <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">User:Leyasu</a>'s violations of site policies, even after his ArbCom case - there's really no recourse).</dd>

He also claims his own "concensus" in articles, and accuses other users of breaking site policies that they really didn't break. Blocks do very little as he just uses IP addresses to evade them. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 18:06, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
