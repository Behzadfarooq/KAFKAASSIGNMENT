<p>Just a note to say that this organisation is officially called the <i>British National Front</i>, so listing under "National Front (UK) is wholly unnecessary, and having the article under <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Front_1140.html" title="British National Front">British National Front</a> removes the need for a country in parentheses and confusion arising from other groups' bearing the name 'National Front'. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrown_Eagle_7b39.html" title="User:Brown Eagle">Brown Eagle</a> 01:23, Apr 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd say it's still desirable, though. "British National Front" is pretty obscure -- it doesn't even make it onto UK ballot papers, which preserve in aspic "Conservative and Unionist" and "Labour and Co-operative" in some cases. The WP policy seems to be 'official name unless common usage is different', which could be a tad more rigourlessly expressed, but in this case "National Front" is overwhelmingly the 'popular' usage. I'll wait for comments before perpetrating a move, though. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 07:17, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would have to agree with the latter thought. The common name for the political organization is The National Front, and not the British National Front. Also, the appearance of the National Front in N. Ireland pushes for the treatment and necessity of having it be the National Front (United Kingdom). However, that is just how I see things best set for navigation.</p>

<p>I do not believe any acting NF member has ever been elected. Recently, sadly, we have had a fair few BNP councillors elected, but the NF never managed it. Back in the 1970's two far-right councillors were elected in in Blackburn, but these were members of the splinter breakaway "National Party" rather than the NF. The National Party presented itself as more moderate than the NF, just as the BNP does today. After a young Asian man was murdered, National Party leader John Kingsley Read commented "One down - a million to go." Very moderate you see, just like our modern day BNP. -BJG 6.6.06</p>
<p>It should be noted that Kingsley Read always denied the charge, which was made by members of the Anti Nazi League on a tip off from members of the Tyndallite NF - strange bedfellows indeed. Kingsley Read later quit politics &amp; became a well respected community activist before his rather early death: upon which <i>Searchlight</i> claimed he was one of their moles during his NF years all along! Whether this was true or not will now never be known (certainly Gable &amp; Co have never proffered a shred of evidence to substantiate their claim), but it certainly provided a bizarre twist Mark Boyle <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Boyle_a5ea.html" title="User talk:Mark Boyle">Talk</a> 19:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The NF has never won an actual election - however they did have one councillor elected in 1975. This was to Carrickfergus Town Council in Northern Ireland, where there were more seats than actual candidates. There was also two Conservative Party councillors in Wandsworth - one being later Tory notable Athlene O'Connell - who defected to the NF temporarily in 1967. This latter business was surrounded with much skulduggery, as accusations flew later that O'Connell's return to the Tories was to act as a mole Mark Boyle <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Boyle_a5ea.html" title="User talk:Mark Boyle">Talk</a> 20:43, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the claim that Ian Myars "founded" the NF. I for one have never heard of this character within the ranks of the League of Empire Loyalists, the old BNP, the Racial Preservation Society, or anywhere else for that matter! He doesn't even appear as one of the LOEL or BNP negotiators during the talks to create the party.</p>
<p>It's solid fact that A K Chesterton founded the NF, and indeed was responsible for most of the moving, shaking and financing to unite the various far-right groups to create it in the first place.

Well done on adding it back in, however I have corrected the bit about the UAF fiasco - though big enough to add his signature to their launch letter, afraid old Morrissey is understandably wary of anything involving the SWP - having picketted his concerts in the past &amp; tried to intimidate fans going in, hardly surprising.

<p>I know a bit about the early years of the NF, and its fascist predecessors, but sort of lost track of their activities around 1980. So, I've been looking into elections and have managed to come up with a list for each General Election since 1970 in which the NF took part (using mostly Wikipeda articles in the series <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1970_cdb2.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1970">United Kingdom general election, 1970</a> and so on. I wanted to compile a table showing number of NF candidates, total vote, % vote, but have a slight problem from this page.</p>
<p>In the section "The National Democrats name change" it states there were 12 candidates at the 2005 General Election. A little further on, in "The current NF" it says there were 13 candidates in the 2005 General Election. A clear discrepancy, but it gets worse. The second reference goes on to say they received 8,079 votes. Here's the problem: Wiki article <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">United Kingdom general election, 2005</a> table of results does not list the NF, or any party scoring 8,079.</p>
<p>Can anyone clear this up?</p>

<p>"for the Anti-Nazi League collapsed in early 1979 amid claims of financial impropriety"</p>
<p>A 'fact' not reffered to on the ANL page, a page which indicates that group went on for some time after 1979.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Er...if you want the truth about the history of the Anti-Nazi League, the last place you should look at is an ANL or Socialist Workers Party source! Let's just say they give the British far right a good run for their money in the selective memory &amp; historical revisionism stakes!&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The ANL's chequered history - which is NOT appropriate in a page about the NF's history except <i>en passent</i>, can easily be checked by reference to newspaper microfiche/DVD ROM files in umpteen libraries, particularly after the 1979 collapse (which considering the funds raised by "Rock Against Racism" was a nasty shock). The organisation has appeared on-and-off from time to time since then, and been wound up on each occasion with little correlation to far-right levels of activity. Sad to say I would treat Wiki entries on the ANL/SWP with a pinch of salt, as they tend to be both "PR cleansed" by SWP members &amp; vandalised by opponents on a regular basis.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is some debate as to whether the ANL's real purpose was as an SWP "copycat" for Tariq Ali's tiny but highly influential International Marxist Group, whose members took a "robust" anti-fascist/anti-racist stance (eg. the Red Lion Square demonstation). Ironically, Tariq Ali was later to join up with former NF Directorate member Rodney Legg in the fight for the rights of the people of <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyneham.html" title="Tyneham">Tyneham</a> against the British Army (ah, but that's another story!)
