	    <p>The <b>British Agricultural Revolution</b> describes a period of agricultural development in Britain between the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> and the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, which saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output. This in turn supported unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped drive the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. How this came about is not entirely clear. In recent decades, historians cited four key changes in agricultural practices, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Enclosure.html" title="Enclosure">enclosure</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanization.html" title="Mechanization">mechanization</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four-field_crop_rotation.html" title="Four-field crop rotation">four-field crop rotation</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_breeding.html" title="Selective breeding">selective breeding</a>, and gave credit to a relatively few individuals. However, current thinking suggests that fundamental changes in workforce organization, crops and farming methods were largely responsible. For this reason, historians may argue that there was in fact no "revolution", simply a rapid evolution of methods that led to a sharp rise in productivity.</p>

<p>Prior to the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, agriculture had been much the same across <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> since the Middle Ages. The <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_field_system.html" title="Open field system">open field system</a> was essentially post-<a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal.html" title="Feudal">feudal</a>, with each farmer subsistence-cropping strips of land in one of three large fields held in common and splitting up the products likewise.</p>
<p>Beginning as early as the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a>, some of the common fields in Britain were enclosed into individually owned fields, and the process rapidly accelerated in the <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th</a> and <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th centuries</a> as <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a> farming grew more profitable. This led to farmers losing their land and their <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grazing_rights.html" title="Grazing rights">grazing rights</a>, and left many unemployed. In the 16th and <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th</a> centuries, the practice of enclosure was denounced by the Church, and legislation was drawn up against it; but the developments in agricultural mechanization during the 18th century required large, enclosed fields in order to be workable. This led to a series of government acts, culminating finally in the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclosure_Act_9834.html" title="Inclosure Act">General Inclosure Act</a> of 1801.</p>
<p>While farmers received compensation for their strips, it was minimal, and the loss of rights for the rural population led to an increased dependency on the <a href="../../../p/o/o/Poor_Law_d5cf.html" title="Poor Law">Poor law</a>. Surveying and legal costs weighed heavily on poor farmers, who sometimes even had to sell their share of the land to pay for its being split up. Only a few found work in the (increasingly mechanised) enclosed farms. Most were forced to relocate to the cities to try to find work in the emerging factories of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century the process of enclosure was largely complete.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_field_system.html" title="Open field system">open field system</a> had employed a three year <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crop_rotation.html" title="Crop rotation">crop rotation</a>, with a different crop in each of the three fields, eg. wheat and barley in two, with the third <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallow.html" title="Fallow">fallow</a>. 'Fallow' is a term which means that the field is empty, there is nothing growing there. Over the following two centuries, the regular planting of nitrogen-rich <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legume.html" title="Legume">legumes</a> in the fields which were previously to fallow slowly increased the fertility of croplands. The planting of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legumes.html" title="Legumes">legumes</a> (<a href="../../../l/e/g/Leguminosae.html" title="Leguminosae">leguminosae</a>, plants of the pea/bean family) helped to increase plant growth in the empty field because they used a different set of nutrients to grow than the grains. The legumes put back nutrients the grains used, <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrates.html" title="Nitrates">nitrates</a> produced from nitrogen in the <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atmosphere.html" title="Atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, and the grains put back the minerals the legumes used. In a way, they fed each other. When the pastures were brought back into crop production after their long fallow, their fertility was much greater than they had been in medieval times. The farmers in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> (current day <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>), however, discovered a still more effective four-field rotation system, introducing <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnip.html" title="Turnip">turnips</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clover.html" title="Clover">clover</a> to replace the fallow year. Clover was both an ideal fodder crop, and it actually improved grain yields in the following year (clover is part of the pea family, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leguminosae.html" title="Leguminosae">leguminosae</a>). The improved grain production simultaneously increased livestock production. Farmers could grow more livestock because there was more food, and manure was an excellent fertilizer, so they could have even more productive crops. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Townshend%2C_2nd_Viscount_Townshend_e683.html" title="Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend">Charles Townshend</a> learned the four field system from Flanders and introduced it to Great Britain in 1730.</p>

<p>The British Agricultural Revolution was sparked in part by advancements in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>. The large and dense population of Flanders forced farmers to take advantage of every inch of useable land, so the country became a pioneer in drainage and reclamation technology. Many Flemish experts went to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">The Netherlands</a> and reclaimed land there. Finally, Dutch experts like <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius_Vermuyden_02bf.html" title="Cornelius Vermuyden">Cornelius Vermuyden</a> brought the technology to Britain.</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="#Four-field_crop_rotation" title="">previously</a>, Britain also adopted the four-field crop rotation system from Flanders.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Agricultural_Revolution_0b9b.html" title="Edit section: Effects on history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects on history</span></h2>
<p>The Agricultural Revolution in Britain proved to be a major turning point in history. The population in 1750 reached the level of 5.7 million. This had happened before: in around 1300 and again in 1650. Each time, the appropriate agricultural infrastructure to support a population this high was not present, and the population fell. However by 1750, when the population reached this level again, an onset in agricultural technology and new methodology allowed the population growth to be sustained.</p>
<p>The increase in population led to more demand from the people for goods such as clothing. A new class of landless labourers, products of enclosure, provided the basis for <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage_industry.html" title="Cottage industry">cottage industry</a>, a stepping stone to the Industrial Revolution. To supply continually growing demand, shrewd businessmen began to pioneer new technology to meet demand from the people. This led to the first industrial <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory.html" title="Factory">factories</a>. People who once were farmers moved to large cities to get jobs in the factories. It should be noted that the British Agricultural Revolution not only made the population increase possible, but also increased the yield per agricultural worker, meaning that a larger percentage of the population could work in these new, post-Agricultural Revolution jobs.</p>
<p>The British Agricultural Revolution was the cause of drastic changes in the lives of British women. Before the Agricultural Revolution, women worked alongside their husbands in the fields and were an active part of farming. The increased efficiency of the new machinery, along with the fact that this new machinery was often heavier and difficult for a woman to wield, made this unnecessary and impractical, and women were relegated to other roles in society. To supplement the family's income, many went into cottage industries. Others became domestic servants or were forced into professions such as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>. The new, limited roles of women, dubbed by one historian as "this defamation of women workers", (Valenze) fueled prejudices of women only being fit to work in the home, and also effectively separated them from the new, mechanized areas of work, leading to a divide in the pay between men and women.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the substantial gains in British agricultural productivity were rapidly offset by competition from cheaper imports, made possible by advances in transportation, refrigeration, and many other technologies. From that point, farming in Britain entered a period of economic struggle which continues to the present day.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues that were sorted out in the agricultural revolution was the village commons. These were fields that were that the community of the village could use as a public agricultural field. These were the problems; Firstly,fit animals would breed with poor quality animals, which would outrage the villagers and caused rebellions. Finally, illegal squatters would try to settle on the land. This caused serious problems, which is why in the mid-1800s most of the commons were sold to the local land owners by the government.</p>
