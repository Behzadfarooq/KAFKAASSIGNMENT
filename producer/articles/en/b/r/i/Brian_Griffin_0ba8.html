<p>Brian may be described as the Griffin family's <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talking_animal.html" title="Talking animal">talking dog</a>, but he is more accurately described as a dog who chooses to live with the Griffin family. While he exhibits some typical dog behaviors like eating garbage, licking himself, leaving dead <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">birds</a> on the porch, intensely fearing the <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_cleaner.html" title="Vacuum cleaner">vacuum cleaner</a> and the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_whistle.html" title="Dog whistle">dog whistle</a>, and sleeping at the foot of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Griffin_27cb.html" title="Peter Griffin">Peter Griffin</a>'s bed, he also possesses various <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphic.html" title="Anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> qualities, such as the ability to speak intelligently, drive a car, and walk <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biped.html" title="Biped">bipedally</a>. He also has a particularly sharp <a href="../../../w/i/t/Wit.html" title="Wit">wit</a>. Peter is his best friend, despite Brian's vastly superior intelligence.</p>
<p>Brian has a cultured background; he loves <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> (he is a fan of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Coltrane_0f9b.html" title="John Coltrane">John Coltrane</a>) and speaks <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog_language.html" title="Tagalog language">Tagalog</a>, and a little <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>. He is also a member of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a>. He loves to sing, and can imitate a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbershop_music.html" title="Barbershop music">barbershop quartet</a> without accompaniment. He is an avid writer, having once been invited to write for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, although he was fired once the magazine learned he did not graduate from college. He has also attempted to write a novel, (a reference to <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoopy.html" title="Snoopy">Snoopy</a> from <i><a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanuts_%28comic_strip%29.html" title="Peanuts (comic strip)">Peanuts</a></i> although he seems to have made little progress on it, for which <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewie_Griffin_46b0.html" title="Stewie Griffin">Stewie Griffin</a> mocks him). He is a smoker, a <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> and recovered <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> addict, which he eventually discovered to have stemmed from his mother abandoning him and for which he saw a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">therapist</a>. He has also made references to either buying, being in possession of, or smoking <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> in the following episodes:</p>

</ul>
<p>He has been to rehab, but since he still drinks and smokes pot, it is assumed that it was only for his <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> addiction.</p>
<p>Brian held several jobs while living in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> including <a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiter.html" title="Waiter">waiter</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_wash.html" title="Car wash">car wash</a> attendant, <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screenwriter.html" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a>, and pornographic <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_director.html" title="Film director">film director</a>. He does not hold steady employment in Quahog, although did once become a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substitute_teacher.html" title="Substitute teacher">substitute teacher</a> at Chris' school. Nevertheless, he is able to afford a car and maintain a credit card.</p>
<p>As the most sensible member of the Griffin family, Brian often serves as the voice of reason or as a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediation.html" title="Mediation">mediator</a> during family arguments. He is also usually the first (and often only) one to realize that there is impending danger.</p>
<p>Because of his intelligence and dry, deadpan manner, Brian sometimes acts as the "<a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_act.html" title="Double act">straight man</a>" of the show.</p>
<p><a name="Background" id="Background"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Griffin_0ba8.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>In the <i>Family Guy</i> <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">universe</a>, dogs are either talking, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphism.html" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> creatures like Brian and his cousin Jasper, or more realistic dogs, such as his mother, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Biscuit.html" title="Biscuit">Biscuit</a>, and his lover, Seabreeze. Both classes are subject to the same rules, such as not being allowed inside some shops or to wander the streets without an owner. Brian's "humanity" is rarely remarked upon, one notable exception being the occasion when Peter's boss, <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Weed_fb2f.html" title="Mr. Weed">Mr. Weed</a>, referred to him as a "funny talking dog," or in the episode "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_in_Love_2587.html" title="Brian in Love">Brian in Love</a>" when Brian tries to explain his relationship troubles to Peter, who responds, "Oh my God! You can talk!" Another example of Brian's "humanity" is his attraction to human women: Brian has dated several since the show began, and is deeply in love with Peter's wife, <a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_Griffin_9d78.html" title="Lois Griffin">Lois</a>.</p>
<p>Brian was born on a farm in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, in a litter of five puppies, of whom he was the only anthropomorphic one. His youth and adolescence have not been discussed in detail, although he somehow made his way to <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhode_Island_988e.html" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> and attended <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_University_180e.html" title="Brown University">Brown University</a>. He is currently one class short of graduating from Brown (in the season 4 episode "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Goes_Back_to_College_1ccb.html" title="Brian Goes Back to College">Brian Goes Back to College</a>", Brian re-enrolls in an attempt to earn his degree, but fails). Brian has also served in the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_Corps_5ca7.html" title="Peace Corps">Peace Corps</a>. He has mentioned that he hung out with <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Warhol_b973.html" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, though this particular interlude is most likely one of the shows reality-bending <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cutaway.html" title="Cutaway">cutaways</a>, as he is said to be only seven years old.</p>
<p>In "<a href="../../../p/o/r/Brian%7E_Portrait_of_a_Dog_4219.html" title="Brian: Portrait of a Dog">Brian: Portrait of a Dog</a>", he is said to be found by Peter as a stray, working as a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squeegee_man.html" title="Squeegee man">squeegee dog</a>.</p>
<p>His age is usually treated differently depending on the joke. In one episode, he states: "I'm seven years old and if I play my cards right, I got seven more years ahead of me." Brian spent some time as a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homelessness.html" title="Homelessness">homeless</a> stray washing car windshields for change before he met Peter, who offered him a home with his family in Quahog, Rhode Island. When Brian returned to Austin years later to find his mother, he found that she had died and her owners were using her <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxidermy.html" title="Taxidermy">stuffed</a> body as a table. Brian absconded with her body to give it a proper burial.</p>
<p>Prior to Brian, the Griffins had another talking dog named Todd, who was <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_euthanasia.html" title="Animal euthanasia">put down</a> at the age of 15 due to illness.</p>
<p>Despite his anthropomorphic intelligence, Brian shares certain traits and shortcomings with real dogs. For example, he cleans himself with his tongue and scratches at <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flea.html" title="Flea">fleas</a> with his hind leg. He also couldn't control his <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animal</a> <a href="../../../u/r/g/Urge.html" title="Urge">urges</a> for the prized <a href="../../../p/e/w/Pewterschmidt.html" title="Pewterschmidt">Pewterschmidt</a> dog, Seabreeze. Furthermore, although his maturity and broad range of experiences seem to imply that he is as old as a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_age.html" title="Middle age">middle aged</a> human, as a dog he is only seven years old. Peter has been known to tease him about his shorter lifespan. In one episode, he seems to have a slightly late 'midlife crisis'. He also seems to have a liking for dog food at times. In "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chitty_Chitty_Death_Bang_9aed.html" title="Chitty Chitty Death Bang">Chitty Chitty Death Bang</a>", he chases the chuck wagon from the commercials for Purina Chuck Wagon, and in "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barely_Legal_%28Family_Guy%29_772c.html" title="Barely Legal (Family Guy)">Barely Legal</a>", he comes running with joy when Peter's daughter <a href="../../../m/e/g/Meg_Griffin_0807.html" title="Meg Griffin">Meg</a> shakes a bag of Dog Chow.</p>
<p>Brian seems somewhat ashamed of his animal urges and insecure about his canine status in general. He once refused to do degrading pet tricks for Peter during a <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_show.html" title="Dog show">dog show</a>, despite it being necessary to win the money needed to buy the family a new air conditioner. He also chastised <i><a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_and_the_Tramp_afb2.html" title="Lady and the Tramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></i> for acting in typical dog-like behavior, saying that "that's just what they want you to do". He suffers mistreatment as a dog, with references to movies like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Autobiography_of_Miss_Jane_Pittman_c018.html" title="The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman">The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/School_Ties_ec49.html" title="School Ties">School Ties</a></i>, movies about characters who suffer from <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">racial segregation</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>. He is humiliated when the Griffins catch him with canine <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>.</p>
<p>Brian is extraordinarily intelligent, enjoying great works of art such as the opera <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen.html" title="Carmen">Carmen</a></i> and the works of <a href="../../../f/y/o/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky_1eb3.html" title="Fyodor Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>. He has also heavily invested in the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market.html" title="Stock market">stock market</a>, and collects first editions of literary classics. His intellectual bent makes it very difficult for him to form romantic relationships with most human women, which may be one reason for his <a href="../../../s/u/b/Substance_abuse.html" title="Substance abuse">substance abuse</a> as a sort of coping mechanism.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/Stewie_Griffin%7E_The_Untold_Story_3496.html" title="Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story">Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story</a>, which is set 30 years in the future, it is revealed that Brian died (or rather, will die) after "getting into the garbage and eating some <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a>". In <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">heaven</a>, he tries to get into intellectual conversations with <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_van_Gogh_769c.html" title="Vincent van Gogh">Van Gogh</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Cobain_5fa1.html" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, but is discouraged to learn that their deaths were far more artistically noble than his. It should be noted, however, that the future as depicted in <i>Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story</i> may not actually happen, as Stewie takes action to prevent his own future as it is shown in <i>Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story</i> from occurring.</p>

<p>In addition to behaving like a human, Brian sometimes pursues relationships with humans. No character has ever commented on the <a href="../../../z/o/o/Zoophilia.html" title="Zoophilia">zoophilic</a> aspects of a sexual relationship between Brian and a human, except in "The Perfect Castaway" (see below), where Peter asks Lois why she wants to stay with Brian, then remarks, "that, plus, hello? He's a dog." MacFarlane mentions in the commentary for "Castaway" that making episodes about Brian being in love is "always a line that we have to walk," concerning the mainstream <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media's</a> anxiety regarding <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">bestiality</a>.</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle_While_Your_Wife_Works_ac33.html" title="Whistle While Your Wife Works">Whistle While Your Wife Works</a>" was the first time where it was heavily implied that Brian did have sex with a human woman (albeit a very dim-witted one) named Jillian. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewie_Griffin_46b0.html" title="Stewie Griffin">Stewie</a> pressed Brian the most for these details, noticing that his collar was inside-out after being away for a whole night. After Stewie meets Jillian, he hassles Brian for the rest of the episode about her lack of intelligence, once asking if her parents were "<a href="../../../i/n/b/Inbreeding.html" title="Inbreeding">brother and sister</a>". Brian finally decides to attempt to break up with Jillian, but instead, he ends up leaving Stewie in the car for three hours, apparently to have sex with her. In the end, Brian's relationship with Jillian appears to be based solely on sex and had virtually no meaningful qualities. They are still together.</p>
<p>In the episode "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Wallows_and_Peter%27s_Swallows_be39.html" title="Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows">Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows</a>", Brian falls deeply in love with an elderly human woman named Pearl Burton. Before Pearl passes away, Brian shares a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_reality.html" title="Virtual reality">virtual reality</a> vision of their possible future together that involves marriage and children. He once made a pass at Meg while drunk, and had a brief fling with a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitute</a> named Tina while he was hooked on cocaine. During the show's fourth season, in "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_the_Bachelor_4504.html" title="Brian the Bachelor">Brian the Bachelor</a>", he falls for a woman named Brooke Roberts while appearing as a contestant on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bachelorette_bd4b.html" title="The Bachelorette">The Bachelorette</a></i>. Although she chooses Brian as the winner, she doesn't return his affections outside of the show.</p>
<p>In a different episode ("<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter%27s_Got_Woods_14e6.html" title="Peter's Got Woods">Peter's Got Woods</a>"), Brian has another brief romance, with Shauna Parks, one of Meg's teachers at <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Woods_3ff0.html" title="James Woods">James Woods</a> High. She seems to find him cute ("Nothing cuter than a nervous white dog"), but breaks up with him over his loyalty to Peter, who foiled her (and Brian's) attempts to change the name of the high school to honor Dr. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King_d548.html" title="Martin Luther King">Martin Luther King</a>. Parks is <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">black</a>, in contrast to Brian's previous girlfriends, who have all appeared to be white. Brian is extremely careful to avoid appearing <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> around her and other blacks, such as Meg's one-time producer Dr. Diddy, although his nervousness has caused embarrassing lapses where he will bark violently at black people, after which he apologizes profusely and attributes his behavior to the influence of his father, Coco (who was killed by a milk truck). On one episode, Stewie asks Brian a hypothetical along the lines of "What kind of man would I be if I just left like that?" Brian replies with "You'd be a black man," and then apologizes profusely, again citing his father. In contrast, he seems perfectly comfortable around <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Brown_d172.html" title="Cleveland Brown">Cleveland</a> and his family.</p>
<p>Although he seems to be somewhat ashamed of it, Brian also has relationships with "regular" dogs. In the episode "<a href="../../../s/c/r/Screwed_the_Pooch_6ff4.html" title="Screwed the Pooch">Screwed the Pooch</a>", he is faced with being <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuter.html" title="Neuter">neutered</a> as punishment for impregnating Seabreeze, a racing dog owned by Lois' father, Carter Pewterschmidt. In the last moment, however, he discovers that the impregnating male turns out to be <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Turner_f6c6.html" title="Ted Turner">Ted Turner</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Griffin_0ba8.html" title="Edit section: With the Griffins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">With the Griffins</span></h3>
<p>Brian is one member of the family who does not treat Meg as badly as the others, but he seems to ignore her more than anyone else. He has, however, been known to join in on laughing at Meg's misfortunes, as well as reading her diary along with the rest of the family. In "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barely_Legal_%28Family_Guy%29_772c.html" title="Barely Legal (Family Guy)">Barely Legal</a>", he makes out with Meg at a dance after he gets drunk. The kiss affects Meg, causing her to become deeply infatuated with him. Even after he tells Meg that he doesn't want to be attached to her, she continues to irritate him. The infatuated Meg kidnaps Brian and brings him to a hotel where she attempts to seduce him. However, Peter, Cleveland, Quagmire, and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Swanson_a39b.html" title="Joe Swanson">Joe</a> appear and rescue Brian before she can.</p>
<p>Brian also seems to ignore Chris most of the time. He mostly reacts when Chris says something extremely stupid, such as "Brown is the color of poo!", when Brian reminisces about attending Brown University, or answering "eating a pebble!", when Brian asks the family what would be really exciting. In both cases, Brian reacted with a simple, flat "yes", implying that his main attitude towards Chris seems to be bemused tolerance of Chris's stupidity. However, he did give Chris advice on what to do when Chris kissed Sam (who he thought was a boy at the time although it turned out she was a girl) in "<a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Love_and_Die_in_Dixie_6077.html" title="To Love and Die in Dixie">To Love and Die in Dixie</a>".</p>
<p>In contrast to the other characters on the show, Brian actually can remember things from show to show. In the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fat_Guy_Strangler_6095.html" title="The Fat Guy Strangler">The Fat Guy Strangler</a>" episode, Brian remembers Peter encouraging him to jump into the closed window of the General Lee in "<a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Love_and_Die_in_Dixie_6077.html" title="To Love and Die in Dixie">To Love and Die in Dixie</a>". Brian also recalls Stewie beating him up mercilessly in "Patriot Games" and lets him swallow Peter's tobacco spittle in retaliation in the "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport_%2707.html" title="Airport '07">Airport '07</a>" episode.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Griffin_0ba8.html" title="Edit section: With Lois">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">With Lois</span></h4>
<p>Brian has a special relationship with Lois. He realizes that he harbors romantic and sexual feelings towards her in the episode "Brian in Love", but learns to accept friendship in lieu of a romantic relationship. But he seems to retain a certain amount of longing for her. In the episode "The Perfect Castaway", Brian was married to Lois for a period of several months after they thought Peter and his friends were killed in a <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane.html" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> while fishing. The marriage was largely based on Brian's ability to support the family financially in Peter's absence by taking a job at the local <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummer.html" title="Hummer">Hummer</a> dealership. Despite Brian's desire to consummate their relationship, Lois insisted throughout their marriage on keeping their beds separated. When Peter unexpectedly returns home alive, Lois' feelings for Peter rekindle and Brian and Lois <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a>, as Brian accepts that Lois still loves Peter. Lois declares shortly afterwards that she was one day from deciding to finally have sex with Brian, to his great frustration. He additionally reveals that his attraction may go beyond skin-deep; in <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibling_Rivalry_%28Family_Guy%29_6af9.html" title="Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)">"Sibling Rivalry"</a>, as Lois begins to gain weight, Peter comments that he is no longer attracted to her. When he asks Brian if he still is, he replies "I don't care what she looks like, I would wreck that chick."</p>
<p>Lois is sometimes alternately oblivious to, or intolerant of, Brian's feelings for her. In "<a href="../../../i/_/t/I_Take_Thee_Quagmire_b488.html" title="I Take Thee Quagmire">I Take Thee Quagmire</a>", Lois discusses, with Brian, problems arising due to her inability to <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wean.html" title="Wean">wean</a> Stewie from <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_milk.html" title="Breast milk">breast milk</a>; Brian offers to "medically examine" Lois' breasts while giving Lois the impression that he knew what he was doing. After that discussion, Brian also offers to "medically examine" Lois' genitals; when Lois becomes confused as to why Brian would want to examine that area of her body, Brian simply replies hastily "Please pull down your underpants." In "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Prick_Up_Your_Ears_%28Family_Guy%29_979b.html" title="Prick Up Your Ears (Family Guy)">Prick Up Your Ears</a>", Brian immediately tells Lois, after Meg walked out of her room after she and Lois had a spirited discussion about <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vaginal_intercourse.html" title="Vaginal intercourse">vaginal intercourse</a>, that he loves her. In "<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter%27s_Two_Dads_bc8d.html" title="Peter's Two Dads">Peter's Two Dads</a>", Lois and Brian secretly celebrate the death of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Griffin_da8e.html" title="Francis Griffin">Francis Griffin</a>, but she slaps him when he grabs her breasts.</p>
<p>Brian was once seen <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-dressing.html" title="Cross-dressing">wearing Lois' clothes</a>, much to Stewie's surprise and disgust.</p>

<p>Brian is often called Peter's best friend. He often makes efforts to cheer Peter up, such as dressing up as the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dancing_Banana_eb0d.html" title="Dancing Banana">Dancing Banana</a> and singing "<a href="../../../p/e/a/Peanut_Butter_Jelly_Time_edbb.html" title="Peanut Butter Jelly Time">Peanut Butter Jelly Time</a>" in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Courtship_of_Stewie%27s_Father_4556.html" title="The Courtship of Stewie's Father">The Courtship of Stewie's Father</a>". He also looks out for Peter's long-term interests; When Peter built an indoor <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_slide.html" title="Water slide">water slide</a> by running water down the stairs and promptly injured himself by falling down them, Brian told Peter "I'm not gonna call the hospital because if I do, you won't learn anything."</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Griffin_0ba8.html" title="Edit section: With Stewie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">With Stewie</span></h4>
<p>Brian and Stewie have an interesting relationship. They are the only two major characters, being a dog and an infant respectively, that would be unable to speak in reality. This connection is perhaps why Brian is the only character (ongoing or recurring) that seems to consistently, fully consider Stewie's words. Therefore, Brian often becomes involved in Stewie's schemes, whether attempting to hinder him or help him.</p>
<p>Brian and Stewie also appear to share a certain level of intelligence and sophistication, but also share certain reality-based shortcomings. Also, Brian and Stewie have joked with each other over their respective similarities in appearance to <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoopy.html" title="Snoopy">Snoopy</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Brown_6d8c.html" title="Charlie Brown">Charlie Brown</a>. Brian is often given the responsibility of caring for Stewie, particularly over the older siblings, Meg and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Griffin_e8fe.html" title="Chris Griffin">Chris</a>.</p>
<p>The two share a love/hate relationship. Despite his being an infant, Brian has had a haphazard rivalry with Stewie:</p>
<ul>
<li>In "<a href="../../../h/e/27/He%27s_Too_Sexy_For_His_Fat_5df6.html" title="He's Too Sexy For His Fat">He's Too Sexy For His Fat</a>", when Stewie becomes overweight, Brian spins him around calls him Orson, a reference to <a href="../../../o/r/s/Orson_Welles_8fe7.html" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>, who, in the later years of his life, was morbidly <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obesity.html" title="Obesity">obese</a>.</li>
<li>Also, in "Screwed the Pooch", during the cold open, he places animal feed into Stewie's pocket, causing the animals in the petting zoo to bite/peck at him.</li>
<li>Another act of cruelty occurs in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Father%2C_the_Son%2C_and_the_Holy_Fonz_c89d.html" title="The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz">The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz</a>", when Stewie is relegated to a protective bubble, he is literally kicked out of the house door. Brian also spray-paints his bubble black making it impossible for Stewie to see.</li>
<li>In "<a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_to_Rhode_Island_c013.html" title="Road to Rhode Island">Road to Rhode Island</a>", Stewie mocks Brian's alcoholism by calling him "Cirrhosis the Wonder Dog," and in "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_in_Love_2587.html" title="Brian in Love">Brian in Love</a>", Stewie mocks Brian's interest in Lois by becoming overly affectionate toward her.</li>
<li>In "<a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_Games_%28Family_Guy%29_0525.html" title="Patriot Games (Family Guy)">Patriot Games</a>", Brian lost a sports bet to Stewie but neglected to pay him in the agreed upon time and consequently was severely beaten by the toddler who broke a glass of orange juice over his head, beat him with a towel rack, shoved Brian's head into the toilet, threw him down a flight of stairs, beat him with a golf club, shot him in both legs, and burned him with a flame-thrower. Brian screamed in agony, pleading and cursing the entire time, before finally relenting, though by now charred and bloodied lying in a pile with obvious broken bones, responding with a dry monotone voice, "Alright, let's go to the bank." At the end of the episode, Stewie is pushed into a double-decker bus as revenge for savagely beating Brian earlier in the episode.</li>
<li>In "<a href="../../../o/n/e/One_if_By_Clam%2C_Two_if_By_Sea_2a16.html" title="One if By Clam, Two if By Sea">One if By Clam, Two if By Sea</a>", Stewie calls on Brian to bet on the success of his <i><a href="../../../p/y/g/Pygmalion.html" title="Pygmalion">Pygmalion</a></i>-type project, to which Brian only replies, "why don't you shut up for about a month?"</li>
<li>Brian also seems to be the only one out of the whole Griffin family (and the entire <i>Family Guy</i> cast) who notices how abnormal Stewie is, although most of the adults associated with him can understand him.</li>

<p>Brian seems to have <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> political leanings, which mirror MacFarlane's; he is meant to be a manifestation of <i>Family Guy'</i>s creator within the show (MacFarlane uses his ordinary speaking voice while portraying Brian, which makes director commentary sound as if done by the character). Brian's views have been demonstrated several times: through his criticism of then-Presidential <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candidate.html" title="Candidate">candidate</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

Brian mentions in the episode "<a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Make_Me_Over_18f4.html" title="Don't Make Me Over">Don't Make Me Over</a>" that he votes <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>, though he also said in the first episode, "This is why I don't vote," suggesting that he was not a registered voter until a later date; in the episode <i><a href="../../../h/e/27/He%27s_Too_Sexy_For_His_Fat_5df6.html" title="He's Too Sexy For His Fat">He's Too Sexy For His Fat</a></i>, Brian is quoted as saying "You know, I like <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Clinton_c91c.html" title="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, I don't care what anyone says." However, as a dog, he is likely not eligible to vote anyway. In the episode "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_May_Now_Kiss_The...Uh...Guy_Who_Receives_e42e.html" title="You May Now Kiss The...Uh...Guy Who Receives">You May Now Kiss The...Uh...Guy Who Receives</a>", Brian goes to extremes to prevent a <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_marriage.html" title="Gay marriage">gay marriage</a> ban proposed by mayor <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_West_%28Family_Guy%29_523a.html" title="Adam West (Family Guy)">Adam West</a> after his cousin Jasper comes to Quahog to get married to his <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_American_3604.html" title="Filipino American">Filipino</a> boyfriend (West merely wanted the ban as a distraction after he squandered the entire city budget on a gold statue of the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey_Smacks_d9f5.html" title="Honey Smacks">Dig 'Em Frog</a>). In "<a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell_Comes_to_Quahog_8029.html" title="Hell Comes to Quahog">Hell Comes to Quahog</a>", Brian turns off the air conditioning in favor of a more environmentally safe alternative, to which Lois replies, "Save your <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> BS for the winter months."</p>
