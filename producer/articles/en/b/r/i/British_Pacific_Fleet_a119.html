<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Pacific_Fleet_a119.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>The British Pacific Fleet was, and remains, the most powerful conventional war fleet assembled by the Royal Navy, comprising by <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory_over_Japan_Day_efb2.html" title="Victory over Japan Day">VJ Day</a> four battleships, eighteen aircraft carriers, eleven cruisers and many smaller warships and support vessels. Despite this, it was a fraction of the forces that the United States had in action against Japan and it's difficult to argue that its presence was critical to the war effort.</p>
<p>After the early disasters against Japan, the British presence in the western Pacific and south-east Asia had been eliminated. Now the allies were advancing, it was the U.S. that was liberating British territories and extending its influence. It was, therefore, seen as a political and military imperative that a British presence was restored in the region and British military assets were deployed against Japan. The British government were determined that British territories, such as Hong Kong should be recaptured by British forces.</p>
<p>The British establishment, however, was not unanimous on the commitment of the BPF. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Churchill</a>, in particular, argued against, not wishing visibly to be junior partner in what had been exclusively United States' battle. (The Australian and New Zealand forces that were active had been absorbed into the American command structure.) He also considered that a British presence would be unwelcome and should be concentrated on <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Burma</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsular_Malaysia_75ac.html" title="Peninsular Malaysia">Malaya</a>. Naval planners, supported by the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiefs_of_Staff_697c.html" title="Chiefs of Staff">Chiefs of Staff</a>, believed that such a commitments would strengthen British influence and the British <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiefs_of_Staff_Committee_a0d9.html" title="Chiefs of Staff Committee">Chiefs of Staff</a> considered mass resignation, so strongly held were their opinions<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Some U.S. planners had also considered, in 1944, that a strong British presence against Japan was essential to an early end to the war and American home opinion would also be badly affected if Britain did not put itself in the line.</p>
<p>Australia had been dependent upon U.S. power for its protection, and had endured being a subservient ally. It was argued that, at the least, a powerful British presence would act as a counter-balance. When the BPF arrived at Sydney, its new home base, in February, 1945, it was well received. The Australian government had prepared necessary facilities, supplies had been stock-piled and civilian homes were available for crews to rest and experience home life.</p>
<p>The deployment of the BPF would not be straightforward. The Pacific war was a radically different operating environment requiring warships to remain at sea for extended periods, without ready access to land bases.</p>
<p>The effort made by Britain and its Commonwealth partners in the final stages of the Pacific war did manage to repair British prestige and influence.</p>

</div>
<p>The fleet was founded when Admiral Sir <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Fraser_e6aa.html" title="Bruce Fraser">Bruce Fraser</a> struck his flag at <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trincomalee.html" title="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a> as Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Eastern_Fleet_e8c8.html" title="British Eastern Fleet">British Eastern Fleet</a> and hoisted it in the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insect_class_gunboat.html" title="Insect class gunboat">gunboat</a> HMS <i>Tarantula</i> as Commander-in-Chief British Pacific Fleet. He later transferred his flag to the more suitable <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Howe_%281940%29_c7f9.html" title="HMS Howe (1940)">HMS <i>Howe</i></a>.</p>
<p>The Eastern Fleet was reorganised into the British East Indies Fleet, based in <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lanka_9993.html" title="Sri Lanka">Ceylon</a> (now Sri Lanka), and what was to be become the British Pacific Fleet (BPF). The BPF operated against targets in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumatra.html" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, gaining experience until early 1945, when it departed Trincomalee for Sydney. (These operations are described in the article on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Eastern_Fleet_e8c8.html" title="British Eastern Fleet">British Eastern Fleet</a>.)</p>
<p>The title "<b>British</b> Pacific Fleet" is misleading. As with many other major "British" formations, the BPF was multi-national. It eventually comprised ships and personnel from the British <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> (RN), British <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Fleet_Auxiliary_e3c3.html" title="Royal Fleet Auxiliary">Royal Fleet Auxiliary</a> (RFA), <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Australian_Navy_272e.html" title="Royal Australian Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN), <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Navy_0fcc.html" title="Royal Canadian Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a> (RCN) and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_New_Zealand_Navy_73bd.html" title="Royal New Zealand Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a> (RNZN). The RAN's contribution was limited because its larger vessels had been integrated with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> formations since <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. A high proportion of naval aviators were New Zealanders. The USN also contributed to the BPF, as did personnel from the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_Navy_4972.html" title="South African Navy">South African Navy</a> (SAN). Australian and New Zealand ports and infrastructure also made vital contributions in support of the BPF.</p>
<p>During World war II, the fleet was commanded by <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Fraser_e6aa.html" title="Bruce Fraser">Bruce Fraser</a>. In practice, command of the fleet in action devolved to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice-Admiral_a328.html" title="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> Sir Bernard Rawlings, with <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice-Admiral_a328.html" title="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> Sir <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Vian_a9c5.html" title="Philip Vian">Philip Vian</a> in charge of air operations by the Royal Navy's <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Air_Arm_8044.html" title="Fleet Air Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> (FAA). The fighting end of the fleet was referred to as Task Force 57 and the Fleet Train was Task Force 113.</p>
<p>As well as its base at Sydney, the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Air_Arm_8044.html" title="Fleet Air Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> established <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Naval_Air_Bases_6fac.html" title="Mobile Naval Air Bases">Mobile Naval Air Bases</a> (MONABs) in Australia to provide technical and logistic support for the aircraft.</p>

<p>The United States Navy (USN), which had control of Allied operations in the Pacific Ocean Areas, gave the BPF combat units the designation of Task Force 57 (TF-57), and later made them part of Task Force 37 (TF-37).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty.html" title="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> had proposed an active British role in the Pacific in early 1944 but the initial USN response had been discouraging. Admiral <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_King_2d98.html" title="Ernest King">Ernest King</a>, Commander-in-Chief United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, and alleged Anglophobe,<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> was reluctant to concede any such role and raised a number of issues, including the requirement that the BPF should be entirely self-sufficient. These were eventually overcome or discounted and, at a meeting, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt "intervened to say that the British Fleet was no sooner offered than accepted. In this, though the fact was not mentioned, he overruled Admiral King's opinion" (Churchill, <i>The Second World War</i> pp.&#160;?).</p>
<p>The Pacific war environment was unfamiliar to the Royal Navy, which needed to establish an RFA fleet train that could adequately support an active naval force at sea for weeks or months. This was, however, unfamiliar to the Royal Navy, which had been used to operating close to its bases in Britain, the Mediterranean or the Indian Ocean; purpose-built infrastructure and expertise were lacking. The distance from Sydney was too far to allow efficient fleet support, so, with much American support, a forward base was established at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manus_Island_c471.html" title="Manus Island">Manus</a> atoll, in the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty_Islands_fa40.html" title="Admiralty Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>, which was described as "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapa_Flow_fccf.html" title="Scapa Flow">Scapa Flow</a> with bloody palm trees." <sup><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200405/ai_n16061305/pg_8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200405/ai_n16061305/pg_8" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Major actions in which the fleet was involved included <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Meridian_e8a1.html" title="Operation Meridian">Operation Meridian</a>, air strikes in January 1945 against oil production at <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palembang.html" title="Palembang">Palembang</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumatra.html" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. These raids, conducted in bad weather, succeeded in reducing the oil supply of the Japanese Navy. A total of 48 FAA aircraft were lost due to enemy action and crash landings; they claimed 30 Japanese planes destroyed in dogfights and 38 on the ground.</p>
<p>In March 1945, while supporting the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Okinawa_c899.html" title="Battle of Okinawa">invasion of Okinawa</a>, the BPF had sole responsibility for operations in the <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakishima_Islands_4e9d.html" title="Sakishima Islands">Sakishima Islands</a>. Its role was to suppress Japanese air activity, using gunfire and air attack, at potential Kamikaze staging airfields that would otherwise be a threat to U.S. Navy vessels operating at Okinawa. The carriers were subject to heavy and repeated <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a> attacks, but because of their armoured flight decks, the British aircraft carriers proved highly resistant (unlike their U.S. counterparts), and returned to action relatively quickly. Subsequent studies, however, showed that serious damage had occurred to the ships' structure and modernisation was uneconomic.</p>
<p>In April 1945, the British 4th Submarine Flotilla was transferred to the major Allied submarine base at <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle%2C_Western_Australia_228d.html" title="Fremantle, Western Australia">Fremantle, Western Australia</a>, as part of BPF. Its most notable success in this period was the sinking of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_cruiser_Ashigara_e65f.html" title="Japanese cruiser Ashigara">heavy cuiser <i>Ashigara</i></a>, on June 8, 1945 in Banka Strait, off Sumatra, by <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Trenchant_c34b.html" title="HMS Trenchant">HMS <i>Trenchant</i></a> and HMS <i>Stygian</i>. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_31.html" title="July 31">31 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, in <a href="../../../x/e/_/XE_class_submarine_fa7c.html#Operation_Struggle" title="XE class submarine">Operation Struggle</a>, the British <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midget_submarine.html" title="Midget submarine">midget submarine</a> <a href="../../../x/e/_/XE_class_submarine_fa7c.html" title="XE class submarine"><i>XE3</i></a>, crewed by Lieutenant <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Edward_Fraser_bcb8.html" title="Ian Edward Fraser">Ian Fraser</a> and Acting <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leading_Seaman_2f90.html" title="Leading Seaman">Leading Seaman</a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joseph_Magennis_8a8e.html" title="James Joseph Magennis">James Magennis</a>, attacked Japanese shipping at Singapore.

Fraser and Magennis were both awarded the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a>.</p>
<p>Battleships and aircraft from the fleet also attacked the Japanese home islands. The battleship <i>King George V</i> bombarded naval installations at Hammamatsu, near Tokyo; the last time a British battleship fired in action, Meanwhile, carrier strikes were carried out against land and harbor targets including, notably, the disabling of a Japanese escort carrier by British naval aircraft. The BPF would also have played a major part in a proposed invasion of the Japanese home islands, known as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Downfall_1f0a.html" title="Operation Downfall">Operation Downfall</a>, which was cancelled after Japan surrendered. The last naval air action in WWII was on VJ-Day when British carrier aircraft shot down Japanese Zero fighters.</p>
