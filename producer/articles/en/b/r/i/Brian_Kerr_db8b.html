<p>Kerr grew up in <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drimnagh.html" title="Drimnagh">Drimnagh</a>, a suburb in south west <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. He began playing football for noted schoolboy side Crumlin United along with future world champion athlete <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamonn_Coghlan_53d0.html" title="Eamonn Coghlan">Eamonn Coghlan</a>. He also <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxed</a> with Drimnagh Boxing Club as his father was a coach there. Kerr realised he did not possess enough talent to make it to the top as a footballer and at an early age decided to concentrate on coaching. At age 18, Kerr took his first coaching role when appointed to the Crumlin United under 13 side. He quickly set about gaining all relevant coaching badges and soon caught eye of Irish footballing legend Liam Touhy. Touhy appointed Kerr as his assistant in roles with <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamrock_Rovers_278a.html" title="Shamrock Rovers">Shamrock Rovers</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drogheda_United_1f6d.html" title="Drogheda United">Drogheda United</a> and the Irish Youth side which reached the World Cup finals in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Kerr_db8b.html" title="Edit section: St. Patrick's Athletic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">St. Patrick's Athletic</span></h2>
<p>In December 1986 Kerr was appointed manager of <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Ireland_c3e4.html" title="League of Ireland">League of Ireland</a> side <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Patrick%27s_Athletic_cd5e.html" title="St Patrick's Athletic">St Patrick's Athletic</a>. Kerr told reporters that as a fan of St. Pats, this appointment was a "dream come true". Within 3 weeks Kerr had won his first senior trophy as St Pats won the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster_Senior_Cup_%28football%29_720d.html" title="Leinster Senior Cup (football)">Leinster Senior Cup</a>. It was the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inchicore.html" title="Inchicore">Inchicore</a>'s side first trophy in a decade. Traditionally one of Ireland's poorer clubs Kerr immediately set about rebuilding the squad on a shoe string budget. He acquired several players from junior and schoolboy football (such as future international <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_Fleming_c7f5.html" title="Curtis Fleming">Curtis Fleming</a>) and rescued others from reserve leagues, such as current St. Pats manager <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McDonnell_%28footballer%29_bd0d.html" title="John McDonnell (footballer)">John McDonnell</a>. St. Pats drew 1-1 with <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundalk_F.C._bf13.html" title="Dundalk F.C.">Dundalk F.C.</a> in the last game of the 1987/88 season when a win would have seen St. Pats gain their first league title since 1956. In 1990, Kerr led St. Pats to that long cherished league championship.</p>
<p>As financial troubles hit St. Pats, Kerr was forced to off load his star players and all bar John Treacy left by 1993. In 1992 with the club facing <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquidation.html" title="Liquidation">liquidation</a>, Kerr was among a group of investors (many of whom re-mortgaged their houses) who raised IRÂ£82,000 which helped save the club from extinction. Once again Kerr was left the job of rebuilding a totally new squad and once again he showed he was more than capable as St. Pats won the league again 1996. In December 1996 he shocked St. Pats by quitting becoming technical director of the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Association_of_Ireland_743c.html" title="Football Association of Ireland">Football Association of Ireland</a>. Kerr is still idolised by fans of St Patrick's Athletic and most commentators attribute the further success the club have had largely down to work started by Kerr.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Kerr_db8b.html" title="Edit section: Republic of Ireland Underage sides">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Republic of Ireland Underage sides</span></h2>
<p>As part of his technical director remit, Kerr was manager of republic of Ireland sides from U16 to u20 level. His first major tournament was the <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Youth_Championship_1997_4b11.html" title="FIFA World Youth Championship 1997">1997 World Youth Championships</a> . Kerr surprised many commentators by bringing 3 players from the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Ireland_c3e4.html" title="League of Ireland">League of Ireland</a> but was proved correct when Republic of Ireland won bronze medals by finishing third. The undoubted star of the Irish team was <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damien_Duff_5928.html" title="Damien Duff">Damien Duff</a>.</p>
<p>The following year Kerr guided Republic of Ireland to an unprecedented double by winning both the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Under-17_Championship_c602.html" title="UEFA Under-17 Championship">Under 16</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Under-19_Football_Championship_a538.html" title="European Under-19 Football Championship">Under 18</a> European Championships. No Irish team had ever won a major trophy before (and none have won since). A number of the players involved would go on to win full international caps, such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_O%27Shea_%28footballer%29_62c5.html" title="John O'Shea (footballer)">John O'Shea</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbie_Keane_d022.html" title="Robbie Keane">Robbie Keane</a>. In 1999 Republic of Ireland were knocked out of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_FIFA_World_Youth_Championship_5365.html" title="1999 FIFA World Youth Championship">World Youth Championships</a> by hosts Nigeria on penalties in the quarter final. He again qualified Ireland for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_FIFA_World_Youth_Championship_d09f.html" title="2003 FIFA World Youth Championship">2003 World Youth Championships</a> before taking up position of manager of the senior national side</p>
<p><a name="Republic_of_Ireland_Senior_Side" id="Republic_of_Ireland_Senior_Side"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Kerr_db8b.html" title="Edit section: Republic of Ireland Senior Side">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Republic of Ireland Senior Side</span></h2>
<p>After two defeats in the opening two qualifying games for <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro_2004.html" title="Euro 2004">Euro 2004</a>, national manager <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_McCarthy_15d2.html" title="Mick McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> resigned from his post. In February 2003, Kerr was appointed. This was welcomed by most sections of the media and fans alike. He was, however left a huge challenge, to achieve qualification. Following a draw at home to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia_national_football_team.html" title="Russia national football team">Russia</a>, and a defeat in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland_national_football_team.html" title="Switzerland national football team">Switzerland</a> Republic of Ireland finished 3rd, and were out of the competition.</p>
<p>In qualification for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_25dc.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> Kerr managed Ireland to only one defeat. However late goals conceded to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_national_football_team.html" title="Israel national football team">Israel</a>, at home and away, saw the Republic of Ireland finish in 4th place, in a very tight group. Thus for a second time Kerr's squad had failed to qualify. Kerr came in for heavy criticism from sections of the media, who saw his tactics as negative. Kerr himself felt that the media were being excessively intrusive and unhelpful, in his efforts to perform his job. Kerr now responded by refusing the entertain media questioning, concerning his decision making. As a result many journalists withdrew their support for Kerr, and became even more critical of his role, in the backdrop of a dramatic decline of the Irish soccer team in the FIFA world ranking. Other commentators pointed to a perceived lack of talent in the squad as being the most important factor, due to Kerr's successes in his previous managerial appointements. Kerr himself however continued to have full confidence in the players that he had available to him. He refused to ever blame his players, for any poor results, instead indicating that he was personally responsible.</p>
<p>In October 2005 Kerr's contract was not renewed by the FAI, bowing to perceived media pressure. Kerr was personally disappointed. He was replaced by Steve Staunton. In 2006 Kerr became a director of Sport against Racism Ireland (SARI). Kerr occasionally makes contributions on radio as a soccer pundit.</p>
