	    <p>The <b>Soloveitchik dynasty</b> of <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbinic</a> scholars and their students originated the <b>Brisker method</b> of <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmudic</a> study, which is embraced by their followers in the <b>Brisk yeshivas</b>. It is so called because of the Soloveitchiks' origin in the town of Brisk, or <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest%2C_Belarus_4781.html" title="Brest, Belarus">Brest-Litovsk</a>, located in what is now <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>. Many of the first Soloveitchik rabbis were the official rabbis of Brisk, and each in turn was known as "the Brisker Rav." Today, <b>Brisk</b> refers to several <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshivas</a> in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> founded by members of the Soloveitchik family.</p>
<p>Acceptance into the Brisk yeshivas in Israel is usually dependent on two factors: a personal reference from someone known to the yeshiva's administration, most commonly the dean of the applicant's previous yeshiva, and meeting its (unpublished) criteria for entrance.</p>

<p>The Soloveitchik family includes many significant rabbinical forbearers, most notably Rabbi <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Volozhin_9970.html" title="Chaim Volozhin">Chaim Volozhiner</a>, famed Talmudist and founder of the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volozhin_yeshiva.html" title="Volozhin yeshiva">Volozhin yeshiva</a>. Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner was a student of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna_Gaon_9c31.html" title="Vilna Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>, and thus some students of Brisk talk of a line of tradition extending "from Moses at Sinai, to Joshua, to the Elders ... to the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna_Gaon_9c31.html" title="Vilna Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>, to Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner, and then to the Soloveitchik dynasty."</p>
<p>Most scholars, however, begin the Soloveitchik dynasty with Rabbi Joseph Dov (HaLevi) Soloveitchik known as the <i><a href="../../../b/e/i/Beis_HaLevi_31aa.html" title="Beis HaLevi">Beis HaLevi</a></i> (see below), as he was the first rabbi of Brisk surnamed Soloveitchik. More significantly, the "Brisker style" described below can already be found to some degree in the Beis HaLevi's works, which is not the case for earlier ancestors.</p>

<p>Rabbi Joseph Dov (HaLevi) Soloveitchik (<a href="../../../1/8/2/1820.html" title="1820">1820</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>) who is known by his <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen_name.html" title="Pen name">pen name</a> for his work the <i>Beis HaLevi</i> served as <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> of Brisk for much of his life. All members of the Soloveitchik family are descended from the tribe of <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levi.html" title="Levi">Levi</a> and thus sometimes go by the surname "<i>HaLevi</i>". The surname "Soloveitchik", in fact, is Polish for "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightingale.html" title="Nightingale">nightingale</a>"; it was chosen by the family because the primary duty of the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levites.html" title="Levites">Levites</a> in the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_in_Jerusalem_e1a8.html" title="Temple in Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> was <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singing.html" title="Singing">singing</a>. (Note that the surname "Soloveitchik" can be spelled either as presented, or as "Soloveichik", without the "t". Throughout this article, "Soloveitchik" is used as the default, with the alternate spelling used for those rabbis -- such as Moshe and Ahron -- who spelled their names that way in English.) The works on the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishnah_Torah_ee43.html" title="Mishnah Torah">Mishnah Torah</a> and first five books of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> which Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik authored were titled <i>Beis HaLevi</i> (<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> for "House of the Levites"). Many people therefore refer to him simply as the "Beis HaLevi", which also avoids the confusion with his two great-grandsons of the same name: (1) the son of Rabbi <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshe_Soloveichik_da4f.html" title="Moshe Soloveichik">Moshe Soloveichik</a>, Rabbi <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Soloveitchik_d712.html" title="Joseph Soloveitchik">Joseph Soloveitchik</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>) who moved to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>; and (2) the son of Rabbi <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzchak_Zev_Soloveitchik_bd10.html" title="Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik">Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik</a>, Rabbi <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berel_Solovetichik_48b2.html" title="Berel Solovetichik">Berel Solovetichik</a>, who lived in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>.

<p>Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik I, i.e. "the Beis HaLevi", was succeeded as rabbi of Brisk by his son, Rabbi <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Soloveitchik_797a.html" title="Chaim Soloveitchik">Chaim Soloveitchik</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>). He is most commonly known as "Reb Chaim Brisker" (Rabbi Chaim from Brisk). His primary work was <i>Chidushei Rav Chaim HaLevi</i>, a volume of insights on the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishneh_Torah_1cf7.html" title="Mishneh Torah">Mishneh Torah</a> which often would suggest novel understandings of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> as well.

(<i>Zev</i> is <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> for "wolf".)

He became famous enough that many people, however, refer to him simply as <i>der Brisker Rov</i> ("the rabbi of Brisk"). In fact, many in the yeshiva world refer to him simply as "The Rov". This should not be confused with "The Rav", which is how many in the YU community refer to Rabbi JB Soloveitchik. Like his father and grandfather, he published works based on the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishneh_Torah_1cf7.html" title="Mishneh Torah">Mishneh Torah</a>, often suggesting novel insights on the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> in the process.

<p>In contrast to the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic</a> movement, all of the Soloveichik rabbis were a part of the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitnagdim.html" title="Mitnagdim">Mitnagdish</a> <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Jews_cc4e.html" title="Lithuanian Jews">Lithuanian</a> yeshiva movement, and thus were strong believers in a traditional Talmudic education and, to a certain degree, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellect.html" title="Intellect">intellect</a> over <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotion</a>. However, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik made it clear that he was very much in touch with Hasidism, having lived for several years in Chaslavich, which was mostly Hasidic. Rabbi Soloveitchik once heard a certain <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubavitch.html" title="Lubavitch">Lubavitch</a> chasid who was a <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohen.html" title="Kohen">Kohen</a> describing how torn he felt about his Kohen status prohibiting him from contact with the dead, when he so dearly wanted to visit the grave of the fifth Lubavitch <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebbe.html" title="Rebbe">Rebbe</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholom_Dovber_Schneersohn_9095.html" title="Sholom Dovber Schneersohn">Sholom Dovber Schneersohn</a>. Rabbi Soloveitchik replied in a letter which described his sympathy with the fellow's plight, stressing that he understood why visiting the rebbe's grave means so much to a Hasid.</p>

<p>The "Brisk dynasty" and their followers are known for a tendency towards strictness in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a> ("Jewish law"); if there is ever a doubt between two rabbinic opinions, the "Brisk way" is more likely to follow the more stringent one. For example, many <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshiva</a> students will not only grow their <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideburns.html" title="Sideburns">sideburns</a> as required by the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a>, but will also grow a sidelock of hair above, which they tuck behind their ears. These are known as "Brisker <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payot.html" title="Payot">Peyos</a>", or "Brisk-style sideburns."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisk_yeshivas_and_methods.html" title="Edit section: Talmudic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Talmudic</span></h3>
<p>The Brisk, or "conceptual" style of Talmudic analysis has become very popular in the world of yeshivas today. It challenges existing, simpler, understandings of Talmudic logic by breaking each Talmudic law down into conceptual components. Then, one component can be shown not to apply in a certain case, thus resolving a contradiction between two laws. For example, there may be a distinction between an actual exemption in the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a> and a scenario where the Halakha simply fails to obligate someone. Occasionally such distinctions have significant practical implications.</p>
<p>Often an entire series of disagreements in the <i><a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishonim.html" title="Rishonim">Rishonim</a></i> (Talmudic commentaries from roughly the period 1000-1500) may stem back to a subtle difference in how to understand a line of Talmudic reasoning. Often what seems like one rule in the Talmud may be explained to in fact contain two separate rules for different scenarios. (See "tzvei dinim", below.)</p>
<p>As an extreme example, Rabbi Chaim Brisker observed that that the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> discusses the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheva_Brachot_95b0.html" title="Sheva Brachot">Sheva Brachot</a> celebrations in the week following a Jewish <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedding.html" title="Wedding">wedding</a>. The Talmud requires "panim chadashos" (meaning "a new presence" or "new faces"), i.e. a guest must be present at the Sheva Brachot celebration who had not attended the wedding. Elsewhere, the Talmud comments that once sacrificial meat has been burned to ashes, the ashes no longer have a sacrificial status, as "panim chadashos ba'u l'chan" -- "a new presence has arrived", meaning that the ashes are not the same as the meat. "So if you were at a Sheva Brachot party, and you looked around and everyone there had already been at this couple's wedding, why not just take some meat and burn it to ashes?", challenged Rabbi Chaim. Clearly, the phrase "panim chadashos" has different meanings in the contexts of wedding celebrations and sacrificial meat.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chaim is famous for the quotation, "One approach which answers three different problems is better than three different approaches to individually solve the three problems" (a corollary of <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_razor.html" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>).</p>
<p>Another classic distinction employed in Brisk Talmudics is: "is the principle stated here merely an application of a general rule, or is it a different principle, specialized to our context?" This was demonstrated in an episode involving Rabbi <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzchak_Zev_Soloveitchik_bd10.html" title="Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik">Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik</a> and witnessed by Rabbi <a href="../../../y/e/h/Yehezkel_Abramsky_9e6b.html" title="Yehezkel Abramsky">Yehezkel Abramsky</a>. A fellow came to the rabbis, explaining that a close relative of his had recently died, and that a few hours later, a more prominent, well-to-do member of the same city had died. The <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevra_Kadisha_57c1.html" title="Chevra Kadisha">Chevra Kadisha</a> (Jewish burial society), rather than follow the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-come%2C_first-served.html" title="First-come, first-served">first-come, first-served</a> policy mandated by <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_ethics.html" title="Jewish ethics">Jewish ethics</a>, buried the well-to-do individual first. The bereaved thus demanded an apology from the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevra_Kadisha_57c1.html" title="Chevra Kadisha">Chevra Kadisha</a>. Rabbi <a href="../../../y/i/t/Yitzchak_Zev_Soloveitchik_bd10.html" title="Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik">Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik</a> consulted the Laws of Mourning from <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>' Code of Law (the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mishneh_Torah_1cf7.html" title="Mishneh Torah">Mishneh Torah</a>) for just a moment before telling the individual, "the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevra_Kadisha_57c1.html" title="Chevra Kadisha">Chevra Kadisha</a> were wrong, but that is between them and G-d. I will inform them that their conduct was improper, but you are not involved here." After the fellow left, Rabbi Soloveitchik explained to his colleague, Rabbi Abramsky, that the question at hand was this: certainly Judaism has a general principle of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-come%2C_first-served.html" title="First-come, first-served">first-come, first-served</a>, because of the rule that when faced with the opportunity to do a <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitzvah.html" title="Mitzvah">mitzvah</a>, one should not pass it up. If this is the only reason that <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-come%2C_first-served.html" title="First-come, first-served">first-come, first-served</a> applies in the case of burials, then one who violates it is no more in the wrong than one who has passed over any mitzva opportunity, and his/her offense is between himself/herself and G-d.. Or, instead, there may be a specialized notion of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-come%2C_first-served.html" title="First-come, first-served">first-come, first-served</a> when it comes to burials, to avoid offending the bereaved. Only according to the latter reasoning would an apology be required. Rabbi Soloveitchik found that <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> made no explicit mention of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-come%2C_first-served.html" title="First-come, first-served">first-come, first-served</a> in his Laws of Mourning, and thus extrapolated that only the generalized notion of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-come%2C_first-served.html" title="First-come, first-served">first-come, first-served</a> applies to burial. Therefore the bereaved could not demand an apology. Upon hearing this reasoning, Rabbi Abramsky exclaimed (in a positive way), "Rabbi Soloveitchik can deduce laws from the fact that <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maimonides.html" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> says nothing at all!"</p>
<p>The famed yeshiva of <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volozhin.html" title="Volozhin">Volozhin</a>, arguably the first modern yeshiva, favored a traditionalist approach towards Talmudics under the leadership of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netziv.html" title="Netziv">Netziv</a>, which often required absorbing a great amount of Talmudic material to acquire a "general Talmudic feel" before analyzing a topic. Later, however, Rabbi Chaim Brisker became a lecturer at <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volozhin.html" title="Volozhin">Volozhin</a>, and the yeshiva drifted towards the new "Brisk lomdus" approach. (Incidentally, the Volozhin yeshiva shut down when the government required it to incorporate secular studies to such a degree that there was no longer any real time for Talmudic study, though the details are far more complex. While the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netziv.html" title="Netziv">Netziv</a> was still officially the yeshiva's head, the influence of Rabbi Chaim Brisker should not be neglected, and may have played a large role in the decision.)</p>
<p>As Rabbi <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Soloveitchik_d712.html" title="Joseph Soloveitchik">Joseph Soloveitchik</a> suggested in his eulogy for the Brisker Rov, the full, true "Brisk approach" as we know it today was not developed until Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik had been <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a> of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisk.html" title="Brisk">Brisk</a> for many years. The notes that Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik had used for his lectures at the <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshiva</a> of <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volozhin.html" title="Volozhin">Volozhin</a> (years before he assumed the Brisk <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulpit.html" title="Pulpit">pulpit</a>) are still extant today, and the approach found there is not as well-developed as in (his and others') later published works. The notes could best be described as "proto-Brisk lomdus", a term which could be used regarding the works of the <i>Beis HaLevi</i> as well. Several modern scholars agree with this notion of "proto-Brisk", and it can be heard in the lectures of Rabbi Dr. Aaron Rakefet-Rothkoff. Nonetheless, as seen above, even "proto-Brisk" was already different enough and popular enough to cause the above tension at the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volozhin_yeshiva.html" title="Volozhin yeshiva">Volozhin yeshiva</a>.</p>
<p>An additional major influence on the "Brisk approach" was a Rabbi Mendel Epstein of <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slutzk.html" title="Slutzk">Slutzk</a>. Rabbi Chaim "Brisker" Soloveitchik spent several early teenage years in <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slutzk.html" title="Slutzk">Slutzk</a>, where Rabbi Epstein served as his <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melamed.html" title="Melamed">melamed</a> (Judaics teacher for pre-college levels). Rabbi Chaim later claimed that much of the 'brisker derech' attributed to him was founded on Rabbi Epstein's approach; however, as a small town's <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melamed.html" title="Melamed">melamed</a>, Rabbi Epstein and his ideas never achieved fame. Thus, Rabbi Mendel Epstein's contribution to the "Brisker approach" might be compared to that of Sir <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Barrow_6fdd.html" title="Isaac Barrow">Isaac Barrow</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s mentor, to calculus.</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, some scholars denounced the Brisk approach as "chemistry", as it sought to analyze each Talmudic law by breaking it down into components, whereas a traditionalist approach focused more on the entirety of the laws.</p>
<p>While the "Brisk approach" ("Brisker Derech") has won acceptance in almost all yeshivas today, it has its opponents. These include Rabbi <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avraham_Yishayahu_Karelitz_40d8.html" title="Avraham Yishayahu Karelitz">Avraham Yishayahu Karelitz</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>) (known as the <i>Chazon Ish</i>), who felt that often the existing approach to a Talmudic portion was sufficient. Additionally, the approach of those yeshivas in the United States and Israel today which stem from the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mir_Yeshiva_%28Poland%29_45f8.html" title="Mir Yeshiva (Poland)">Mirrer Yeshiva</a>, (originally from <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>) tend to stress single, unifying themes throughout Talmudic concepts, often focusing on only one <i><a href="../../../r/i/s/Rishonim.html" title="Rishonim">Rishon</a></i> if it is seen as the most "truthful" approach to a Talmudic passage. "Mir-style" yeshivas are thus seen generally as opposed to "Brisk-style" yeshivas, though there is very little personal animosity.</p>
<p>In Brisk Yeshivas, the tractates studied deviate from the normal <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshivish.html" title="Yeshivish">Yeshivish</a> tractates. Most <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshivas</a> learn the Talmudic laws of money, property, marriage, and divorce. In Brisk, there is a greater tendency toward <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodashim.html" title="Kodashim">Kodashim</a> tractates, as well as <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazir.html" title="Nazir">Nazir</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/t/Sotah.html" title="Sotah">Sotah</a> (more ritually oriented) tractates in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashim.html" title="Nashim">Nashim</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisk_yeshivas_and_methods.html" title="Edit section: Political">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political</span></h3>
<p>A great deal of controversy has erupted regarding the political sidings of the rabbis of Brisk. Rabbi Yitzchak Zev and his descendants, who settled in Israel, have made their opinion clear that they oppose a secular <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> state and thus show no support for the Israeli government. They are also opposed to yeshiva students having a secular <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> education as well.</p>
<p>In contrast, most of the Soloveitchiks who moved to the United States, including Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and his brother Rabbi Aaron Soloveitchik, were generally warmly supportive of the current State of Israel as well as what they perceive as a well-rounded college education. Turning to their ancestors, Rabbi Chaim Brisker had made some harsh statements against <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, but it is hard to tell what his views may have been today, as many groups who had opposed Zionism in the 1800s changed their views after the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> (1939-1945) and the founding of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a> (1948). For more on this, see the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a>.</p>
<p>With regards to feminism, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik was proud to point out that on his parents' wedding invitation, his grandparents are listed as "Chaim &amp; Lifsha" on one line, with "Soloveitchik" on the next line, centered between their names. This could be seen as more feminist than the "Rabbi &amp; Mrs. So-And-So" (or in Hebrew, "Ploni BenPloni V'Rayaso") seen in many <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi.html" title="Haredi">haredi</a> invitations today.</p>
<p>Thus, given how the world has changed in the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>, and given the strong and varied views of their descendants, the views of Rabbi Chaim Brisker and the <i>Beis HaLevi</i> on Zionism, secular education, religious <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernism.html" title="Modernism">modernism</a> in general, are topics of current discussion.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisk_yeshivas_and_methods.html" title="Edit section: Logic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Logic</span></h3>
<p>Two popular logical sequences ("<i>lomdus</i>") used extensively by followers of the Brisker Talmud approach to resolve apparent contradictions between different passages are the <i>tzvei dinim</i> ("two laws") and <i>cheftza/gavra</i> ("object/person") answers.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Tzvei dinim</i> is used to answer contradictions by explaining that the two conflicting rulings are indeed talking about two different cases and the differences in the cases cause the conflict in the verdicts. An example of this is Rabbi Chaim Brisker's interpretation of (Bava Kama 88a) that there is one law for a man to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_milah.html" title="Brit milah">circumcise</a> his son and another that obligates the son himself to be circumcised. The two overlapping, but distinct, obligations can together explain a set of outcomes which could not be explained by a single logical principle.</li>
<li><i>Cheftza/gavra</i> is when a person is distinguished from his/her actions (or the actions done upon him/her). For example, the Brisker Rav states (Yevamoth 2a) that a forbidden incestual relative is considered a "forbidden <b>person</b>," while though a <a href="../../../n/i/d/Niddah.html" title="Niddah">menstruating</a> woman is not a "forbidden person," the sexual <b>act</b> performed with her is forbidden.</li>
