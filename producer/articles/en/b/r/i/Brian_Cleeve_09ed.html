<p>Cleeve was born in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southend-on-Sea_5eec.html" title="Southend-on-Sea">Southend-on-Sea</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex.html" title="Essex">Essex</a>, the second of three sons to Charles Edward Cleeve and Josephine nee Talbot. Josephine was a native of Essex, where her family had lived for generations. Charles Cleeve, who was born in <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, was a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scion.html" title="Scion">scion</a> of a famous and wealthy family that ran several successful Irish <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condensed_Milk_Company_of_Ireland_619c.html" title="Condensed Milk Company of Ireland">enterprises</a> in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cleeve_7644.html" title="Thomas Cleeve">Cleeves</a> came from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> originally and emigrated to Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of labour troubles and the effects of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Civil_War_de5a.html" title="Irish Civil War">Irish Civil War</a>, the Cleeve business failed and Charles moved with his family to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, where Brian was born in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>.</p>
<p>When he was two-and-a-half, Brian's mother died and his maternal grandparents, Alfred and Gertrude Talbot, took over responsibility for his upbringing. At age eight, Cleeve was sent as a boarder to Selwyn House in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>, followed at age 12 by three years at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Edward%27s_School_%28Oxford%29_4b3a.html" title="St Edward's School (Oxford)">St. Edward's School</a> in <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. He was by nature a free-thinker and he rejected the assumptions and prejudices that were then part and parcel of upper-middle class English life. His unwillingness to conform meant that school life was very difficult for him, and, in the late summer of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, Cleeve decided not to return to St. Edward's for his final year. Instead, he ran away to sea.</p>

<p>Cleeve led an eventful life during the next fifteen years. He served on the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Queen_Mary_e54c.html" title="RMS Queen Mary">RMS Queen Mary</a> as a commis waiter for several months. At age 17 he joined the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Own_Cameron_Highlanders_404b.html" title="Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders">Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders</a> as a private soldier, and, because of his age, just missed being sent to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> as part of the <a href="../../../b/e/f/BEF_ae69.html" title="BEF">BEF</a> when <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> broke out. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, he was selected for officer training and sent to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_lieutenant.html" title="Second lieutenant">Second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_African_Rifles_1050.html" title="King's African Rifles">King's African Rifles</a>. A year later he was court-martialled as a result of his objections to the treatment by colleagues of an African prisoner. Stripped of his commission and sentenced to three years' penal servitude, he was transferred to <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield_Prison_f13b.html" title="Wakefield Prison">Wakefield Prison</a> in <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. There, he was offered parole if he agreed to work for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Intelligence_a418.html" title="British Intelligence">British Intelligence</a>. For the remainder of the war he served as a counter-spy in neutral ports such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. As cover, he worked as an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinary_Seaman_%28occupation%29_adaf.html" title="Ordinary Seaman (occupation)">ordinary seaman</a> in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Merchant_Navy_f6e7.html" title="British Merchant Navy">Merchant Navy</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, Cleeve took an Irish passport and came to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> where, in the space of three weeks, he met and married Veronica McAdie. A year later, they left Ireland, with baby daughter Berenice, on a protracted odyssey that took them to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>, and finally <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, the family settled in <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> where Cleeve and his wife set up their own perfume business. A second daughter, Tanga, was born to the couple there in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. As a result of his friendship with Fr. <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Huddleston_c095.html" title="Trevor Huddleston">Trevor Huddleston</a>, Cleeve witnessed the conditions in which the black and coloured population had to live in townships such as <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophiatown.html" title="Sophiatown">Sophiatown</a>. Cleeve became an outspoken critic of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, and, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, he was branded by the authorities as a 'political intractable' and ordered to leave <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. He returned to Ireland where he lived for the remainder of his life.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Cleeve_09ed.html" title="Edit section: Literary career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literary career</span></h3>
<p>Cleeve started writing poems in his teens, a few of which were published in his school paper, the St. Edward's Chronicle. During the war he continued to produce poems of a spiritual or <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> nature, most of which were never published. In 1945, he turned to <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a>-writing. After his first two attempts were rejected, his third novel, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Far_Hills_ef6d.html" title="The Far Hills">The Far Hills</a></i>, was published in 1952. It is a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_%C3%A0_clef.html" title="Roman Ã  clef">roman Ã  clef</a> about the first few months of his married life in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. It is also an unflattering picture of the drabness and mean-spiritedness of lower middle class Irish life in the mid 1940s. Two further novels about <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> followed and their unvarnished descriptions of the reality of life for the native population probably contributed to Cleeve's eventual expulsion from the country.</p>
<p>In the mid 1950s, Cleeve began to concentrate on the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_story.html" title="Short story">short story</a> form. During the next 15 years over 100 of his short stories were published in magazines and periodicals across five continents. He sold nearly 30 to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saturday_Evening_Post_4fca.html" title="The Saturday Evening Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a></i> alone. In 1966, his story <i>Foxer</i> was honoured with a scroll at the annual <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Award_a01b.html" title="Edgar Award">Edgar Awards</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 70s, Cleeve returned to writing novels with considerable success. He produced a series of well-received mystery and spy thrillers that did not sacrifice character to plot. One of these, <i>Dark Blood, Dark Terror</i>, was reviewed in the following terms by <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">The Sunday Express</a></i>: "Dublin author's exciting novel overshadows a man of genius. I am afraid <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Greene_22c0.html" title="Graham Greene">Graham Greene</a> comes off second best". (This was a reference to Greene's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comedians_19bc.html" title="The Comedians">The Comedians</a></i>.)</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, Cleeve published <i><a href="../../../c/r/y/Cry_of_Morning_c481.html" title="Cry of Morning">Cry of Morning</a></i>, his most controversial and successful novel up to that point. It is a panoramic depiction of the economic and social changes that affected <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> during the 1960s as seen through the eyes of a disparate collection of well-drawn characters. Cleeve subsequently achieved even greater commercial success, especially in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, with a number of historical novels featuring a strong female character as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonist.html" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a>. The first of these, <i>Sara</i>, is set in England during the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_era.html" title="Napoleonic era">Napoleonic era</a> and was published in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>.</p>
<p>Cleeve also wrote several works of non-fiction, principally the <i>Dictionary of Irish Writers</i>. This was a 20-year project to provide to scholars and the general public alike a comprehensive resource on Irish writers at an affordable price. It was a labour of love that consumed a great deal of his time and was effectively subsidised by his more commercial pursuits. The last edition was published in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Cleeve_09ed.html" title="Edit section: Television career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Television career</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, <a href="../../../r/t/%C3%A9/RT%C3%89_One_319e.html" title="RTÃ‰ One">TelefÃ­s Ã‰ireann</a> was launched as the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>'s first indigenous television station. Cleeve joined the station as a part-time interviewer on the current affairs programme, <i>Broadsheet</i>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, a new documentary series, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_%28Irish_TV_series%29_bbe1.html" title="Discovery (Irish TV series)"><i>Discovery</i></a>, began with Cleeve as scriptwriter and presenter. The series covered all aspects of Irish life and Cleeve won a prestigious Jacob's Television Award for his contribution.</p>
<p>In January <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, TelefÃ­s Ã‰ireann announced that Cleeve was being dropped as presenter of <i>Discovery</i> because his voice was deemed to be "too light in tone". Many suspected that the real reason was political. Cleeve was told by a colleague that his English accent was felt to be similar to that of the "ascendancy class". This was a reference to the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_8ba2.html" title="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> elite which had governed Ireland before independence. An evening newspaper mounted a campaign on Cleeve's behalf and he was soon reinstated.</p>
<p>In September <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> he joined the new weekly current affairs programme, <i><a href="../../../7/_/d/7_Days_%28Ireland%29_058c.html" title="7 Days (Ireland)">7 Days</a></i>. There, Cleeve and his colleagues set about exposing issues of public interest, much to the dismay of the traditional power structures of big business, the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> and the political parties. Eventually, external pressure led to the programme coming under tighter editorial control. Cleeve refused to be subject to the new regime and was moved to other less controversial programmes. TelefÃ­s Ã‰ireann did not renew his contract when it expired in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, ironically, just as his last documentary won two awards at the Golden <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a> International Television Festival. The documentary, <i>Behind The Closed Eye</i>, focused on the Irish poet <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Ledwidge_54d8.html" title="Francis Ledwidge">Francis Ledwidge</a> who was killed while serving in the British army in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to his literary and broadcasting careers, Cleeve had a lively interest in many other areas. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>

<p>Raised as an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, Cleeve converted to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. In his thirties he became <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a> but continued to pursue his interest in the spiritual dimension of life. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, he began to experience a deep sense of the presence of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> and the effect on his life was profound. He all but abandoned his successful literary career and wrote three mystical works that aroused much debate in Ireland. The first of these, <i>The House on the Rock</i>, contains a series of meditations on a wide variety of topics from the nature of good and evil to more <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> matters such as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_energy.html" title="Nuclear energy">nuclear energy</a>. This was followed by <i>The Seven Mansions</i>, which delves deeper into some of the subjects covered in its predecessor. The third book, <i>The Fourth Mary</i>, was published in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> and is an account of a branch of the cult of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> that flourished in first century <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
<p>When the clamour caused by his spiritual books died down, Cleeve withdrew from the public gaze. He continued to write for a small audience of those who contacted him following publication of <i>The House on the Rock</i>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, he published a collection of essays on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> summarising his spiritual beliefs. In these, he described the steps he believed were necessary for anyone wishing to pursue a spiritual life. They consist of learning to follow God's guidance as an "inner voice" in one's mind, uncovering the past failures that keep one trapped in a negative cycle of self-absorption, and learning the qualities necessary to live as one of God's servants.</p>

<p>Following his wife Veronica's death in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Cleeve moved to the village of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shankill%2C_Dublin_4aff.html" title="Shankill, Dublin">Shankill, Dublin</a>. His health deteriorated rapidly following a series of small strokes. In November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, he married his second wife, Patricia Ledwidge, and she cared for him during his final months.</p>
