<p>What does "Far Right" mean any more - does it mean the economics of a free market? Or is it more authoritarian in nature? Would Adam Smith be a member of the "Far Right"?</p>

<dd>Well, the idea of "right" and "left" are pretty inadequate, but I've never heard the phrase "far right" used to mean anything other than near-fascism (or actualy fascism).

<p>I've removed the implication that anti-immigration == racism. Many parties (including the torys and David blunkett, according to what he said on the JV show today), are against immigrants "taking" jobs. (for the record I'm not). I've also removed the "overwhelming evidence" part, unless someone can provide some example of overwhelming evidence?</p>
<hr />
<p>I've clarified that there have never been any BNP MP's. Most of their support comes from a fear of crime rather than "loss of jobs". And they do not deny being a racist party. The nastiness of their ideas is evident in the "voluntary repartiation" policy, not in their anti-immigration stance, which is mainstream. M-Henry 11:30, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>In fact a voluntary repatriation policy already exists. It is simply very poorly funded. The BNP say they will increase the funding of this.</i> They do deny being "racist" per se, although some things they say could be construed as racism.</p>

<dd>I'm new here, so apologies for not having set up a userid yet. I presume you are referring to me though Karada, as you've been changing the changes that I've changed! I was under the impression that name calling such as "BNP apologist" was against Wikiquette rules - <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks</a> - but maybe I'm wrong. However, just for the record, I am not a member of the BNP; I have never voted for the BNP; I do not speak for the BNP, only myself; I do not apologise for or on behalf of the BNP. I am, however, a proponent of free-speech, no matter who is doing the speaking and no matter how distasteful or otherwise I find their views. I do not shout other people down and I do not allow other people to shout me down. I thought that wikipedia was about neutrality and acknowledging that other people may share different views to ones own. If that's not the case please let me know. I believe in honesty above all other policies!</dd>

<dd>As for your google search, that gets 16 hits; not suprising as some of the pages refer to the 'anti nazi league'. If you change 'nazi' in the search string to 'neo-nazi', you only get 4 hits. Admittedly, the BNP are called "neo-nazis" in these 4 articles, but none of the articles is dated this year, 3 of them being from 2002 and 1 from 2001. If you remove the keyword 'nazi' (or 'neo-nazi') and just search for BNP, you get 200 hits (172 if you add the keyword '2003'). What I am trying to make clear is that the Telegraph and most other middle or right wing papers rarely call the BNP "neo-nazis" these days, preferring to simply use the terms 'right-wing' or 'far-right' instead or, indeed, leaving out any description altogether.</dd>

The BBC, <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Observer</i> and <i>Daily Telegraph</i> newspapers have described the BNP as "neo-Nazis", as has Searchlight Magazine, widely viewed as an authority on European neo-fascism. These are all mainstream, respected, sources. The fact that many left-wing sources agree with them does not detract from this. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a> 20:52, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By "The BBC", I guess you're mostly referring to the 'unbiased' Panorama programmes concerning the BNP, produced and variously staffed by key members of Searchlight Magazine.</dd>
<dd>The Guardian and Observer are basically one and the same, even sharing the same website. Most of the information they publish concerning the BNP is sourced from and/or quotes - you guessed it - Searchlight Magazine! They even include a link to Searchlight on each such article published on the web. The Guardian/Observer is usually referred to as a "fascist left" newspaper by rival commentators in "The Sun" newspaper, due to its extreme left leanings.</dd>
<dd>I've dealt with the Telegraph already. They have not called the BNP "neo-nazis" during 2003, despite publishing 172 articles that mention them.</dd>
<dd>Then we have Searchlight Magazine themselves. They are a nasty bunch, not adverse to publishing names, addresses and photos of their "opponents", many of whom have subsequently been attacked. Their "opponents" include other 'anti-fascist' organisations and anarchist organisations, whom they denounce in order to keep their monopoly on all things 'anti-fascist'. Searchlight was founded and is run by members and former members of 'The Communist Party of Great Britain' - hardly torchbearers of democracy! Searchlight are mostly controlled and paid for by British State Intelligence Agency - MI5. Of course, I'm sure you've done your research and are well aware of all this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To put it simply Karada, neither your sources, your opinions or your writings could be described as un-biased, could they! That's fine by me. Like I said, you're entitled to your opinions, but please don't try and hide them as the mainstream opinions of all sections of the media and the public.</dd>
</dl>
<p>194.165.163.127 please dont insult our intelligence by claiming that "its only the far-left who try to call the BNP neo-nazis, not the mainstream" youre fooling nobody. I'm sure the Guardian/Oserver would be surprised to hear that they had "far left leanings", mildly centre-left leanings would be more like it. <a href="../../../g/-/m/User%7EG-Man_797a.html" title="User:G-Man">G-Man</a> 22:56, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>G-Man, I read the guardian, and it is a great newspaper, but lets be honest, it is about as neutral as a party political broadcast. But there is is no need for arguements about these things - the BNP entry can include all opinions, as long as it is clear whose claims they are. And if you describe the BNP as neo-nazi, since this is an encyclopdia, it should be made clear that the BNP are not like ww2 german or italian militarists - they are right wing isolationists, not right wing conquerers. They are "only" described as nazis because they are violent racists. And the dispute is whether or not they are violent. Which can be made clear in the article. M-Henry 10:43, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Perhaps the solution to the "neo-nazi" question is to look at parallels between the policies of the <a href="../../../n/s/d/NSDAP_6abb.html" title="NSDAP">Nazi party</a>, as exposed in <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> and the parties that are called "neo-nazi". For all I know, the BNP advocates neither the expulsion of Jews from British society, neither the military expansion of the United Kingdom at the expense of the neighbouring countries. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 10:53, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone please give a source reference (here only) to the Nick Griffin attributed quote that "racism is a natural instinct". I sought/googled, but could not find!</p>

<p>-Found it. <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,783675,00.html" class="external free" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,783675,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,783675,00.html</a></p>
<p>"So when white bleeding hearts or black radicals accuse white people of being inherently racist, he is in complete accord. That's right, he says, that's perfectly natural." Observer, 1st September 2002. I'll correct the main article so it is sourced better. M-Henry 08:58, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm - there are no quotation marks around what NG is alleged to have said. At the very least, the BNP page should be changed to acknowledge this fact. What is written in the Observer/Guardian article and how that is paraphrased on the BNP page are really at odds within an encyclopedic environment. (The O/G article itself is all the more questionable for the correction printed at the bottom of it. Did the reporter ever really attend such a meeting and meet the people he named?) Regardless, another O/G article - <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4407688-102273,00.html" class="external free" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4407688-102273,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4407688-102273,00.html</a> - states: "together with the strutting figure of Nick Griffin, whose assertion that he is not racist ...". This clearly contradicts the other attributed quote. I think the BNP page should have the "On the other hand, when asked, Nick Griffin does not deny claims of racism, which he says is a natural instinct." line removed, unless someone can come up with something more substantial to back it. Comments?</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Another good one is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,222602,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,222602,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,222602,00.html</a> - which somewhat contradicts the observer interview, showing how Nick Griffens language changes over time. I have no idea why he gives all these interviews to the Guardian/Observer when he must know they fully intend to demonise him. M-Henry 09:14, 23 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I've fleshed out the one-liner about Griffin's conviction (which wasn't factually correct in itself). Everything added is fact and in the public domain. I originally deleted the one-liner about Griffin's conviction the other day, as it is repeating what is said in Griffin's own article, but someone put it back saying it was relevant. So I decided to add details and context in this (BNP) article as well. I'd be happy to move the whole section to the Griffin article proper if people think that best.

<hr />
<p>I've noticed that a lot of edits seem to have the effect of presenting things from the BNP's POV just recently. As the vast majority of UK people are anti-BNP, I find this imbalance curious. Not that I'm suspicious or anything, but I've added this article to my watchlist. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:56, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the main problem is that the earlier versions of this article read more like a leaflet from the ANL than an unbiased encyclopedia. Your latest revisions appear to be carrying on that earlier tradition. You leave in whatever sounds negative about the BNP and remove any attempt at providing context or balance. Your assertion that "the vast majority of UK people are anti-BNP" is like saying "the vast majority of UK people eat meat, so vegetarians have no right to their point of view"! If you want to add your POV, that's fine, but don't remove things which may represent a POV you disagree with unless you can come up with a more constructive reasoning than that stated above. -- <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETails_e24a.html" title="User:Tails">Tails</a> 18:26, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I think we need to rework the wording in some parts of this article. Like it or loathe it, the BNP are a registered political party in the UK. "Opponents" of it, in a political context, customarily refers to other political parties. Neither 'Searchlight' magazine, nor the ANL/SWP are registered political parties, therefore I think they should be referred to as 'critics' or something akin to that - (non-abusive suggestions welcome).</p>
<p>Also, it is not factual to say that the BNP "are opposed by all of the mainstream media". Apart from the Guardian Group, it would be very difficult to say that the rest of the mainstream media has, in place, a de facto policy of opposition to the BNP. It would be fairer to say that, as far as the mainstream media is concerned, the BNP don't really feature on their radar at all. Either way, this is supposed to be an encyclopedia reporting facts, not assumptions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed many critics of the BNP believe the Daily Mail is a supporter <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Weaver_c7df.html" title="User:Paul Weaver">Paul Weaver</a> 16:05, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Finally, stating that the BNP are opposed "by all of the mainstream political parties" is a case of stating the (proverbially) obvious! All political parties, mainstream or not, oppose all other political parties; that is the reason for their existence. Stressing the point here is silly. -- <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETails_e24a.html" title="User:Tails">Tails</a> 19:20, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Tails, I won't go into all your points in detail. However, I would just like to stress the point that the mainstream parties are publically <i>united in condemnation</i> of the BNP, in much the same way as they are united against other issues that almost all voters agree on. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 15:25, 27 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Anome - of course they're "united in condemnation", but again, that is stating the obvious. The BNP are standing candidates against them, splitting their previously comfortable three-way votes, and actually winning some council seats. The "mainstream" parties are hardly going to be "united in celebration", are they! It's a hell of a lot easier to simply all condemn the BNP than it is to actually answer the real reasons behind their own failure to get elected.</p>
<p>Going back to point I made about the "mainstream" media, much of it recently seems to be virtually neutral when reporting about the BNP. There have been very few 'attacks', as such, when the BNP have had recent election successes. Some sources even appear to be dropping the term 'far right', either using 'right wing' or no description at all. Very few outlets are using the word 'extremist'. Even fewer use the word 'racist' - and only those connected with Searchlight in some manner now describe the BNP as 'neo-nazi'. Even Gary Younge, writing in the Guardian recently - <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/columnist/story/0,9321,1037373,00.html" class="external free" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/columnist/story/0,9321,1037373,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://politics.guardian.co.uk/columnist/story/0,9321,1037373,00.html</a> - <i>only</i> described the BNP as "rightwing"!</p>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no evidence that the BNP are actively "opposed by all of the mainstream media" (although, obviously, they are not actively supported by them either)</li>
<li>stating that the mainstream parties are "united in condemnation" of the BNP is worthless comment in an encyclopedic environment</li>

Try and find a similar statement in any wikipedia article about any other political party. Most people in the UK don't vote for the Liberal Democrats, but I doubt (without looking) that that fact is spelt out in their article! It's blatant bias. Factual, but pointless! The stated facts about how many candidates the BNP have fielded and how many got elected speak for themselves.

But I think I was a bit confused because, well, let's just say you've also done make the article "softer" by adding things like "Some people say that" and adding in Griffin's arguments in his defence after the sentence that says he was convicted. Also, it's a bit strong to call the sentence you repeatedly removed on most people in the UK not being BNP voters dumb or biased, so let's just say you caught my attention. It's true that <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=80.225.30.236" class="external text" title="http://en2.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=80.225.30.236" rel="nofollow">user:80.225.30.236</a>is obviously biased and that you have removed some of their more egregious edits. -- <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_b5f0.html" title="User:Bcorr">Bcorr</a> 04:35, 28 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the acknowledgement - I didn't think I'd been that overzealous!! As for parts of the article that I <i>did</i> amend, that's just an attempt to keep some balance and add some context where necessary. If I and others didn't do that, this article might just as well only have a link to either the BNP website or the ANL website, depending on who got the last edit in! Perhaps my use of the word <i>dumb</i> was a tad strong in the Wikipedia world.

<p>There's a big difference from stating a neutral fact ("The BNP are from the right of the political spectrum; a non-representative minority of critics from the radical left describe the BNP as "neo-nazi" in outlook, althouh the party strongly refutes this allegation.") and twisting that facts by the use of emotive words, which are likely to bias the reader ("The BNP are a FAR RIGHT party often described as neo-NAZI by the ANTI-FASCIST magazine, searchlight"). Facts can be accurately described without resorting to such words. The only reason searchlight call themselves an "anti-fascist" magazine is so that people immediately associate anyone they criticise with fascism, whether this is justified or not. So, by using such terms, you can easily be biased in favour of such organisations.</p>
<hr />
<p>The 'Alleged links between the BNP and neo-Nazism and racism' section is silly. It is just there to satisfy a liberal POV that insists that the BNP are <i>neo-Nazis</i> because they have different views to those on the left. It is <i>guilt by association</i>. There is no similar section within the Conservative Party article, although the same <i>guilt</i> could easily be shown for them. Even IDS has had talks with members of the French FN. There is no similar section within the Labour Party article, although they could easily be called <i>Communists</i> if <i>guilt by association</i> was the only proof needed. Tony Blair has shaken the hand of Gerry Adams, but nobody calls Blair a terrorist!</p>
<p>William Pierce may have addressed a BNP rally 8 years ago in the days of Tyndall, but Pierce is now dead and Tyndall was deposed as Chairman 4 years ago and recently expelled outright from the party. David Duke <i>was</i> the "National Director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan" between 1974-78, but that particular KKK was a legal organisation and his association with it ended 23 years before he shared a platform with Griffin. Duke has also lectured at Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard universities and was elected to the House of Representatives in Louisiana! Both of these men could well be described as "White separatists", but <i>guilt by association</i>, especially with such a small <i>association</i>, is never valid and certainly, in this case, hardly grounds for branding the present day BNP as neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>Unless someone can say (here) why the <i>links</i> section should remain, I'm going to remove it soon. It is clearly <i>not</i> NPOV and looks more like something added to please the <i>Wikipedia Friends of Searchlight</i>! -- <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETails_e24a.html" title="User:Tails">Tails</a> 04:43, 28 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the links ought to stay. To talk about David Duke as if he has been completely separated from the Klan for 25 years, that and since he won an election for state rep and has spoken ("lectured" sounds as if he had a position as a lecturer) he's suddenly a horse of a different color is at best ignorant of the reality of David Duke, and at worst, highly disingenous! In fact, the sections used to just say "Links..." and perhaps changing that back would help. -- <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_b5f0.html" title="User:Bcorr">Bcorr</a> 04:53, 28 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You didn't quite read into what I said. I acknowledged that Duke was with the KKK and that he could be described as a "White separatist". What I am trying to point out is that Duke appearing on the same platform as Griffin, once, does not banish the BNP to be known as a <i>neo-nazi</i> party for all time. 'Guilt by association' is <i>not</i> valid. If it was, then all the others who sat with Duke in the Louisiana House of Representatives, would also be classed as neo-nazis, which I doubt they were. I also pointed out how easy it would be to call the Conservatives <i>neo-nazis</i> and the Labour Party <i>Communists</i> if <i>guilt by association</i> is the only evidence required. They are not labelled as such though, and the BNP are entitled to the same privilege. -- <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETails_e24a.html" title="User:Tails">Tails</a> 05:43, 28 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Are the BNP a neo-Nazi Organisation?</i></p>
<p>As can be seen, I changed the title and format of the 'Alleged Links to neo-Nazism and Racism' section. I don't know if this format is acceptable in the Wikipedia environment, but I think it's better than what we had already. All the 'opponents claim'/'BNP deny' stuff is becoming very repetitive, whilst also being repetitive and, one might add, a bit repetitive. I just thought I'd try something different. The 'response' to the Combat 18 stuff is borrowed from the BBC Panorama/Searchlight programme, so it's not as though it's even a biased opinion.

<dd>I can see that you are trying to address concerns raised whilst still making it clear that it's a matter of opinion as to whether the BNP is neo-Nazi, racist, &amp;c. However, I think that in itself is a POV -- and a minority viewpoint as well. For example, this passage from your latest edit seems clearly POV: <i>"Some opponents have claimed that the BNP are neo-Nazis and, by implication, racist, fascist and xenophobic. Obviously such claims are highly emotive, frequently disputed and rarely objective. When a subject such at this arises, the only reasonable solution is to allow both 'sides' to state their case."</i> I also think that the way you rewrote the allegations into debate makes it seem as though those are the main reasons that many consider them neo-Nazi, &amp;c. -- <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_b5f0.html" title="User:Bcorr">Bcorr</a> 13:59, 1 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is nonsense to claim that it is only the "far-left" who call the BNP "fascist" or "neo-nazi".

<p>No the "opponents" section as presently written gives readers the hopelessly misleading impression that the BNP are opposed "only" by the ANL searchlight etc, which is a grotesque misrepresentation of the truth and does not reflect the widespread nature of opposition to the BNP, and the fact that the majority of the population finds them abhorent.

<li>balanced irrelevant and biased commensts on the london nailbomber, who did say that he left the BNP because ti was "too democratic". He was also a member for about 2 months...</li>
</ul>

<li>added the many people consider the panorama programme very biased, which is true. It would be better if the use of that as a source were avoided, but if you insist, it must be mentioned that many do consider it biased - read the talk page on the BBC website.</li>

When you say that the Panorama programme was biased, are you saying that it is <i>incorrect</i> in reporting that the BNP officials it named have the criminal convictions that it alleges? -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 08:38, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm saying that the programme emphasized facts like that in a biased manner. Many people in the UK (20% of the working population) have criminal convictions. Many people in the labour/tory/lib dem/ etc/ parties have criminal convictions. Conversely, many officials in the BNP <i>do not</i> have convictions of any kind. If information like that is over-emphasized with any sense of perspective then it gives a misleading impression and is biased. Many people observed this about the panorama progamme. It's motive was not " <i>let's give an accurate and informative picture of the BNP</i>", but "<i>let's do all we can to emphasize the bad aspects of the BNP in order to give an overall misleading picture that they are the worst thing since the black death</i>". Panorama also gave much importance to such highly biased and unreliable sources as the ANL/SWP and Searchlight.</dd>
<dd>If you want to include all BNP official's previous criminal convictions then go ahead - but I expect <b>no complaints</b> from you, let alone reverts, if I do the same for "searchlight magazine/educational trust"...</dd>

</dl>
<p>I note that you are not claiming that the Panorama allegations are untrue. I also note your point that a substantial minority of the population have minor criminal convictions. Minor crimes are in general defined as crimes not considered so serious that they result in prison sentences. The <i>Panorama</i> listing alleges a variety of serious offences which resulted in imprisonment or suspended sentences. I very much doubt that you could show a comparable level of offending in the leadership of the mainstream Labour / Lib Dem / Conservative parties.</p>
<p>Please feel free to list alleged convictions on both sides: don't forget to cite references, of course. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 10:35, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not qualified to dispute the truth or validity of the allegations in question; I shall asume, however, that they are based on some semblance of factual acuracy, and give the highly biased programme makers the benefit of the doubt on the grounds of factual accuracy alone (against my better judgement, in the most part). However, I am qualified, as a person equipped with reason and independent thought, to dispute the manner in which these allegations have been selectively laid out and emphasized, and it is starkly clear that the objective of the programme was anything but objective!</dd>
<dd>I stated that a substantial minority of the population have criminal convictions; I did not use or imply the word "minor", and furthermore what consitutes a "minor" crime is not set in stone, as far as I am aware. "Spin", as always, can construe crimes as being more or less serious than an objective and neutral commentator would tend to believe. If you wish to change my statement of the presence of criminal convictions in a large percentage of the population to the presence of <i>minor</i> convictions, then please provide evidence to support this, and define a <i>minor offence</i>.</dd>
<dd>regarding your last comment&#160;: "<i>I very much doubt that you could show a comparable level of offending in the leadership of the mainstream Labour / Lib Dem / Conservative parties</i>" - this has potential for being a specious comparison. The three "mainstream" parties are far larger organisations than the BNP, and thus their "leadership" will be at a far higher level. Comparisons of "the leadership" is rather akin to comparing "the senior management" of your local butcher's shop to "the senior management" of a huge multinational corporation employing thousands of workers. At the moment the BNP has only local councillors, so for a fair comparison we should look for "serious" criminal convictions in councillors and local activists of the three major parties.</dd>
<dd>There is certainly no shortage of such convictions! Serious fraud, rape, paedophillia, theft... I could certainly find a not inconsiderable number of cases of such serious (more serious than those alleged of BNP officials)convictions amongost councillors and activists of the main parties, particularly libdem and labour. However, they would not be relevant in this article, unless mentioned simply to restore NPOV for "BNP convictions". Of course, the "mainstream" parties, being much bigger organisations, can afford to be more selective in their respective leaderships to exclude people who would attract unwated publicity/notoriety for these reasons. This is simply because they have at their disposal much more money, and hence a far larger pool of people from whom to choose the "cleanest"; the BNP does not. This, coupled with the fact that all convictions mentioned took place a rather long time ago - certainly during Tyndall's reign - and many even before membership of the party (unlike many Libdem child molestors who haven't even been expelled from their party for it!), leads me to suggest that mention of such convictions is at best completely irrelevant, and at worse highly opinionated, biased, and divisive. And I haven't even begun to mention "Searchlight Criminal Trust", upon which the anti-BNP leftie lynch-mob so consistently relies...</dd>
