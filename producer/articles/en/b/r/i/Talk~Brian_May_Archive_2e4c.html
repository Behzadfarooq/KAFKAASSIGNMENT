<p>I'm not sure if one would consider him a virtuoso of guitar. Hes fantastic, true, but I'm not sure if virtuoso is the right title.</p>
<p>I agree. Virtuoso i ssubjective and too strong a term to be associated with this artist. Popularity and good musicianship does not, by any means, trascend one to virtuoso status. Lynnarmstrong 02:42, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Question - is it customary to use the "Dr." title with people who have been awarded honorary doctorates?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps not customary usage, but when he appeared on The Sky at Night in August 2005, the caption read "Dr" <a href="../../../i/s/i/User%7EIsidore_619b.html" title="User:Isidore">Isidore</a> 16:42, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you have a doctorate (known as a PhD) in any subject, you may rightfully be called "Doctor". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheImpossibleMan_b47f.html" title="User:TheImpossibleMan">TheImpossibleMan</a> 05:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The title "Doctor" and the postnym letters "Ph.D." apply only to <i>earned</i> doctorates. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFront243_c63f.html" title="User:Front243">Front243</a> 14:24, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are two levels of doctorate in UK academia. The first level consists of the PhD (or DPhil at Oxford and Sussex, and formerly at York), and also the newer `vocational doctorates' like EdD, EngD and DClinPsych. These require about 3-4 years full-time study and research training, and the submission of a thesis containing a `substantial original contribution to knowledge' which is, in principle, publishable in a peer-refereed context (either as a book or in a journal).</p>
<p>The second level consists of the `higher doctorates' - DSc, DLitt, DMus, DD, etc. These are often, erroneously, believed to be purely honorary awards (in the USA they are only ever honorary). In the UK, though, while they are often awarded <i>honoris causa</i>, it is possible to <i>earn</i> one - almost always by submission of published work representing a `very substantial original contribution to knowledge'.</p>
<p>There are also many cases where someone who is eminently capable of obtaining an earned higher doctorate has been awarded an honorary one - a few years ago my university gave an honorary DSc to <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Wiles_2324.html" title="Andrew Wiles">Andrew Wiles</a>, for example. Were he to formally submit his proof of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_f4b0.html" title="Fermat's Last Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> for consideration, there isn't a university on the planet that wouldn't award him a substantive DSc forthwith.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether your doctorate is honorary or substantive (earned), you are entitled to call yourself `Dr'. It is, however, generally regarded as slightly bad form to do so unless your doctorate is substantive (although this has never stopped <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">Ian Paisley</a>), or if you're a qualified physician (the standard UK medical degree is the double-baccalaureate MB BS or MB ChB, which, while not being a doctorate, for historical reasons accords the holder the courtesy title of `Dr').</p>
<p>Brian May has a DSc, and may thus style himself `Dr Brian May' - the fact that it's an honorary one <i>doesn't</i> change that. Now, as I understand it, he never quite finished his PhD - he did all the research, and either never submitted his thesis, or didn't complete whatever corrections the examiners required. However, as I understand it, he does have two peer-refereed journal articles to his credit, so it seems reasonable to assume that he would have got the PhD had international megastardom not intervened. So although it would ordinarily be slightly bad form to call himself Dr, I think it's fair to say that he possesses the requisite level of technical knowledge in his chosen field, so I think the usual etiquette probably doesn't apply in this case. (For what it's worth, speaking as someone who did finish his PhD, I have no problem with Brian May calling himself Dr.) --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholas_Jackson_5378.html" title="User:Nicholas Jackson">Nicholas Jackson</a> 00:50, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On a related matter, not even those doctors who have earned their degrees use "DSc" (or PhD or whatever) after their names except for relevant contexts such as within a university. He's <b>Brian May CBE</b>, not <b>Brian May DSc CBE</b>. I'm removing DSc. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 09:02, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to restructure this page a bit, but lack ideas. I've done a couple of little tweaks, but it needs some kind of overall structure. Something along the lines of intro, history, performing (broken into guitar, singing, other?), songwriting, personal, these days? Or should the whole thing be presented as a history? All ideas very welcome. The structure as it is, with a section on 'Gear' doesn't make much sense. The content I agree with, but not the structure... --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevage_75d6.html" title="User:Stevage">Stevage</a> 20:37, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Didn't he get knighted recently? Could someone verify and amend the article?</p>

<p>I personally think he deserves a knighthood. He has done probably more than some Rock Stars who already have them. I am holding a petition for him to be knighted: www.petitiononline.com/bmaykbe XRockxKittenx 21:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)XRockxKittenx</p>

<p>One thing the article doesn't say is what a nice bloke he is.</p>
<p>At a club was working in the late 80s, none of the other staff had turned up to work for a party.</p>
<p>When they saw how overstretched and stressed I was getting, he and Anita rolled up their sleeves and pitched in, taking orders, delivering drinks to customers, collecting empties etc.</p>
