<p>This is only partly true because part of the Hudson's Bay watershed which was the original definition of Rupert's Land became territory of the United States before Rupert's Land became the Northwest Territories. I am not sure how to write this in the article. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:01 Apr 15, 2003 (UTC)</p>

This needs a mention of John Cabot who sailed to Newfoundland in the 15th C (from Bristol?) GH</p>
<dl>
<dd>This page is about the colonization of the Americas, not the discovery. The colonization of Newfoundland began more than 110 years after Cabot visited, if he made it there and not Maine, or Nova Scotia or&#160;?? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 12:34, Oct 10, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The colonization of newfoundland was made by the vikings at some 1000ad.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, for that see <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking_colonization_of_the_Americas_e858.html" title="Viking colonization of the Americas">Viking colonization of the Americas</a> part of this series of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_colonization_of_the_Americas_2457.html" title="European colonization of the Americas">European colonization of the Americas</a> articles. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:40, Dec 8, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article as it now stands, seems to be a glorified laundry list of British colonies in the Americas, with little historical perspective, discussion of reasons, government policy, or overviews. Is there more coming? --219.101.137.3 04:24, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just moved Bermuda from the Caribbean heading (which is geographically inaccurate; the islands are in the North Atlantic) to the North American section. I also added the Falkland Islands to the South American section; they are close enough to Argentina to justify that categorization.</p>

<p>This article exists and so does a scotish colonization of the americas one- yet Scots are British. Shouldn't there be a English one too or the Scotish one rolled into this one?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, because the Darrien Scheme occured before the Act of Union - so Scotland was still Scotland at the time. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 17:19, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Better yet, there should be three articles: English, Scottish, and British. Categorising the English settlements as being a British accomplishment is incorrect. Equally incorrect would be the categorisation of the British colonisation process after 1707 as being merely an continuation of the previous (English) gains, as would be inferred from the article's course. Many soldiers, colonists, and generals were Scottish, Irish or Scots Irish. A list won't suffice or do justice to all those that served as privates or civilians, so I'll quote the old Canadian national anthem: On Merry England's Far Famed Land / May Kind heaven Sweetly Smile, / God Bless Old Scotland Evermore / and Ireland's Emr'ld Isle! <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 17:27, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is related to American history, and that is a significant portion of the article, but the article also deals with equally with Canada, Newfoundland, the Caribbean, and South America. The unifying factor is the British involvement, not the American. Standardisation is really irrelevant to Wikipedia, since anyone can type in whatever their spelling is, and be redirected. The only relevant standard that I know of is, "Articles that focus on a topic specific to a particular English-speaking country should generally conform to the spelling of that country.

<dd>Another principle is deference to the original author's spelling. Inasmuch as the article is NOT specific to a single country, there's no compelling reason to move. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:18, July 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Looks to me as though it is about <s>Britain AND</s> all of its various colonies and former colonies the new world. Actually, I just took another look at it and there is nothing in it at all about "Britain" proper. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 15:24, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>British colonisation of the Americas not only includes the US but also Canada – who prefer the "<i>-ize</i>" suffix – and is an integral part of both those nations' histories. Also a side note, according to stats: about 30 - 40 pc of Britons prefer -ize over -ise. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">T</a></small>) <small>02:27, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</small>
<dl>
<dd>Peregrine981's attempt to turn it into a world vs. United States issue falls on its face when the standard spelling in Canada including Newfoundland is -ize. I have no information on what Belise uses--oops, make that <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belize.html" title="Belize">Belize</a> (no, I'm not claiming that spelling is relevant to this argument, just pointing out a coincidence). Furthermore, there is that little bit about -ize being the Oxford Guide to Style spelling and used by a significant number of Britons. We also have the claim by Septentrionalis below that the -ise spelling came after this colonization was done. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 09:17, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a fallacious argument. The OED lists the word under -ize (which it has always preferred, on straight etymological grounds: "But the suffix itself, whatever the element to which it is added, is in its origin the Gr. ιζειν , L. -izāre; and, as the pronunciation is also with z, there is no reason why in English the special French spelling should be followed, in opposition to that which is at once etymological and phonetic." It is not a national mark. The OED's earliest quotations are <i>The farther occupation and colonizing of those countries.</i> from <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bacon_d51b.html" title="Francis Bacon">Bacon</a> and <i>Our growth by colonization, and by conquest.</i> from <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Burke_4d22.html" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</a>. <b>Colonise</b> is a late eighteenth-century innovation, not used by the subjects of this article. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:13, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The argument is not whether or not British spelling should adopt the -ize suffix. As things stand, the British standard is to use -ise. Linguistic developments from as far back as the late 18th century are pretty well established by this point. Entire written languages have been standarised in the time since then. Any rate, all of that is a different discussion.</dd>

<p>The reasons for removing St. John's Newfoundland as a British colony are not valid. A colony is defined as <i>"a territory under the immediate political control of a geographically-distant state"</i>. The definition of a colony defines no limit on the amount of people or buildings located in the colony. Early English colonies were granted only by Royal Charter of the reigning English Monarch.</p>

<p>Yes Gilbert recieved a paper of paper, that piece of paper was the Royal Charter, issued by Queen Elizabeth I of England, claiming Newfoundland as a colony of England. Gilbert never established a 'plantation' because his ship was sunk on the return voyage. Still, according to the definition of a colony, Newfoudland was a colony. Colonies dont need people, read the definition of a colony.

<dd>Claiming a piece of land for England and having the right to start a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony.html" title="Colony">colony</a> is not the same as actually starting one.

<p>According to the Wikipedia article, a colony is <i>"a territory under the immediate political control of a geographically-distant state"</i> and according to the Oxford dictionary a colony is <i>"A region politically controlled by a distant country; a dependency. "</i>. English colonies were only established by issue of the English crown under Royal perogative, hence <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cabot_6901.html" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Frobisher_648d.html" title="Martin Frobisher">Martin Frobisher</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Davis_b1db.html" title="John Davis">John Davis</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Hudson_bf98.html" title="Henry Hudson">Henry Hudson</a> did not recieve a Royal Charter to establish a colony. According to the definition of a colony, colonies dont need to transport any inhabitants or build any building, engage in any trade, etc. Humphrey Gilbert was under Royal perogative to claim Newfoundland as Enlgand's first colony in 1583, whether or not people settled or built buildings is irrelevant, as a colony doesn't need either according to its definition. I think you are confusing colony with plantation. <a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmurphy_8372.html" title="User:Jcmurphy">Jcmurphy</a> 15:06, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe that you are confusing territory with colony.

<p>Read both sides to this argument, and have to agree that the current edit should be appropriate. Based on the definition of a colony (in Wiktionary), there is no need for a colony to have settlers or a settlement. It is only a piece of land governed by a foreign power. As such it seems to be that St. John's, Newfoundland was the first colony in 1583, although not settled until the 1620's. Dbalderzak 04:15, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Under that reasoning then it would have to be in 1497 when <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cabot_6901.html" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a> sailing under letters patent from the king set foot somewhere in Newfoundland, possibly even St. John's and claimed it in the name of the king. But that is not consistant with the meaning of colony which always includes a population. We do not talk about a colony of seabirds where there are no birds or a colony of Englishmen where there are no people. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 14:49, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The meaning of a colony doesn't include a population. See the definition of a colony in Wiktionary and Wikipedia. As noted above a colony is a region politically controlled by a distant country. Dbalderzak 14:58, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I mean no disrespect to the folks who maintain Wiktionary, but I think it may be a little disingenuous to Wiktionary (or the Wikipedia colony article) as the sole justification for maintain that colony does not include population. A quick check of definitions in other dictionaries ALL either explicitly or implicitly describe a colony as a populated area.</dd>

<dd>And so on. Point is that merely laying claim to a territory (or even being granted a charter by some faraway sovereign who otherwise had no authority to give grants over the territory) doesn't establish a colony per se. Control of an area implies a permanent (or at least periodic) presence of persons. Even the etymology of the term (from L. <i>colonia</i> "settled land, farm, landed estate" in turn from <i>colere</i> "to inhabit, cultivate, frequent, practice, tend, guard, respect") implies settlement, rather than simply making a nominal claim to an area. At best, Humphrey Gilbert merits a note of having the first charter to establish a colony, an objective which he did not accomplish. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 16:13, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you Bkonrad for proving my point. As you have noted above in <i>The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2.</i> and <i>WordNet ® 2.0, © 2003 Princeton University, 4.</i> a colony can have settlers but doesn't specifically require settlers to be a colony. Dbalderzak 16:23, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, sorry, but I don't see that. Any "control" by a faraway power fairly implies the presence, either permanent or at least periodically, of persons. Where there are no persons present to exercise ongoning control over an area, there is no colony. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 16:28, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dictionary definitions dont imply anything. As the dictionary states, <i>a colony is under political control of a foreign government</i>. There is no connotation that people have to be present. If it requires only a periodical presence then what time frame qualifies as periodic? Such implications are not stated in the definition of a colony, and thus are meaningless. Dbalderzak 17:13, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In order to have any significance, political control entails a body politic, or people. There absolutely is a connotation that people are necessary. Without people exercising practical control over an area, there is only a paper claim. My use of periodic was merely a shorthand for intermitent with a frequency sufficient to enforce control. Such implications are most certainly present in the definitions. A claim of control over an area without any actual enforcement of such claim does not make a colony. Again, look at the etymology of the term. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:30, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you saying that to be a colony, that a land doesnt require permanent settlers, just a periodic presence of a person exhibiting political control?? Dbalderzak 17:34, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The presence of people is necessary, but colonization can follow a couple of courses. In one case a colonizing power may exercise control over a foreign populace without necessarily having any permanent settlers from the parent power. In a second case, the colonizing power sends permanent settlers to colonize an area. But in both cases a population needs to be present in the colony over which the colonizing powers exercises political control. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:47, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then according to the first case you have listed St. Johns' would be a colony. Even thought it didnt have permanent settlers in 1583, seasonal cod fishermen had frequented Newfoundland since 1497. Gilbert's political claim to Newfoundland was exerted by the Fishing Admirals of England's West Country which had excluded all other nations from the east coast of Newfoundland by 1620. Dbalderzak 18:04, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I don't think so. I phrased the first case poorly. The "foreign populace" over which the colonizing power exercises political control is residential, not transient. I.e., the populace is foreign to the colonizing power, but it is native (or at least resident) to the colonized area. Domination of the fishing waters does make a stronger case for British control over the area, but a colony without settlement is meaningless, and runs directly countrary nearly all common definition of the word as well as its etymological origins. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 18:49, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we can come to a compromise. St. John's Newfoundland was the first English colony but Jamestown was the first English settlement. In 1578, Queen Elizabeth gave a patent to Sir Humphrey Gilbert to <i>"inhabit and possess at his choice all remote and heathen lands not in the actual possession of any Christian prince."</i> John Cabot only had the power to explore lands, he never had the authority to claim lands for England. King Henry VII of England gave Cabot a grant <i>"full and free authoritie, leave, and power, to sayle to all partes, countreys, and seas, of the East, of the West, and of the North, under our banners and ensignes, with five ships ... and as many mariners or men as they will have in saide ships, upon their own proper costes and charges, to seeke out, discover, and finde, whatsoever iles, countreyes, regions or provinces of the heathen and infidelles, whatsoever they bee, and in what part of the world soever they be, whiche before this time have beene unknowen to all Christians."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Gilbert's shipwreck prevented his exhibiting control over Newfoundland. Since the early 1500's, English fishermen under the political power of the Fishing Admiral returned each summer to Newfoundland and by 1620 they excluded other nations from the east coast of Newfoundland. <a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmurphy_8372.html" title="User:Jcmurphy">Jcmurphy</a> 18:16, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is selective quoting as Cabot's letter patent continue on and say: "And'that the aforesayd Iohn and his sonnes, or their heires and assignee may subdue, occupy and possesse all such townes, cities, castles and isles of them found, which they can subdue, occupy and possesse, as our vassals, and lieutenants, getting vnto vs the rule, title, and jurisdiction of the same villages, townes, castles, &amp; firme land so found."

<dd>I think the most that can be said of Gilbert in Newfoundland is that it was a failed attempt to establish a colony. He made a claim and nothing much ever came of it except a lot of hooing and hawing about who was first. But to be honest, I don't object to the current phrasing in this article: <i>St. John's, Newfoundland claimed for England by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1583; settled unsuccessfully in 1610; informal settlements by 1627.</i> <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 18:49, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree fully. It's just that several published reference books state that Gilbert was the first to colonize North America. Perhaps, this is not the correct place to argue for that one way or the other. I just felt that there should be some reference to Gilbert in this article. The current phrasing is fine. <a href="../../../j/c/m/User%7EJcmurphy_8372.html" title="User:Jcmurphy">Jcmurphy</a> 21:58, 1 October 2005 (UTC) If you think the Native Amercans had it bad, think about the slaves later brought in to replace the Natives.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I disagree with splitting the page. There is no good reason to discuss the same people colonizing the same places in two different articles merely because the name of their mother country changed. Few of the colonies were started after the name change, there is no reason to believe that any of the control, or ownership of the colonies was altered by the name change, and the new article would have to go through and re-discusse all the continuing colonies that had already been started before the name change. A needless duplication of effort. Better to leave this as British and discuss all the colonies in one place. If anything, find a way to add a mention of the one Scottish post-merger colony here. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 01:45, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, it wasn't a name change; the Act of Union ended England and Scotland, and created a different country.</dd>
<dd>Second, most British colonies were started after 1707: Nova Scotia (including modern NB and PE), Georgia (including AL and MS), Turks and Caicos, Dominica, Florida, Grenada, Québec (including ON), Saint Vincent, Tobago, West Florida, Trinidad, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Falkland Islands, Vancouver Island, British Columbia.</dd>
<dd>Third, there was no 'Scottish post-merger colony', since Scotland ceased to be a state after 1707. So, for that matter, did England. Thus, to treat the United Kingdom as if it is the same as England is ridiculous. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 14:29, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One or two anonymous user/s has added a book source and a date of 1605 for informal settlement. I do not have access to that book and perhaps because he/she has a dynamic IP, they did not get the message I left them. I asked for clarification of what exact claim the book makes and note that it is not written by a trained/professional historian. I also note that I can find no online claim for this early date. For instance the The Early Settlement of St. John's, by Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Site Project hosted at Memorial University of Newfoundland can be expected to be a good source and does not make this claim. In fact they state: "There is one record, in an early Cornish account book, of what sounds like an over-wintering caretaker in Conception Bay in 1609 (a year before John Guy's colony at Cupids). It is sometimes claimed that English fishing ships regularly left winter crews behind at this time, but there is no other evidence for this. In fact, the suggestion seems unlikely." <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 13:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this page and hoped to find more information about why the British began to colonize in the first place, information on what kinds of people emigrated, information on enclosure in England creating landless poor, the English Civil War, and so on. But the article is more than half lists. The text is very wide focus and terse.</p>
<p>There seems to be much more information on the how and why of colonization at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_America_9dc8.html" title="Colonial America">Colonial America</a>, but unfortunately that article is only about the region that began the United States (although it is not restricted to British colonization, even if it overfocuses on the British).</p>
<p>So many wikipedia articles are little more than lists. Even the text of this article reads like a list of facts. I'd love to see more about why and how the British began colonizing, why they colonized the places they did. What kind of people emigrated and why. Rivalry between London and Bristol? There is a sentence or two in this article about the effect of the American Revolution on the British colonial system, but what about the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>? Why were so many British people willing to emigrate? Etc. ..in short, lists of facts are useful in a dictionary-type way, but not very explanatory. <a href="../../../p/f/l/User%7EPfly_f5cb.html" title="User:Pfly">Pfly</a> 14:44, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surely colonies founded before the Act of Union should be described in a seperate article about English colonisation? The Scots and Welsh have their own info pages, why doesn't England? <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenzar_6809.html" title="User:Lenzar">Lenzar</a> 14:40, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article either does not give any actual reasons for the colonization, or it is just very good at keeping it hidden. I do no know the reasons, but someone does and should to a bit to clarify. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.34.0.92_571d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.34.0.92">71.34.0.92</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.34.0.92.html" title="User talk:71.34.0.92">talk</a>) 04:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
