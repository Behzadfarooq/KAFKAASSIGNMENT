<p>Lenihan's last period as Minister for Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by his serious ill-health. A long-standing liver problem had developed into a life-threatening issue requiring a liver transplant.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> In May 1989 Lenihan underwent the liver transplant in the <i>Mayo Clinic</i> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.

<p>In January <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> leaks to the media suggested that Brian Lenihan was considering seeking the Fianna Fáil nomination to become the party candidate for the Irish presidential election, which was due in November of that year.

<p>Lenihan was generally perceived<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> as unbeatable for the presidency, though he did receive a late challenge for the nomination from cabinet colleague <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wilson_%28Irish_politician%29_b991.html" title="John Wilson (Irish politician)">John Wilson</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> However, in September 1990 Lenihan was formally nominated as his party's candidate. The main opposition party, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine_Gael_b9bc.html" title="Fine Gael">Fine Gael</a> chose new Fine Gael TD and former <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party_cec0.html" title="Social Democratic and Labour Party">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> cabinet minister in Northern Ireland, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Currie_98c0.html" title="Austin Currie">Austin Currie</a>, to be its candidate.</p>
<p>Lenihan however had one serious flaw. Though regarded by those who knew him personally as an intellectual heavyweight he had masked his ability behind an image of a lightweight, semi-comic politician, the "clown prince" of Irish politics, in the words of longtime friend, journalist John Healy. He was once described by <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine_Gael_b9bc.html" title="Fine Gael">Fine Gael</a> politician and former <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a>, John Kelly as<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <i>like a lighthouse in the Bog of Allen, brilliant but useless</i>. During leadership heaves against Haughey in the 1980s Lenihan had regularly appeared on <a href="../../../r/t/%C3%A9/RT%C3%89_e38d.html" title="RTÉ">RTÉ</a> television to insist that Fianna Fáil was <i>not</i> divided, even as ministers were resigning from cabinet, and when Haughey supporters physically assaulted an opponent of Haughey's, ex-minister <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Gibbons_%28Irish_politician%29_f3f4.html" title="Jim Gibbons (Irish politician)">Jim Gibbons</a>, in the environs of <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster_House_1e9d.html" title="Leinster House">Leinster House</a>, the Republic's parliament building.</p>
<p>That image was augmented by a disastrous <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Late_Show_5411.html" title="Late Late Show">Late Late Show</a> TV special devoted to him and broadcast only weeks before the presidential campaign started, in which colleagues and friends of Lenihan projected an image of him as a political <i><a href="../../../c/u/t/Cute_hoor.html" title="Cute hoor">cute hoor</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> which describes someone who would do anything and pull any stunt that was required, including making any promises to the electorate without any intention of following them through.

<p>The issue of Lenihan's trustworthiness became the central issue of the second half of the presidential campaign, where a furore arose over his involvement on Haughey's behalf in 1982 to pressurise the President, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Hillery_3d20.html" title="Patrick Hillery">Patrick Hillery</a>, a former government colleague of Lenihan's, into refusing Taoiseach <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garret_FitzGerald_58c7.html" title="Garret FitzGerald">Garret FitzGerald</a> a parliamentary dissolution in January 1982. Had Hillery done so<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> FitzGerald would have had to resign, allowing Haughey to attempt to form a government. Allowing Haughey to form a government without calling a general election and giving him the freedom to choose the timing of a subsequent election would have protected Haughey from rumoured plans to depose him,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> as he would have been able to use his appointments powers to reward middle ground TDs who might otherwise have supported moves to topple him.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lenihan, over the eight years since the incident, had never denied that he had been one of the people making phonecalls to <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/a/%C3%81ras_an_Uachtar%C3%A1in_17b2.html" title="Áras an Uachtaráin">Áras an Uachtaráin</a><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> that night in January 1982.

In September 1990 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Irish_Times_e693.html" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a> carried a series of articles on the presidency, one of whom mentioned in passing the role of Lenihan, <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvester_Barret_c712.html" title="Sylvester Barret">Sylvester Barret</a> and Charles Haughey in making the controversial phonecalls to Áras an Uachtaráin, to pressurise the President.</p>
<p>In October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, Lenihan changed his story and, in an interview in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Press_d71a.html" title="Irish Press">Irish Press</a> newspaper and on <a href="../../../r/t/%C3%A9/RT%C3%89_e38d.html" title="RTÉ">RTÉ</a>'s <i><a href="../../../q/u/e/Questions_and_Answers_6490.html" title="Questions and Answers">Questions and Answers</a></i> political programme, insisted that he had played <i>no hand, act or part</i> in efforts to pressurise President Hillery. All his previous confirmations had been in <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism_sourcing.html" title="Journalism sourcing">off the record</a></i> briefings to journalists who could not reveal he was the source of their stories. However, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">17 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> Lenihan had confirmed his participation in one <i>on the record</i> interview with a post-graduate student and journalist, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Duffy_%28author%29_0fd1.html" title="Jim Duffy (author)">Jim Duffy</a>, who was researching the presidency of Ireland for a thesis and for a series of newspaper articles in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Irish_Times_e693.html" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a>. In the aftermath of Lenihan's TV denial, The Irish Times, which was aware that Lenihan <i>himself</i> was Duffy's source for the original article claim, with Duffy's agreement, published a newspaper story confirming that contrary to Lenihan's TV claim, he had made the controversial phone calls to the Áras in an attempt to pressurise President Hillery. When Lenihan's campaign manager, Bertie Ahern, on radio inexplicably named Duffy as someone who had interviewed Lenihan back in May, a political storm erupted in which the journalist was put under siege by the media and Fianna Fáil, leading to the reluctant decision after consulting with lawyers to release the portion of the tape in which Lenihan talked about the events of January 1982.</p>

<p>Lenihan's immediate reaction severely damaged his credibility. He appeared on a live news bulletin and looking to camera in a manner media commentators referred to as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Nixonesque</a> pleaded with the Irish people to believe him, arguing that <i>on mature recollection</i> he had not phoned President Hillery and his account to Duffy had been wrong. He then requested an <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audience_%28head_of_state%29.html" title="Audience (head of state)">audience</a> with President Hillery to seek his confirmation that he made no phone calls. In the end when no audience was granted his campaign manager, Bertie Ahern, decided to withdraw the request though in a sign of the chaos envelloping the campaign, Lenihan, not knowing of this decision, told RTÉ journalist Charlie Bird that the request was still there until the journalist played back his interview with Ahern, after which Lenihan recorded a new soundbite explaining why the request had been withdrawn.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> It was further revealed that one of the callers named under parliamentary privilege was Haughey, though he denied it. Haughey had threatened when he returned to power to end the career of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Army_0071.html" title="Irish Army">army</a> officer who took the calls and who on President Hillery's explicit instruction had refused to put any of them through to the President. Fergus Finlay, a senior aide to Labour leader Dick Spring, was telephoned by an anonymous source will details of the threat.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> According to Finlay, Haughey having told the Army Officer to <i>put me through to the President</i> and, on the basis of the President's earlier instructions being refused, told the army officer that he would be Taoiseach one day and <i>when I am, I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately.</i><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> It was stated that the President as Commander-in-Chief had expressly recorded details of the threat made against the army officer in the officer's file with an instruction that his career was not to be harmed in any way by the politician.</p>
<p>The opposition put down a motion of no-confidence in the government. The minority party in government, the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Democrats_3859.html" title="Progressive Democrats">Progressive Democrats</a>, told Haughey that unless Lenihan was either dismissed or an inquiry set up into the events of January 1982 it would resign from government, support the opposition motion and so force a general election on the issue. Though insisting that he would put no pressure on Brian Lenihan, "my friend of thirty years", in private, Haughey drew up a letter of resignation which he tried to get Lenihan to sign. Lenihan refused, and so Haughey formally instructed President Hillery to dismiss Lenihan from his cabinet post, as Tánaiste and as Minister for Defence, which Hillery, as was required constitutionally, duly did. Many in Fianna Fáil were disgusted with what they saw as Haughey's betrayal of his old friend.</p>

<p>Lenihan's dismissal led to an immediate collapse in popularity (from the mid 40% to 31% almost overnight) but then rallied. However, a subsequent personal attack by former cabinet colleague, <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padraig_Flynn_5795.html" title="Padraig Flynn">Padraig Flynn</a> on Mary Robinson, in which he accused her of showing a "new found interest" in her family, backfired and destroyed Lenihan's campaign.

While Lenihan did win more votes in the first count, most of the votes that went to Austin Currie (who came in third with 17%) transferred against Lenihan, going to Robinson.
