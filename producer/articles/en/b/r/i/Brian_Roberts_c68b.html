<p>He made his major league debut in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_baseball.html" title="2001 in baseball">2001</a> and played 75 games in Baltimore, batting .253. He also played for AAA <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester_Red_Wings_0f82.html" title="Rochester Red Wings">Rochester</a> and AA <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowie_Baysox_3c34.html" title="Bowie Baysox">Bowie</a> that year.<br /></p>
<p>In 2002 he played 38 games with the Orioles and batted .227. He stole 22 bases on 26 attempts. He also played 78 games with the Orioles AAA affiliate in Rochester.</p>
<p>In 2003 he started for AAA <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Lynx_89c3.html" title="Ottawa Lynx">Ottawa</a>, playing 44 games and hitting .315. In late May he was called up for injured second baseman <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Hairston%2C_Jr._337c.html" title="Jerry Hairston, Jr.">Jerry Hairston, Jr.</a> He hit his first major league <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_slam_%28baseball%29.html" title="Grand slam (baseball)">grand slam</a> in his second game (and his first in any sort of professional play), in the 9th inning against the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaheim_Angels_3751.html" title="Anaheim Angels">Anaheim Angels</a> to win that game. He finished with a .270 average in 112 games, stole 23 bases on 29 attempts (tied for eighth in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Roberts_c68b.html" title="Edit section: 2004">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2004</span></h4>
<p>The Orioles started <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_training.html" title="Spring training">spring training</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a> with both Hairston and Roberts on the roster. Hairston fractured his finger in the first game, however; and Roberts became the opening day starter. After Hairston returned from the disabled list, he was moved to right field, leaving Roberts at second base. Since this put their competition on hold Roberts became more confident and improved dramatically over the following months. In August he batted .347 with ten doubles in 107 at-bats. During the second week of August, Roberts was named the American League Player of the Week for hitting .531 over a span of six games. He finished 2004 with a .273 average, collecting 175 hits in 159 games. He also hit 50 doubles, which led the American League and was third-best in the majors. His 50 doubles also broke the Orioles single-season record for doubles(originally set by <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Ripken_2bb5.html" title="Cal Ripken">Cal Ripken</a>) and the single-season AL record for doubles by a switch hitters.</p>
<p><a name="2005"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Roberts_c68b.html" title="Edit section: 2005">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2005</span></h4>
<p>Prior to the 2005 season, Jerry Hairston Jr. was traded to the Chicago Cubs (along with Oriole prospects Mike Fontenot and David Crouthers) for <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Sosa_e94a.html" title="Sammy Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a>, thereby cementing Roberts' position as the Orioles' starting second baseman.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005</a>, Roberts rewarded Orioles management for their faith in him by beginning the season red-hot, leading the AL in batting average for the first several months of the season. In addition, he showed an incredible increase in power; prior to the 2005 season, he had only 12 career home runs, but by late June, he had already outmatched that total. Fans awarded Roberts explosive offensive first half by voting him the starting second baseman in the 2005 All-Star game. It was Roberts' first appearance in the All-Star game. As the season wore on Roberts slumped heavily and the Orioles were no longer as dominant.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Roberts dislocated his elbow in a game against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. The injury occurred in a collision with New York's <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubba_Crosby_3be6.html" title="Bubba Crosby">Bubba Crosby</a> at first base in the bottom of the second inning. The injury prevented Roberts from playing the rest of the season.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Roberts_c68b.html" title="Edit section: 2006">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006</span></h4>
<p>Roberts rebounded from his 2005 injury with a strong 2006 campaign. He played in 138 games scoring 85 runs with 55 RBI. He stole 36 bases in 43 attempts and finished the season with a .286 average, hitting seven home runs in the last two months of the season. He spent the beginning part of May on the 15-day DL.</p>
