<p>Laura Jesson, a country housewife, tells her story in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_person.html" title="First person">first person</a>. Bored with the security of her husband and family, Laura goes into town once a week for shopping and a matinée picture. On one of her weekly excursions, she accidentally meets Dr. Alec Harvey in the refreshment room of the railway station. Both are early middle-aged, married, and have two children each. The doctor is working in the area because he wants to study miners' diseases.</p>

<p>Enjoying one another's company, the couple continue to meet weekly for a cup of tea in the refreshment room of the station while they await their respective trains home. They are soon dismayed to find their innocent and casual relationship quickly developing into love. For a while, they continue to meet furtively in cafes and cinemas, constantly fearing chance meetings with friends. After several meetings, they go to a room belonging to a friend of the doctor's, but their meeting is interrupted by the friend's unexpected return. Realizing that a future together is impossible and wishing not to hurt their families, they agree to part. The doctor is to leave for Africa.</p>
<p>During their final meeting at the station, while they sit waiting for Alec's train, Dolly Messiter, a talkative friend of Laura's, joins them and is soon chattering away, totally oblivious to the couple's inner misery. As they realize that they have been robbed of the chance for a final goodbye, Alec's train arrives. With Dolly still chattering away, Alec departs with a last look at Laura. As the train is heard pulling away, Laura suddenly dashes out onto the platform. The lights of the passing train flash across her face as she conquers her impulse to commit suicide; she then returns home to her family.</p>

<p>The film is based on Coward's play <i>Still Life</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>), one of a group of ten short plays entitled <i><a href="../../../3/0/_/Tonight_at_8%7E30.html" title="Tonight at 8:30">Tonight at 8:30</a></i>, designed for <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertrude_Lawrence_46f4.html" title="Gertrude Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</a> and Coward himself to be performed in various combinations as triple bills. All scenes of <i>Still Life</i> are set in the refreshment room of a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_station.html" title="Train station">railway station</a> (the fictional Milford Junction).</p>
<p>As is normal in films based on stage plays, the film depicts places that are only talked about in the play: Dr. Lynn's <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartment.html" title="Apartment">flat</a>, Laura's home, a <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_theater.html" title="Movie theater">cinema</a>, a restaurant and a branch of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boots_the_Chemists_6f1f.html" title="Boots the Chemists">Boots the Chemists</a>. Additionally, a number of scenes have been added which are not mentioned in the play: a scene on a lake in a rowing boat where Dr. Harvey gets his feet wet; Laura wandering about alone in the dark, sitting down on a park bench and smoking in public; a drive in the country in a borrowed car.</p>
<p>Certain scenes are made less ambiguous and more dramatic in the film. The scene in which the two lovers are about to commit adultery is toned down: in the play it is left for the audience to decide whether they actually have sex or not, whereas in the film, Laura has only just arrived at Dr. Lynn's flat when its owner comes home, and is immediately led out by Dr. Harvey via the fire escape. Later, when Laura wants to throw herself in front of an express train, the film makes this intention clear by means of <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice-over.html" title="Voice-over">voice-over</a> narration.</p>
<p>Unlike the play, the film uses a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frame_story.html" title="Frame story">frame narrative</a>: the ending of the story is at the beginning of the movie, which is then repeated at the end. It also uses voice-over, with Laura addressing her husband, or rather Laura imagining addressing her husband in a dream-like state.</p>
<p>At present, there are two editions of Noel Coward's original screenplay for the film adaptation, both listed in the bibliography below.</p>

<p>Much of the film version was shot at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnforth_railway_station.html" title="Carnforth railway station">Carnforth railway station</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, then a junction on the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway_367a.html" title="London, Midland and Scottish Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>. As well as a busy station being necessary for the plot, it was located far enough from London to be brightly lit for film purposes, shooting taking place in early 1945 before the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">War</a> had finished. Noel Coward makes the station announcements in the film. The station buffet was a studio recreation. Carnforth Station still retains many of the period features present at the time of filming and remains a place of pilgrimage for fans of the film.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, some of the urban scenes were shot in London or at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaconsfield.html" title="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a> near <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denham_Film_Studios_f70c.html" title="Denham Film Studios">Denham Studios</a> where the film was made.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brief_Encounter_1240.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>In her book <i>Noël Coward</i> (1987), Frances Gray says that <i>Brief Encounter</i> is,</p>
<dl>
<dd>after the major comedies, the one work of Coward that almost everybody knows of and has probably seen; it has featured frequently on television and its viewing figures are invariably high. Its story is that of an unconsummated affair between two married people. [...]</dd>
<dd>Coward is keeping his lovers in check because he cannot handle the energies of a less inhibited love in a setting shorn of the wit and exotic flavour of his best comedies. [...] To look at the script, shorn of David Lean's beautiful camera work, deprived of an audience who would automatically approve of the final sacrifice, is to find oneself asking awkward questions. A disastrous attempt in 1975 to <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remake.html" title="Remake">remake</a> the film in a more up-to-date setting, with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Burton_49d2.html" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Loren_f82d.html" title="Sophia Loren">Sophia Loren</a> as Alec and Laura, made this plain. (pp.64-67).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Gray acknowledges a common criticism of the play: why don't the characters just go ahead and do it? Why do they feel guilty, watched and hunted all the time? They do not seem to be particularly religious, so what's the problem? Gray argues that their problem is <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_consciousness.html" title="Class consciousness">class consciousness</a>: the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working classes</a> can be and act vulgar, and the <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_class.html" title="Upper class">upper class</a> can be silly; but the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_class.html" title="Middle class">middle class</a> is or at least considers itself the moral backbone of society - a notion whose validity Coward did not really want to question or jeopardize (since they were Coward's principal audience).</p>
<p>However, Laura (from whose point of view the film is told) makes it clear that what holds her back is her horror at the thought of betraying her husband and her settled moral values, tempted although she is by the force of the love affair. Indeed, it is this very tension which has made the film such an enduring favourite and it rather misses the point to suggest that this is a weakness rather than its most important feature.</p>
<p>The values which Laura precariously, but ultimately successfully, clings to were widely shared and respected (if not always observed) at the time of the film's original setting (the status of a divorced woman, for example, remained sufficiently scandalous in the UK to cause the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">King</a> to abdicate in 1936). Updating the story left those values behind and with them vanished the credibility of the plot, which may be why the remake could not compete.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film is widely admired for the beauty of its black and white photography and the atmosphere created by the steam-age railway setting; both of which were particular to the original David Lean version.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film is working in the social and cultural context of the Second World War when 'brief encounters' were commonplace and women had far greater sexual and economic freedom than was normal. In <i>British National Cinema</i> (1997), Sarah Street argues that "Brief Encounter thus articulated a range of feelings about infidelity which invited easy identification, whether it involved one's husband, lover children or country" (p. 55). In this context, feminist critics read the film as an attempt at stabilising relationships to return to the status quo.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Meanwhile, in his 1993 BFI book on the film, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dyer_1a2e.html" title="Richard Dyer">Richard Dyer</a> notes that due to the rise of homosexual law reform, gay men also viewed the plight of the characters as comparable to their own social constraint in the formation and maintenance of relationships. Sean O'Connor considers the film to be an 'allegorical representation of forbidden love' informed by Noel Coward's experiences as a closeted homosexual (p. 157).</p>
<p>A made-for-TV version of <i>Brief Encounter</i>, starring <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Burton_49d2.html" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Loren_f82d.html" title="Sophia Loren">Sophia Loren</a>, was made in 1974.</p>
