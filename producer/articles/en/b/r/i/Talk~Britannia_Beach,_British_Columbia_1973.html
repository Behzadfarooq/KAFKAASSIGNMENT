<p>From the current article: <i>During the Great Depression, miners unionized in 1946 and suffered through their first strike. Low copper prices saw the Britannia Mine Company reduced to seven employees, and in 1959 it went into liquidation.</i></p>
<p>As far as I know, the Great Depression ended at the latest during WW2, so the 1946 date is incompatible. 1936 would make a lot more sense. Is this a simple typo?</p>

<p>In the history section, the first part talks about <b>HMS Britannia (III)</b> . According to the updated link, the ship <i>broke up</i> in 1825. It's not clear why <i>Captain Richards</i> decided on this name. Since the ship broke up before the name of (1859), how does it relate? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessemonroy650_0a9e.html" title="User:Jessemonroy650">meatclerk</a> 22:10, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A number of sources seem to independently confirm that Captain Richards named the mountains around 1859 after a ship called HMS Britannia, so I'm inclined to believe it. <a href="http://www.discovervancouver.com/gvb/place_names.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.discovervancouver.com/gvb/place_names.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.discovervancouver.com/gvb/place_names.asp</a> specifically says that the HMS Britannia in question "served in the Battle of St. Vincent (1797) and the Battle of Trafalgar (1805)", which correlates with the Wikipedia description of the third HMS Britannia, and <a href="http://srmwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=1103" class="external free" title="http://srmwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=1103" rel="nofollow">http://srmwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=1103</a> also identifies the ship as the third in the line. <a href="http://www.georgianindex.net/Navy/navylist.html" class="external free" title="http://www.georgianindex.net/Navy/navylist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgianindex.net/Navy/navylist.html</a> confirms that she was broken up in 1825. So, this all seems to check out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the article's wording "... by her commanding officer, Captain Richards..." sort of suggests (to me) that he was commanding officer <i>at the time of the naming</i>, which seems to be definitely untrue (in fact, his ship at the time was apparently "HMS Plumper"). I guess the possibility remains that he was the <i>former</i> commander of HMS Britannia III (as a young man). The dates seem a little tight, but if he had been, say, 30 at the time the ship was broken up in 1825, he would have been 64 in 1859, which is not totally infeasible. In fact, <a href="http://sea-to-sky.net/britanniabeach/history/index.html" class="external free" title="http://sea-to-sky.net/britanniabeach/history/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://sea-to-sky.net/britanniabeach/history/index.html</a> also says "Captain Richards ... names Britannia Mountain ... after <i>his</i> 100 gun frigate."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it can be confirmed that Richards was indeed commanding officer of HMS Britannia III earlier in his career then I would recommend changing the article to read "... by her former commanding officer, Captain Richards...".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to <i>why</i> he named the mountains after the ship, who knows. I guess he was surveying in the area, and probably naming various local features, and had to come up with something!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, with a bit more digging, I think that this Richards character is actually <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Henry_Richards_ebf0.html" title="George Henry Richards">George Henry Richards</a>, born 1820. So it appears he could not possibly have been commanding officer of HMS Britannia III. I think I will change the article to reflect this. Matt 11:13, 30 July 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Okay, I've removed the tag. It's now clear and the article looks fairly clear. I'm adding a verify and citations tag to it. That should be the final step... <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessemonroy650_0a9e.html" title="User:Jessemonroy650">meatclerk</a> 02:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Province of British Columbia in the Year 2000 negotiated (behind closed doors) an agreement with the remnant companies of the original mine owners in which a total of 30 million dollars was paid to a Remediation Fund in exchange for full indemnity. The government through its Ministry of Water, Land, and Air Protection began a major study to use this Fund to design the best way to clean up the site. The University of British Columbia at the same time partnered with the original mine owner, Copper Beach Estates Limited to install a research laboratory at the 2200 Level of the mine that would allow UBC to design earth plugs to seal mine adits for extremely long periods of time. This facility was installed in December 2001 and had the "spin-off" benefit of eliminating all pollution flows into Jane Creek and Britannia Creek and hence, into the surface waters of Howe Sound. The low-pH effluent previously emitted from the 2200 level was diverted back into the mine workings to eventually find its way down to the 4100 Level (about 400 ft. above sea level) where all effluent now leaves the mine through a single controlled point-source.</p>
<p>This effluent is now being treated in a High-Density Sludge Treatment Plant that finally began operation in November 2005 following the establishment of a Private-Public Partnership (P3) arrangement with the province and Epcor Limited - a water treatment company head-quartered in Edmonton, Alberta. Since the start-up of this plant, all pollution from the mine site is now under control and Howe Sound is likely cleaner than it ever has been. Copper pollution has been emitted from this site throughout the 20th Century prior to the start-up of the mine through the contact of run-off water at the top of Britiannia Mountain with orebody outcrops; during the operation of the mine in which controlled effluent discharge from the mine was used to generate power and recover copper copper in cementation launders located at Mount Sheer townsite and at the Britannia Beach fan area; and since the closure of the mine in which effluent at about 25-40 ppm Cu and 25 ppm Zn flowed directly into HoweSound for over 25 years.</p>
<p>Britannia Beach has been converted from a derelict mine site into a sustainable community. New real-estate development is taking place in the town and the commercial area is planned to be expanded into a tourist village with boutiques and shops on a mining theme. The BC Museum of Mining has recently completed the up-grading of the old Mill No.3 building which is protected by Heritage-Canada. All of the windows (~1200) have been replaced and new metal cladding material has been applied to the exterior walls and roof. The Museum stands as a testament to the ingenuity of Canadian pioneers who opened up British Columbia in the 1800s to become a province in 1874 based on the exploitation of its gold and other mineral wealth. A visit to the Museum is a great way to become familiar with the incredible history that is Britannia Beach and Britannia Mine. The changes that have taken place in the mining industry with respect to environmental protection and community sustainability are clearly enunciated throughout the Museum exhibits and activities which includes an underground mine train ride (not to be missed).</p>

<p>I believe was caused, at least in part by a blasting incident at the Park Lane Lake Dam. I source that to an excellent film called Britannia Beach: A tragi-comedy of geological proportions, as well as other research over the past 3 years. Just gotta coordinate it etc and put it up. Also, for WikiBC purposed, rated this Start/Mid-importance, although it is mighty close to 'high' IMO.--<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeefer4_a544.html" title="User:Keefer4">Keefer4</a> 07:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
