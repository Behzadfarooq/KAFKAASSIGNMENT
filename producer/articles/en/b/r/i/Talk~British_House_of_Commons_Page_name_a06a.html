<p>I fundamentally disagree. We have a problem with wiki's Americocentrism. Presuming that if people say House of Commons they <i>of course</i> mean the UK House of Commons is going to add a degree of anglocentrism that we should equally apply. Other countries also call their lower chambers the House of Commons and are <i>just</i> as entitled to. Equally some countries have former lower houses that were called House of Commons. I think the standard should be [[{country} House of Commons]] allowing Canadian, Irish, British etc to be used, with House of Commons as a disambigulation page. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 23:04 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mintguy, there's a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_Ontario_4fcb.html" title="Paris, Ontario">Paris, Ontario</a>.

<dd>I agree, but "House of Commons" is <i>not</i> almost universally understood to mean the British one. Nobody outside the UK says "House of Commons" if they mean the British one.

<p>Also: outside the UK people <i>do not say</i> the House of Commons when referring to the UK HofC. They say <i>British</i> House of Commons. That is how the French, German, Italian, Canadian, Irish and US media always refer to it. Simply adding in the relevant name as in British House of Commons, Irish House of Commons, Canadian House of Commons is by far the best option. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 23:22 Apr 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand Mintguy's argument but I think it is misplaced and I agree with Montrealais's changes. And in particular I think <i>British</i> House of Commons is preferable to the House of Commons <i>of the United Kingdom</i>, given that the first form is the one generally used, whereas the second isn't. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 17:39 Apr 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>That is my last word on the subject, my protest has been registered, I've had enough of arguments of this kind dragging on. I've already lost faith in Wikipedia over naming conventions <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<p>FWIW I think <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Commons_%28UK%29_9608.html" title="House of Commons (UK)">House of Commons (UK)</a> is better than <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>, because it's much easier to modify existing references with the pipe trick. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<p>That is a format used by 0% of people, Mint. And how do you suppose we deal with others House of Commons articles. [[House of Commons (Irl)]], [[House of Commons (Can)]]. <i>No</i>one uses those. We are supposed to use the most common easily recognisable format. That is <i>British</i> House of Commons, the terminology used worldwide outside the UK. And how exactly is it easier to modify using the 'pipe trick'? The format Montrealais used here is 100% correct, 100% recognisable, 100% usable and 100% accurate. No other alternative is. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 00:09 Apr 26, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just thought of another problem with House of Commons (UK). The United Kingdom became the formal name of the state when Great Britain and Ireland merged in 1801. So using (UK) could in terms of accuracy only refer to the House of Commons from 1801 on. Britain dates back to 1707, though James VI/I first coined the term in a rather confusing manner in October 1604. No-one word is 100% accurate (so that's a slight change from what I said above.) England cannot cover after 1707 when Scottish MPs went to Westminster and UK covers when Irish MPs joined them in 1801. <i>British</i> at least covers two of the three general names of the state which sent MPs to Westminster, so while it isn't 100% accurate, it <i>is</i> the most accurate version on offer and covers just about all of the period of parliamentary supremacy over the monarchy, which many date to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. So that offers another nail in the coffin of the HofC (UK) option. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 00:20 Apr 26, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some further statistics in the same vein. (Figures are rough, I couldn't motivate myself to count exactly). 200-250 pages link to British House of Commons, 80 pages link to Canadian House of Commons, 12 pages link to Irish House of Commons. Rough average of Google News stats,Mintguy's statistics and these statistics is that Britain mentions outweigh Canada mentions about 4 to 1, with Ireland nowhere. I can't decide whether this is sufficient to warrant 'promoting' Britain to the HoC slot - if it does there is a lot of work changing nearly 250 links to be done. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 15:01, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

re <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons_2c38.html" title="United Kingdom House of Commons">United Kingdom House of Commons</a> - that was debated some time ago and the agreement was to use <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Lords_ffa6.html" title="British House of Lords">British House of Lords</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Prime_Minister_265e.html" title="British Prime Minister">British Prime Minister</a>, etc., not <i>United Kingdom</i>. (I didn't take sides if I remember correctly) The reason was the 'most common name' wikipedia policy. UK HoC is simply never ever used. If HoC is qualified, it always is with British. Ditto with PM. Anytime anyone decided to change them, it usually led to a revertion war from those who were passionate about the <i>British</i>. And in retrospect I think they were right. UK HoC looks alkward and is not used. BHoC is. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 23:47, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting, I wasn't aware of that - I will stop fixing the links for a bit until we can clarify this - I am surpised that an encyclopedia would go with the 'most common name' rather than the correct one - are there other instances of this? I don't think <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> should be listed as America simply because that is the most common name for it, or <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> listed as <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> just because a lot of people think that's what it's called - do you?<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 23:51, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The most common name rule is the basic rule of wikipedia. You didn't know that? Oops. It is Rule Number 1 of wikipedia. Only where most common name is also 100% wrong (eg Holland) is it not used, or in specialist areas like royal titles. But elsewhere <i>most common rule</i> is all but sacrosanct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can seeon the guidelines on this, the most common name is not used if it is factually wrong or misleading. Factually acuracy (Bill rather than William is not not misleading for Clinton, since both refer to him) would seem to be important for an encyclopedia, but perhaps I'm very old fasioned.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 06:51, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hence <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in most of wikipedia, not <i>United States of America</i>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> not <i>William Jefferson Clinton</i>, etc. Also as the House of Commons is in as BHoC not UK HoC if you have been doing what you did on <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Houses_of_Parliament_5049.html" title="Irish Houses of Parliament">Irish Houses of Parliament</a> elsewhere, you'd be strongly advised to be careful. Redirects have a habit of breaking down. One re-direct is risky (where possible they should go <i>directly</i>) but two redirects is suicidal, for they regularly break links all over the place. So <i>never ever</i> make double redirects and if possible remove single redirects. It is worth reading all the guidance on naming conventions before making major changes because clear policies are defined there.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 00:02, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>100% wrong? Surely the name is either correct or not? Holland is part of the Netherlands, Britain is part of the United Kingdom. The fact that people commonly mistake one for the other is surely not justification for what an encyclopedia calls it?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Re the redirects, I was slapped for moving the page without correcting the redirects, and then for fixing the redirects before moving the page - it seems the tactic is simply one to keep the incorrect name for the page.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 00:09, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>Change all "British" pages to UK unless the topic specifically excludes Northern Ireland.

Cons: An enormous amount of work where the benefit is likely to be pretty thin compared with an equivalent amount of work developing new articles.</li>

<dd>I would be more than happy to assist in fixing the links, and think that an approach of gradual fixing and making new articles correct would be reasonable, a small group of people could probably fix most of the links pretty quickly, and spot and broken links.</dd>
<dd>Without wanting to bang on about this too much, the fact that it is a common misconception that Britain and United Kingdom are synonyms doesn't mean we need to propogate it - it is even more important to be correct on this point. Thanks for you input on this, I support either of the first two of your proposals.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 14:26, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now it's me at risk of banging on too much, but I just wanted to be clear on what exactly the misconception people have is. It is a misconception to believe that (Britain = United Kingdom). I don't think this conception is widespread (at least in the British Isles) and of course we would never wish to make this mistake in Wikipedia. However are you saying the use of the adjective "British" to mean "of the United Kingdom" is also a misconception? I don't believe it is. See for instance <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=British" class="external free" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=British" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=British</a> where <i>as an adjective</i> there are two meanings - meaning a) of Great Britain but meaning b) <i>of the United Kingdom</i>. My Concise Oxford English Dictionary says the same thing (meaning 1, if you have a copy). Thus although using British in meaning b) sense would seem to be wrong in a strict formal grammatical sense, it is absolutely fine in normal English according to the dictionary compilers. There is no suggestion that this meaning is slang or inappropiate for a formal medium like an encyclopedia. These were the two levels of correctness I alluded too. I hope with this extra detail you won't be too disappointed if there is not a wholesale change in lots of page names. You probably aren't going to get a lot of support for changing something that isn't substantially wrong, for little benefit and a lot of work. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 21:55, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks - actually I do think the misconception is widespread (there is, at the very least, considerable confusion, see below). I believe the disctionary definition reflects usage, a lot of people use <b>Britain</b> to mean <b>United Kingdom</b>. While that's fine in everyday use, I can say I am from Britain or from the UK without fear of confusion, I believe that an encyclopedia should be a little more careful, especially when most of the article linking to it are discussions of UK politics and constitutional issues where the distinction is important. I think that it is <i>substantially wrong</i> and am volunteering to put in a large share of the work.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 22:03, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to ask for broader comment on a discussion going on on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> page. The debate hinges on whether the page about the House of Commons in London should be called <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons_2c38.html" title="United Kingdom House of Commons">United Kingdom House of Commons</a>. It seems that everyone agrees that the House of Commons in question is part of the government of the United Kingdom, but some assert that the page should nonetheless be called British because it is often (erroneously) called that. The convention of naming the article by its most common correct term, not necessarily the official one, is cited to justify that. My concern is that Britain is only part of the United Kingdom, and it is factually incorrect and misleading to title the article <i>British</i>. Comment would be appreciated on that page since there are implications for many other articles.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 05:13, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>My concern with "UK" is that there is a Scottish one too, right? This is their web page: "The House of Commons is part of the United Kingdom Parliament." Speaking as an American, I think it's silly to call it anything other than plain old "House of Commons" in the article. They were first, it's quite unambigous, etc. There should be another article entitled <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_Parliament_7c38.html" title="United Kingdom Parliament">United Kingdom Parliament</a>, etc. For the article itself, I would recommend House of Commons (United Kingdom). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 06:46, Nov 12, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Err, no, not if I'm reading you properly -- there's a Scottish Parliament, not a Scottish House of Commons.

<dd>Are you suggesting that someone born in Northern Ireland would not have <b>British Citizen</b> in the nationality part of their passports' data page (unless they applied for an Irish passport, which they certainly could do at least before the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Friday_Agreement_6853.html" title="Good Friday Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>)? If this is the case, you are simply wrong in your argument. The British Nationality Act 1981 defines <i>British Citizenship</i>, <b>not</b> <i>United Kingdom Citizenship</i>, there is no such thing. <b>"British" is an adjective meaning "of the United Kingdom" - see any reputable dictionary</b>.

<dd>No, citizenship has nothing to do with what we are talking about. The use of the term <b>British</b> to refer to <b>citizens of the UK</b> is fine, but not for government. You will not, I think, find any examples of the UK government describing itself or parts thereof as the <b>British Government</b>.

<p>My two cents is that the article should be listed under <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons_2c38.html" title="United Kingdom House of Commons">United Kingdom House of Commons</a> as I think official names should be the default in situations like this. I'd list <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> as a redirect. However, I'd generally use "British" rather than "United Kingdom" as the adjective form in articles; it's the common term in general usage and much less unwieldy. <a href="../../../m/k/_/User%7EMK_d3fe.html" title="User:MK">MK</a> (Sorry.

<p>That is a false argument based on a historical and linguistic misconception. Many states have adjective forms of their name. Some do not. In the case of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, <i>British</i> is universally used and has been continually throughout the variety of states that have existed in that geographic region. In modern geo-political terms, <i>British</i> was used initially from October 1604 to describe the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, which in the previous year had come to share the same sovereign, James VI/I. It owned its origins to James's unsuccessful attempt to create a single name for his separate kingdoms. That name he chose was <i>Great Brittaine</i>. <i>Great Britain</i> because the formal state name following the 1707 Act of Union of Scotland and England. In 1801 a new state, the <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</i> was formed. (James had used the perscriptive, not descriptive term <i>united kingdom</i> as early as 1604.) In 1922, most of Ireland left the kingdom, and the new truncated state was renamed the <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i>. Through every state from 1604 to the present day, (ie. England and Scotland separate with a shared king, Great Britain, the UK of GB and I, then the UK of GB and NI) the term <i>British</i> has been used as the adjective form of the state, whatever its nomenclature, in 99% of cases. Queen Anne is recorded as a <i>British</i> Queen, as is Queen Elizabeth II. (Some commonwealth states used to refer to "His Brittanic Majesty") Every prime minister without exception has been known when defined by state mostly as <i>British</i> prime minister, with the alternative <i>Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</i> used largely only in formal legal documentation (eg, treaties). The monarchy since James VI/I has been regularly called the <i>British</i> monarchy, the House of Commons the <i>British</i> House of Commons. The media is referred to as the <i>British</i> media. Sports stars are referred to <i>British</i> athletes/footballers/ etc. David Beckham is called a British football player, except when seen in terms of international soccer when he described as <i>English</i>.</p>
<p>A linguistic distinction exists between <i>British</i>/<i>Britain</i>, which is used to refer to the entire kingdom, and <i>Great British</i>/<i>Great Britain</i>, which is used to refer to the island that contains England, Scotland and Wales, and is used as such in the name of he UK, ie, the United Kingdom of Great Britain (the island) and Northern Ireland (a territory off the island of GB). To use <i>Great British PM</i> would be wrong as there is no PM in the Island of GB, not is there a queen of GB. But using <i>British</i> as the adjective form of <i>United Kingdom</i> is standard, not least because it allows for a degree of continuity between the often changing names by which the British state was known since the separate states on Great Britain were first constitutionally linked ago. <i>United Kingdom</i> is also problematical given that there have in fact been <i>2</i> UKs, one from 1800 to 1922, one from 1927 to the present (and confusion between 1922 and 1927). Following the flawed logic of 2toise, one could not have a list of British Prime Ministers, for example, but three lists; GB (up to 1800), UK of GB+I (1801-1920s), UK of GB + NI (1920s - present), no list of British monarchs, but 3 lists, no lists of famous British people, but three lists, etc etc. And so one would have articles called</p>
<ul>
<li>[[List of Prime Ministers of the Kingdom of Great Britain]],</li>
<li>[[List of Prime Minsters of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]],</li>
<li>[[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and</p>
<ul>
<li>[[House of Commons of the Kingdom of Great Britain]],</li>
<li>[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]],</li>
<li>[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logically if one was to follow the policy of accurate absolutism 2toise seems to want, you would have to rewrite much of wikipedia - one could not talk about Australia before 1900 as there were six states, not one. Italy could not be used before Italian unification in the 1870s, Germany would be limited to after the creation of the German Empire. And of course, <i>President of the United States</i> would also have to go, as to use the correct state nomenclature, every link would have to be <i>President of the United States of America</i>.</p>

So clearly using <i>British</i> as the adjective form of UK is the solution that follows general usage, international usage and wikipedia's own rules. Using <i>United Kingdom</i> in adjective form involves ignoring general usage, accepted usage worldwide and breaking wikipedia's <i>own</i> rules on the matter.<a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:35, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. <b>British</b> is not 'universally used'. It is often (erronenously) used in a casual context, rarely in a discussion of constitutional or political issues.

<p>Morven is absolutely correct. As to British not being "universally used" in adjective form it is a fact that it is. As to the British House of Commons link, that should have been piped. As to the <i>current correct name</i> argument, OK, so you want to rename the British House of Commons article as <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland House of Commons</i>? That is what your argument requires. <i>United Kingdom</i> is <i>not</i> the correct name but a generalised shortened version, as you will see if you look at treaties signed in the state's name. So if you want accuracy, it <i>has</i> to be that! As to the <i>we need to temper common usage when the commonly used term is unreasonably misleading</i> argument that is completely irrelevant. <i>British</i> is not "unreasonably misleading". <i>It has been used as the adjective version of various British states for 399 years.</i> Calling The Netherlands "Holland" is misleading. Calling France "the Kingdom of France" would be misleading. Calling <i>Northern Ireland</i> "Ulster" is misleading. Using the standard adjective form of a name, used worldwide by billions of people, including the British <i>(BTW what do you suggest calling the British then? United Kingdomish?)</i> is common sense and follows wikipedia's rules on name use to the letter and the spirit. Your suggestion does neither. As to the British Parliamentary website, that is completely irrelevant, and I'm surprised you use it. <i>Of course</i> they use <i>the</i> most formal title. <i>All</i> official sites do that. That is not evidence of anything. Why does Tony Blair have international press releases issued that call him the "British Prime Minister" if the "British" bit was so wrong. <i>I simply cannot understand your determination to push an illogical, factually inaccurate agenda that breaks wikipedia's own rules to produce article titles that will be no more accurate, just less accessible and less likely to show up in google searches, given that most of the planet will use</i> British <i>in searches, whether you want them to or not.</i> <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 23:20, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Clearly, the correct approach according to Wikipedia precedent with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> which is similarly problematic for a few editors (although because it may be too inclusive, not because it may be too exclusive) is to clarify every single usage of "British" and replace with "UK citizen" or "of the UK" since it can be confusing. <a href="../../../u/k/i/UKian_2adf.html" title="UKian">UKian</a> would be the best option if only people would use that term instead of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a>. We should also create a new page named <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_words_for_British_aa54.html" title="Alternate words for British">Alternate words for British</a> and list any alternative words that have been constructed to raise awareness of the issue and it can be linked from various possibly offensively-titled articles where "British" has to be retained for some pathetic reason.

<p>The website mentions about the Duke of Gloucester (the website's words) <i>He is President of a number of organisations including: Britain-Nepal Society, The British Consultancy and Construction Bureau, British Leprosy Relief Association (LEPRA - Vice President).</i></p>
<p>By the way, have you ever heard of two airlines called <i>British</i> Airways and <i>British</i> Midland.

<p>"The British Constitutional Monarchy was the consequence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and was enshrined in the Bill of Rights of 1689. Whereby William and Mary in accepting the throne , had to consent to govern 'according to the statutes in parliament on." - J. Harvey and L. Bather, <i>The British Constitution</i>. And don't forget Ralph Alan Griffiths, John Ashton Cannon, <i>The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy</i> (Oxford Paperback Reference) and Kenneth O. Morgan, <i>The Oxford History of Britain</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 019288073X</a>).</p>
<p>So in other words, the British parliament uses the word <i>British</i> constantly. The official website of the monarchy refers to the <i>British</i> monarchy. Net encyclopædias talk about the <i>British</i> House of Commons. Top academics write books with the words <i>British</i> in it. Google searches show it is the overwhelming preference of millions of internet users. We have <i>British</i> Midland, <i>British</i> Airways, the Order of the <i>British</i> Empire, and of course the <i>British</i> Broadcasting Corporation. So your comment about how <i>British</i> is 'rarely used', maybe on the moon it isn't but on planet earth it clearly is. How official do you want? The Queen? - got it. Parliament? - ditto. The media? Yup. Academia? You bet. Sorry your argument is so nonsensical that it is funny. The facts are clear. The evidence is overwhelming.

<dd>Although it's good to have your research and knowledge on the page, I think now is the time to stop flogging this horse. 2toise already conceded the point and debate - maybe not particularly gracefully - but that's hard to do when the debate got to a pitch as feverish as last night. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete</a> 23:49, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wouldn't agree that 2toise conceded the point, merely adopted a 'you all are wrong and won't listen to sense' tone. The problem is that this nutty "you can't use <i>British</i>" argument comes up as regularly as a British royal scandal. Granted no-one else has been as absolute as 2toise in making a claim that can so easily be demonstrated as factually wrong. But those of us who deal with this nonsense everytime it appears are getting a tad bored having to re-fight the argument every couple of months. So I put in the comments to show that 2toise's <i>you all are wrong and won't listen to sense</i> is not a consession, merely an "OK. Be wrong then for all I care" withdrawal, by answering the claim once and for all. That way the <i>next</i> time someone digs up this nonsensical argument, we won't have to start from scratch again but simply point to a definitive page of facts. And instead of the previous attempts to raise the issue, that ended in the person just dropping the issue for a while, <i>this</i> time the clear unambiguous evidence is stated bluntly, so 2toise, unlike others, can't come back and try again thinking everyone will have forgotten their evidence and maybe this time they might get away with the loopy idea. The evidence is here to be used the next time this issue is dug up. And I did deliberately end the piece above with QED (<i>Quad Erat Demonstratum</i>) which means in effect - <i>as has been demonstrated. Issue now closed.</i>&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 00:41, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jtdirl / FearÉIREANN / ÉÍREman - I'm afraid that all you have demonstrated is an ability to win a war of attrition against people interested in correcting this point. Not many people have endless reserves of tolerance for your cheap debating club tactics. A couple of particularly risible examples stand out:
<ol>
<li>Your cup and ball trick logic; "There's an airline called <i>British Airways</i>, so it must be called the <i>British House of Commons</i>".</li>
<li>The belief that if you state something false enough times it becomes true "the British Parliament uses the word constantly".</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not interested in discussing this with you any further because you are clearly bent on misrepresenting the situation. Even if we were to accept the strong form of your argument, that is only that there is an secondary meaning to the term British which is a synonym for 'relating to the UK'. That still leaves UK as at least as appropriate a term, and the one that is used overwhelmingly on the UK Parliament website [www.parliament.uk/ www.parliament.uk/].</dd>
<dd>Of course people keep on bringing this up, and of course more people will continue to. The fact that the people who are interested in correcting this don't seem to want to put up with your belligerence and hostility as well as your childish 'logic' for very long, and eventually give up on trying to make you see sense isn't really surprising. Whatever bizarre agenda it is that makes you think it is so important to propagate this error is none of my business, but it's a shame that Wikipedia has to pay the price for it.<a href="../../../2/t/o/User%7E2toise.html" title="User:2toise">2toise</a> 14:04, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

"one that is used overwhelmingly on the UK Parliament website" this appears to be inaccurate. The phrase that is used overwhelmingly is an unqualified "House of Commons" as for the rest&#160;:- Google search</p>

<p>Let us recap. 2toise believed that the use of <i>British</i> as the adjective form of <i>United Kingdom</i> was wrong. That was shown to be wrong by history books, by websites, by the records of the British Parliament, by the Royal Family, by industry, broadcasting, etc. He insisted that the term <i>British House of Commons</i> was false and never existed. ever. This was disproved by the House of Commons itself. So as usual he moved the goalposts and said it was <i>just</i> one. So another ten were produced that showed both the widespread use of <i>British</i> and the specific usage of <i>British House of Commons</i>. His response was to call that "childish logic". Arwel, MIntguy and others demonstated that, no matter how 2toise changed the question when his latest theory was disproved, every new argument fell flat on his face. But still, 2toise calls the facts a "bizarre agenda". The words 'when', 'hole' and 'digging' come to mind. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 20:19, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
