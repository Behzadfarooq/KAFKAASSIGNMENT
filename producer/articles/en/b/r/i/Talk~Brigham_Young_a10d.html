<p>"No longer tolerates" implies that the Church never approved of polygamy but didn't stop its members from practicing it. This is not true.

<p>I think that the Mr. Young's notation as second prophet/President of the Church of Latter Day Saints should be changed. Offically Mr. Young is not considered by the courts or Community or Christ, RLDS, Restorationists to be the successor of Joseph Smith in the most legal sense. The legal courts showed that in 1890 that the Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saints was the true successor to the church that Joseph Smith created. Therefore calling Mr. Young The second Prophet/President is irresponsible. He should be recognized as the first president of the Mormon Church. After going out to Utah with his follwers he rebaptized and reordained every member of that church which means he formed a completely new faith. I would like to see this changed if possible.</p>
<p>The purpose of rebaptism in the Great Salt Lake Valley was to recommit to living the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Re-baptism was to signify that the members would (again) start anew in a different land with a revitalized commitment to building up the Church. The purpose was not to become baptized into a new faith. Given that the primary leadership of the Church(the apostles, the general authorities, and bishops), which existed before Young's leadership as a prophet, migrated to the Salt Lake Valley, it should be fair to say that this was, in fact, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints--the same Church that existed in Nauvoo, Illinois. The term "Mormon" is a secular term that was originally used as a derogatory means of identifying members of the Church by non-members during the early years of its development while they were still in the eastern New England states--prior to moving to the Salt Lake Valley. This logic suggests that it would be contrary to refer to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints alone as "Mormons", although it has grown to be commonly accepted, even among church members themselves. 70.117.240.220 04:45, 19 February 2007 (UTC)Brandon Jay Bingham</p>

<p>"and I prophesy in the name of Jesus Christ, by the power of the priesthood that's upon me, that any President of the United States who lifts his finger against this people, shall die an untimely death, and go to hell"</p>
<p>Did Brigham Young really say this? (unsigned by an anon)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not that I could find in any source document - however it was reported to congress and to President Filmore that Young said this - in a "Report of the three officers to President Fillmore, Ex. Doc. No. 25, 1st Session, 32d Congress" on the 24th of July 1851 <a href="http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/relg/historygeography/TheStoryoftheMormonsFromtheDateoftheirOrigintotheYear1901/chap66.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/relg/historygeography/TheStoryoftheMormonsFromtheDateoftheirOrigintotheYear1901/chap66.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://elmerfudd.us/dp/lds/lds2-doc25-letters0.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://elmerfudd.us/dp/lds/lds2-doc25-letters0.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://elmerfudd.us/dp/lds/lds2-doc25-letters.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://elmerfudd.us/dp/lds/lds2-doc25-letters.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The original source is missing from any statement by Young (which is suprising due to the meticulous record-keeping of the saints) It may appear in an 1851 entry Journal History of the Church (which is unpublished), but I've not seen it in my research. I doubt he said it, although it would not be inconsistent with his rhetoric.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The closest I've seen is the following remark from HC Kimball, nearly 6 years later&#160;:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To gratify some who cry, "Oh, don't say anything, brother Heber,--don't say anything, brother Brigham, to bring down the United States upon us," we have at times omitted printing some of the remarks that might offend the weak-stomached world, and we have made buttermilk and catnip tea to accommodate the tastes of our enemies; but the poor devils are not pleased after all. Would they come any quicker if we told them that they were poor, miserable, priest-ridden curses, who want a President in the chair that dare not speak for fear those hell-hounds be on him?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>God knew that Zachary Taylor would strike against us, and He sent him to hell. President Fillmore was the next man who came on the platform, and he did us good. God bless him! Then came President Pierce, and he did not strive to injure us. We hoped that the next after him would do us justice; but he has issued orders to send troops to kill brother Brigham and me, and to take the young women to the States.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The woman will be damned that will go: she shall dry up in the fountain of life, and be as though she never was. But there ain't any a-going--unless they are whores. If the soldiers come here, those creatures will have the privilege of showing themselves and of becoming debauched.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I tell you there is not a purer set of women on God's earth than there is here; and they shall live and bear the souls of men, and bear tabernacles for those righteous spirits that are kept back for the last time, for the winding-up scenery.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Will the President that sits in the chair of state be tipped from his seat? Yes, he will die an untimely death, and God Almighty will curse him; and He will also curse his successor, if he takes the same stand; and he will curse all those that are his coadjutors, and all who sustain him. What for? For coming here to destroy the kingdom of God, and the Prophets, and Apostles, and inspired men and women; and God Almighty will curse them, and I curse them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, according to my calling; and if there is any virtue in my calling, they shall be cursed, every man that lifts his heel against us from this day forth. - Journal of Discourses, Vol.5, p.134, Heber C. Kimball, August 2, 1857</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, it is interesting to note the Presidents deaths/legacies of the time period -</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachary_Taylor_d92b.html" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> died in office (Untimely - apparent fullfilment of alleged prophecy)</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millard_Fillmore_5e1f.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> who was kind to the Mormons died when he was 74 years old of a stroke (Could be untimely, but was kind, so should have lived longer? Could be fullfilment of alleged prophecy)</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Pierce_eb91.html" title="Franklin Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> drank himself to death at the age of 65 after not being re-elected, and is known as one of the worst presidents in history (disputed as untimely - died from drinking - could be untimely, but was 65, which is older - could be fullfilment of alleged prophecy)</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> was also not re-elected. Also known as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history. Lived to be 77. One of the most controversial presidents up to his time. (Not untimely, apparent not fullfilment of alleged prophecy)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was assasinated by Booth - he was allegedly going to focus on Polygamy the other "twin relic of barbarism" as part of the reconstruction, however had no formal policy toward mormons. (untimely, however disputed as fullfilment of alleged prophecy, as policy is unclear)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> was "associated" with Lincoln, and lived to a ripe old age of 67. He had no formal policy toward the Mormons that I can recall, however he was impeached. (cannot be counted in the alleged prophecy).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For the historical ranking of Presidents, see <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_rankings_of_U.S._Presidents_92b1.html" title="Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents">Historical_rankings_of_U.S._Presidents</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, if it was a prophecy, it could be as high as 4/5, more likely 2/5 or untimely means something different than what it means to us. I'd say HC Kimball's statement or curse is more accurate, as it deals with being "tipped from his seat," which did happen with every president who has had a policy against the Mormons, and have not be re-elected. Of course no president between Jackson and Cleaveland (1838-1893) was president for two full terms, and it wasn't until Teddy Roosevelt (from Jackson in 1838 until 1901) - that the president was elected for two consecutive terms. You've raised an interesting question. I wish we had more detail on this statement, but the bottom line and answer to your original question is we don't know if Brigham Young made the statement or not. Ther is no record of it that has been published aside from a hearsay report to the US that led to the Utah War. The same document has other strange things that have later been proven false - and I do find it a bit funny that Young said "Hell" with Mormon theology of the spirit world and the kingdoms of glories. Anyway , long answer to say, "who knows."

<p>I am appalled to see that Young's involvement in the Mountain Meadows Massacre is just glazed over, as if the LDS had written this themselves. (Is Wikipedia a Mormon front?)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/mtn_meadows/11.html" class="external free" title="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/mtn_meadows/11.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/mtn_meadows/11.html</a> "If the United States send their army here, and war commences, the travel must stop," Young told the Saints in August 1857. "To accomplish this, I need only say a word, for the Indians will use them up unless I continually strive to contain them."</p>
<p>Young created the atmosphere that made the massacre possble, if not planning the entire thing. As far as his letter to "leave the settlers alone," arriving too late... well, for good reason. It wasn't composed until after the murders took place!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/mtn_meadows/16.html" class="external free" title="http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/mtn_meadows/16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/mtn_meadows/16.html</a> "Lee immediately reported the slaughter to Brigham Young, who quickly issued a letter dated before the slayings ordering the southern communities to take no action against any immigrant trains."</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments. This has been a source of Mormon, non-Mormon and Anti-Mormon debate for many years. All evidence surrounding the event is inconclusive and anyone stating otherwise is not telling the truth or is not truly familiar with the primary documents. We hope an upcoming book and the release of documements that are supposed to be made available at that time will shed further light on the events.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your first quote "for the Indians will use them up unless I continually strive to contain them" was said by young, as showing that the Indians hated and wanted to kill many of the whites who used the various trails to california (indians seemed to like the mormons whose policy was to feed them, and disliked the rude california gold seekers, and oregon land claimants), but they were spared because of an agreement between Young and Chief "Walker" (<a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakara.html" title="Wakara">Wakara</a>) - so I'm not sure why you are pointing to this as evidence against Young - it actually is a strong support against your point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, the letter was composed the second day of the massacre, if I remmeber correctly. There is no way for word to have travelled 600 miles within that time for "Lee immediately reported the slaughter to Brigham Young" and then Young to have "quickly" issued a letter (Lee didn't see Young for months after the event). Even the descendants of the fancer party and most western historians doubt Young's knowledge of or involvement in the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Meadows_Massacre_79b8.html" title="Mountain Meadows Massacre">Mountain Meadows Massacre</a> until about five days after the event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said that, there was a lot of rhetoric of the time by Young and other church leaders that lead to such a paranoid group of "Mormons" where this took place. This have very unfortunate ramifications and likely contributed to the events. But to tie the two so closely together as you are trying to do is drawing conclusions where there is no evidence or records or support for it. Especially with the outspoken nature of many within the Fancher party claiming to have aided in Joseph Smith's death. Someday we may very well find out that Young was involved (though it is unlikely from my own research), but for now, we don't. There is not evidence to support and is actually evidence to the contrary. There's more evidence to support various <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_755d.html" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">John F. Kennedy assassination</a> threories than your point.</dd>

I'd say there is only a couple of dozen folks who've really been able to spend time researching and understanding the MMM. Juanita Brooks definitely went against the grain of Mormon leadership in her works on the subject, and they seem to be the most accurate and throrugh up until this time - and they definitely didn't tie anything but Young's and other church leaders' rhetoric to haveing been a contributing factor.

<p>In general, this section is lacking. Sources to these quotes need to be documented; I'll take a look into what's offered online through the official LDS website, but it may not have all of them available. Concerning the controversial quote regarding Young's views on African Americans, a comment has been made in the History that it is not notable for the time period. I disagree, especially due to the significant issue of race in the Church. Keep in mind that just because the quote may not be highly regarded or popular within the Church (and with good reason, of course), it doesn't make it any less notable or important. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadsalmon_0aca.html" title="User:Deadsalmon">Deadsalmon</a> 07:21, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Okay, after some searching on the LDS site, it's not pulling up much. The search engine doesn't seem to work well for advanced text searching, and in any case, some of the more important books necessary, such as the Journal of Discourses, aren't available. I'd imagine that the book used for the Sunday School course on Brigham Young a few years back (from the rotating series on presidents of the Church) would be an excellent resource; however, I'm not able to get to one at the time being. Without proper documentation, I've removed the entire section for now. I'll try to find the sources, but if someone wants to take a shot at documenting the quotes in the meantime, just look for the edit in the History page corresponding in time with the timestamp listed here. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadsalmon_0aca.html" title="User:Deadsalmon">Deadsalmon</a> 07:39, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There's much more to this story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did the Mormons get run out of two states (Illinios, Missouri)?</li>
<li>What was there intent when they went west?</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these questions center on political interaction between the new Mormon communities and the existing non-Mormon communities. Remember the Rajneeshies in Oregon? The Mormons got into trouble when they began to exercise political power in the established states of Illinois and Missouri.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their cities and towns were growing. They had organized militias. They were a direct political and military threat to the established power structure of these two states. They weren't persecuted so much as defeated in battle.</li>
<li>Brigham took his people to Utah to get away from the United States. They had no intention of re-joining it. Indeed, the Meadow Massacre can be looked at more in terms of one action in a low-intensity war, than as a single crime. Is there anything here about the Utah Expeditionary Force?</li>
<li>Polygamy began early in Mormon history. I personally am descended from Brigham Youngâ€™s first polygamous marriage to <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_A._Decker_fef0.html" title="Lucy A. Decker">Lucy Ann Decker</a>. They were married on June 14th, 1842, in Missouri.</li>
<li>Polygamy was used as a political diversion to the anti-slavery movement.</li>
<li>Polygamy had a definite theological basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any comments on any of these points and how we can properly discuss them? <a href="../../../d/j/o/User%7EDjohnson53_7645.html" title="User:Djohnson53">DJohnson53</a> <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">10 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Three, if you count Ohio.</li>
<li>Their intent, rather than "there" intent.</li>
<li>The content of Mountain Meadows is the genocide of Caucasian settlers against Native Americans. That is what led to the massacre. It was basically a Native American counter-attack, with the LDS joining in from Native American pressure.</li>
<li>In Ohio, the LDS were persecuted, not defeated in battle.</li>
<li>In Missouri and Illinois (not "Illinios"), the LDS were persecuted <i>and</i> defeated in battle - like the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugenots.html" title="Hugenots">Hugenots</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Young was perhaps the most famous <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html#Mormon_Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamist</a> of the early church. Young married some 50 women and had 57 known children. These marriages were not recognized as legally binding according to U.S. law, and in response to a suit for alimony from one of his "ex-wives", Young successfully argued in court that he owed no alimony because they were never legally married."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have found a citation for the above, but as I noted, there is a "rest of the story." She was married to another man before she married Young (and had concealed this fact from him). So, not only was she not legally married to him because bigamy was illegal (for him according to US law), but she was not married to him because bigamy was against church marriage rules <i>and</i> US marriage law (for her). This information seems to be from a pro-church source: <i>Comprehensive History of the Church of The Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>, by B. H. Roberts. Another source that discusses the case seems to have <i>Comprehensive History of the Church</i> as its only reference for this story: <i>Zion in the Courts</i> by Edwin Brown Firmage &amp; Richard Collin.</dd>

<dd>I do not know how long the sentence remained in the article, but feel that undiscussed deletions like this are a terrible bane to a page that has the controversy potential this one does. Even though I do not personally miss the statement (the article seems better overall for the changes that have since been made), I just figured I would comment here that after putting a "{fact}" marker the line was deleted without comment. If someone that is more invested in this article would like, I would be glad to add it with a bit more information and the needed reference. --<a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMkoyle_44e6.html" title="User:Mkoyle">Matthew K</a> 17:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Warren Jeffs reveres "Brother Brigham" and often quotes him in his speeches to FLDS members...his seclusion from this section is pov - as many of the other sobriquets are based on LDS members views on him...a different church, but still (Young) was just as influential in development and growth as he was in the more prominent LDS church.

</dl>
<p>No, a great deal of the FLDS belief is structured around polygamy - and is a direct result of the teachings of Brigham Young, to not include them here goes against Wikipedia standards for trying to be as truthful and knowledgable as possible...why should you include many sobriquets and tidbits in the beginning that are only in relation to Brighams LDS church...to be fair, other religions and povs should be included.<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWick_Griffon_5bcf.html" title="User:Wick Griffon">Wick Griffon</a> 03:11, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>...uh - not sure what to say here?

<dd>Unfortunately not - there are plenty of criminals that use the writings of others to justify their crimes.

<p>Every single (previous) sobriquet was pov (provided by his own churchs assessment) and therefore does not live up to wikipedia's neutral pov standards.

<p>Wick Griffon added the following sentence: "In the Ex-Mormon community, he is often referred to as "Brigham the Butcher" (<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/az2/arizonadry/false.html" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/az2/arizonadry/false.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/az2/arizonadry/false.html</a>)." The citation of its use on one Web page, however, does not meet the standard of verifying that this sobriquet is "often" used by members of the ex-Mormon community. I used Google to check this sobriquet and the others cited:</p>
<ul>
<li>"brigham young" "brigham the butcher" - 1 reference (the one cited by Wick Griffon)</li>
<li>"brigham young" "american moses" - 9300 references</li>
<li>"brigham young" "modern moses" - 780 references</li>

<li>"brigham young" "lion of the lord" - 339 references</li>

<dd>The redirects are probably fine, but I would like to note that redirecting these wives to this page (from this page) is rather silly. It might be wise to remove the "[[]]" link markers from the ones that just point to redirects to this page (otherwise someone wanting to research Brugham Young's wives will have to click on each of these links to see if there is content there or just another annoying redirect to this same page). I will do that if no one has any objection. --<a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMkoyle_44e6.html" title="User:Mkoyle">Matthew K</a> 18:07, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An unfactual cartoon doesn't help the cause of truth. --Coldblackice 22:13, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I concede that the image was intended to be derogatory and is somewhat silly; nonetheless, the cartoon itself could be seen as a factual representation of <i>public opinion</i> of Young in his own day. If everyone thinks it good to delete this image, out it stays. Does anyone feel it best to leave this here? --<a href="../../../m/k/o/User%7EMkoyle_44e6.html" title="User:Mkoyle">Matthew K</a> 18:15, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There needs to be an entry made on this article in regards to how and when he passed away.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrigham_Young_a10d.html" title="Edit section: Hickman jilted?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hickman jilted?</span></h2>
<p>As I was reading the article, this sentence struck me odd: "This indictment was based on the testimony of William Hickman, who also felt jilted when 8 of his 9 wives left him, after Young had him excommunicated."</p>
<p>This sentence seems to imply that the <i>only</i> reason Hickman made those claims was to get back at Young for excommunicating him. Is there any evidence that this was the case, or is this just an editor's opinion? I think we should rephrase this sentence, or even the paragraph, because Hickman's confession was not the only reason that Young was indicted. Suspicion had been swirling for years among US government officials that Young was behind the many Danite attacks -- which even led to the brutal beating and death of one governor. It's just that with Hickman, officials felt that they finally had enough evidence to take the case to trial.</p>
<p>So, unless someone here can provide convincing evidence that Hickman <i>invented</i> the claims out of petty spite, I think we ought to rephrase the sentence. I don't have any specific ideas right now, but I'll think about it, and come back with something. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinM_ce35.html" title="User:KevinM">KevinM</a> 19:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
