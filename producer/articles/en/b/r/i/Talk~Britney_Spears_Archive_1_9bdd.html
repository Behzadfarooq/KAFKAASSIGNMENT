<p>What is meant by "Billboard" and "GQ" at the bottom of the article? Also, I'm not sure what the word "incently" is supposed to mean... recently? innocently?</p>
<hr />
<p>The National Enquirer, a paragon of journalistic integrity, reported in early 2002 that Britney Spears gave up her virginity and is now "living in sin" with Justin Timberlake. She is 21 -- an adult in every state -- and apparently managed to remain a virgin while a minor, but immediately took up "adult" behavior once she became an adult.</p>
<p>Should we include the National Enquirer info, or wait for a clear statement from the bimbo, er, I mean, admirable young lady?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gee, Ed -- why do you think it's anybody's business? do we list "important dates in sexual development" or "sexual partners" for anyone else? I can't stand the girl myself for any number of reasons, but her sex life is none of my business, or yours, unless it directly affects me or you. More importantly, when did the Enquirer become a reliable source? <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure an encyclopedia should care, but I think in this case it's fair game for newspapers: Britney herself made it their business by publicly extolling her virginity. --LDC</p>
<hr />
<p>Obviously, there something wrong with your screen -- if you can't detect the <b>irony</b> in the phrase</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>a paragon of journalistic integrity</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>as applied to the cream of America's supermarket tabloids. I was trying to "damn with faint" praise, but maybe I'm not British enough for that to work.</p>
<p>Anyway, Ms. Spears has apparently been speared by Justin's "timber" -- he, he -- despite her very public and oft-repeated pledge to remain a virgin until marriage. If she was an ordinary entertainer, like Marie Osmond, I wouldn't mention gossip even in a talk page. But she contrasted her pledge with the most blatant sexually-charged antics possible, as if to deliberately heighten interest in the question: is she, or isn't she a virgin?</p>
<p>As she has made a career of provoking interest in her sexuality, her fans (and others) can hardly be blamed for commenting on it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>While that may be true, IMHO it is hardly encyclopedic. I did notice the sarcasm (not irony, actually), but the fact that you suggested it as a source for inclusion in the article was puzzling, to say the least.<a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Ah, my dear lab rat, a civil word -- finally!</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's a thought: it seems factual and of historical interest, as an indicator of the progression of humanity as sexually sophisticated, to point out it in a way such as this:</p>
<p>Spears, who early in her career made it a point of extolling the virtures of virginity before marraige, brought elements of overt sexuality into her performances as she aged. By the age of 21 she had gone from preaching about virginity to publicly stating "Why do people care about that stuff, anyway?" In the end it was revealed by her then ex-boyfriend, singer Justin Timberlake, that they had in fact had intercourse. This served to tarnish Spears' image as a sexual (but still innocent) young woman.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this isn't in any way outside of a NPOV, and it is directly relevant to the history of her career and the development of her celebrity (in the same way that Whitney Houston's alleged cocaine usage and spousal abuse incidents are directly related her her career's fizzle and fade.) -EB-</p>
<hr />
<p>That has got to be the worst picture I have ever seen.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yeah the picture could be better.</p>
<p>Also i think it's safe to say timberlake and spears are broken up. Also, do you really think a real encyclopedia would have a quote saying timberlake took her flower?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you think a real encyclopedia would list Britney at all? Seriously, see LDC's justification. Ms. Spears' virginity became a public issue when she talked about it - repeatedly. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 22:49, 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>just my humble opinion</p>
<hr />
<p>Hmm...What was wrong with my edit?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure about the edits 66.156.38.204 is making, but this one in particular seems rather strange: "Her ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, admitted that he had oral sex with Spears to get his songs on the radio." What does that even mean? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 00:40, 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm... the sentence was changed. It should make more sense now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It still seems a little ambiguous, but does it mean he admitted that to the radio station so they would play his songs? Before the sentence was changed I thought it meant Britney had some sort of personal influence over radio stations, or something&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 03:32, 2 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been thinking for a couple of days about the "Britney's sex life" section, and have come to the conclusion that it ought to go. Mainly, I feel it's not very nice to Britney Spears herself. We can envy Ms. Spears her financial success, but it must be hard for her to lead the life of a young single person with media attention focused on her every move.</p>
<p>It's true that Ms. Spears takes endless flak from media outlets. But, of course, it's the very function of the <i>National Enquirer</i> and its ilk to spread mean-spirited gossip. The Wikipedia doesn't have to lower itself to their standard.</p>
<p>I've substituted a section reporting the general situation (in particular, the conflict for Ms. Spears between the benefits of fame vs. the loss of privacy), but leaving out the lurid details.</p>
<p>If other Wikipedians agree, perhaps we can get an administrator to delete the "sex life" section from earlier drafts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree completely. Her sex life is very much at issue. She thrives off of it and the controversy surrounding it. Her sex life and persona are her selling points, and she seems to want it that way because if she's changed at all she's spun up more controversy. Sex is how she makes her money, other then her sex appeal, what seperates her from the other artists of her ilk? An article about her cannot be complete without covering her very public sexual expression and how she uses it to her advantage. Just my personal opinion though. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlockmeal_2b16.html" title="User:Flockmeal">Flockmeal</a> 19:52, 8 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Her sex life, or lack thereof, is part of her public persona. It is a part of her cultural status, and should be reported. And it is inappropriate to delete any edits from the history. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 04:31, 31 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">Merovingian</a>. I've reverted your "Coke" edit. Although I think it should really be parlayed into a controversy before being added to Britney's life story, I could just about live with the "she once drank Coca Cola" shock-horror if it wasn't, ahem, an April Fool's joke. <a href="http://www.britney-spears-portal.com/News/coke-scandal.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britney-spears-portal.com/News/coke-scandal.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChocolateboy_d22d.html" title="User:Chocolateboy">chocolateboy</a> 22:17, 17 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a big problem with the "trivia" section, which includes things about Britney's life that are not at all trivial, such as her recently announced engagement. I'd suggest we merge important biographical info such as that into what is now the "Career" section and simply remove or change that title. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:02, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
