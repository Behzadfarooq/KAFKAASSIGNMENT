<p>I've also written this in the 'Evolution of the British Empire' page, but as the map is also here I thought it is relevant here too:</p>
<p>I see in the map labelled 'The British Empire in 1897’ there is a part of Greenland shown as part of the Empire. The map contains the note ‘This map shows parts of Greenland as part of the British Empire. This region was never occupied by the British and the claim was contested by Denmark, which continued to claim sovereignty over all of Greenland.’ Aside from this note, however, I can find no reference to any part of Greenland being claimed by the British in articles on the Empire or on Greenland. Looking at the map the area appears to be labelled ‘Prudhoe Land’; again I can find no reference to such a territory. If anyone does have any information about this I would find it very helpful if they could put some details on this page. --<a href="../../../p/h/u/User%7EPhunting_d7de.html" title="User:Phunting">Phunting</a> 1020, 29 Dec 2006</p>

<dd>Don't know about this example. But there's something similar at <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borders_of_the_Roman_Empire_51f7.html" title="Borders of the Roman Empire">Borders of the Roman Empire</a>, where a part of Ireland is "sort of" included in the map. It's against the historical evidence, which fails to show a claim, much less an occupation. Do you notice any similarities in these cases, any community of edits? The usual suspects (above) may be at work, casting back for legitimacy in the hope that no objection is made.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 01:01, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for that really helpful and relevant contribution.

<dd>On the contrary, that's how it was before. It is "bent out of shape" because of the need to shoehorn Ireland in. Whilst Ireland is certainly over the sea from England, it is not "overseas" in the general meaning of the term as used by the English. The inclusion of Ireland in this list is clearly motivated by political concerns. In reality, the relationship of Ireland to England must be sought in medieval feudal times. If we include Ireland, then why not Wales? Or Cornwall? Or central and northern England after it was conquered by Wessex? The whole point about the British Empire is that it came about as a result of the Age of Discovery. We already knew where Ireland was!

<dd>Tharkun, you were involved in the debates over this months ago. Do we have to rehash the issue in to finer mince? There's nothing political about it - it's just a fact that English colonisation began with Ireland and set a template for the colonial empire.

<dd>I don't particularly remember taking a significant part in any major debate on the issue. My point was really quite simple - if we include Ireland, then we must also include Wales which experienced English colonisation (e.g. Pembrokeshire, the "Little England beyond Wales") during the Norman period. And what about the medieval colonies in Ireland, around Dublin? It is ludicrous to make no mention of them, if Ireland is to be included. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 13:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Because Ireland is not "overseas" (despite being over some sea), and was not a newly discovered territory.

<dd>It doesn't matter that Ireland wasn't newly discovered. Neither was North America - the Spanish had already been there for a century and John Cabot turned up for the English in 1497. And maybe 'overseas' is a big deal at the foreign office. But this article deals with the British Empire, which began with the colonisations of the 16thC. During that period, new colonies were established in Ireland - not in Wales or Cornwall or Isle of Man or Calais - and those colonies were the model for what was happening simultaneously in North America. The Stuart plantation of Ulster was England/Britain's, largest colony of all and dwarved what was happening across the Atlantic. It's plain. Why deny it? I guess you're not tracing the empire back to Angevin conquests and inheritances, but are you under the impression that Ireland was really under English control from the 12thC? There's a phrase for what the English were faced with following the near collapse of their government in Ireland: "Beyond the Pale" - it happened mid-14thC, during the Gaelic resurgence. That's why H8 undertook the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_re-conquest_of_Ireland_f2a6.html" title="Tudor re-conquest of Ireland">Tudor re-conquest of Ireland</a>, and why Ireland is <i>sui generis</i> in the list of Norman conquests.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 22:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But to include Ireland nevertheless obscures the very real distinction between a British overseas empire based on trade as a result of the Age of Discovery, and the various feudal relationships in Ireland that the English state inherited from its previous Norman rulers. In particular, this article treats Henry VIII's assumption of the title "king" of Ireland as some sort of turning point, whereas in reality it was nothing more than a change in nomenclature.</dd>

<dd>The existance of English (and Scottish, of course) plantations in Ireland does not imply that Ireland was part of the British Empire. After all, one could simply interpret such activities as experimenting in one's own back yard before exporting the results overseas. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 00:11, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The early empire was not based on trade, but on colonisation. If you want to talk about a trade based empire, then focus on the Portuguese. The change of title in Irlenad from lordship to realm was not about nomenclature - it marked the end of the feudal order and the beginning of a new order, which was explicitly committed to colonisation of the country. To describe what went on there as experimentation is flippant - the new order took 60 years to establish, in a series of vicious wars. I know Ireland is not an easy example to take because of its constitutional standing - <i>kingdom or colony?</i> as the historians put it - but it is necessary.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 22:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am reverting again. The following references show that it is right to begin discussion of the British Empire with English colonization of Ireland.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Niall Ferguson, Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power</i>: "In the early 1600s, a group of intrepid pioneers sailed across the sea to settle and, the hoped, civilize a primitive country inhabited by - as they saw it - a 'barbarous people' - Ireland. It was hte Tudor queens...who authorized the systematic colonization of Ireland...By 1673 an anonymous pamphleteer could confidently described Ireland as 'one of the chiefest members of the British Empire'."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Lawrence James, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire</i>: "The first colonisation of North America was contemperaneous with the far larger settlement of Ireland...120,000 colonists arrived to help undertake what Francis Bacon revealingly called the "reduction to civility"...of the Irish. On both sides of the Atlantic the settlers faced sporadic but determined resistance..."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Nicholas Canny, Origins of Empire, The Oxford History of the British Empire</i>: "Much has been written about [the] interconnections between British 'domestic' and 'overseas' colonization, which has sometimes been likened to the connection between the reconquista of Moorish Spain and the conquest of New Spain. In both instances, historians find it puzzling that procedures and justifications that they associate with overseas colonization were employed within Europe into the early modern period...[several pages later]...The most obvious oversight is the extent to which the plantation in Ulster which was the costliest British colonial undertaking of the 17th century, both popularized the concept of 'British' as opposed to 'English' colonization, and provided the first example of how a British colony and Empire might function."</li>

<p>I have to say, we seem to have some confusion in the discussions above between "British" (the subject of this article) and "English" empire-building. The first English empire building long pre-dated Ireland and includes the invasions of Wales, Scotland and parts of what is now France. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 19:29, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

A basic problem is, When does Britain appear as a political reality? The concept was around in the late 16thC in John Dee's writings, and the movers and shakers at Elizabeth's court used the term in the 1590s, as they teed James VI up for the succession. Then you get the union of crowns in 1603, and union of parliaments in 1707.

As for the specifics of your contribution: the fact is that it was clearly explained to you why your addition was deemed inappropriate: if it was a case of <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> and me "ganging up" on you and reverting something that is appropriate, then other editors would chime in and either restore your text, or contribute to the debate on the talk page and say so.

There is no Debate, you keep on deleting it without Debate, or with cited sources with proof discrediting the infomation from the University Text. It is well researched from major north american universities, and also used by them. It's upto you to discredit it with Sourced Proof, no just saying you don't agree with research information.

<dd>On the assume good faith principle that the words are quoted accurately and in context, I'm not sure about the wording of the mention, nor about its placing in the lead paragraph. It seems to be making a point in a way not appropriate to a neutral article, and a point which is a questionable one. The article on <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">Empire</a> starts by saying how difficult it is to define. The assertion that the British "created violence to take what it wanted" is very questionable; the British Empire hardly aimed to create violence within itself once it was established. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 23:09, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with Sam. Gsd2000 was at least right to put the brakes on Cosmos. With edits that should be discussed beforehand, the 3RR rule is one more honoured in the breach than the observance. The original text of the reverted edit suggests that the book in question is not being summarised accurately - the 'backwardness' paragraph contradicts itself.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 23:16, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is another quote from this contributor/source that is remaining in the article: "<small>However, the fight for control of India was not a conventional one. European powers at the time were simultaneously backwards in terms of their administration, their bureaucracies, and in terms of their military technologies. The resultant of "backwardness made it difficult for any one state to overwhelm the others and create in empire like that in China or India”. European powers were advanced in terms of naval military technologies, and had good weapons to protect their ships at sea, which allowed them to project force into the Indian Ocean.</small>" Again this is odd: if India wasn't one, what <i>is</i> a "conventional" fight? European powers were "simultaneously backwards" when this was a time of Europeans dominating the world? The rest may be true, but I'm not sure it's really relevant in the first paragraph of a section on the British East India Company. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 23:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, that is a weird addition. I agree that India was not a conventional "fight" (assuming this means "military conquest") - most of it was taken over by the East India company without a plan or an organized campaign. It was only taken under direct Crown control much later. But the rest of the comment is weird. Europe was certainly not backwards with respect to military technology, whether Naval or on land. Admininstration and bureaucracy may have been more advanced in China, but probably not in most of the rest of the world. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 23:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

Furthermore, the description says "Bringing together 33 specially commissioned chapters by leading scholars in politics, economic, and international relations, this book provides an authoritative introduction to the theory and practice of international economic relations in the post-Cold War world." - so this isn't even a text <i>about</i> the British Empire, let alone the period in question. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 00:29, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nice! I didn't know that "search" gives you pages not in the normal preview. Anyways, according to that search, the term "British Empire" occurs exactly once (there is another occurance of the "French Empire" following the lead of the "British"). And the one occurrence is in relation to post-cold-war guerrilla war.

<p>THAT LINK POSTED TO THE BOOK ABOVE, TO WHICH YOU FORMED A “CONSENUES”, IT'S FROM THE 1994 VERSION OF THE SAME BOOK. NICE TRY, DO YOUR HOMEWORK.</p>
<p>THEY ARE ABOUT 30 CHAPTERS IN EACH VERSION OF THE BOOK, FROM YEAR TO YEAR. A DIFFERENT AUTHOR WRITES FOR EACH CHAPTER, IN THEIR SPEICALIZED FIELDS.... MAKES ANY SENSE???? DON’T MAKE FALSE AND BASELESS ACCUSTIONS.</p>
<p>I took the paper and paraphrased, summarized, and sourced with quotes (If your in University, you’ll do this when you write 15-25 pages in something called a RESEARCH PAPER).....</p>

<dd>I think this discussion will benefit more from light into the contentious text than heat between editors. Cosmos, perhaps you could make a more formal proposal for what you want to include in the article? Very often a disputed claim, if worded slightly differently and toned down, becomes acceptable.

We don’t need multiple sources. This is from a <b>widely used University textbook</b>, which you had a vote on bias, FALSE information [based on 1994 edition], mine is one of the 2005 version I believe. Go buy the book yourself or check it out at the library. Did you read this???....</p>
<p>"I took the <b>paper</b>, I <b>paraphrased, summarized</b>, and <b>sourced with quotes</b> (If your in University, you’ll do this when you write 15-25 pages in something called a <b>Research Paper</b>)..."</p>
<p>If you guys dispute the <b>accuracy</b> of the content, the bearing is on you to <b>discredit</b> it with <b>relevant sources</b> directly <b>supporting your position</b>. I have given a paper derived from a widely used University Textbook, complied from research based on studies (and sourced) from MIT, Cambridge University, Cornell, etc.. It's all in the book.</p>
<p>I’m now thinking instead of creating a <b>Criticism section</b> over the next couple of weeks because there are many issues where scholars have raised as the British army with hiring Indian soldiers (Sepoy’s: 270,000 [1857]) to fight their own people. That’s one topic and there are at least 10 more I will cover.</p>
<p>Also I will be going threw the whole article to put fact needed symbol because this whole page doesn’t have any sources linked to 95% of the content.</p>

Sorry, I don't have the book anymore, I actually sold it and got the condensed version with multiple sources complied and thought it would have been good enough, because it is out of my <b>university notes</b>, which had <b>sources and references</b>.</p>
<p>First...I wouldn’t call it plagiarism or misreporting, because <b>I stand by my statement</b> because this is a <b>research notes</b> complied from my professor did when she at McGill University and see used <b>her research combined with a few other texts</b>. My professor made her notes for us by <b>paraphrasing</b>, using her own research and other sources supporting her view with <b>different sources</b>. That does not make it a lie, and again, I stand by it.</p>
<p>Second...If you read the whole book it also dealt and direct quote where it says “they organized this theft through the Dutch and British East India Company”, which I believe needs further input in the ‘’’Criticism’’’ section I will be adding in and expanding in the coming weeks (economic exploitation, slavery, using native soldiers in Asia, Africa, and the America’s, etc.).</p>
<p>Third...Finally, this whole article has a bias/ favoring a certain view, and there are no Citations for 95% of the information on this page. The links said to be sources are few lines at most. I’m adding a source tags for citations also because there are none corresponding to many facts.</p>

<dd>Cosmos146, let's take a look at your <b>Third</b>, <b>Fourth</b>, and especially <b>FIRST</b> points.</dd>
<dd><b>First</b>: Regarding your source. I think <i>her research combined with a few other texts</i> would be what we call "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">original research</a>".</dd>
<dd><b>Third</b>: Regarding the style of the article, it might be biased in your opinion, but the article is actually pretty neutral and avoids making the kind of value judgements you have been inserting. This is also partly why there are so few in-line citations - there is little need for them. However, I will concede that there are a few assertions which needs to be referenced.</dd>
<dd><b>Fourth</b>: Although this is irrelevant to the article, I understand that Uber originally interceded on your behalf. I didn't see you complaining about him then...</dd>
<dd>You've already discredited yourself and your proposal to insert a section dealing with material already covered by the article, but slanted to reflect your personal <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">opinion</a>, does not inspire confidence. Wikipedia is not a forum for you to express your prejudice behind a facade of unbalanced misquotes from selected critics. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 21:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd also like to mention that UBeR and I are on opposite ends as far as this rather <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Reigning_in_Uber.27s_trolling" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">unrelated issue</a> is concerned. In my opinion, it's fine to avoid eurocentrism, or even to be politically correct, but not at the expense of being <i>actually</i> correct. The British Empire is hardly unique in greedily grabbing what it could get. And it is certainly not unique in using native troops and fostering dissent among its opponents - in fact, if I got this information as part of a quiz question, my first guess would be the Byzantine Empire (but it's trivial to find examples of just this behaviour for e.g. the Persian, the Roman and the Austrian Empires). --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 22:53, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"First...I wouldn’t call it plagiarism or misreporting, because <b>I stand by my statement</b> because this is a <b>research notes</b> complied from my professor did when she at McGill University and see used <b>her research combined with a few other texts</b>. My professor made her notes for us by <b>paraphrasing</b>, using her own research and other sources supporting her view with <b>different sources</b>. That does not make it a lie, and again, I stand by it."</p>
<p>Don't try and discredit something before it even is posted, that's showing your bias with flying colours. The Criticism section is going in, and they is absolutely no reason why it shouldn’t. There are many articles research about economic exploitation, slavery, using native soldiers in Asia, Africa, also charge of Eurocentrism, and instances of History distortion, including achievements. These are important things for people to know so they don't get a one sided view.</p>
<p>Also, you and others You should starting putting in sources for 95% of the information that needs sourcing, cause I'm starting to add tags for sources where ever it is needed.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hold on.. let me get this straight. I am in disbelief here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, you wrote, at least twice, "My version of the BOOK IS A FEW YEARS OLD" and then you told us that you "took the paper...paraphrased...summarized, and sourced with quotes (If your in University, you’ll do this when you write 15-25 pages in something called a <b>Research Paper</b>)..."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then, after we actually locate said text, and find you have completely misquoted it, you change your story thus: "this is a research notes complied from my professor did when she at McGill University and see used her research combined with a few other texts. My professor made her notes for us by paraphrasing, using her own research and other sources supporting her view with different sources."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That means, you never even read the text for yourself. I'll say this to you again: you should be ashamed of yourself. You have committed the worst possible sin in academia: lying. Lying about your research and your sources. The icing on the cake is that you were simultaneously insulting your fellow editors <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGsd2000&amp;diff=112491055&amp;oldid=112423863" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGsd2000&amp;diff=112491055&amp;oldid=112423863" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 00:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did <b>read</b> the book, but like I said I <b>sold</b> it. I used the <b>researched notes</b> complied on her own research, and several other sources with deals with many aspects of which like I said I will go into the <b>Criticism</b> section. You keep repeating yourself over.</p>

<dd>That is <i>totally out of order</i>, and taken totally out of context (seems to be a recurring theme with you).

It’s not totally out of order, because your posting personal messages to on the board, and you did it first, so it’s fair game. Last time I’m going to ask you stop attacking me, then I report you because I explained myself several times, and since I can’t write out my whole research notes, you assume a more baseless view. That’s fine, but please keep it to yourself. You keep harassing people, and then claiming your being harassed.</p>
<p>This will not be your playground for your attacks on me, so I repeat, last time I asking you. Stop with theses childish games. Don’t make anymore disparaging comments against user(s). Help expand the Criticism section I’ve already started, so we can make it more transparent, and let’s be productive, and get everything that needs a source, sourced.</p>

<dd>But it is an issue, especially with history articles. An article on technology or on recent political controversies really has to have a citation for every other line (although, in my experience, many are out of date and lead nowhere). But in a history article, much depends on synthesis of the sources, so inline (or in-paragraph) citation can get complicated.</dd>
<dd>At a minimum, quotations and distinct opinions must be cited immediately. Beyond that, I'm not sure. Insistence on citation of sources for every assertion of fact would take WP beyond its role as a tertiary source. There are policy pages devoted to the various difficulties raised here, but I haven't seen any one dealing with the peculiar problems of compiling history for WP.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 02:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>No, anything remotely that sounds like a fact needs a citation. Go down the page, look at the body of information, and there is no corresponding facts for almost all of the information given. That's suspicious and needs to be fixed. If no accurate or reliable sourced is determined, it will be removed.</p>
<p>You can compare lots of articles, but you need specific citations as other history articles on wikipedia has, there are virtually none corresponding to the vast amounts of information, that's what I mean by 95%. You don't want a one-sided view, right? You r fighting so much for sources, and your right, we do need to source facts. Additionally, we need to add more to the article to make it more transparent, like adding in the Criticism section, and also more into the Economic aspect also including slavery and exploitation.</p>

<dd>This is the first time I've seen the attribution/citation point raised in a general way for history articles - and I think UBeR is right, but it's a tricky situation. As far as I can tell, WP policy requires inline citation for quotes, academic opinions, and for assertions of fact to which the editor might reasonably anticipate a challenge. The first two categories are not a problem, but the third is. I agree with Wiki-ed on that.</dd>
<dd>Most of the stuff I've posted is historical biography, with very few inline citations - the articles rely on reference sections, naming the books from which I took notes to compile the various entires. So, when I compare my contributions to one of my most used sources, the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_National_Biography_5c24.html" title="Dictionary of National Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a>, it's clear that WP is a lesser source. But in providing inline citations the DNB is almost invariably referring to primary sources. WP only claims to be a tertiary source - a report of what the experts say about the particular subject.</dd>
<dd>UBeR put a non-attribution tag on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Empire_72b4.html" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish Empire</a>, which is a good article. But he is making a sound point.

<p>Actually - I'm starting to think we've gone overboard here. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: "Attribution is required for direct quotes and for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged." The vast majority of this text is uncontentious and easily confirmed in the most cursory of texts about the British Empire. True, there are some weasel words and a some POV leaking in (these should be removed, Wiki-Ed has already done a bit), but neither user - <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> nor the other chap - who added the tag has actually challenged <i>any</i> specific fact in the article (I might also add, it doesn't look like they're going to help out either finding sources). The fact is that this article <i>does</i> cite its sources - anyone can look in any of those books listed in the References section and confirm the facts. Just to requote the policy: "Attribution is required for <i>direct quotes</i> and for <i>material that is challenged</i> or <i>likely to be challenged</i>." So again, I think we have gone overboard. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 14:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course I agree with you that the article is relatively non-contentious, but the key words from the policy are "<b>likely</b> to be challenged". We cannot guess what certain people might challenge but we can't go wrong by assuming that they will challenge everything because they won't read the referenced sources. Although I think you're right that my tagging is going "overboard", I see no harm in tightening up the writing and sourcing statements where applicable. It should save time in the long term. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a> 20:24, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. I still think though that - now the article is pretty much written already - it's more efficient to cross each bridge as we come to it (ie as and when each fact is challenged) - than to go through and guess what facts <i>might</i> be challenged. (This article has existed in its current state for a long long time, and I haven't seen many facts challenged). Also, if he doesn't have the books to dip into to find references, I encourage <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> to help out by challenging some specific facts. It's too easy to swoop in and add tags at the tops of articles. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 21:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, the subject of references was discussed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/British_Empire" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">peer review</a>. And, it's a "good article". Keep the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> things in there , but I move to remove the tag at the top. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 21:54, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I think you are misunderstanding the policies and my purpose here. First of all, there is no need for any contention here; my purpose is to benefit the article. Already, we have seen improvements. Articles are scrutinized not to desecrate them, but rather to aid them into making <a href="../../../p/e/r/WP%7EPERFECT_2407.html" title="WP:PERFECT">great articles</a>.</dd>

<dd>While you're right that quotations and material likely to be challenged absolutely have to be sourced, also note, "<b>Any edit lacking attribution may be removed, and the final burden of evidence lies with the editor wishing to add or retain the material. . . . If you encounter a harmless statement that lacks attribution, you can tag it with the {{fact}} template, or move it to the article's talk page with a comment requesting attribution. If the whole article or an entire section is unsourced, you can use the {{unreferenced}} template. Absurd unsourced claims and original research should be deleted rather than tagged or moved to a talk page.</b>" The problem isn't that there aren't sources which confirm the information; the problem is that references are not being attributed or used correctly within the article (however, as I noted, this is being improved upon). ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 22:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I go against UBeR for the moment. Quotations must be attributed immediately. Academic opinions too. That's clear. And facts 'likely to be challenged' ought to be attributed - but this issue is only raised when the challenge actually happens: and so the WP-litigation begins.</dd>
<dd>The policy pages seem unclear on the rules of litigation. First, there's <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivocation.html" title="Equivocation">Equivocation</a> in the use of the terms Attribution and Sourced. Second, there's no guidance given for broad historial subjects - this article, for example, where the sources themselves are summaries of fact and don't rely on primary sources. Third, there is an argument from policy (the "appalling vista"): if inline citation is demanded for every summary of fact (read as, fact that is likely to be challenged), then almost every historical article that hasn't been subjected to the finest WP admin scrutiny could be unpicked and reduced to a stub. Perhaps that's in WP's long-term interest (Jimbo Wales reckons Brittannica will be 'crushed' within five years - Great! A competing source of knowledge sent packing. Buh-wah-ha-ha!)</dd>
<dd>In the end, I wonder what is the proper attribution of a source in a paragraph that broadly syntheses knowledge on a subject spanning decades or centuries? I've tried to be precise in addressing the issue, but it's tricky. Look at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html#Sources" title="Talk:British Isles">Talk:British Isles#Sources</a>, where there's an ongoing debate about the origins of the term, which involves a broad view of history informed by piecemeal sources.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 01:23, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sentence in the first para, "British influence remains strong throughout the world, such as in economic practice, legal and governmental systems, militarily, society, sports (such as cricket and football), educational systems, and the English language itself.", should - I think - be expanded upon in the final Legacy section of this article.
