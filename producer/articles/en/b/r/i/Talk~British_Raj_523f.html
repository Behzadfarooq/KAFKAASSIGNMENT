<p>Can we avoid the usage of the term "Myanmar" in the article.

<p>From what I see, this entire entry is about the war of Indian independence. There is hardly any mention of the creation of the Raj, governance, or duties. When were they created? By whom? Where there main areas that had a Raj or did each village? Were any famous/infamous?</p>
<p>The only information relevant to the Raj is contained in the summary.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts.</p>
<p>--Backward 17:07, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it has very little on the day-to-day aspects of British rule - it needs massive expansion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 16:12, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It should be noted that only the Ganges region burst into open revolt. Additionally only one of the three mainly Indian armies in India revolted, the Bengali army, of which the majority of troops were from Awadh (Oudh). Outside of Bengal and the Ganges regions the rest of the Indian Subconinent did not revolt and were crucial in putting down the revolution based out of Lucknow and Delhi.</p>
<p>-- in response to Backawrd's comments: this article is not about the Indian War for Independence, it is about the "British Raj" which was an informal (but widely accepted) term for direct rule over india by Britan, it was NOT a person per se. During this time period the King or Queen of Great Britain was the Emperor or Empress of India who was represented by a Viceroy (Governor General).</p>
<p>-- I agree that this article is rather lacking. The Mutiny was certainly a pivotal point in the history of British India but doesn't justify taking up 1/2 the article. I admire whoever takes it on though as I'm sure it will start 1000 revert wars. Epeeist smudge 12:12, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since "British Raj" is "an <i>informal</i> term" for British rule in India, is it the most appropriate title for an encyclopedia entry? In addition, the term Raj is not well known outside the former British Empire even among English speakers (e.g, USA, South America, East Asia). What about "British India" or "British South Asia"? Certainly either of these would need to be qualified (e.g., in regards to Ceylon/Burma) but this is already a part of the introductory definition.</p>
<p>If the British Raj is the Informal term, what the Hell is the Formal terms for British rule in South East Asia. Your recommendation of British India or British South Asia certainly isnt the "FORMAL" term. If people dont know British Raj or Hindustan they better learn. After all wikipedia is about learning. If British India or British South Asia can be "qualified" why cant Hindustan or British Raj be explained??</p>

<dd>I agree. I came to this article wondering, "What on earth is a <i>Raj</i>, exactly?" And the article as it now stands does not answer that question at all.~Sylvain 11/14/05</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why dont u pick up a dictionary, any English Dictionary for that matter. Even though Raj wasnt originally an "English" word it surely was after the British rule in Asia. There are many English words that were not originally part of the english but have become so. Wikipedias aim should be to be accuracte and precise. it shouldnt uneccessarily be dumbed down. Sorry guys i feel strongly about this.</p>
<p>Raja = King, Raj = verb= the act of ruling. When the British used the word Raj they meant the British Kindom (coz Kindom is a place where one engages in the act of ruling). Since Raj is a hindustani word, the Kingdom referred to this particular region and not any part of the empire. If you guys are so hung up on "Raj" even though it is the authentic manner to refer to that part of the empire than you could use British Hindustan. This term was common at the time.</p>
<p>It appears the article used to be called british india and was changes for some reason.~pure inuyasha</p>
<p>British India is a more appropriate title for this page, however a redirect should <b>definately</b> be kept for British Raj. That term is still used quite frequently, but not as much as British India. <b><font color="darkblue"><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza">D</a></font><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">a</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="lightblue">Gizza</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="orange">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="gold">(c)</font></a></b></sup> 10:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What the?? British Raj is the common name for the part of the British empire including pakistan, india, bangladesh and burma not British India. And British India gives the wrong idea that the British Empire consisted only of India. It also includes Pakistan and Bangladesh and Burma.</p>
<ul>

<p><i>If people dont know British Raj or Hindustan they better learn. After all wikipedia is about learning.</i></p>
<p><br />
whats so hard about knowing what raj means? i've known since the age of 12! for shame! Manjot D.</p>
<p>Absolutely correct. People should be able to look up something by a clear, concise title and then learn. I could <b>look up</b> "British India" and <b>learn</b> that it was "informally called the British Raj."</p>
<p><i>Why cant...British Raj be explained??</i></p>
<p>I can and should be (and should definitely have a redirect) but it doesn't need to be the title of the article.</p>
<p><i>Why dont u pick up a dictionary, any English Dictionary for that matter.</i></p>
<p>I did. I picked up <i>New Webster's Dictionary</i> (abr.) and "raj" was not listed. I picked up the <i>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</i> and it said "raj" means "sovereignty." British sovereignty? Where? That didn't help much. For the 300+ million (30+ <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crore.html" title="Crore">crore</a>) native speakers and 1 billion+ non-native learners of North American (US) English, "raj" is a largely unknown term. Should these people be educated? Absolutely. Does it need to be the title? Not necessarily.</p>
<p><i>And British India gives the wrong idea that the British Empire consisted only of India.</i></p>
<p>It might. However, so does <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_India_d42c.html" title="History of India">History of India</a> before 1947. And <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_empires_in_India_0ab3.html" title="Islamic empires in India">Islamic empires in India</a> . And <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Independence_Movement_89be.html" title="Indian Independence Movement">Indian Independence Movement</a>. And... -- this problem is dealt with in the first sentence of the current article. (If it's too unpalatable, what about "British South Asia"?)</p>
<p>Check out these two sentences -- the current 1st sentence of the article followed by an alternate.</p>
<p><i>The British Raj is an informal term for the British colonial administration of most of the Indian subcontinent, or present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; also included from 1886 was Burma.</i></p>
<p><i>British India or, informally, the British Raj, is a term for the British colonial administration of most of the Indian subcontinent, or present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; also included from 1886 was Burma.</i></p>
<p>Now was that really so painful?</p>

<p>I wasn't aware that Raj was the "informal" term. I thought it was just the term, in general, with the other terms mentioned here equally suitable alternatives. I think the solution is probably to remove the word 'informal' from the intro and just have redirects for terms that seem obvious. that way you can find the article whether you know the term Raj or not. As for the title itself, I see no problem with the use of "Raj" . the idea that a specific and somewhat specialist term like 'Raj' shouldn't be used because people might not be familiar with it is silly. Then what should we call articles about "Dadaism" or "Napoleonic Code"? If you lack either a basic vocabulary or the ability to do simple research, maybe you should stick to the "simplified english" area of wikipedia. I'm officially taking 'informal' out of the intro.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Caledonia_f61a.html" title="New Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> is coloured British, in utter error.</li>
<li>The British shpere of interest in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Honduras_dc08.html" title="British Honduras">British Honduras</a> shows only areas in the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_of_Honduras_e4e0.html" title="Bay of Honduras">Bay of Honduras</a>, but not the claims on the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosquito_Coast_5cfd.html" title="Mosquito Coast">Mosquito Coast</a>. Possibly, a similar scenario applies for the British claims to the <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guyanas.html" title="Guyanas">Guyanas</a>. But maybe these claims where abandoned by 1921...</li>
<li>As for Burma, I'm not sure, but apparently it was split off to form a separate administrative colonial unit early on.</li>

<p>Thanks for the map! Burma was a province of British India from 1853 to 1937; Aden was part of British India from 1839 to 1937, so the map is accurate as far as Burma is concerned, although the Aden colony should be purple as well. Aden colony did not include all of present-day Yemen; the northern portion remained an independent state. Afghanistan was not part of the British Empire. Lebanon and New Caledonia were French colonies, not British. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Radulovich_3e4e.html" title="User:Tom Radulovich">Tom Radulovich</a> 18:09, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was mistaken regarding the Mosquito Coast Colony. It had already been ceded to the Republic of Nicaragua by the time this map indicates (1921). Also, the claims in the Guyanas had been consolidated to include only British Guyana. <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 18:12, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>a map showing the boundaries of Aden Colony, including the Aden Protectorate, can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LocationSouthYemen.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LocationSouthYemen.png" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and here: <a href="http://www.worldstatesmen.org/south_yemen.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldstatesmen.org/south_yemen.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As far as Afghanistan goes, it really was independent; although the British occupied Kabul in the 19th century, their army was devastated by the Pashtuns, and only one soldier survived. Don't know what the Times Survey Atlas of the World is up to; wishful thinking, perhaps? [Image:British_Empire_Anachronous_4.PNG] shows it in the same red color as the eastern USA and southern Oregon Country, which may indicate territories held and lost, or, as in the case of southern Oregon Country, a lapsed claim. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Radulovich_3e4e.html" title="User:Tom Radulovich">Tom Radulovich</a> 16:47, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"At the same time, the British abolished the British East India Company and replaced it with direct rule under the British Crown, and so began the greatest exploitation of the greatest number of people, and what prior to the colonial era, was the largest internal economy, reducing the share of India's GDP output by the end of this 90 year old oppression, a share reduced from 30% in the 1700s, to 3% in 1947."</p>
<p>This sounds as if the informatin it is trying to convey is probably interesting and important, but as it stands the last 3/4 of the sentence (from "and so began") is totally confusing to me, and i suspect others as well.

<p>British Raj → <b>British India</b> – For several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The term raj is vague. As noted <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Raj_523f.html#Raj_is_just_rule" title="Talk:British Raj">above</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raj" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raj" rel="nofollow">raj just means "rule"</a> and doesn't specify time or place. (Also, <i>cf.</i> "<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Raj_b008.html" title="Scottish Raj">Scottish Raj</a>" where raj is used to mean a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clique.html" title="Clique">clique</a> or faction. <b>British India</b> is more specific.</li>
<li>The term raj for a title is an informal colloquialism and unencyclopedic. (Note, the <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal_Raj_8cb5.html" title="Mughal Raj">Mughal Raj</a> article is titled <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal_Empire_c07c.html" title="Mughal Empire">Mughal Empire</a>. Also, cf. "<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Raj_b008.html" title="Scottish Raj">Scottish Raj</a>" where raj is clearly informal.) <b>British India</b> is more encyclopedic.</li>
<li>The term raj is not universally used in English (i.e., not in US English). While many terms in Wikipedia are not universal, there is no reason to use one when <b>British India</b> is clear in all forms of English.</li>

<p>Possible objections are that "British India...prior to Independence...referred only to those portions of the subcontinent under direct rule." However, 60 years after independence, this is increasingly irrelevant and that quote which appears in the opening paragraph easily clarifies things. A possible first sentence could be <i>"<b>British India</b> or, informally, the <b>British Raj</b>, is a term for lands under the colonial control of Britain as part of the British Empire including most of the Indian subcontinent, or present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; also included from 1886 was Burma (now Mynamar)."</i></p>

<dd>The proper (and increasingly archaic) sense of British India vis-à-vis <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princely_States_24dd.html" title="Princely States">Princely States</a> already has an article under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_India_003a.html" title="Provinces of India">Provinces of India</a>. If a <i>raj</i> <i><b>is</b></i> India (which I'm not sure it is), why not use India for the main article?

<p>It lacks the important aspects of the British rule of India, such as the economics, political, and social aspects. Half the article appears to be about the Indian independence from British rule. Issues like opium farming in India aren't even mentioned at all. This article is very present-day India-centric and POV. It needs to be vastly expanded and restructured.</p>

<p>There seems to me to be too much on Subhas Chandra Bose and the INA in this article versus the rest of the freedom movement. The current version makes it look rather as if Bose defeated the Raj. I've tried to introduce a bit of NPOV (debolding his name, for a start), but the whole thing seems pretty unbalanced. -- <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinaSparkle_3b36.html" title="User:TinaSparkle">TinaSparkle</a> 01:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no mention of the impact on Inda. The starvations that killed tens of millions, the deindustrialization of India... The article contains the following; "Economic historians estimate that India commanded roughly 25% of world GDP by 1800, but perhaps a tenth of that by the 20th century, due in large part to the severe and rapid decline in the Subcontinent's native industries.", but no explanation to why. Someone with deeper knowledge of the subject might want to share.</p>
