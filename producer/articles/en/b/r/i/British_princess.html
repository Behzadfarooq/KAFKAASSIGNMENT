<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_princess.html" title="Edit section: Princesses of the blood royal and princesses by marriage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Princesses of the blood royal and princesses by marriage</span></h2>
<p>Under the current practice, princesses of the blood royal are the legitimate daughters and the legitmate male line granddaughters of a <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_United_Kingdom_2421.html" title="King of the United Kingdom">British Sovereign</a>. They are dynasts, that is potential successors to the throne. For these individuals, the title "Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" and the style "Her Royal Highness" is an entitlement for life. The title Princess and the style <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Highness_b587.html" title="Royal Highness">Royal Highness</a> is prefixed to the Christian name, before another title of honour. From 1714 until 1917, the male-line great granddaughters of the Sovereign were titled "Princess of Great Britain and Ireland" with the style "Highness". Since 1917, the male-line great granddaughters of the Sovereign, have held "the style and title enjoyed by the children of dukes". For example, the daughters of the current <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Richard%2C_Duke_of_Gloucester_711e.html" title="Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>, a male line grandson of George V, are styled <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Davina_Lewis_6545.html" title="Lady Davina Lewis">The Lady Davina Lewis</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Rose_Windsor_2c52.html" title="Lady Rose Windsor">The Lady Rose Windsor</a>.</p>
<p>Princesses by marriage are the recognized wives of the Sovereign's sons and grandsons. Generally, these women are entitled to the style Royal Highness by virtue of marriage. They retain the style during their widowhood. However, Queen Elizabeth II issued Letters Patent dated <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">21 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> stating that any woman divorced from a Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland with the style "Royal Highness" would no longer be entitled to the style "Royal Highness". This has so far applied to <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales_d703.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">HRH The Princess of Wales</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah%2C_Duchess_of_York_f2e4.html" title="Sarah, Duchess of York">HRH The Duchess of York</a>.</p>
<p>Since the passage of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Marriages_Act_1772_f699.html" title="Royal Marriages Act 1772">Royal Marriages Act 1772</a>, there have been several instances in which princes of the blood contracted marriages in contravention of that act (which meant they were not legally married) and several instances in which the Sovereign withheld the style "Her Royal Highness" from a prince's wife deemed to be unsuitable. For example, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George%2C_Duke_of_Cambridge_f142.html" title="Prince George, Duke of Cambridge">Prince George, Duke of Cambridge</a>, a male-line grandson of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a>, married Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act. Although morganatic marriage did not exist in British law, the duke's wife was never titled the Duchess of Cambridge or accorded the style "Her Royal Highness". Instead, she was known as "Mrs FitzGeorge". Most famously, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a> issued Letters Patent dated <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> that entitled <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">The Duke of Windsor</a> "to hold and enjoy for himself only the title style or attribute of Royal Highness so however that his wife and descendants if any shall not hold the said title style or attribute".</p>
<p>The wife of a prince of the blood takes her husband's Christian name in her title as do all married royal women. For example, upon her marriage to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Michael_of_Kent_c15c.html" title="Prince Michael of Kent">Prince Michael of Kent</a> in 1978, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Michael_of_Kent_102b.html" title="Princess Michael of Kent">Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz</a> assumed the title and style of "Her Royal Highness Princess Michael of Kent". Similarly, upon her marriage to then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Richard%2C_Duke_of_Gloucester_711e.html" title="Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester">Prince Richard of Gloucester</a>, the former <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birgitte%2C_The_Duchess_of_Gloucester_36fc.html" title="Birgitte, The Duchess of Gloucester">Birgitte van Deurs</a> assumed the title and style of "Her Royal Highness Princess Richard of Gloucester".</p>
<p>The situation is slightly different when a woman is married to a prince who happens to be a peer or the Prince of Wales. Upon marriage, the wife of the Prince of Wales becomes "Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales". Upon marriage, the wife of a royal duke (or earl) becomes "Her Royal Highness The Duchess (or Countess) of X". When Prince Richard of Gloucester succeeded to his father's dukedom in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, his wife became "Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_princess.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The use of the titles prince and princess and the styles of Highness and Royal Highness for members of the Royal Family is of fairly recently usage in the British Isles. Before 1714, there was no settled practice regarding the use of the titles prince and princess other than the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">heir apparent</a> and his wife. From <a href="../../../1/3/0/1301.html" title="1301">1301</a> onward, the eldest sons of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_the_monarchs_of_the_Kingdom_of_England_c020.html" title="List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England">Kings of England</a> (and later Great Britain and the United Kingdom) have generally been created <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales_d14a.html" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester</a>. Their wives were titled <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_of_Wales_d6c9.html" title="Princess of Wales">Princess of Wales</a>.</p>
<p>The title <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Royal_0697.html" title="Princess Royal">Princess Royal</a> came into being in 1642 when <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrietta_Maria_of_France_9c53.html" title="Henrietta Maria of France">Queen Henrietta Maria</a>, the French-born wife of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I</a>, wished to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French King was styled (<i>Madame Royale</i>). However, there was no settled practice on the use of the title princess for the Sovereign's younger daughters or male-line granddaughters. For example, as late as the time of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">King Charles II</a>, the daughters of his brother <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James, Duke of York</a>, both of whom became queens regnant, were called simply "The Lady Mary" and "The Lady Anne." The future <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a> was styled princess in her marriage treaty to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George_of_Denmark_fa15.html" title="Prince George of Denmark">Prince George of Denmark</a> and then styled "Princess Anne of Denmark" once married.</p>
<p>After the accession of George I of Hanover, the princely titles were changed to follow the German practice. The children, grandchildren, and male line great grandchildren of the British Sovereign were automatically titled "Prince or Princess of Great Britain and Ireland" and styled "Royal Highness" (in the case of children and grandchildren) or "Highness" (in the case of male line great grandchilren). <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> confirmed this practice in Letters Patent dated <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">30 January</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a> (the first Act of the Prerogative dealing with the princely title in general terms).</p>

<ul>
<li>Daughters of sovereigns- HRH The Princess "X"</li>
<li>Granddaughters of sovereigns- HRH Princess "X" of "Y", where "Y" is the territorial designation of their father’s peerages, eg HRH <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Alexandra_of_Kent_d6d4.html" title="Princess Alexandra of Kent">Princess Alexandra of Kent</a>.</li>
<li>Wife of a son of the Sovereign or male line grandson of the Sovereign- "HRH Princess Husband's Christian Name" (if her husband is not a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_of_the_realm.html" title="Peer of the realm">peer of the realm</a>) or "HRH The Duchess/Countess of X." (otherwise)</li>
<li>A Princess Royal is normally styled HRH The Princess Royal.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a princess marries, she still takes on her husband's title. If the title is higher than the one she possesses, she will normally be styled using the female equivalent. If her husband has a peerage, she may well be styled, HRH Princess X, and then the female equivalent of the peerage, for example <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Louise%2C_Duchess_of_Argyll_b744.html" title="Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll">HRH The Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Alice%2C_Countess_of_Athlone_d605.html" title="Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone">HRH Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone</a>.</p>

<p>The following women married a Royal Prince but as their marriages were invalid under the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Marriages_Act_1772_f699.html" title="Royal Marriages Act 1772">Royal Marriages Act 1772</a>, they did not become Princesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Anne_Fitzherbert_1ee0.html" title="Maria Anne Fitzherbert">Maria Anne Fitzherbert</a>, married <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_62b2.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George, Prince of Wales</a> in 1785</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Augusta_Murray_9fea.html" title="Lady Augusta Murray">Lady Augusta Murray</a>, married <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Augustus_Frederick%2C_Duke_of_Sussex_c853.html" title="Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex">Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex</a> in 1793</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecilia_Underwood%2C_Duchess_of_Inverness_b27f.html" title="Cecilia Underwood, Duchess of Inverness">Lady Cecilia Buggin</a>, married <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Augustus_Frederick%2C_Duke_of_Sussex_c853.html" title="Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex">Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex</a>. She was later created <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchess_of_Inverness_8484.html" title="Duchess of Inverness">Duchess of Inverness</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Louisa_Fairbrother_c3cf.html" title="Sarah Louisa Fairbrother">Sarah Louisa Fairbrother</a>, married <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George%2C_Duke_of_Cambridge_f142.html" title="Prince George, Duke of Cambridge">Prince George, Duke of Cambridge</a> in 1847</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the status of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallis_Simpson_0939.html" title="Wallis Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a> as a princess is questionable. She married the Duke of Windsor in 1937. Although he was a British prince with the style <i>His Royal Highness</i>, King George VI passed letters patent which denied the style HRH to any wife of the Duke and also to his descendants. It is not clear if this would have denied the title of Princess to Wallis, although as her husband had a peerage, she was always styled as <i>Duchess of Windsor</i>.</p>
