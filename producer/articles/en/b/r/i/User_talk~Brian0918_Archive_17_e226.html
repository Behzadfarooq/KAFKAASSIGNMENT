<p>Hello, thank you for you assitance, but I have a question. How can I add sources to such things as video game characters? The information I put on their pages are directly from the game itself. I get why I would need them for the pages I created for Final Fantasy V characters, since they have stats you wouldn't know from playing the game (and I meant to put sources but I just kinda forgot) but for the ones I created for Final Fantasy 2, everything there I got directly for the game. Is it ok to simply say that I got the information from the game? Thank you -Midna 16:14, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. The information in this article came from a class I took at an accredited university. I don't have time to find written sources which confirm it. I hope someone else has the time to do so. I have a book called "Introduction to the Physics of Electrons in Solids" by Tanner that uses the term "pinning of the domain wall", but it does not define it. You could probably find a definition of the term in a book on magnetic materials. Leroybrown 17:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>For a couple of weeks now, I have been experimenting with Firefox myself. Its poorly implimented ctrl-F mechanism has quickly become my #1 complaint. I was curious, since Firefox touts itself as being the most customizable browser on the face of the earth (or something like that), whether there is likely to be a easily obtained plug-in to patch over that issue? I presently find myself using Firefox strictly for reverting vandalism, yet still relying on IE to make "constructive" edits. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freakofnurture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freakofnurture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> 19:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firefox used to be able to search within an edit box. Unfortunately, that capability disappeared when I upgraded from from v.0.92 to v.1.05. Still, I'd never go back to M$IE. I've used either Firefox or Opera exclusively for the last three years except for doing Windows Updates (and for awhile, a genealogy website that wouldn't work unless you used M$IE). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 20:12, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. Recently several Wikipedians, myself included, have set up a multitude of portals for various religions, with a view to having a portal for each major faith. I realise that atheism/secularism/agnosticism is also a major system of thought, so perhaps it would deserve a portal of its own. Would you be interested? If so, I would be happy to provide initial assistance in setting it up etc. If any atheists would be interested in maintaining/updating the portal, which would include rotating "Featured Atheist", "Featured Article" and "Featured Picture" sections every few weeks/months, that would be great. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrisvegas_f939.html" title="User:Brisvegas">Brisvegas</a> 01:32, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the comments on Owslebury. I've tried to update with some sources now. However, some of the basic stuff is based on direct observation - i.e. it has a pub, I know this as I've drunk there. Wasn't sure if that counted as "original research", but thought it was easily verifiable, not contested and could be included?</p>
<p>On the issues of "Marwell" being referred to as a Hamlet, I was even less sure - I lived there, and my family and neighbours used to term it a hamlet. Iffy?</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>OK that you remove linkspam from my talk page <i>Archive</i> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancis_Schonken_Archive_01_5570.html" title="User talk:Francis Schonken/Archive 01">User talk:Francis Schonken/Archive 01</a>), although even that is maybe somewhat over the hill (it is a <i>user talk</i> page that's been archived for some time).</p>
<p>The only thing qualifiable as linkspam in that sense would be the external link to bopnews in Stirling Newberry's signature, which occurs two or three times on that page.</p>
<p><b>Not</b> OK that you remove non-standard characters from discussions whether or not Wikipedia should use these, e.g. what's the use of changing "Slobodan Milošević" to "Slobodan Miloševic'" in such discussion. None of these type of changes had anything to do with linkspam. You just succeeded in making these passages unintelligible. Please revert <i>all</i> changes, apart from the bopnews linkspam (if you insist on removing that).</p>

<p>I wondered who'd edited my talk page just now... While I now see that there are guidelines <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#Internal_spamming" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#Internal spamming</a>, and have seen the link removed from others' pages before, I did not remove the link from mine because I know this user and have for some years, more than the year-and-change that I've been on this site. That said: I had not read that guideline, and if you had directed me to it and asked me first, it would have been much appreciated. Your tact in this situation is appreciated and acknowledged.

<dd>I like <a href="http://www.bopnews.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bopnews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bopnews.com/</a> and choose to allow links to it on my user talk page. For those who wish to know Stirling, or read his latest research, a direct link to his contributions is convenient. Stirling doesn't format his research in a way that is encyclopedic, so most of it does not get into Wikipedia, but I find it very valuable and not duplicated in any form at this site. If we can't truly be the sum of all human knowledge, at least we can allow links to it. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_McConaughey_8eba.html" title="User:Peter McConaughey">Peter McConaughey</a> 18:37, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that the committee made a mistake in blocking user <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum">Haizum</a> from editing wiki articles. The whole apparent vandalism was really a mistake done by an inexperienced user. Fire Start and I had dug into the George W. Bush article's past and found that Haizum was trying to alert people to a vandal that occurred before his "vandalism". Fire Star and I at first mistook his blanking of the page as vandalism, but upon futher research, he was found to be innocent. Fire Star removed the complaint logged against him on his discussion page, and he hasn't done any acts of editing since then! I formly request that Haizum's block be removed immediately. Thank you. --<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeStar_2a7c.html" title="User:LifeStar">LifeStar</a> 05:50, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When someone removed your etymology I defended and replaced it. However, since the etymology is a complicated and unsettled issue (see section) I don't think we should privilege one version in the first sentence.

<p>According to the copyvio template text:</p>

<li>"If you want to work on this article meanwhile, write a new article at the temporary subpage, and indicate that you have done so on this page's talk page."</li>

<li><i>There is no need to blindly follow a template that was written specifically to prevent reversions to copyrighted content.</i> That's not my decision to make.
