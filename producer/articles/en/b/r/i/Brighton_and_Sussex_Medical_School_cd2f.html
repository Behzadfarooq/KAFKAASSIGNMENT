<p>BSMS is one of four new medical schools to have been created recently as part of the UK government’s strategy of increasing the number of qualified doctors from the UK working in the NHS.</p>
<p>The first intake of students began their five-year medical degree programmes in September 2003. Since then, it has become one of the most popular new schools in the country. According to UCAS, 2005 saw BSMS as the most competitive medical school to gain a place at, with over 25 applications per place.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_and_Sussex_Medical_School_cd2f.html" title="Edit section: Falmer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Falmer</span></h2>
<p>The University of Sussex is situated in <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falmer.html" title="Falmer">Falmer</a>, just out of Brighton. It has direct pedestrian access into the planned <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Downs_National_Park_d974.html" title="South Downs National Park">South Downs National Park</a>, long recognised as an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is very well served by local transport. In addition to good bus services, it has its own rail station with services to central Brighton (8 minutes) and the nearby county town of <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewes.html" title="Lewes">Lewes</a>.</p>
<p>From Brighton, London is just 51 minutes away by train and Gatwick Airport 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The curriculum is a careful blend of the best of new and traditional teaching methods, with firm foundations on the established strengths of the two universities in educating and training health professionals and in science teaching and research. The University of Brighton provides professional aspects of the course through its faculties of health, sciences and engineering, while Sussex provides biological science teaching.</p>
<p>The medical school requires human dissection of <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadavers.html" title="Cadavers">cadavers</a> as a compulsory part of the course. This means the course is far more clinically based than that of other medical schools, especially the other new medical schools. Indeed, it is the only new medical school to use no <a href="../../../p/b/l/PBL_2a79.html" title="PBL">PBL</a> (problem based learning) at all; as such, it is in the minority even among established medical schools.</p>
<p>Professor Jon Cohen, Dean of BSMS, is pleased with the School's progress. 'Students tell us that they are attracted by the small size of the classes, the friendly and supportive atmosphere, the modern and innovative curriculum and the brand new facilities. We are establishing BSMS as a first choice place to study medicine.'</p>
<p>Having not only appointed a highly-esteemed faculty with established research and teaching expertise, the school also maximises on the special skills and experience of local health professionals through its strong ties with Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust.</p>
<p>BSMS is the first medical school in the UK to integrate personal digital assistants (PDAs) into undergraduate teaching.</p>

<p>Subject to performance, students may be offered the opportunity to study subjects of their choice in greater depth by taking an intercalated BSc degree in Medical Science. This is taken between the third and fourth years of your BM BS studies and provides the necessary academic background for those who wish to embark on a career combining medical practice with medical research. It is possible to transfer to undertake the degree and then return to complete the medical course at BSMS.</p>

<p>All BSMS candidates are expected to be able to demonstrate high academic ability. Candidates considered at interview to show exceptional potential may receive offers at a slightly lower level than those indicated below. Applicants normally need three A levels and must have studied both Biology and Chemistry to AS level and at least one of these subjects to A level. General Studies is not included.</p>
<p>Most standard offers are now conditional on gaining 340 UCAS points in three A levels.</p>
<p>As of 2006 entry, applicants are required to take the UKCAT (UK Clinical Aptitude Test). Information about the test and preparation can be found at <a href="http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">UKCAT</a></p>

<p>BSMS is administered jointly by the Universities of Brighton and Sussex, and works closely with Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust.</p>
<p>The School occupies its own state-of-the-art teaching facilities at the two universities’ adjacent sites in Falmer.</p>
<p>The main teaching and lecture buildings are located on the campus of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sussex_b081.html" title="University of Sussex">University of Sussex</a> with a second facility housing clinical labs, another lecture theatre and most of the medical school's clinical facilities on the Brighton campus in Mayfield House. The accommodation is split between the Falmer campus of the University of Brighton, and the University of Sussex.</p>
<p>The two purpose-built teaching facilities for medicine at Falmer provide tutorial and seminar rooms, lecture theatres, clinical science laboratories and IT resource suites. Fully-equipped consultation rooms, identical to those used in GP surgeries and hospital out-patients departments, provide a setting in which to learn history-taking and examination. These are sited close to a clinical skills training area which also houses an advanced patient simulator, computer-controlled to represent normal and abnormal physiology and a realistic response to drugs.</p>
