<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hebrew tattoo</span></h2>
<p>Concerning her new <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> tattoo, I removed the following from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>To the amusement of some commentators, it was discovered that the words were written the wrong way round. The phrase, designed to celebrate her new found <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> faith (which, allegedly, frowns upon tattoos), was unintelligible as a result.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as I can tell, what she has tattooed is "מהש", which is certainly a word ("protection"), but not the word she was expecting ("new era"). As I don't speak Hebrew, I can't check it out. Anyone more proficient than me who can clarify, or for that matter, find out if "מהש" is what the tattoo actually says... For an image of the tattoo, see <a href="http://www.britneyspears.bz/bp/tattoos/pics/britneyspears.bz-neck-02.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britneyspears.bz/bp/tattoos/pics/britneyspears.bz-neck-02.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.britneyspears.bz/bp/tattoos/pics/britneyspears.bz-neck-01.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britneyspears.bz/bp/tattoos/pics/britneyspears.bz-neck-01.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> —<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabbe_a391.html" title="User:Gabbe">Gabbe</a> 13:51, Aug 2, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, there is some uncertainty; she says she was married in "a spiritual sense", but that it hasn't been made legal yet because they haven't filed the marriage license, which she says will be done soon. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:42, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Birthdate</span></h2>
<p>According to IMDb, Britney was born on December 15, 1981. Wikipedia lists her as December 2, 1981. Can anyone confirm which is the correct date? I see to have read in more than one place that her birthday is December 15, so it seems to be the more likely date - however, some "official" confirmation might be nice. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuantumEleven_2375.html" title="User:QuantumEleven">QuantumEleven</a> 17:02, Nov 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what you're up to. IMDb says December 2, not December 15. Moreover, December 2 is fairly well known, at least among fans, as her birthday. And that's the date on her marriage license from back in January. <a href="http://et.tv.yahoo.com/celebrities/2004/01/04/britneylicense" class="external autonumber" title="http://et.tv.yahoo.com/celebrities/2004/01/04/britneylicense" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:33, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Britney spears: a Hideous Conservative reality</span></h2>
<p>Britney spears, only 3 yearrs my senior has admittedly done remarkably well for herself. She has earned millions and has a cult following amoung teenegers AND seedy old men. what firghtens me the most is the power inveted in her by the Bush adminisration, or should that be Disctatroship, anyway, passe dabate there. what is the really disturbing thing is that this 20 yeaor old virgin/sinner has the pwer to sway he election. But should she? barely educated and barely legal, if this lovely loud mouthed teen says that 'i trust my president wholly, and i think whatever he's doing out there is good in the end"(Quote, from Farenheit 9/11) Does this not scare the living daylights out of you. That Britney Spears has the power over impressionable yound people to support this tyrant. Someone pass her a cross and a newspaper. And a dose of reality please, her perogative should not be to promote death and war.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't worry. I think most Britney Spears fans either aren't old enough to vote, or don't care about what she says, only what she looks like. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:34, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Britney, a has been? Hopefully!!!</span></h2>
<p>I do not understand everyone's fascination with this pop tart. Many agree, that once she may have been intruiging and, dare I say, beautiful, she is now just another has been. Mrs. Kevin James is nothing more than a slut, who dresses very badly. Perhaps I'm not up to date on my fashion, but since when has wearing a rosary around your neck been considered fashionable? Not only is it disrespectful and a bit offensive, it looks stupid as well. But, maybe Miss Spears doesn't know this, or anything else about fashion, everytime I see a picture of her she looks terrible wearing some hideous outfit. As well as her horrible taste in clothes, her music isn't all that great either. On her latest "greatest hits" CD it is clear that on some of the newer songs her voice in synthesized, it is definitely not her singing. While I have many other grumbles about this washed up "superstar" I shall just hope and pray that this Spears-mania will soon die down. I will never be happier the day that she is finally out of her undeserved spot light. --MEC 21:46, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Early Life</span></h2>
<p>The early life section of her biography before <i>...Baby One More Time</i> is incredibly short and should definitely be adjusted. There is no reference to her parents and very little to the events on her years from birth to 16. I'm not quite sure how to spice up this section, so I think someone with greater knowledge Of Britney should do so, but it is important. Also, would it hurt to start with "Early Life" as the first section of her biography? For the whole of the article, her impact on the United Kingdom is dissapated by that of her impact on the United States. I am aware it is her home country, but there is notable chart and cultural impact she has had on the United Kingdom and this needs to be addressed with greater importance in the article. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltimate_Star_Wars_Freak_7703.html" title="User:Ultimate Star Wars Freak">Ultimate Star Wars Freak</a> 16:15, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
