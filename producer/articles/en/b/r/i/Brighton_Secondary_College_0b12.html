<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Secondary_College_0b12.html" title="Edit section: Grounds and facilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grounds and facilities</span></h2>
<p>Having prominent grounds and facilities, the school boasts many features such as a gym (two basketball courts capacity, ability to use two courts separately with floating screen, canteen, drama &amp; music facilities, high-capacity hall. The school also features an Arts and Materials Section, Science Wing, VCE Study Centre and more.</p>
<p>The main part of the school consists of the N-corridor and C-corridor. The N corridor houses the bulk of most junior school classes, but is also used for other years. At recess and lunchtimes it is known for being congested. All Year 7&amp;8 lockers are located in this corridor.</p>
<p>The "C" corridor houses "C2" computer lab, and Staff Rooms. Wider than the N corridor, it only spans North-south. History reveals that a portion of this corridor was burnt sometime in the 1990's (possibly earlier - the exact date is unknown) (Aerial images depict a longer C corridor which extended down to where the former basketball were located - which now houses the Discovery Centre)</p>
<p>The C corridor serves for Year 10 accelerated student lockers. At the end of the C corridor is the C Corridor bypass, or better known for housing Year 10 lockers (one of the most congested areas at bell times). This connects the C corridor to the East Corridor and Senior School Area.</p>
<p>The E corridor consists of two parts. The northern section housing a majority of senior school studies and classes. In between both sections is a sheltered walkway to bicycle sheds to main grounds. The southern section houses the "Science Wing." Four classrooms dedicated to Science operations, and a computer pod.</p>
<p><br />
The rest of the school consists of portable classrooms, south of the library. These house Classrooms "P0 - P8." Directly east is the Discovery Centre. East again, is the science wing. South of the Science Wing is the Materials Technology rooms - for Woodwork, Metalwork and Electronics. Adjacent, south-west are the Art Rooms.</p>
<p>West of the N corridor is the Hall on the upper level. On the lower level is the Drama room, and Music practice/lesson rooms, band room. Adjacent south is the canteen area, toilet blocks, and the main entrance to the gym. West again, is the "Patterson Project" facilities, which have been rename as "W8." The classrooms are used by VCAL students, but now it is being revamped as a more Art/Media related area - with dedicated computer access for classes.</p>

<p>Brighton Secondary hosts new technology. Three of the four science rooms, most computer labs, and 3 classrooms contain "<i>Smartboards'</i>" They are advanced interactive multimedia hubs. Video/DVD playback, sound, and projection.</p>
<p>Many teacher use smartboards. They feature a normal projector which projects onto a specially designed board. This board has sensors - when using an electronic white board marker will project 'electronic ink' onto the smartboard. It also is fully interactive, similar to using an advance touch-screen monitor (in this case, touch-screen projector). Brighton Secondary is one of the first of these Smartboards across Victoria.</p>
<p>The school contains 4 computer rooms, and 3 'pods.' Each computer room is able to house a full class, and are dedicated to IT and Computer subjects. L2/L4 rooms contain the newest of Computers. N4 located on the N corridor also has computer purchased in early 2005 - N4 is the computer room which lacks a "Smartboard." C2 is the other computer lab, also open at lunchtimes for students to complete assignments. The 'pods' are built in sections of computer labs, which are often used for student group tasks. They serve as quick access computers, which are located in the Art Section, Science Area and one intershared between two classrooms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Secondary_College_0b12.html" title="Edit section: Discovery Centre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Discovery Centre</span></h2>
<p>In 2006 a new portion of the school named the "Discovery Centre" was commissioned into use. Officially opened on the behalf of the Minister of Education the centre brings in new incentives for students integrating a World Class learning environment, with the advantage of IT rich surroundings. At current, use is purely for Year 9 students.</p>
<p>Guests and politicians from the local community were invited to attend the opening ceremony - where all 2006 Year 9 students, Year 9 teachers, and school principals attended as well as certain 2005 Year 9 students who assisted into contributing to the Discovery Centre (which would have been those in the Art Class - aided by a student mum who designed and made mosaics which are featured near the Discovery Centre)</p>
<p>The ceremony invited the Minister of Education's assistant/secretary to formally open the complex. A speech by Year 9 students highlighted the importance of "Year 9" and they thanking the past Year 9 students for creating a reputation of "Year 9." Rock bands consisting of some Year 9 students also concluded the ceremony which followed with 'light refreshments' and so on.</p>
<p>Construction commenced mid-2005. The area it was built was formerly the basketball area and Portable classrooms "S4 - S6."</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the Discovery Centre should have opened some time in 2005 - the plans to construct the centre completed earlier.</p>
<p>2006 Year 10 students - having no classrooms as construction went underway had to endure the hardship of replacement classes in the Hall. The Hall was set-up to accommodate 4 classes - divided merely with boards. Teachers and student will agree that classes that were in the hall were very difficult to operate. Noise was a major problem - and in some cases, some teachers undertook classes outdoors near the amphitheater.</p>

<p>The school offers Victorian Secondary School years 7 through 12, with <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education_0986.html" title="Victorian Certificate of Education">VCE</a> offered as their years 11 and 12 option. This school does not offer the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a>.</p>
<p>In 2004, the school had a large young population (eight year-7 classes of approximately 25-30 students each) ranging up to a significantly smaller elder population (five year-12 classes of approximately 18-22 students each).</p>
<p>The school offers extensive exchange opportunities; the majority of exchange students tend to be from <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> (most specifically from Japan, though rarely from its sister school there).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Secondary_College_0b12.html" title="Edit section: Student Representation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Student Representation</span></h2>
<p>The student body is represented by a Student Representative Council (five students drawn from each year level at teachers' discretion and voted by peers), junior, middle school and senior school sports captains (two for each of the four houses at each of years 7-8, years 9-10 and years 11-12 - 24 in total), Culture captains for each of the houses (usually year 11 students) and finally year 12 captains (each of whom has a council of four year-11 students, excluding the debating and school captains).</p>
<p>The SRC plays a prominent role. Elected they serve to represent their year level in the upper hierarchy in school. They also run casual clothes days, numerous special events and fundraising.</p>
<p>Brighton SRC has been involved with many other events, such as previous SRC Conventions, 'SRC Congress,' and also in 2006 as part of their training camp - undertook visits to Mount Evelyn Christian School, and Upway Secondary School to associate with their SRC and share common values and goals among the different schools.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Secondary_College_0b12.html" title="Edit section: Senior Captains">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Senior Captains</span></h2>
<p>The following represents previous years and committee structures. 2007 committee structures have been slightly altered to now include a certain amount of Year 10's.</p>
<ul>
<li>School Captains: 1 male and 1 female year-12 student (usually heads of the SRC) who become the public face for the school. As with all political races, winners are usually predictable. Kind of like a presidential nomination requiring a billion-dollar net worth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vice School Captains: 1 male and 1 female year-12 student who act as understudies for the school captains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Education Captain: 1 year-12 student with a council of 4 year-11 students that looks out for educational issues/interests among the student body. They seek out information such as "top 10 most enjoyable subjects" and advertise to promote study. One created a super-hero alias at the school to highlight the issue of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a>. The super-hero alias in question has been granted to every subsequent education captain so far. They also aid the school's Tournament of the Minds interests. Student morale, due to potent relevance to education and study, is often affected by Education Captains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Student Issues Captain: 1 year-12 student with a council of four year-11 students that looks out for social issues among the student body. These include bullying and smoking (not providing cigarettes, but rather discouraging it).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Debating Captain: 1 year-12 student who looks after the school's debating team interests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Social Captain: 1 year-12 student with a council of 4 additional year 12 students that looks out for year 12 social events/interests (such as the year 12 formal).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arts Captain: 1 year-12 student with a council of 4 year-11 students that looks out for artistic issues within the school. This involves aiding in advertising for school plays and performances (although not running them).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sports/Sporting Captains: 2 year-12 student with a council of 4 year-11 students that look out for sports interests within the student community. These often co-ordinate with the senior house-captains to aid in house co-ordination for locations at sporting events.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Secondary_College_0b12.html" title="Edit section: SEAL Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SEAL Program</span></h2>
<p>Brighton Secondary College offers a <b>Select Entry Accelerated Learning</b> program. The College is an approved Department of Education "Select Entry Acceleration Provider" to the Bayside Network. The first set started in 1999, whilst later years have the option of finishing school one year early.</p>
<p>The "Guinea Pigs" of the program (class of '04 who started in 1999) were originally placed in a large room of which one wall was made entirely of large paneled glass windows. This earned the classroom the title of "The Fishbowl" and was later used to explain the discomfort of new students (who may have felt isolated due to the separation of their class). Ironically the "Smart Kid" stigma that accelerated students were marked with was most embraced by those that were put through the 'fishbowl' experience. Today in 2007 room "N2" still remains the gateway for new student to begin their 'accelerated' learning.</p>
<p>Year 7 SEAL start with an altered curriculum to normal Year 7 studies. It integrates an amount of work usually intended for Year 8.</p>
<p>Year 9 SEAL are identified as Year 10's, so as Year 10 identified as Year 11 etc.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Secondary_College_0b12.html" title="Edit section: School Restructuring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">School Restructuring</span></h2>
<p>In 2006 plans were made underway to change the school structure for 2007.</p>
<p>In previous years the school operated in three sections (defined as 'sub-school'):</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior (Years 7 &amp; 8)</li>
<li>Middle (Years 9 &amp; 10)</li>
<li>Senior (Years 11 &amp; 12) (Purple style jumpers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Year level has their "Year Level Co-Ordinator" as well as for sub-school there was a "Sub-School Manager"</p>
<p><br />
As of 2007, restructuring changed the sub-schools into two sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior (Years 7 - 9)</li>
<li>Senior (Years 10 - 12) (Purple style jumpers)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is thought that the change was primarily instated due to changes in education made by the state government. (Along with a change to 'SOSE' subjects renamed to "Humanities.")</p>

<p>As with other schools, Brighton SC has student houses.</p>
<p>Each house is headed by a teacher. There have been notable leaders for each house - some of their claims on speeches contreversial but nevertheless rather humorous.</p>
<p>Over past years some of the house teachers have been rather memorable trying to recruit their house students to participate in the many events.</p>
<p>Brighton Students are split into four different houses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lonsdale (Yellow)</li>
<li>Phillip (Green)</li>
<li>Murray (Red)</li>
<li>Grant (Purple)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Throughout the year some key events such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chorals - House singing competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>(A key calander event where each house forms their own choir. Each house elects to sing two songs, and one set song which each house sings. Induvidual students represent each house in soloists competition. And there is usually singing entertainment by the specialist choir.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Swimming - House swimming competition</li>
<li>Athletics House athletics competition</li>
