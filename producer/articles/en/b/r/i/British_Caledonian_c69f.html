<p>The BUA takeover enabled Caledonian to realise its long-held ambition to transform itself into a major scheduled airline.</p>
<p>The merged <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entity.html" title="Entity">entity</a> eventually became Britain's foremost Independent, international scheduled airline.</p>
<p>A series of major setbacks during the 1980s as well as the airline's inability to grow to the minimum size to become a viable "Second Force" as envisaged in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> Edwards report led to growing financial difficulties during the second half of that decade.

<p><b>British Caledonian Airways Ltd.</b> (<b>BCal</b>) was formed on <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Andrews_71e7.html" title="St. Andrews">St. Andrews</a> Day (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>) in 1970 when Caledonian Airways acquired British United Airways (BUA) from its previous owner, the British and Commonwealth group, for £6.9m.<sup id="_ref-risk256_7_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk256_7" title="">[1]</a></sup> Caledonian Airways also purchased three new <a href="../../../b/a/c/BAC_1-11_b1ae.html" title="BAC 1-11">BAC 1-11</a>-500 aircraft, which British and Commonwealth had leased to BUA, for a further £5m.<sup id="_ref-risk256_7_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk256_7" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The deal concerning Caledonian's acquisition of BUA from British and Commonwealth did not include the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asset.html" title="Asset">assets</a> of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_United_Island_Airways_5cd5.html" title="British United Island Airways">BUIA</a>, BUA's regional affiliate, which BUA's former <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parent_company.html" title="Parent company">parent company</a> continued to own.</p>
<p>BCal itself was established as a wholly owned <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidiary.html" title="Subsidiary">subsidiary</a> of <b>Caledonian Airways (Prestwick) Ltd.</b><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> A number of other wholly owned subsidiaries were established as well. These included <b>British Caledonian Aircraft Trading</b>, which was set up to acquire and dispose of aircraft on behalf of the airline. It became one of the most profitable parts of the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a>. BCal also owned two <a href="../../../p/a/c/Package_tour.html" title="Package tour">package tour</a> companies - <b>Blue Sky Holidays</b> and <b>Golden Lion Tours</b> - as well as several hotels in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_8171.html" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>. In addition, BCal inherited BUA's minority stakes in <b>Gambia Airways</b> and <b>Sierra Leone Airways</b> (<b>SLA</b>).</p>
<p>The airline's formation followed the publication of the Edwards Committee report entitled <i>British Air Transport in the Seventies</i> in 1969.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> It recommended the creation of a so-called "Second Force", private sector carrier to take on the state-owned Corporations, i.e. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_European_Airways_7c12.html" title="British European Airways">British European Airways</a> (<a href="../../../b/e/a/BEA_1627.html" title="BEA">BEA</a>) and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation_f055.html" title="British Overseas Airways Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/a/BOAC_690b.html" title="BOAC">BOAC</a>), by providing competing domestic and international scheduled services on trunk routes.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The new airline established its headquarters and operational base at <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatwick_Airport_9029.html" title="Gatwick Airport">Gatwick Airport</a> and the late Sir Adam Thomson, one of the two co-founders as well as one of the main shareholders of Caledonian Airways, became its <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">chairman</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive.html" title="Chief executive">chief executive</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fleet inherited from both of its predecessors comprised 31 <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_aircraft.html" title="Jet aircraft">jet aircraft</a> consisting of eleven long-haul aircraft (seven ex-Caledonian <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a>-320Cs and four ex-BUA <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vickers_VC-10_d32b.html" title="Vickers VC-10">Vickers VC-10</a>-1103/1109s) as well as 20 short-haul planes (twelve BAC 1-11-500s [eight ex-BUA and four ex-Caledonian] and eight BAC 1-11-200s [all ex-BUA]). The merged entity's paid-up share capital was <a href="../../../%C2%A3/_/_/%C2%A3.html" title="£">£</a>12m - more than that of any other wholly privately owned, Independent <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> airline at the time - and its combined workforce numbered 4,400.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-flyme130_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flyme130" title="">[8]</a></sup> This made BCal the UK's foremost Independent airline at the time. (Although <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan-Air_c3ba.html" title="Dan-Air">Dan-Air</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia_Airways_1274.html" title="Britannia Airways">Britannia Airways</a> eventually exceeded BCal's total annual passenger numbers from 1975 onwards, BCal maintained its position as Britain's leading Independent international scheduled airline, in terms of both the number of scheduled passengers carried each year as well as in terms of its total yearly scheduled capacity measured in passenger kilometers - the distance covered by its scheduled operation multiplied by the number of scheduled passengers carried within a twelve-month period, throughout its 17-year existence.) The newly created company's output measured in available capacity tonne kilometers - a figure arrived at by multiplying the number of [metric] tonnes available for the carriage of <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenue</a> load (passengers, cargo and mail) on each flight sector by the sector's distance in kilometers - was greater than that of some of the smaller, contemporary <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> flag carriers, such as <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aer_Lingus_08df.html" title="Aer Lingus">Aer Lingus</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/b/SABENA_e099.html" title="SABENA">SABENA</a> or <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swissair.html" title="Swissair">Swissair</a>. By that measure, BCal was about the same size as <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>'s flag carrier <a href="../../../q/a/n/Qantas.html" title="Qantas">Qantas</a>.<sup id="_ref-flyme130_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flyme130" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The institutional investors that had been instrumental in helping the late Sir Adam Thomson and the late John de la Haye in launching Caledonian Airways back in 1961 were also among the shareholders of the newly constituted airline. They included the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile_Association_d6a7.html" title="Automobile Association">AA</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Universal_Stores_7369.html" title="Great Universal Stores">GUS</a>, Hogarth Shipping, Lyle Shipping, Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC)<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup> - one of the two predecessors of Investors in Industry (as <a href="../../../3/i/_/3i.html" title="3i">3i</a> used to be known earlier on), <a href="../../../k/l/e/Kleinwort_Benson_e417.html" title="Kleinwort Benson">Kleinwort Benson</a> (now part of <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresdner_Kleinwort_Wasserstein_e51d.html" title="Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein">Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein</a>), the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Bank_of_Scotland_299b.html" title="Royal Bank of Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> (<a href="../../../r/b/s/RBS_0879.html" title="RBS">RBS</a>) and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schroders.html" title="Schroders">Schroders</a>.<sup id="_ref-ch4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ch4" title="">[10]</a></sup> Airways Interests (Thomson), which had been set up at Caledonian's inception a decade earlier as an investment vehicle to hold the stakes of that airline's founders, initially continued holding the late Sir Adam's stake in the new airline combine.<sup id="_ref-risk258_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk258" title="">[11]</a></sup> It was subsequently merged into Caledonian Airways (Prestwick).<sup id="_ref-risk258_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk258" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The merged entity initially traded under the interim name <b>Caledonian/BUA</b> before adopting the <b>British Caledonian</b> name on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. It carried a total of 2.6 m passengers during its first year of operation.<sup id="_ref-ch4_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ch4" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the interim period the VC-10s, five of the eight former BUA 1-11-500s as well as the eight 1-11-200s were operating the merged entities' scheduled services as these aircraft were already configured in a lower density scheduled seating arrangement, with some of the aircraft - notably the long-haul VC-10s - featuring a contemporary standard first and economy, two-class configuration. These aircraft were allocated to the airline's "BUA Division", which was responsible for all scheduled operations, pending full integration.<sup id="_ref-risk258_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk258" title="">[11]</a></sup> All passenger-configured former Caledonian aircraft as well as three former BUA 1-11-500s featured a high density, single class seating arrangement. These aircraft were allocated to the company's "Caledonian Division", which was responsible for all <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter.html" title="Charter">charter</a> operations during that period.<sup id="_ref-risk258_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk258" title="">[11]</a></sup> Some of the 707s had an all-cargo configuration. Depending on whether these were used to operate scheduled or charter flights, they were either allocated to the "BUA Division" or the "Caledonian Division".<sup id="_ref-risk258_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk258" title="">[11]</a></sup> This meant that at that time roughly 55% of the firm's combined aircraft fleet was allocated to its scheduled division whereas the remaining 45% of the fleet was allocated to the charter division. However, as the charter division's aircraft were configured in a higher density seating configuration than the scheduled division's planes and charter flights generally tended to have higher load factors than scheduled services, two-thirds of all passengers - representing the bulk of the new carrier's passenger business - were carried on its charter flights during that time.<sup id="_ref-ch4_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ch4" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Former BUA <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_hostess.html" title="Air hostess">air hostesses</a> still wearing that airline's blue uniforms were working alongside their <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartan.html" title="Tartan">tartan</a>-clad, former Caledonian counterparts in the cabins of all passenger flights - scheduled as well as non-scheduled - during the interim period. Eventually, the attractive Caledonian tartan uniforms became BCal's standard uniform for all female cabin crew members.</p>
<p>Following the end of the interim period, all former BUA aircraft were repainted adopting Caledonian's <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livery.html" title="Livery">livery</a> featuring a prominent Scottish <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion_Rampant_48eb.html" title="Lion Rampant">Lion Rampant</a> on its aircraft's fins.</p>
<p>The "Second Force" inherited BUA's extensive network of scheduled routes serving the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">Continental Europe</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. The newly formed airline's future scheduled ambitions received a major boost when the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> Government agreed to transfer BOAC's <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_African_8cf9.html" title="West African">West African</a> trunk routes to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghana.html" title="Ghana">Ghana</a> as well as its <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_African_8ba6.html" title="North African">North African</a> route to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libya.html" title="Libya">Libya</a> to it.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup> (These routes represented 3% of BOAC's annual, worldwide turnover.) The Government also agreed to transfer an unused BEA route licence to serve <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca.html" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Furthermore, the Government agreed to license BCal to operate non-stop scheduled services between <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and to begin negotiations with the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> authorities to secure reciprocal approval for BCal to be able to commence scheduled operations on what was then the busiest international air route in Europe. BCal moreover received Government assurances that it would be designated as the UK's sole flag carrier on all routes transferred to it and that it would be assisted in obtaining traffic rights for additional, selected scheduled routes where it wished to compete with the Corporations, including the lucrative London-<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> and London-<a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> routes.<sup id="_ref-ch4_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ch4" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another important concession by the Government designed to improve the competitiveness of the "Second Force" was to permit it to provide a first class cabin on its <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_African_b3e9.html" title="East African">East African</a> routes.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup> (BUA, from whom BCal inherited these routes, had been prevented from offering a first class on its East African "Skycoach" schedules. To compensate for this loss of competitiveness, the late <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Freddie_Laker_2f78.html" title="Sir Freddie Laker">Sir Freddie Laker</a>, BUA's <a href="../../../m/a/n/Managing_director.html" title="Managing director">managing director</a> from 1960 to 1965, had come up with the novel idea of designing a cargo door to be installed on the right-hand side of the forward fuselage of that airline's long-haul VC-10s, where the first class cabin was normally located. This modification permitted the carriage of additional freight instead of first class passengers on the East African routes.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[14]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>In addition, BCal became the Government's "chosen instrument of the private sector".<sup id="_ref-risk275_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk275" title="">[15]</a></sup> This meant that the Government agreed to accord preferential status to BCal's worldwide scheduled ambitions, especially in the award of additional licences to operate scheduled services on major domestic and international trunk routes.<sup id="_ref-risk275_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk275" title="">[15]</a></sup> The Government hoped that putting BCal's requirements ahead of other UK-based Independent airlines' rival scheduled ambitions would help the new "Second Force" develop into a fully fledged, major international scheduled airline, thereby enabling it to acquire the "critical mass" to challenge the Corporation's near-<a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> among UK-based scheduled airlines.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> BCal extended its East African network to the <a href="../../../s/e/y/Seychelles.html" title="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>.</p>
<p>The same year BCal also introduced a new <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>-<a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle-upon-Tyne_91d2.html" title="Newcastle-upon-Tyne">Newcastle</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> regional scheduled service to live up to its claim of being "<a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>'s international airline". This service complemented the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>-Newcastle-<a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> regional route BCal had inherited from BUA.</p>
<p>1972 was also the year BCal introduced the UK's first-ever "walk-on", "walk-off" type of operation - including a reduced, "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_frills.html" title="No frills">no frills</a>" style on-board service - on the two main domestic trunk routes linking London and Scotland, at the time the only profitable scheduled services plying UK mainland domestic trunk routes. The airline introduced simultaneous night-time departures from Gatwick as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh resulting in an overall frequency increase to six daily round-trips on each route. The company charged very low fares on these night-time services, which were marketed under the "Moonjet" trademark.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[21]</a></sup> ("Moonjet" was one of several trademarks BCal had begun using to market specific services during the early 1970s. Other trademarks used at the time included "Interjet" for the airline's domestic jet schedules and "Eurojet" for the company's jet-operated, international European scheduled services. However, these trademarks were dropped some time during the late '70s.) This move, which was modelled on the high-frequency-low-fares operation run by <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines_ea57.html" title="Pacific Southwest Airlines">Pacific Southwest Airlines</a> (PSA), the original "no frills" airline, on the busy <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_36a0.html" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>-<a href="../../../l/2E/a/L.A._d541.html" title="L.A.">L.A.</a>-<a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> air corridor in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, boosted passenger numbers as well as the profitability on both routes.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[22]</a></sup> (Interestingly, <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_Airways_4ae9.html" title="Jet Airways">Jet Airways</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>'s leading private sector airline, introduced a similar operation between <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> as well as Delhi and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> respectively, two of the busiest domestic trunk routes in India, during the 1990s.)</p>
<p>During that year larger capacity, longer range and more fuel-efficient Boeing 707s that had been re-configured featuring a lower density, two-class scheduled configuration began replacing VC-10s on BCal's South American routes, where the 707's greater range enabled the airline to commence non-stop flights between London Gatwick and <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, as well as on the West African trunk routes to Nigeria and Ghana.</p>
<p>As a result of the then prevailing, ruinous rates in the charter market, which still accounted for well over half of BCal's business at the time, the airline incurred a loss of £194,000 during the financial year to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>To support its ambitious expansion plans, BCal acquired a number of additional, second-hand Boeing 707s from various sources through its British Caledonian Aircraft Trading subsidiary during the early 1970s. This included a pair of 320C series aircraft procured on a long-term <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lease.html" title="Lease">lease</a> from Britannia Airways featuring a two-class, "widebody look" interior. These aircraft were used to inaugurate the airline's transatlantic scheduled routes to New York and L.A. where the established competition was operating widebodied aircraft, such as the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a> "<a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumbo_jet.html" title="Jumbo jet">jumbo jet</a>". It was thought that the aircraft's widebody style interiors would leave passengers under the impression that BCal was operating widebodied aircraft as well when in fact they were operating older generation, narrowbodied planes. During that time BCal also acquired two additional, second-hand BAC 1-11-500s, which were sourced from <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_Line_b10c.html" title="Court Line">Court Line</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transbrasil.html" title="Transbrasil">Transbrasil</a> respectively. (At the same time the airline disposed of some of the 707s that already were in its fleet - including the original pair of 399C series aircraft that were delivered to Caledonian Airways direct from the manufacturer's plant in 1967/'68 [-99 being <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>'s customer designator for Caledonian]. In addition, a VC-10 and a 1-11-200 were sold to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Aircraft_Establishment_edec.html" title="Royal Aircraft Establishment">RAE</a>, which was using the aircraft as <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testbed.html" title="Testbed">testbeds</a>.)</p>
<p>BCal inaugurated its two transatlantic "flagship" services from London Gatwick to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_JFK_9071.html" title="New York JFK">New York JFK</a> and from Gatwick to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_International_Airport_1053.html" title="Los Angeles International Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. Again, this occasion marked the first time that an Independent British airline commenced transatlantic scheduled operations on what are sometimes referred to as two of <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">aviation</a>'s "<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Riband_0790.html" title="Blue Riband">Blue Riband</a>" routes linking the UK and the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>. (Although <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Eagle_6eab.html" title="British Eagle">British Eagle</a> had managed to get a licence for a daily <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Heathrow_88e2.html" title="London Heathrow">London Heathrow</a> - New York JFK scheduled service due to commence in 1965, its inaugural flight was cancelled when the then UK Minister of Transport revoked its licence as a result of BOAC's last minute intervention.)</p>
<p>In 1973 BCal also inaugurated its fourth scheduled domestic trunk route between London Gatwick and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> (in addition to the Gatwick-Glasgow, Gatwick-Edinburgh and Gatwick-<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> routes inherited from BUA). The new service was subcontracted to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Island_Airways_15a4.html" title="British Island Airways">British Island Airways</a> (BIA), BUIA's successor, which was operating two daily return trips on that route using its <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_Dart_Herald_caed.html" title="Handley Page Dart Herald">Handley Page Dart Herald</a> <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turboprops.html" title="Turboprops">turboprops</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> BCal switched its Gatwick-Paris services to the then brand-new <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Gaulle_62f6.html" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> airport near the Northern Paris suburb of <a href="../../../r/o/i/Roissy.html" title="Roissy">Roissy-en-France</a>, thus becoming the first scheduled carrier to operate between London and the new Paris airport.</p>
<p>To further extend the network's reach and its connectivity, BCal agreed to host Dan-Air's new, twice daily Gatwick-Newcastle flights, which commenced on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, in its computerised reservation system (<a href="../../../c/r/s/CRS_22d5.html" title="CRS">CRS</a>).<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>June 1974 saw the launch of BCal's non-stop Gatwick-<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> scheduled route, the third European trunk route on which the airline operated scheduled services in competition with the incumbent flag carriers' established services from Heathrow. (In addition to Gatwick-Paris, the company already operated daily non-stop Gatwick-Amsterdam scheduled services, the route being one of the European routes inherited from BUA.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_c69f.html" title="Edit section: Plan S">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plan S</span></h3>
<p>The creation of British Airways (BA) as a result of the 1974 BEA-BOAC merger (one of the other two main recommendations contained in the 1969 Edwards Report on the future of British civil aviation) came against the background of the first global <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_crisis.html" title="Oil crisis">oil crisis</a> in the wake of the 1973 <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab-Israeli_War_0606.html" title="Arab-Israeli War">Arab-Israeli War</a>, which led to the quadrupling of the price of a barrel of oil as a consequence of <a href="../../../o/p/e/OPEC_0e81.html" title="OPEC">OPEC</a>'s decision to boycott the West in retaliation for its support of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> during that war. This meant that the newly merged Corporation's original revenue and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit.html" title="Profit">profit</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Projection.html" title="Projection">projections</a> were far too optimistic. During that time BA began exerting pressure on the Government, at the time its sole owner as well as the regulator for all UK airlines, to curtail the activities of its Independent competitors generally and of the "Second Force" in particular.</p>
<p>The difficult operating environment at the time did not affect BA alone. In fact, the major scheduled airlines were all losing horrendous amounts of money at the time. The sudden spike in the oil price caused a major recession during the second half of 1974 as well as the first half of 1975 with much reduced demand for air travel. This, in turn, led to the collapse of a number of prominent travel companies and their associated airlines - most notably the Court Line group and Horizon Holidays, the latter having provided work for three BCal short-haul aircraft prior to its collapse. There was also massive overcapacity on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Atlantic_0bb4.html" title="North Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>.</p>
<p>These circumstances forced BCal to put in place a major programme of retrenchment, known internally as Plan "S" ("S" for "survival") at the time, to avoid finding itself in a Court Line type of situation.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Plan "S" began to be implemented from <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> onwards. It resulted in route cut-backs - including the suspension of the transatlantic "flagship" services, the immediate withdrawal and subsequent disposal of the remaining VC-10 long-haul aircraft, the temporary grounding of a number of short-haul aircraft pending disposal as well as several hundred redundancies among the company's staff (800 out of a total workforce of 5,600).<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to withdrawing from the prestigious long-haul routes to New York and L.A. after only 18 months, other specific measures the airline took at the time to ensure its survival included dropping all scheduled flights to Belfast, Copenhagen, <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibiza.html" title="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaga.html" title="Malaga">Malaga</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palma_de_Mallorca_46c4.html" title="Palma de Mallorca">Palma de Mallorca</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunis.html" title="Tunis">Tunis</a>, indefinitely suspending scheduled services on the Glasgow-<a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton.html" title="Southampton">Southampton</a> route as well as cutting the number of frequencies on the Gatwick-Glasgow and Gatwick-Edinburgh routes from six to four daily round trips. The company furthermore retired its remaining two VC-10s. One of these aircraft was sold to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Malawi_4f47.html" title="Air Malawi">Air Malawi</a> enabling it to take over the Gatwick-<a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairobi.html" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>-<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blantyre%2C_Malawi_6289.html" title="Blantyre, Malawi">Blantyre</a> route, which BCal had been contracted to operate. (The other aircraft was acquired by the <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omani.html" title="Omani">Omani</a> government.) Moreover, eight of the 14-strong 1-11-500 fleet were temporarily grounded. Four of these aircraft were subsequently sold. (Dan-Air acquired two<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[28]</a></sup> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_Airlines_0a31.html" title="Monarch Airlines">Monarch Airlines</a> one of these aircraft in 1975/'76.) A fifth aircraft was disposed of to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Airlines_b042.html" title="Philippine Airlines">Philippine Airlines</a> in 1976. Two of the temporarily grounded aircraft that remained in BCal's fleet were leased out to <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Malta_daa9.html" title="Air Malta">Air Malta</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_Airlines_9b26.html" title="Austrian Airlines">Austrian Airlines</a> respectively for the duration of the 1975 summer timetable period. Another aircraft was stationed at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Berlin_10b8.html" title="West Berlin">West Berlin</a>'s <a href="../../../t/e/g/Tegel_Airport_59ea.html" title="Tegel Airport">Tegel Airport</a> during the month of July of that year to fulfill a short-term charter contract to carry <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_people.html" title="Turkish people">Turkish</a> <a href="../../../m/i/g/Migrant_workers.html" title="Migrant workers">migrant workers</a> to and from <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> on behalf of a local tour operator. BCal also decided to increase its 707 freighter fleet from one to four aircraft and to acquire a five-seater <a href="../../../p/i/p/Piper_PA-23_dc44.html" title="Piper PA-23">Piper PA-23</a> "Aztec" for serving the rapidly growing executive charter market. These changes to the composition of the BCal fleet left the airline with 25 operational aircraft for the 1975 summer season, comprising eleven Boeing 707-320C long-haul aircraft (including four pure freighters) and 13 BAC 1-11 short-haul planes (six larger series 500 and seven smaller series 200 models) as well as a single Piper "Aztec". In a further move to reduce its operating <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cost.html" title="Cost">costs</a>, BCal decided to contract out its scheduled operations between Gatwick and <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Touquet_033f.html" title="Le Touquet">Le Touquet</a> as well as between Gatwick and <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> to BIA. The reason for replacing BCal's 1-11-200 jet aircraft with that airline's Herald turboprops on these routes with the beginning of the 1975 summer timetable period was the high price of <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_fuel.html" title="Jet fuel">jet fuel</a>, which had made BCal's own jet operation on the aforesaid routes uneconomic.</p>
<p>Even during this period of severe retrenchment, BCal continued launching scheduled services to new destinations. <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakar.html" title="Dakar">Dakar</a> joined the airline's network on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, followed by <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinshasa.html" title="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. From 1975 onwards, the BIA-operated BCal service to Manchester was extended to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackpool.html" title="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> during the peak summer travel period. Furthermore, BCal agreed to continue holding details of the Gatwick-Belfast service - an important feeder route for its long-haul services, which had been taken over by British Midland Airways (as <a href="../../../b/m/i/BMI_%28airline%29_f9fc.html" title="BMI (airline)">bmi</a> used to be known then) following BCal's withdrawal from that route - in its CRS.</p>
<p>As a result of the "success" of Plan "S", BCal's fortunes quickly recovered. The airline operation itself managed to return to the black during the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_year.html" title="Financial year">financial year</a> ended <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> with a small profit of £250,000 after having lost £4.3m the year before.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[29]</a></sup> (BCal's total loss for the 1973/'74 financial year was £5.6m.) However, BCal's operating profit for the 1974/'75 financial reporting period translated into an overall loss of £366,000 after taking into account the heavy costs relating to the early disposal of the remaining VC-10s and the grounding of several other aircraft as well as the voluntary redundancy programme to achieve the required reduction in headcount.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

<p>The then Secretary of State for Trade Peter Shore, conducted a review of the Government's aviation policy and in 1976 announced a new "spheres of influence" policy that ended "dual designation" for British airlines on all long-haul routes. As a result of this new aviation policy BA and BCal were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled services on the same long-haul routes and the latter was forced to withdraw from the East African routes inherited from BUA as well as the London-New York and London-Los Angeles routes, leading to the revocation of BCal's Gatwick-JFK and Gatwick-L.A. licences.<sup id="_ref-risk316_7_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk316_7" title="">[31]</a></sup> In return, BCal became the sole British flag carrier to the entire <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_American_1d95.html" title="South American">South American</a> mainland by taking over the former BA routes to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>.<sup id="_ref-risk316_7_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk316_7" title="">[31]</a></sup> The Government's new "spheres of influence" aviation policy effectively confined BCal's long-haul scheduled operations to two continents only, i.e. Africa and South America.<sup id="_ref-risk375_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk375" title="">[32]</a></sup> The loss of BCal's East African routes enabled the airline to replace the one-stop scheduled service via <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nairobi.html" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> to <a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusaka.html" title="Lusaka">Lusaka</a> with non-stop flights.</p>
<p>During 1976 BCal's recovery continued leading to the introduction of two new scheduled routes to <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algiers.html" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oran.html" title="Oran">Oran</a> and the reinstatement of scheduled services to <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunis.html" title="Tunis">Tunis</a>. It also led to BCal's decision to bring the operation of its Gatwick-Manchester service back in-house by replacing the two daily round-trips BIA had operated with its Herald turboprops on that route since the route's launch in 1973 with a three-times-daily BCal 1-11 schedule starting <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>.</p>
<p>BCal ended its 1975/'76 financial year with a healthy profit of £5.6m.</p>

<p>BCal had an unblemished safety record throughout its 17-year existence.</p>
<p>During that time there never was a fatal accident involving a BCal aircraft as a result of good airmanship and an extremely high safety consciousness throughout the organisation. This made the airline stand out from many of its contemporary rivals. It also was one of the company's greatest contributions to commercial aviation.</p>
<p>According to the annual airline safety review for the year 1975 conducted by <i>Flight International</i>, BCal was one of the top three safest airlines in the world, behind Qantas and ahead of Lufthansa.</p>
<p>However, there were a few noteworthy non-fatal incidents involving BCal aircraft.</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28.html" title="January 28">January 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> a BCal Vickers VC-10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) sustained severe structural damage as a result of an exceptionally hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow, where the aircraft had been diverted due to Gatwick being fog-bound and where all passengers had disembarked. A survey of the aircraft's damage had revealed that its airframe had been bent out of shape and that it required extensive repairs to be restored to an airworthy condition. The airline's senior management decided that these repairs were not cost-effective. The aircraft was written off and a decision taken to have it scrapped. It was eventually broken up at Gatwick in 1975.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[43]</a></sup> (This aircraft had been the VC-10's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prototype.html" title="Prototype">prototype</a>. It had subsequently been converted as a 1109 series passenger aircraft before being sold in 1969 to Laker Airways, which immediately leased it out to <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_Airlines_d022.html" title="Middle East Airlines">MEA</a>. Laker Airways sold the aircraft to BUA in 1970.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the summer of 1976 a BCal BAC 1-11-500 (registration: G-AZMF) burst all its main wheel tyres while landing at Gatwick at the end of a scheduled flight from Jersey. All occupants were safely evacuated via the aircraft's emergency exits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During 1981 a BCal McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aquaplaned after touching down on the wet runway at Kano Airport in northern Nigeria. Nobody was hurt in that incident.</li>
