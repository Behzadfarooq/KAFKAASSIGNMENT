	    <p>A number of different numbering and classification schemes have been used for carriages and wagons on Britain's railways, and this page explains the principal systems. Carriages and wagons (either not self-propelled, or part of a multiple unit which has power units distributed throughout a semi-permanent formation of carriages) have frequently had similar arrangements for classification and numbering, so are considered together. There are also links to other pages that deal in greater depth with the particulars of individual types.</p>

<p>Carriage and wagon classification has never been quite the same as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Locomotive_and_Multiple_Unit_Numbering_and_Classification_c342.html" title="British Locomotive and Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification">locomotive and multiple unit classification</a>. For most railways, specific types were identified by their Diagram Number. This could simply be arranged by consecutive number, or there could be some greater organisation of numbers so that similar types were grouped together.</p>
<p>However, carriages and wagons have rarely been referred to in general terms by their Diagram Number. Instead, there have been a variety of other codes and designations, which have referred to generic designs rather than specific types. For instance, there were the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_coach_designations_6ab6.html" title="British Rail coach designations">BR (adapted from the LNER system) and LMS carriage codes</a>, which indicated interior layout or usage. The GWR identified their non-passenger carriages and wagons through a series of animal designations, including sealife for departmental (non-revenue earning) stock, followed by a letter to illustrate detail differences, e.g. Beetle A.</p>
<p>Therefore the majority of the sections below deal solely with carriage and wagon numbering series, though where a particular classification system was used, this is also described.</p>

<p>Before nationalisation in 1948, each railway company devised its own numbering arrangements.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Railways_c7a8.html" title="British Railways">British Railways</a> inherited the stock of the 'Big Four' companies upon Nationalisation in 1948, and also a substantial number of former 'Private Owner' wagons.

<p>The numbers of inherited carriages were left unchanged, but were differentiated by the addition of a prefix letter to show where they had originated from, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>E:</td>
<td>London &amp; North Eastern Railway</td>

<p>New carriages to the designs of the old companies were numbered in their series.</p>
<p>In 1951, the first carriages built to British Railways' designs appeared, known as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Mark_1_b6b5.html" title="British Rail Mark 1">'Mark I'</a>. From this time, a new approach was adopted, which involved the use of a prefix letter to indicate the region to which the carriage was allocated. The inherited carriages then showed the letter indicating the region responsible for heavy maintenance, usually the same as the company of origin, as a suffix. Thus new British Railways carriages had no suffix and so were differentiated from the other four series. When the carriages of the Pullman Car Company were added to the mix, their numbers carried only a suffix (indicating regional allocation), and no prefix, as a means of differentiation. The regional allocation letters used were:</p>

<p>Wagons were allocated numbers from 100000 upwards, and the 9xxxxx series was reserved for deparmental (non-revenue earning) carriages and wagons. Departmental carriages have been numbered in the 963xxx, 975xxx, 977xxx, 998xxx and 999xxx series. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_departmental_locomotives_e28a.html" title="British Rail departmental locomotives">Departmental locomotives</a> have been numbered in the 966xxx and 968xxx series, though in recent years those locomotives that remain self-propelled have been allocated locomotive <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_97_a0e7.html" title="British Rail Class 97">Class 97</a> rather than use these series.</p>
<p>Initially some non-gangwayed carriages were numbered in the 5xxxx series, but these were soon renumbered to 4xxxx when the Modernisation Plan Diesel Multiple Units started to arrive. Another change came when Third Class was renamed Second Class. There had been very few Second Class carriages before this change (mainly used in Boat Trains since ships still used all three classes), and most were absorbed into the larger mass of former Third Class carriages, although they had many fewer seats.</p>
<p>The same series was used for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Mark_2_43c3.html" title="British Rail Mark 2">'Mark II'</a> coaches built in the 1960s, but when the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Mark_3_9b93.html" title="British Rail Mark 3">'Mark III'</a> carriage was introduced in the early 1970s new number ranges were carved out of the old series. These new ranges were perpetuated for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Mark_4_e19c.html" title="British Rail Mark 4">'Mark IV'</a> carriages in the 1980s), and were as follows:</p>

<p>The new diesel multiple unit builds in the 1980s utilised the 52xxx, 55xxx, 57xxx and 58xxx series for the individual carriages, all of which were motored. The 55xxx and 58xxx contained a mix of driving and non-driving motors, but the 52xxx and 57xxx cars were all driving motors. In addition, some series have been used for conversions of carriages, e.g. 63xx has been used for a variety of miscellaneous carriages, including generator vans and observation saloons. Privately-owned carriages registered to run on British Railways were allocated numbers in the 99xxx series (which they shared with bullion and exhibition vans).</p>
<p>Another major change came in 1983 when the use of prefix and suffix letters was abandoned, and any carriage which had the same number as another carriage or a locomotive was renumbered. The programme worked as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>14000-14999</td>

<td>17000-17999</td>

<p>Subsequently, further renumberings have taken place as new locomotives were introduced. Most have involved only a handful of carriages, but a major one saw carriages in the 920xx series renumbered to 929xx when the Class 92 locomotives were introduced.</p>
<p>This series has been perpetuated by the privatised railway, though the series have been adapted for new generation multiple unit stock. For instance, the latest diesel multiple units have reused the 50xxx and 79xxx series for driving motors and the 56xxx series for non-driving motors. In the electric multiple unit series, Class 390 Pendolinos have reused the 68xxx and 69xxx series.</p>
