<dd>I forget. Ive stopped using that css, but I just looked at that skin in my monobook history, and it might be the one at the bottom (with comment "image background," before the tooltips section). Otherwise its one of the little entries above, in the section thats impossible to read. I did it by making little tweaks via trial and error--I wasnt too systematic about it. sinreg, -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 00:37, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Brian, I saw the screenshot you linked (thank you for using my skin ^_^ feedback welcome). You are an admin, right? This could be a reason for the fault, since some buttons aren't the same, but the "article" button should have a black background nonetheless. Hm. Try to add these four rows:</p>
<pre>
#p-cactions { background-color: #000000; }
#p-cactions li { background-color: #000000; }
#p-cactions li { background: #000000; }
#p-cactions li a { background-color: #000000; }
</pre>
<p>They are global background settings for link tabs; please let me know what you get with these on. BTW I'm wondering: would be better to add the "more tools" user-links in the existing "tools" sidebox or not? What do you think about it?<br />
PS: all the ".itwiki_template_something" sections are specific of the italian wiki, you guys in en.wiki can safely delete them in your monobook. --<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKormoran_1e86.html" title="User:Kormoran">Kormoran</a> 01:27, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On a second thought, I tried my skin by myself here on en.wiki and gone through some serious testing &amp; debugging (the solution is way more complex than 4 rows), finally ending in Fosfori Verdi version 1.1 ^_^ You can get it <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKormoran_monobook.css_196b.html" title="User:Kormoran/monobook.css">here</a>. The white background for thumbs and images is on purpose, since a number of pics are drawn "black on transparent" expecting to be displayed on a white background. However, you can easily change this by modifying the <b>img{}</b> section of my .css, at the very end of the file. --<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKormoran_1e86.html" title="User:Kormoran">Kormoran</a> 02:53, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You put a cleanup tag on the Haute couture article, but didn't say exactly what should be cleaned up. I wrote much of the article, so I'm naturally concerned. I don't think there are any grammar or spelling errors, so what is it? Yes, I know about Anna Wintour's comment in the Guardian -- she didn't exactly say WHAT exactly she found so wrong, which is frustrating. I can't tell if there is something <i>wrong</i> (something that a fashion industry insider would know, and someone who's just a seamstress and a Vogue reader wouldn't) or if she just has a difference of opinion with something there.</p>
<p>So, again, what do YOU see as wrong? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:42, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please hop on IRC and let the devs on #wikimedia-tech know straight away - vandalbots coming from AOL is a doomsday scenario, owing to their stupidly broad proxy network, and Tim Starling really wants to know about this stuff if it springs up. Try to keep it to as small ranges of AOL as possible, though Tim says he'd happily block the whole ISP if the alternative is making the wiki read-only. Drop a line to Wikitech-L as well (you have to subscribe first), detailing what makes you think it's a vandalbot and so on, best detail possible. (If it turns out not to have been a bot, blame me ;-) I'd rather you raised an unnecessary alarm than fail to raise a necessary one.) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 09:25, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My name is Oliver Metz. I am a student at Brent International School, Manila, an International school located in the Philippines. I am doing my last year of school (12th Grade) and I am writing a research paper (about 4000 words) on Wikipedia in ITGS (Information Technology in a Global Society). Of 10 randomly picked people you have been chosen as one. If you are willing and have the time to answer a few questions I would be grateful if you could fill out a short questionnaire of 6 questions.</p>
<p><b>Some Information about my essay:</b></p>
<p>My essay topic is about the freedom to collaborate and the usage of the Internet as a tool to do so. I will analyze topics such as Altruism versus Egoism as well as the Product Wikipedia itself.</p>
<p><b>My Thesis Statement:</b> The Internet is not only a medium for communication, information and marketing but also a place for altruism, collaboration and cooperation. Wikipedia is the product of a voluntary collaborative effort that defies commonly held beliefs about human nature.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or requests you would like to pose before filling out the questionnaire I'd gladly answer them.</p>
<p>you can write to: taklung@gmx.net (I check this e-mail address regularly)</p>
<p><b>Questionnaire:</b></p>
<p>Please answer the following questions by either inserting the answers or sending them to me via e-mail. (*are not necessarily required).</p>
<p>Name*: Age*: Nationality*:</p>
<p>1. How long have you been contributing to Wikipedia?</p>
<p>2. Have you or are you planning to donate money to the Wikipedia cause?</p>
<p>3. When you first heard of Wikipedia and the concepts it is based on, what did you think about it and did you believe it could work? What do you think now?</p>
<p>4. Why do you think people contribute to Wikipedia? With it being voluntary what interests do/did you follow when contributing to Wikipedia?</p>
<p>5. Do you think that Wikipedia appeals to Altruism? If yes, do you think such a thing can exist in our society in which greed and consumption apparently drive the world?</p>
<p>6. What do you think makes Wikipedia most beneficial to society?</p>
<p>Further comments*:</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>Oliver Metz</p>

<p>It breaches the wording of the higher templates, all of which refer to vandalism. Call it what it is. Writing <i>Mary L is an AIDS infected bitch</i> is vandalism. Writing a person's name with seriously libellous claims, as a user did recently, is vandalism. These templates are designed to give blunt warnings to stop. The lower numbers are designed to give less blunt requests that people desist. The wordings are carefully structured to deal with different levels of edits using different strengths of warnings and have a consensus behind them. Stop unilaterally changing agreed formats. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="background-color: orange"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear<i>ÃIREANN</i></b></font></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 23:35, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<p>Test template - Brian, I appreciate what you are doing with the test templates, but I might suggest that you initiate some discussion first - since you are doing more than tweeking these. These are heavily used messages. I just blocked someone for racid pediophilic vandalism and found myself leaving a '<i>please</i> come back' message on his user page. That is NOT what I want to say. These messages need to cover a multitude of situations, and unless we are to have multiple templates, we need a 'lowest common denominator' message - or admins will continually have to write their own. As I say, I like your motives - and the lanuage could be improved. But perhaps you should restore the original test messages - and post a set of proposed changes on AN for discussion by RC patrolers. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 23:42, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True. The last thing Wikipedia needed to say to a vandal accusing a prominent politician of genecide in random unconnected articles lately was "please come again". Template 4 designed for clear and deliberate continuous vandalism, while Template 6 is meant for the most serious case, such as someone lately who used his school computer to post homophobic rants and who refused to stop when asked nicely over and over again. It made it clear that Wikipedia might take action against him. The moment he read that he stopped, as did the guy replacing user pages with pictures of penises for months. They are bluntly worded because in the extreme cases where they are used polite 'please stop' notices have been found not to work. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="background-color: orange"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear<i>ÃIREANN</i></b></font></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 23:53, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></dd>

<p>Interesting idea. The problem is that for JavaScript to be able to look for a particular word, it has to be looking through a string. And as far as I know, I don't think JavaScript can take the whole page and turn it into a string. It can do a lot of other things with the HTML, but as far as I know, not read it if the page hasn't been specifically designed for my script to read it. Sorry.</p>
<p>However, I don't know why, but I have this hunch about the idea. I'll look into it. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaverocks_009d.html" title="User:Daverocks">Daverocks</a> 05:07, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../e/x/p/Special%7EExport_1a62.html" title="Special:Export">Special:Export</a> is a nice tool, but, again, JavaScript can't turn the text of this page into a string, especially since in the XML file, none of the text is given IDs. Keep in mind that JavaScript was never originally designed to be as powerful as it is often used to be nowadays.</dd>

<dd>The idea that I have is that in the HTML of every Wikipedia page, things <b>are</b> given IDs. I could exploit this but... I'm not sure. I'll think about it.

<p>Would you happen to know how to make a firefox extension using Javascript? It would be very simple and used to fight vandalism. The basic idea is to feed RC diff's into firefox, and let it determine which pages contain text (such as an obscenity) listed in a file. For pages that don't contain anything on this list, the tab is closed. The others remain open and ready to be examined. If you can't figure out how to hookup the IRC RC output into firefox, then it could be used with WP:CDVF to open new tabs in firefox to be checked. I found a guide to making extensions, but it says you need to know Javascript. Thanks. â BRIAN0918 â¢ 2005-10-30 03:49</p>

<dd>Hi Brian. hum, tough question. I haven't written any Firefox extensions myself. I'd say that what you propose could be a very interesting addition to WP:CDVF, however, having it as a separate entity could be difficult, especially in terms of keeping track of what has been checked or not. You could also add some checks for empty articles. Best luck to you. <a href="../../../z/e/_/User%7EZe_miguel_0384.html" title="User:Ze miguel">Ze miguel</a> 16:37, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, not everyone agrees, per the discussion you cite.

<dd>No, I don't usually give a fig what those who dwell on IRC/mailing list decide and hand out to the rest of us as fiats.

<dd>...no they're not...but more seriously, I think the extra stuff on the bottom of {test} is a good idea, but in the wrong place. Since this template often appears multiple times on, say, an anon's talk page, it is going to start looking more than a little odd if it is used regularly. I suggested at <a href="../../../t/e/s/Template_talk%7ETest_d798.html" title="Template talk:Test">Template talk:Test</a> removing the bullets but keeping the new phrasing.
