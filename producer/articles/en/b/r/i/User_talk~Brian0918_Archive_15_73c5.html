<p>Heya,</p>
<p>on the Grocer's page you mentioned that there was a full-text HTML version of the book...but unfortunately I can't seem to find it on that page. I poked around, but I just am missing it (I'm sure it's right in front of my face&#160;:P). If you could give me the URL for the HTML version, that'd be really helpful.

<p>Your message is completely unverifiable and arouses little sympathy and I am at a loss as how to respond. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 10:16, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking around your message is fairly easily verifiable. I am now confused by your unwillingness to state that X is not gay. It seems that besides an apology that is all we can do to rectify the problem. Also, do you know how often these mirror sites update and thus how quickly they will no longer list X? <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 10:37, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brian,</p>
<p>Craig Buchanan, a new user, has claimed he was blocked while editing from IP82.34.45.47 over the weekend, On the last time about 5 hours ago, you were nominated as the administrator who blocked him. I suspect but I am not sure that the reason you blocked that IP was that Mr Transit had used that account. Craig Buchanan has asked that this IP be unblocked so that he can create an account.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for your advice as to whether unblocking would be appropriate. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 17:57, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, ain't he cute? He wants it as the featured article on Christmas. Militant atheists...just as bad as evangelical Christians. (Now you'll respond I'm a brainwashed Catholic.

<dd>I wouldn't really call him a militant Atheist just for supporting an article... anyways, Brian, thanks for the message. However, I'm still relatively new (been here just under two months) and I'm kind of confused as to how I would support the article. Do I have to wait until December 24 to vote on it?

<dd>I understand, Brian, and agree with the need for sources. But the <i>way</i> you are doing it <i>will</i> seriously backfire. You need to encourage people to do this, not adopt an approach which seems like an accusation. Plonking it at the top is guaranteed to backfire. It seems as though you are making an accusation against the authors. Or at least get a better less accusatory template that says something like <i>Wikipedia strongly urges all authors to cite sources in articles. If you can provide any sources for articles, please add them in.</i> The current template in the current location implies that the work is substandard, whereas it may simply be that the work is fine but the sources weren't added in people the authors, perfectly genuinely, didn't think WP required them. Doing it the way you are doing it is simply likely to lead to the deletion of the template by furious and offended contributors, not the adding in of citations. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 15:42, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brian0918, I find it questionable that you cut through article namespace, slapping "unsourced" templates on articles. If you want to draw attention to your cause, I would suggest you use the talk pages. Many of the articles you tagged have excellent "external links" section, which isn't as respectable as ISBNs, but even more useful in many cases. Also, you could take the time to actually compile a references section for one or two articles in the time you spend to tag dozens, which I would consider a more constructive approach. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:56, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>that's fine, I suppose. I tend to disagree with the sweeping "External links are not sources", but that's just my opinion. I guess people can always remove the templates if they disagree. Your approach seems rather aggressive, but of course if it leads to the desired result, cheers to you. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 15:17, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think the external links and references sections serve entirely different purposes, so having an excellent external links section is not sufficient. The unsourced template should be used in such a case. He could simply work on adding reference sections himself, but it's clear that most wikipedians don't think about references, and the case should be made to them that this section needs to be in the articles they work on. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane">Jacoplane</a> 15:45, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I add my complete agreement with Dbachmann's original comments. Several pages on my watchlist have recently had {{unsourced}} added to them by you, with the comment:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This often-viewed article has no References section. Its content should be thoroughly sourced. See WP:CITE for methods of citation</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Whilst I have no argument with the premise that articles should cite their sources, and I do so with most of my edits, I strongly believe that <i>washing our dirty linen in public</i> by putting tags like this on <i>often-viewed articles</i> is wholely wrong. If an article is often-viewed then it surely must be getting something right, and we should not be sowing unnecessary doubts in our non-editing readers minds by putting in tags like this. Tags are fine where the article is clearly lame, but in these circumstances we need to find other ways of communicating the need to improve the article. Isn't that what discussion pages are for?. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 15:49, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not "hostile". You do seem to be putting this in every fricken page. The reference for the material in a top level article (eg., popular articles) is most often is in the lower article (one that is wlnked), is unnecessary, or is in "External links" (something I see that is used as a 'reference' for manythings ... but should properly be called a reference section).</dd>

<p>The tag should be on the talk page. Only severe content (such as NPOV) problems should be flagged on the page itself. There's already plenty of defacement with various tags and flags that can distract readers, detract from the content, and disturb the alignment of other items at the top of the page. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:09, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is obvious that on Wikipedia we accord NPOV more importance than CITE. We have tolerated poorly cited material for a long time, and I'm completely with SimonP that these tags should not be on pages themselves. I am moving the template because I do actually care about the presentation of Wikipedia articles. I do share your concern about unsourced material, especially after the recent high-profile criticism Wikipedia has received, and I reckon you noticed that I've sourced numerous articles with adequate source material. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:17, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

Remember, though, one is a "guideline" (eg., it is not policy) and the other is "official policy". Acknowledging the common opposition to Wikipedia "<i>that the content can't be trusted</i>" does not dictate that this enforcement should allow spamming the tag. A citation doesn't necessarily mean that the "<i>content can be trusted</i>". Again, a referenced piece of information can be as debatable as unreferenced piece of information (pending the reference and how it was cited). As JFW states below, "Not putting boxes on articles pages is not the same as ignoring CITE".</dd>
<dd>Repeating again .... <b>IF</b> an editor derives a part of an article from somewhere, <b>that editor</b> should making it clear where it is from .... and <b>IF</b> there is some question on POV (eg., need a ref for a stance that is not NPOV) or some question on accuracy problem (eg., some question by someone (perferable <i>not a bot</i>) as to the truthfulness of a statement) should this tag be put in, IMO.</dd>
<dd>Can you provide who is the "common opposition" and particular instances that can be corrected?

Many sources of information have "common opposition" that state thier content cannot be trusted absolutely ( ... CNN and FOX news are 2 that come to mind off hand that have poeple that question the credibility of the institution ...) and if a particular instances <i>is</i> pointed out that can be corrected. And, contrary to the critics, an encyclopedia as your only "trusted source" can lead to fundamental errors (if that "trusted source" (such as the <a href="../../../e/r/r/Wikipedia%7EErrors_in_the_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_that_have_been_corrected_in_Wikipedia_5d26.html" title="Wikipedia:Errors in the Encyclopædia Britannica that have been corrected in Wikipedia">EB) is wrong</a>; which has, can, and will happen).

<dd>I wouldn't have gone through with it unless I was comfortable that other Wikipedians I knew and respected were alright with it, in this case members of Arbcom and Wikimedia. How is my placing the template in the article not the first step toward getting the article's editors to add a references section? I've noticed at least two articles that have since added references sections, presumably because of my template. As I have repeated at least 5 times, it is easier for one person to motivate several others to edit articles they know about than to have that one person go through unknown articles searching for sources on content that person did not write. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-1 20:28</small></dd>

<p>Could you please give a link to the discussion with the Arbcom and Wikimedia members? ...&#160;??? ... (it may be helpful to this converstation [I'll check back] and <i>ignoring</i> other editors that you "don't know" isn't a good thing) ... ... moving on, adding the template in an article <i>when it is not needed</i>, eg. unsourced but othewise perfectly good articles, is not a good way of achieving the end of better references. Additionally, a "references section" is not absolutely necessary. It may be nice to alot of articles ... but it's not "vital" to all articles. .... I was also kinda waiting for you to state the refrain "one person to motivate several others " .... that you are only "passing the buck" (as I had seen you state before). Placing the tag on an article (especially when the person going through doesn't known about the article) will just have the tag removed (usually by the editors that put in the content in the first place) ... and the article will <i>still</i> have no references. AND, what about "some material" that is used from another article and put in a "main" article .... the sub articles have the references ... but it's be "too much" to have them all in the main article. A <i>better thing</i> would be to go out and get references for the articles that you know about ... or can find out about.

<p>In <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> the refereces are easily visible as external links. If you had taken the time to track those link you would have seen the big three reference works, and the population reference. I get the idea you just shotgunned the link down without clicking them. I went through the silly exercise of moving them to a new reference section. You have a point on the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> page there was no external links nor a reference section. If you are going to do this, then do it right. If you are going to shotgun tags on stuff, please stop. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 17:45, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The only reason I've had to place these links on several pages is because several pages don't have reference sections. I was simply acknowledging that the article doesn't follow <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. How are readers supposed to know which external links are just links to "other related sites" and which external links are sources? This isn't just my opinion either. I discussed this thoroughly with members of Arbcom and Wikimedia. It's just that I am the only one of us that is going through the tedium of adding the actual templates. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-1 17:53</small></li>

<p>Please give me the links to the places where this discussion waas caried out. I do agree that I must be missing some points. In particlular, I don't quite understand what this would mean "to discuss a year in detail"? Can you show me an example how it was done?</p>
<p>If you mean what I think, then AFAIK this would be one huge <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> and POV, and its "NPOVed" form will simply look like the lists we have only withour bullets and various opinions. IMO the current lists must be left as they are: just lists. And year summaries could be separate articles: 1984 in the world, 1984 in Poland, 1984 in Africa, 1984 in San Francisco, 1984 in Apopka Snake Farm, Soutrh Carolina, USA. It is much more convenient to separately maintain "articles proper" and lists related to articles, like <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jews_2000.html" title="List of Jews">List of Jews</a></p>
<p>In any case, in the current state I have already explained why this is wrong.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are making such sweeping changes based on some consensus, you better put it into the comment line, so that people would try to understand reasoning. Wikipedia is not democracy, but there is no arbcom's cabal either.</p>
<p>I undesrtand your desire to make wikipedia better. But 90% of its articles are in miserable state, and slapping a sticker or several of them on each non-perfect article will hardly make its better. We are not in Mocrosoft or Ford Motors here. People are working here in their spare time. And I can easily imagine quite a gew of them to get annoyed by excessive and pervasive commandeering. People already complain that policies and guidelines grew worse than in is some bureaucracies, and now you are placing "No smoking" on every corner. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:33, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
