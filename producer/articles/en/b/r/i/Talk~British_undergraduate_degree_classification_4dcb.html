<p>It would make sense to report what percentages of students recieve the different grades. The article does state, that approximately 20% recieve a 3rd degree and 10% recieve a 1st degree, but what about a 2:1 and a 2:2. Are these two groups equally big, meaning that those who recieve a 2:1 is the best 45%? - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_K_4ac6.html" title="User:Marc K">Marc K</a> 19:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Generally the proportions are roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st - top 10%</li>
<li>2:1 - next 50%</li>
<li>2:2 - next 30%</li>
<li>3rd - bottom 10%</li>

<p>The "Drinkers Degree" section is inaccurate and degrading. "Icairns" needs to do his homework before saying such a thing. People with 2:2s can succeed on POSTGRADUATE degree courses. There are schoolteachers with Third Class Degrees ..... only a fool would write these people off. One woman on my degree course got a Third Class Degree, and she wasn't stupid at all. You can't judge someone solely on their degree classification</p>
<dl>
<dd>I got a 2:2 and I'm on a Postgrad course. I knew people who were doing Postgrad study with a 3rd. It really depends on the number of enrolments and the quality of your dissertation I think.

<dd>To me it appears that the term "drinker's degree" used in the Guardian link is referring to a 3rd class degree. Although it could be taken to refer to a 2:2 depending on how you choose to interpret it. I have heard it used to describe a 2:2 before. I scraped a 2:1 yesterday woohoo!

<p>The term "drinkers degree" is in common use across the UK both in universities and the workplace, the fact some people don't like it is irrelevant. If wikipedia is to represent a full body of knowledge it should be included. (<a href="../../../b/o/d/User%7EBoddah_23bd.html" title="User:Boddah">Boddah</a> 12:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Boddah - The term "drinker's degree" was common at the University of Sussex when I graduated in 2005. The 2:2 was also referred to as the "Sportsman's", as the Wednesday away games and partying of a Uni sports team-member tended to impact on study time. It was considered a forgone conclusion that the captain of any team was doomed to a 2:2, as they were expected at every social event, without fail.</dd>

<p>The first paragraph ends with <i>"It is similar to the Latin honors system used in <b>North America</b>"</i> however this 'British' system is used in Canada and not the Latin honors used in the USA.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Typically a distinction is made between "honours" and "general" degree programs, where only the former is suitable as a prerequisite for graduate work. Often, graduates with averages above some threshold are also granted special recognition, e.g. "with distinction" or "dean's honours list". There are usually a couple medals or awards for really outstanding graduates.</dd>

<dd>I suppose this resembles the British system more than the American: however, I've never heard of the level of stratification seen in the British system. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 17:42, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Few third class degrees are in fact awarded [...] It is therefore rare for a graduating class to include more than a small handful of Thirds."</p>
<p>This seems like too broad a generalisation. Certainly in science subjects at my university (<a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_University_84ef.html" title="Durham University">Durham</a>) thirds were fairly common - probably (vying with firsts) the smallest classification, but certainly not rare enough to justify the above description. I understand that thirds (and firsts) are much rarer in arts and social sciences, however. Does anyone have aggregated statistics on the number of degrees of each class given each year? A brief bit of research suggests that the volume "Students in Higher Education Institutions", published each year by HESA, would have the information in; but I don't think it's online. <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 22:14, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am very doubtful about the latest addition about the diploma. Here no "consolation prize" is given if you fail the 3rd year. Someone from Britain may confirm? Maybe editors can cite their sources or give examples of universities who act this way? i.e. an undergraduate course supposedly leading to a degree giving out certificates and diplomas. <a href="../../../v/o/d/User%7EVodkaJazz_6d7b.html" title="User:VodkaJazz">VodkaJazz</a> 19:48, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two different forms of notation are used in this article for second class honours. The first is used almost throughout - the 2:2 and 2:1 notation, the other is used in the non-bulleted portion of the "Undergraduate degree honours slang" section - 2:i and 2:ii. Elsewhere, I have seen 2:2 written as II.2. Why are there different forms of notation? Do different universities use different notation? If not, what is the "correct" notation? 86.137.199.185 13:26, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think probably they're all acceptable. My university uses IIA and IIB in its exam results, which is completely different. But everyone still calls it a 2.1 and a 2.2. <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBovineBeast_eec5.html" title="User:BovineBeast">BovineBeast</a> 09:22, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it not common for degree classifications to be calculated as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt;=70% - 1st</li>
<li>60-69% - 2:1</li>
<li>50-59% - 2:2</li>

<li>40-44% - Pass</li>
<li>&lt;40% - Fail</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are Universities that do not use this system and there are some that base you overall mark more on your work over the course of the degree than the exams but is this not the system used in the majority of universities in the UK?

<p>When a candidate is awarded a degree with honours, adding '(Hons)' is an unofficial practice and not part of the official degree designation.

<dd>But surely it's no more 'unofficial' than abbreviating the degree to BA in the first place since there aren't any 'official' abbreviations. My uni certainly used the (Hons) suffix in the titles of their courses, though of course my degree certificate has the full 'Bachelor of Arts with Honours'.
