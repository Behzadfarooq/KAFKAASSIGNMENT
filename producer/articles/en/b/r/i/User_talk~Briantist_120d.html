<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriantist_120d.html" title="Edit section: Channel 4 logo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Channel 4 logo</span></h2>
<p>From the Channel 4 style guidelines: The Channel 4 identity should always be surrounded by a minimum area of space. The area of isolation ensures that headlines, text or other visual elements do not encroach on the logo. The area is defined by using a third of the height of the logo which is referred to as x. A margin of clear space equivalent to 0.3x is drawn around the logo to create the invisible boundary of the area of isolation.</p>
<p>It is important that the appearance of the logo remains consistent. The logo should not be misinterpreted, modified or added to. The logo must never be redrawn, adjusted or modified in any way. It should only be reproduced from the artwork provided. To illustrate this point some of the more likely mistakes are shown.</p>
<p>...</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not place the logo in a box.</li>
<li>Do not place the logo in a frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you revert the logo again, then this will be seen as vandalism, and you may be blocked.</p>

<p>Oh well, I've had nearly 20 years working with TV corporate identities... The version that has been locked on to the page is wrong.</p>
<p>I'm just following the guidelines, mate. It has a white background if it's on something that's white. More importantly, it cannot be placed in a box. that's why I'm saying it's wrong. If it breaks in IE, then maybe you should create a version that is not in a box, but also which doesn't break in IE? -- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">9cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 13:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But the version you have installed is of poor resolution, and you are looking at the guidelines for printing on paper. It also breaks the rules as it is so large that gets a border from the box on the page ("Do not place the logo in a frame").</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, as I said on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">channel 4</a> talk page, feel free to create a higher resolution image that is transparent. Only reason I didn't do it myself is because I'm on a machine without suitable software. -- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">9cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 13:59, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you actually look at what is being used by Channel 4: into and out of ad-breaks and all other on-screen versions the logo is cut out of white. This is not possible on paper. This doesn't mean there has to be an additional background colour.-- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">9cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 13:59, 20 January 2006 (UTC) The best way to do this would be to have to whole box background white, but you are going against what is shown on the website.</p>
<p>Surely the purpose of wikipedia is to reflect what is actually shown to the viewer?</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have to follow guidelines -- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">9cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 13:59, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm quite happy to ring Channel 4 to get their guidance, if that is what is required.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As said earlier, I have the C4 guidelines, of which I have pasted the excerpt about the logo above.-- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">9cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 13:59, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've got new logos direct from the Channel 4 press office. Can I be alowed to upload these?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not an admin, so I cannot unprotect the page. If they've got the transparent background, which will solve the issue with the "white box", and works in IE (which is buggy), then go ahead and upload once it's been unprotected. -- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">9cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 14:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you please clarify the following sentence you added to the Ceefax article?-</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There is still a limited Ceefax service broadcast alongside <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_World_2ae1.html" title="BBC World">BBC World</a> that covers British news on.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is this related to 'Pages from Ceefax' (the section it was placed in), or does it just mean an ordinary (but limited) Ceefax service?</p>
<p>I didn't want to remove this, as it looks like worthwhile information.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd>I don't quite understand. I wasn't aware, and have never suggested that, the BBC are going to remove any radio services from digital terrestrial television after the digital switchover. What I do know is that BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4 are currently broadcast on Multiplex A and there are no plans for them to move. As Multiplex A is due to become a one of the 'commercial' multiplexes after the switchover, these radio stations will not be on the PSB multiplexes and therefore will not be available on all the relay transmitters like the channels on Multiplexes 1, 2 and B (including Five and S4C, which are moving). - <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Tentacle_f78f.html" title="User:Green Tentacle">Green Tentacle</a> 21:12, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have written to the BBC for clarification on this point, but as far as I understand it BBC radio via Freeview is very popular and the BBC will have the space to carry these four 'original' stations on Multiplex 1 when it switches to 64QAM mode. The space on multiplex B is being 'gifted' to five, S4C and S4C2. I have written confirmation from both the BBC and S4C on this point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Jackie Burdon, BBC Date: Nov 29 2005 - 6:26pm Five will move to one of the BBC muxes at switchover, as will S4C and S4C2 in Wales. This is to ensure that, as public service broadcasters, they have near-universal coverage in the digital world. The move will be possible without displacing any BBC services, because at switchover the BBC will return from 16QAM to 64QAM mode but maintain equivalent coverage and robustness of signal thanks to the high power transmissions which will be possible post switchover. The mode change will create capacity equivalent to two standard channels on each of the BBC's multiplexes - enough for five, S4C and S4C2. S4C isn't a whole multiplex in this instance - are you thinking of SDN, the multiplex operator that was founded in part by S4C? You are right that the three commercial multiplexes will not have the same level of universal coverage after switchover as the three psb muxes you describe - though I'm not sure we can assume they won't roll out at all. It is the case that they are not obliged to reach the same level of coverage as the psb muxes - and indeed will not be able to achieve it for technical reasons. But they may make a commercial decision to extend their coverage substantially.</p>

<p>I'm curious as to why you're so protective of this sample excerpt and its credits - placing a sample on Wikipedia and stating it is an Unreleased Mix is the equivalent of uploading what you would call a "Promo Mix" and the track then getting a full release.</p>
<p>The sample you have uploaded MAY have come from a vinyl, printed as "Unreleased", but as you may or may not know, it has been. Three times. Once on the "Close Up (Hop)" vinyl, once as part of the "That Was Close" cassette mix and subsequently on the "That Was Close" addition to the "What Have You Done With My Body, God?" boxset. My changes, while not altering the sample itself and leaving your addition to the release listing above it (which, by the way, I also have a couple of issues with - let me check my full AON collection first before I amend THAT. And, yes, I do have EVERY AON release, including promos and reissues. I'm a bit of a fan meself...), merely acknowleged what the sample actually IS (not what it could have been from a promo copy), from a fresh visitors perspective. Which, with Wikipedia as a Encyclopedia, must be the priority. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumbsucker-UK_1ee8.html" title="User:Thumbsucker-UK">Thumbsucker-UK</a> 14:07, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The lablel on the record says "UNRELEASED MIX" and therefore I am simply replicating the information onto Wikipedia. I had the cassingle too, and I know that it's all on there, but the sample was recorded from the vinyl, and we are documenting what ACTUALLY HAPPENED here not a reinterpritation of the events. The fact that the names of the remixes have been altered after the event does not actually effect the truth of where the sample that I have provided for the wikipedia actually came from. The cassingle I have calls the all-in-one-mix "Best of Close - Closest Hits - Close Enough - Come Closer" and I have "Closely Closely (Enoughs Enough), "Close-Up", "Close-Up (Hop)", "Edited".

<dd>I fully appreciate your desire to replicate the facts as accurately as you can in regard to the sample you've uploaded but once again the best analogy I can think of is... if a track was initially issued on a promo printing, featuring what would subsequently become a full release, it would be more, if not beneficial, than certainly more relevant for a fresh reader with a passing interest in that track to be given the information as a full release. As it stands, your listing gives a reader the impression that this sample cannot be found anywhere because you have entered it as "Unreleased" when, by your own admission, it was. I'm not going to go in and re-edit this entry, you uploaded it and I frankly can't be that arsed to trample on your particular patch of this territory - I woud only appeal to your sense of pedantry to acknowledge that to someone interested in this track would be under the impression that this excerpt was "Unreleased" instead of what the sample excerpt was actually called on its FULL release.</dd>

<dd>Oh, and other thing - you read the title and listing on the cassette of "This Is Close" as titled "Best Of Close etc...". A warning; all the text on that part of the cassette insert is made up of, as per usual, the demented, arrogant, grandiose, pre-madonna waffling rantings of Mr Paul Morley (you ever get the feeling I ain't too keen on this self-serving prat?? For listening to him in interviews, you'd think the band would have never come to fruition without him. The arse.) The more comprehensive and accurate listing is on the other side of the insert, with the publishing legalities (reproduced here - <a href="http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=R&amp;obid=53431" class="external free" title="http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=R&amp;obid=53431" rel="nofollow">http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=R&amp;obid=53431</a>) and can also be found in detail in the fantastic booklet that accompanies the boxset "...Body, God?" (I'd get that if you haven't already - amazing package, from a fans perspective, truly amazing ...). Right, that's my nit-picking over and done with.

<dd>I fully apreciate, as I did at the time the marketing angle that Paul Morley brought to AON, and yes, there is a deliberate obfuscation caused by calling a mix "unreleased" when I bought it in the Virgin Megastore in Leeds in 1984. The problem with "...Body, God?" is that it is a rewriting of history, of course. Nit picking is good as it gets to the truth of the matter! Briantist 09:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Briantist and thank you for helping out with the BBC Portal. Unfortunately, we cannot use the BBC logo anywhere other than within articles due to the fair use criteria that allows its usage on Wikipedia. I myself have had problems in the past with using the logo for the BBC stub template (the image was deleted) so unfortunately we are unable to use the BBC logo itself on the portal. We can however use images of BBC buildings, presenters and similar but rather annoyingly, not images. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwoohoo_4afe.html" title="User:Wikiwoohoo">Wikiwoohoo</a> 19:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Briantist, it is recommended that you use the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Help%7EShow_preview_e6da.html" title="Help:Show preview">preview</a> button before you save; this helps you find any errors you have made, and prevents clogging up <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPage_history_b7d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Page history">page history</a>.

<dd>I am using an unreliable internet connection and use the save facility to stop my working being lost. Briantist 10:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, can I suggest that you either 'select all' and 'copy' the whole content of the article before pressing preview so that you have a copy of the changes you have made, or that you copy the whole text into a text editor such as Notepad or Word, make your changes and then paste back into the edit box and press preview? Making many saves makes it harder for other editors to see what changes you have made as well as cluttering up the page history, recent changes and other peoples watchlists. (It also means you only need one edit summary.) Thanks, <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattbr30_b780.html" title="User:Mattbr30">mattbr<sup>30</sup></a> 11:50, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>No, I'm not trying to impose my own rules, asking users to use the preview button is common practice, due to the reasons previously stated and those listed at the link above.

==Speedy deletion of Image:BBC News 24 evolution 2.jpg==
</pre>
<p>A tag has been placed on Image:BBC News 24 evolution 2.jpg, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done for the following reason:</p>
<center><i><b>Duplicate of previous version of Image:BBC News 24 evolution.JPG.</b></i></center>
<p>Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#General_criteria" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not meet <i>very</i> basic Wikipedia criteria may be deleted at any time. Please <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as an appropriate article</a>, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is appropriate, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

<p>I'm not particularly sure what you're talking about in what you posted on my talk page, but if you had been paying any attention at all, you'd realize it wasn't MY knowledge I was posting but that written by someone else and inappropriately reverted by someone with a stick up their ass. Also, when you're going to post rude things on talk pages, don't use 'please'.

<p>Brian, you're continuing to add an image that is in clear violation of our policies. Even if the image had been taken from McKeith's website, it would be in violation, but given that it's a Channel 4 image of her, the copyright issue is very clear, and it means we can't claim fair use under Wikipedia's rules. Now that we have a free-license one available, it's an even clearer violation. I'm having some trouble getting the new one to upload, but I'll sort out the technical issues soon, and then we'll have an image on the page, so please be patient.

<p>Please try to be more careful. I can understand that you felt there was a problem in the case of your third revert, since the image SlimVirgin added didn't seem to load properly at first, but you were repeatedly adding an image after being told that it was a policy violation, and, whether you agreed or not, it would have been more appropriate to have left the article without any image, and to have tried to reach a solution on the discussion page. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> 21:05, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

It even says that at the top of the page. Regardless, you had an administrator and others telling you that it wasn't allowed, and the article without your picture was not in some obviously damaged state that had to be corrected urgently. There are good reasons why blatant vandalism and BLP problems can be reverted without reference to the three-revert rule, as it can be problematic to leave an article in a vandalised state, or with negative unsourced information about a living person who might sue Wikipedia. But the lack of an image is not something that has to be <i>urgently</i> corrected. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> 21:13, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we'll have to agree to disagree on that. Image policy is complicated, and I don't fully understand it myself. But I do realise that since Wikipedia is a "free" encyclopaedia, we want everything in our articles to be able to be freely copied by others, and reused, and modified. So a copyrighted image may only be used under Fair Use if it would be impossible to get a free image. I was recently looking at the user page of someone who had reverted some vandalism, and I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3APublicity_photos&amp;diff=66922063&amp;oldid=58823881" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3APublicity_photos&amp;diff=66922063&amp;oldid=58823881" rel="nofollow">this</a> quotation, where the founder of Wikipedia says "We are much better off to have no photo than to have a fair use or even "wikipedia only" photo."</dd>
<dd>The point I'm making, however, is that you seem to be in such a huge hurry to force your own version of the article. Obviously, if someone vandalises an article, in the sense of falsifying the information, replacing the page with an obscene word, etc., you don't and shouldn't wait to discuss it on the talk page, because it's urgent to restore the article to its unvandalised state. But there is no urgency in restoring an image that someone took out on the grounds of policy. Even if she's wrong, the article can survive without the image while discussion goes on. There is no urgency in restoring a quotation that you want to use. It's not like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weighing_scale&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107613339" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weighing_scale&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107613339" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It won't harm Wikipedia's status if someone happens to read the article a moment later and your quotation isn't in it. That's why I'm asking you to stop reverting so forcefully, and in particular to stop using "rvv" as edit summaries when it's not vandalism. Thanks. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> 10:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not trying to force "my version" of the article, I have used "rvv" when people have removed items with references and replaced them with unreferenced content. <span style="border-top: 1px solid #962B00; border-bottom: 1px solid #962B00"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriantist_b9e9.html" title="User:Briantist"><b><span style="background-color:#5A7300; color:#F5A009">••Briantist••</span></b></a></span> <strong class="selflink"><span style="color:#8A7E58"><i>talk</i></span></strong> 11:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC) If this was my view of this awful <b>quack quack</b> (as she is called on the Guardian website today) woman I would be much more foreful.

<dd>No, just your lack of interest in it. It suggests you have no sources. If the whole text is taken from s single source, please use refs with the "name=" parameter. It's easy. I don't have your document, so it's not up to me to find references. If you do, just add them.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Dr Ben Goldacre on Gillian McKeith.ogg</b>. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.</p>
<p>As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p>As a representative of the Max Clifford Intelligent Design Foundation I must ask you to stop constantly revealing the identity of our agents... Seriously though, if you only cared to look around you would notice that most editors on that page are seasoned skeptics themselves. I simply prefer a more moderate, source-based page, and one that does not attack the subject at every point. The goal should be to give her some space, and then cite sources like the nutrition authorities and Ben Goldacre's column in the BMJ to refute her. <i>Please do not assume that our readers are not complete morons that need to be told one thousand times that the subject is wrong.</i> It is important that our criticism is well cited and accurately labeled, otherwise we are no better than the quacks we try to debunk! Assume that our readers are highly intelligent, and we need to provide them the most accurate criticism and most honest description of our sources! --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 16:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A tag has been placed on <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fripp_and_Eno_8dcf.html" title="Fripp and Eno">Fripp and Eno</a>, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time.
