<p>The standard units contained passenger seating only, and formed the backbone of the new fleet. 111 units were built in several batches, initially numbered in the range 7101-7211. Units 7101-7104 were the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prototype.html" title="Prototype">prototype</a> units, and were followed by 'Phase 1' units (7105-7153) and subsequently 'Phase 2' units (7154-7211).</p>
<p>Units were formed of two outer driving motors cars, sandwiching two intermediate trailer cars.</p>

<p>During the late 1970s and early 1980s, British Rail recognised that the 4Cep fleet was in need of refurbishment. This was carried out at BR's <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon_railway_works.html" title="Swindon railway works">Swindon Works</a>. Refurbishment included moving the guard's compartment from both the motor cars to one of the intermediate trailers. Many of the 4Bep fleet were converted to standard units, since the requirement for buffet cars had declined.</p>
<p>The first refurbished unit was no. 7153, which was later renumbered to 1500. This unit was experimentally refurbished in 1975 at <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastleigh_railway_works.html" title="Eastleigh railway works">Eastleigh Works</a>. Following evaluation, the contract for the refurbishment of the rest of the fleet was awarded to BR's <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon_railway_works.html" title="Swindon railway works">Swindon Works</a>. Subsequent refurbished standard units were renumbered in the range 1501-1621, and reclassified as <b>Class 411/5</b>. Only seven 4Bep units were retained and refurbished, being renumbered in the range 2301-2307, and reclassified as <b>Class 412/0</b>. The remaining 4Bep units were converted into 4Cep units by replacing the buffet car with a standard trailer converted from conventional locomotive-hauled coaching stock.</p>
<p><a name="4Tep_units"></a></p>

<p>During refurbishment work, several temporary <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_unit_designations_6430.html" title="British Rail unit designations">4Tep</a> units were created, formed of three carriages from a refurbished Cep unit, with an unrefurbished buffet car from a Bep unit. The units were renumbered in the range 2701-2704. These units were disbanded by 1986, once the refurbishment program was complete. The units were reformed as standard 4Cep units, and the unrefurbished buffet carriages were scrapped.</p>

<p>After rail privatisation in the mid-1990s, the different divisions of British Rail were divided up into different franchises. The three former SR division; South-Eastern, South Central and South-Western; all operated 4Cep units, and are dealt with separately here.</p>

<p>The South Central (SC) division, operated as <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Connex_South_Central_f540.html" title="Connex South Central">Connex South Central</a></b>, briefy operated 4Cep units in the period 1995-1998. Three standard units were converted to <b>Class 411/6</b> by fitting them with high-speed Mk.6 motor bogies. These units were renumbered into the series 1697-1699. They were chiefly employed on <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Bridge_railway_station_8c47.html" title="London Bridge railway station">London Bridge</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_railway_station.html" title="Brighton railway station">Brighton</a> express services. However, as the units were non-standard in the SC fleet, they were withdrawn and transferred to South West Trains.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_411_b975.html" title="Edit section: South Eastern Trains">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">South Eastern Trains</span></h3>
<p>The South Eastern (SE) division inherited the largest fleet of 4Cep units. The franchise was originally operated by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connex.html" title="Connex">Connex</a> as <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Connex_South_Eastern_d574.html" title="Connex South Eastern">Connex South Eastern</a></b>, but after Connex lost the franchise it became <b><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Eastern_Trains_7393.html" title="South Eastern Trains">South Eastern Trains</a></b>. In 1996, when the frachise was awarded, a fleet of 85 standard units were in traffic. Many of these were quickly withdrawn from traffic, or transferred to the SW division. In early 1999, five units were converted to <b>Class 411/9</b> 3Cep units, with the removal of an intermediate trailer. This was necessary, as some stations could only accommodate 11 carriages, so a 12 carriage trains would over-hang the station. A further 13 units were later converted. The 3Cep units were renumbered into the series 1101-1118.</p>
<p>The Connex fleet contained two 'celebrity' units. The first, no. 1592, was repainted by staff at <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slade_Green_3e53.html" title="Slade Green">Slade Green</a> depot into it original Green livery, to commemorate the final months in traffic for these units. The second, no. 1602, was the only 4Cep unit repainted into Connex livery, after it received derailment damage outside <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Bridge_railway_station_8c47.html" title="London Bridge railway station">London Bridge station</a>, and had to be repaired at <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastleigh_railway_works.html" title="Eastleigh railway works">Eastleigh</a> works. Both of these units were popular with railtours and excursion trains.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of units started in 1999, after they were replaced by new <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_375_ce55.html" title="British Rail Class 375">Class 375</a> 'Electrostar' units. The original aim was to totally replace the 4Cep fleet by 2000. However, poor reliabily of the new units saw the 4Cep's retained beyond this date. By the end of 2002, the fleet was again being reduced, with many standard units being sent to <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immingham.html" title="Immingham">Immingham</a> for scrap. The 3Cep units were all withdrawn by March 2003, as units in traffic beyond this date had to be fitted with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Train_Protection_%26_Warning_System_074c.html" title="Train Protection &amp; Warning System">TPWS</a> equipment. In the event, only seven units, nos. 1562, 1590, 1592, 1593, 1594, 1602 and 1615 were retained. These became known to enthusiasts as the "Magnificent 7".</p>
<p>By the beginning of 2004, the seven units were withdrawn as they were due overhaul. They were replaced with units cascaded from South West Trains, which included the three Class 411/6 units. However, these units were themselves slowly retired, and it was expected the final units would have been withdrawn from service before the end of 2004. However, the Class 411/6 units were eventually withdrawn in <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2005.html" title="July 2005">July 2005</a>, following the introduction of refurbished <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_465_91fe.html" title="British Rail Class 465">Class 465/9 "Networkers"</a>. Units 1697 and 1699 were sent for scrap, but 1698 was retained for working railtours. Due to a unit shortage It was later reinstated in August 2005, and remained in traffic until late September. It was one of three units to work a <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsgate.html" title="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> to <a href="../../../w/e/y/Weymouth%2C_Dorset_13b4.html" title="Weymouth, Dorset">Weymouth</a> railtour, the others being 4Cig 1866 and 4Vep 3545. Following this, it was quickly despatched for scrap.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_411_b975.html" title="Edit section: South West Trains">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">South West Trains</span></h3>
<p>The South West (SW) division franchise was won by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach_Group_dc5f.html" title="Stagecoach Group">Stagecoach Group</a> and was operated as <b><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_West_Trains_aff8.html" title="South West Trains">South West Trains</a></b> (SWT). SWT did not inherit any standard 4Cep units, but it did operate the seven 4Bep units. However, in 1996, a shortage of trains led to SWT hiring two sets (nos. 1568 and 1589) on a short-term lease. These units were quickly followed by more, until by 1998, SWT had a fleet of 29 standard 4Cep units. These were gradually overhauled, and were employed on a range of duties, including services to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth.html" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton.html" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth.html" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/y/Weymouth%2C_Dorset_13b4.html" title="Weymouth, Dorset">Weymouth</a>. Additionally, units commonly worked services on the <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lymington.html" title="Lymington">Lymington</a> branch.</p>
<p>The fleet stayed reasonably static until 2002, when SWT reformed several sets. The buffet cars from the 4Bep units were inserted into seven standard units, which were renumbered 2321-2327 (reclassified as <b>Class 412/2</b>). The displaced carriages were inserted into the 4Bep units, which were renumbered 2311-2317 (reclassified as <b>Class 412/1</b>). The reason behind this was that the 4Bep units had faster acceleration, and the buffet cars were no longer used. Therefore the reformations allowed a higher <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seating_capacity.html" title="Seating capacity">seating capacity</a> in the faster units.</p>
<p>By 2003, SWT had ordered new trains, to replace all its slam-door trains. These were designated <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_444_c99b.html" title="British Rail Class 444">Class 444</a> for express trains, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_450_e5f0.html" title="British Rail Class 450">Class 450</a>, for suburban trains. The first units to be replaced were the units in the 232x series, which were due for early withdrawal. Of the seven sets, one, set no. 2323, was withdrawn in 2002 due to fire damage, but was later converted back to a standard unit. Another, set no. 2326, was reduced to a 3Cep, for operating the <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lymington_Flyer_ed35.html" title="Lymington Flyer">"Lymington Flyer"</a> service on the <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lymington.html" title="Lymington">Lymington</a> branch, and was renumbered 1199. The remaining five units lasted until December 2003, when they were withdrawn. One, set no. 2325 was preserved, whilst the rest were scrapped.</p>
<p>The standard units lasted until early-2004, when they were either withdrawn and scrapped, or transferred to South Eastern Trains. One of the 4Bep units, no. 2314, was converted into a 3Cep to replace no. 1199, and was renumbered 1198. Of the remaining six 4Bep units, four were withdrawn in October 2004, leaving just two units remaining in traffic into 2005. The 3Cep unit, no. 1198, was withdrawn at the end of December 2004, and was preserved by the EMU Preservation Society on the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmoor_Railway_c5ad.html" title="Dartmoor Railway">Dartmoor Railway</a>. A replacement came in the form of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_421_5935.html" title="British Rail Class 421">3Cig</a> unit no. 1499. The final two 4Bep units soldiered on in traffic until withdrawal in March 2005. They were both later preserved.</p>
