<p>Should the article "Sovereign" be directed toward this article referring to the *British* monarchy alone? Are not other monarchs sovereigns as well? -- --Larry G 00:08, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nevermind. I was confused that the article actually directed to "British Monarchy", (here), but that there was already a "Sovereign" disambiguation page.- --Larry G 06:55, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
The section on the "fount of honour" is a bit silly. It proclaims that The Sovereign cannot hold an honour, yet in the picture above The Queen can quite clearly be seen to be wearing the insignia of certain Commonwealth orders. The Queen is the Sovereign of all Orders of chivalry and may wear the insignia of all of them. I would change this section but for the fact it forms part of a paragraph telling us that the Sovereign can accept dignities from other heads of state. The two examples are blatantly wrong, but I am not sure about the precedent itself. Can the author clarify? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-Ed_69cd.html" title="User:Wiki-Ed">Wiki-Ed</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Can't we go back to the old way? The Scots kings are in no way British monarchs and neither are the English kings before the union. From this list you cannot tell who ruled what territory and the various short-lived English "houses" are given the same prominence as the entire history of Scots kings. British Monarchs should be limmited to those who were British monarchs. --rmhermen</p>
<p>Good point --</p>
<p>Alternatively, though, why not just point that out on the page itself? It wouldn't hurt to have a brief blurb on "Scotland and Wales were separate until 1603 and whenever Wales was finally annexed; England was a Bunch of little Kingdoms, then one larger kingdom, then joined with Scotland at the death of Elizabeth." That way, people who don't know the difference might learn something! <a href="../../../j/h/k/User%7EJHK_4341.html" title="User:JHK">JHK</a></p>
<p>I don't see your point. Britain existed long before England or Scotland did and any kingdoms which existed on the island were definitely European and British even if they didn't rule the whole of Europe or the whole of Britain. The Kings of the Picts fought the Scottish invaders for many years before they were finally outmanoeuvred. It makes little sense to say that they were Scottish but it's quite reasonable to say that they were British. Likewise once the Scottish and the English had established kingdoms in Britain (rather than Ireland or Denmark/North Germany/Holland, it is reasonable to think of them as British rather than as foreign invaders. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<hr />
<p>A small problem with the British monarch pages is that several monarchs are referred to as "the first" when they shouldn't be. Technically, a monarch is not "the first" until there is a "second", much like there wasn't a "First World War" until there was a "Second World War".</p>
<hr />
<p><i>On February 27, 1998 the House of Lords agreed to give a monarch's first-born daughter the same claim to the throne as a first-born son thus ending 1,000 years of male preference.</i></p>
<p>Is this true? According to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/60808.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/60808.stm" rel="nofollow">the BBC</a> the Bill was withdrawn on that date, though the government said that the Queen did not object to the change. As recently as last year the Govt. said it hadn't the time to change the succession law, according the <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/constitution/story/0,9061,727500,00.html" class="external text" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/constitution/story/0,9061,727500,00.html" rel="nofollow">the Grauniad</a> --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></p>

<p>Your change is correct. Mav left a message on my talk page. I checked with the Buckingham Palace and Downing Street press offices. They could not remember a change, which they would if one had been made. Also, if the change had been made, the Princess Royal, as the Queen's second child, would now be number 4 in the Order of Succession. The Palace confirmed that she is still at no. 8. Any change would require legislation also in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, etc. No such change has yet been made.</p>
<p>While the Blair government has promised to support a change, it probably won't happen for a while, not least because of the Australian complexity, in the aftermath of the republic referendum. Passing an Act on the royal succession could re-open wounds there that are still tender.</p>

<p>Yep - that's why I asked. These damn "this day in history" website people (like <a href="http://www.on-this-day.com" class="external free" title="http://www.on-this-day.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.on-this-day.com</a> and whatever source Zoe is using) copy and modify each other's work and never seem to check their facts. So when mistakes are made by one those errors are copied and often made worse. It's like the children's camp game "telephone" where you whisper a statement to your neighbor's ear and they whisper the statement in the next person's ear and so on. The message at the end of that exercise is often very different from the original. I've been checking their info for a while now - some days are great, others are filled with errors. If anybody has a better source for daily historical event information I would love to hear about it (the damn fact checking is taking way too long for on-this-day info). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I think <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> has (unusually) misdirected himself about <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. To the best of my recollection there is <i>not</i> specific succession legislation in place here, at either the State or Federal level, but rather the succession goes according to a generic "heirs and successors" rule which would automatically pick up on whatever happened in the UK. (Reminder: "automatic" doesn't mean "no Australian involvement" but rather "no subsequent involvement once things start going by themselves".) PML.</p>
<p>There isn't, but under the Australia Act the UK can no longer legislate for the Commonwealth of Australia. Under the current law, the Australian throne automatically passes to the person who inherits the British one. But since the Australia Act there is some confusion as to whether a change in Britain's succession law <i>automatically</i> affects the Australian succession (even if it isn't technically a law change, merely a knock-on effect in Australia's case, in which case it wouldn't be blocked by the Australia Act) or whether as a result of the Australia Act (I think section 5, though I could be wrong) Australia <i>has</i> now to regulate any changes itself in Aussie law. It may well be that just to be on the safe side Australia will decide to produce its own mirror image law matching a UK one, just to cover all eventualities. Otherwise, there might be legal questions thrown up that might have to go to the High Court in Australia, and that could bring up the whole monarchy issue again. And given that complexity, my suspicion is that Howard's government dropped the hint to Blair - please don't do anything for a couple of years that might get Australian republicans all fired up with plans for <i>"Referendum II: The Revenge of the Republicans!'</i> ie, let sleeping dogs lie, especially as William ain't about to marry a catholic let alone produce a daughter. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JtdIrL</a> 06:48 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that establishes my point; that if no action is taken within <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> beforehand, all events within <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> after the "Demise of the Crown" would proceed automatically. That might well involve the courts, but they are supposed (in this area, at any rate) to be involved in Lex Dicere and not Lex Dare - and so, despite involvement of human beings, it would be by way of implementing a mechanism. I would certainly expect less discretion than the Council of Accession has. PML.</p>
<p>The point is that there is a 'grey area' which is a matter of differing legal interpretations. Monarchists might not like it to be left grey, 'just in case . . . ' while republicans would be happy too. But monarchists who would like clarity would probably, to paraphrase St. Augustine, prefer 'clarity, but not yet'. Politicians by experience (including my experience) run a mile from legal complexity. And this is one case: on the one hand, there is the vaid argument that as the succession to the Australian throne is linked to the UK one, no Aussie law change is needed. On the other hand, there is the counter-argument, that post the Australia Act, any legal change in the UK would not be enough, with Australia's law remaining as was the law <i>before</i> the Australia Act. So for example, if after a legal change in the UK, Princess Anne moved from 8th in line to 4th in line, would that automatically apply in Australia, or would Aussie law remain in the pre-1986 state, with Anne being 8th? In such circumstances, Attorneys-General tend to advise the most cautious approach, which would be rather than raise a legal question in the future, to pass an Act in the Aussie parliament matching that in the UK, so that all doubt would be erased. The last thing they would want would be for Anne, or a daughter of Prince William, to become monarch in the UK, followed by lawyers working over the complex laws as they apply to Australia. They may <i>know</i> in reality Anne or that daughter's succession would be automatic, but the last thing they would want to do is have to have some legal queries that they may have to explore, especially when that would give Australian republicans an excuse to demand an <i>immediate</i> referendum on a republic.</p>
<p>Having repatriated the constitution with the Australia Act, even if it was not a legal necessity many Australian monarchists might as a matter of principle wish for the repatriation of the laws governing succession to the Australian throne. Indeed it might make tactical sense for monarchists to insist that post the Australia Act, the basic law should be changed to separate the succession <i>completely</i> from UK law, with a separate Australian succession act, albeit one matching the change in UK law. It is a very blurred area, and you can be quite sure the last thing Canberra, London and Buckingham Palace was in any blurring whatsoever, hence the desire in all three not to stumble into this constitutional minefield, at least not for a couple years, until the dust of the republic referendum has settled. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JtdIrL</a> 05:06 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that rather misses what I was driving at, which is much simpler. suppose the Queen died tomorrow; then there <i>would</i> be an Australian succession. All that the above discussion goes to is what it might deliver. But it is clear that <i>even without</i> separate Australian steps, whether in anticipation or in some hurried way, there would still be an Australian succession. The wisdom of having separate steps, or the possibility of things working out differently from the UK, in no way means that they would <i>not</i> work out to produce some result if there were no intervention. PML.</p>
<p>You are missing the point, PML. The succession law regulates the order of succession. There is a dispute as to whether, post the Australia Act, the <i>United Kingdom</i> can change the Order of Succession for Australia, or whether in relation to the Australian throne, that <i>must</i> be done in accordance with exclusively Australian law. Yes there would be a succession, for the current Australian law matches the current UK law. But if the UK changes the law, there are lawyers who argue that <i>because of the Australia Act</i> that will not change allow automatic change in the Australian succession law, unlike heretofore, that would leave Australia with the <i>old</i> succession list. Hence the argument that if there is a change to the UK law, that <i>will require</i> Australia through its own parliament to keep them identical. If for whatever reason the first three in line, the Prince of Wales, Prince William of Wales and Prince Harry of Wales, were to simultaneously die in an accident (eg, while all three were at the same ski resort) or if Charles and Harry renounces, while William marries a catholic and so is debarred, or if both William &amp; Harry marry catholics, or if Camilla becomes a catholic, the issue of who is number 4 in the list could become crucial. And lawyers argue that a change in the UK law <i>would not</i> automatically change the Aussie order of succession, producing a Queen Anne II in the UK but what in Aussie? In theory, under Aussie law Andrew would be fourth in line, but equally, the Aussie law it is supposed to follow the UK succession, except that the UK and Aussie orders of succession would be legally different. It would be a case of 'The Queen is dead. Long live . . . em who exactly in Australia?' <i>That</i> is why, to avoid confusion that could end up in the courts, the argument is that Australia should separately pass a Bill regulating succession identical to the UK. It simply is not as straight-forward post the <i>Australia Act</i> as you seem to think. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a> 03:09 Mar 9, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<li>British monarch implies a discussion on . . . a British <i>monarch</i> (ie., the person). This article is about monarch<i>y</i>, about the institution, not the person.</li>

<p>In the Political Powers section.</p>
<p>"In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II withheld such consent on the "Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill," which sought to shift the power to order a military strike on Iraq from monarchical control to parliamentary control."</p>
<p>Factually correct but pretty emotive language. It was a member's bill by a very independent member of the labour party. Could we clarify? I'm thinking something fluffy like:</p>
<p>"This was not a government-backed bill. Had the government supported it, it is unlikely consent would have been withheld."</p>
<hr />
<p>No, I definitely don't agree with that clarification. (Also, the specific clarification you suggest is just speculation.) The language as it stands is accurate and factual. The Queen's actions with respect to this bill were important because they reinforced the notion of monarchical prerogative and the attendant responsibility with respect to the waging of war. This is relevant because in certain political circles, Canadian opponents of the Iraq war being one example, there is currently a debate as to whether the Queen bears ultimate responsibility for the Iraq war. Canadian proponents of the monarchy argue that the Queen bears no responsibility and that the blame for the entire enterprise can be layed at the feet of the British and American elected governments. Canadian opponents of the monarchy point to the Queen's assertion of her prerogative powers with respect to this bill as clear evidence that her responsibility is not merely ceremonial or theoretical, but real and actively asserted. (This debate has important implications in Canada in ceremonies where individuals must pledge allegiance to the Queen; a nontrivial, unusually vocal minority of Canadians believes the Iraq war was a criminal enterprise as defined by the Nuremberg Tribunal and that pledging allegiance to an individual holding ultimate responsibility for such a crime is unacceptable.) --Chris Thompson 21:32, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have this entirely wrong. The Queen did not refuse a bill. What happened was that parliament may only discuss the Royal Perogative (which the act of declaring war is) if the Queen agrees first. The Queen however acts on the advice of the Prime Minister when she makes this decision. The Prime Minister asked the Queen to refuse a discussion of the royal perogative to declare war so she did. He did this because he did not want parliament to take over his right to ask the Queen to declare war. It was a PM versus parliament argument not a Queen versus parliament one.</p>

<p>Hello all. This is really a great article on a top which I know very little about. I think a really good section would be about the checks and balances of the monaracy in the 21st century. Take an impossible/worst case scenario, i.e. Queen Elizabeth declares the Prime Minister a traitor, has him executed, declares the UK a dictatorship, and orders a military strike on the United States. That would never happen, of course, but what measures are in place to prevent that it never could? I read alot of the monaracy "has the power but normally would never use it." I think it would be a great topic to talk about what would happen if the monarach tried to.

<dd>Hi there. The whole British constitution relies on the concept of trust in the constitutional system in place and the careful use of the Royal Prerogrative by the Queen and Her Majesty's Government. The scenario you outlined above will never happen and therefore we don't bother thinking about it! That's the beauty of the UK constitution - we assume nothing silly will happen and if anything does happen (ie an emergency) then actions can be taken to ensure things are in place and if a monarchy or minister gets carried away we would go around the authority of the Crown via Parliament. Just like the Crown can overcome the authority of Parliament via dissolution. So the only real check/balance is that the Crown and Parliament share sovereignty (one cannot exist without the other, yet they cannot ignore each other and can over-rule each other). All very strange, but that's the UK! <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpaajones_4ea2.html" title="User:Dpaajones">David.</a></dd>

<p>Given the naive and false presentation of the role of monarchy in Britain in this article - nice propaganda though - I, for one, would welcome an objective revision by some of the above commentators. I suggest that the article remove the claim that the monarchy has been reduced to figurehead status and begin with a factual discussion of Royal Perogative as specified in the Parlimentary paper mentioned above. In fact, I'm going to delete the offending sentence as a start on the basis that it is not NPOV.</p>

<dd>That is not, in fact, the case - as recent reports highlight. There is a complex tension between Parliment and the Monarchy that is not always in the public eye - always has been, and the dynamic ebbs and flows throughout history. The right thing here is to make a simple statement of the facts and not color the article with any POV. Certainly your original wording is what the Monarchy would prefer - and it is popular misconception in the USA - but that propaganda wish does not alter the facts of the matter as outlined in the Parlimentary report. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenzenith_aecc.html" title="User:Stevenzenith">Steven Zenith</a> 01:06, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dr. Zenith, with the greatest possible deference, I should like to note that there is a difference between the power of the Crown (as a corporation aggregate) and the power of the monarch (as an individual). The prerogative of the Crown, exercised by the Government, is indeed vast. However, the British monarch is a constitutional ruler. The Queen's powers are not as extensive as some of your comments might indicate. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 19:07, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, I beg to differ. The position of the Crown as a corporation aggregate is not merely my opinion, but also the view of the courts, both in the United Kingdom (<i>Adams v. Naylor</i>) and in the other Commonwealth realms (<i>Verreault v. Attorney General of Quebec</i> in Canada, for example). Thus, I find that there is a distinction between the monarch as a person and the Government, both in theory and in practice. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Emsworth</a> 19:59, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With equal respect, you continue to miss the point. There is a clear distinction between <i>The Crown</i> government, which is the body that acts on the Monarch's behalf - by powers delegated by the monarch - and the Monarch that continues to have the power to dismiss ministers and assemble parliment. You are misrepresenting the facts found by the recent Parlimentary committee. What would actually happen if the Queen used the full force of her powers is open to speculation - I expect it would lead to civil war today, but in a few years, as times change, it could equally and legally lead to despotism. Present the facts, not a popular spin on the facts, or if we must then explain the common misconception. You have a popular TV view of the matter. And BTW - <i>constitutional convention</i> means NO constitution. The British people are unprotected. - <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenzenith_aecc.html" title="User:Stevenzenith">Steven Zenith</a> 21:27, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. They <i>choose</i> to be unprotected. If they wanted a constitution they could have one through parliament tomorrow. You are seriously overestimating the power of the monarch. A monarch cannot govern on their own. If they acted unilaterally, the government would resign, everyone else would refuse to form a government, and parliament at a stroke could abolish the monarchy. Any monarch who abused their power would be signing their own political death warrant.

The fact is that it has been demonstrably hard to advocate such a written constitution because it would likely disolve the power of Monarchy. The establishment is obstructive to change because most of the civil service is run by the aristocracy and monarchists. Look how hard is has been for elected socialist governements in the twentieth century to bring about such change.

For a start the aristocracy doesn't run the civil service; the middle class do. Making such a demonstrably ludricrous claim suggests a somewhat shaky understanding of British politics on your part. Secondly, there is no evidence of the monarchy in any way undermining socialist governments; on the contrary ministers in the 1960s worked very closely with the Queen. You have a lose way with words and seem not to understand how British society actually works, who are its key influencers and who aren't.

If they were to step in any way out of line they'd lose their jobs almost straight away, something that would not have happened as easily earlier. Focusing on the monarchy as some sort of bogeyman is a complete red herring. If you want to change Britain, change the electoral system, change the class structure, change a whole host of things. But frankly the monarchy is a complete red herring to the debate and your argument. You are making a big deal out of nothing, whereas you should be tackling the system of government, overwhich the monarchy has damn all influence any more, and hasn't had in any real sense for well over a century. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">22:04, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>

Democracy does not mean everyone has a vote. It means that those that have a vote get to participate.

<p>Given the nature of the British constitution - that precedent is as important as what can theoretically be done, it seems quite clear that the monarch's powers are quite limited. The last time the monarch fired a ministry without its consent was in 1834. The last time the monarch refused consent to a bill was in 1707. I'm not sure the last time the monarch dissolved parliament without the government's advice, but I imagine it was quite a long time ago as well. The only recent instances of hte monarch having a real say in the choice of a prime minister - in 1923, in 1924, and in 1963 - were anomalies. I think it's pretty clear that Jtd is absolutely right about what would happen if a monarch abused power. The fact that the monarch can only exercise most aspects of the royal prerogative on the advice of ministers is just that - a fact. And it is one which is semi-officially acknowledged, in that there are several powers - appointments to the Garter, for instance - which are specifically reserved to the monarch's personal wishes, and don't have to be done on advice. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 22:50, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"were anomalies" should clue you into the problem. My point, however, it not to take a political position but ask that assumptions not be made and to simply ask that the facts be reported. Surely, we would all be surprised if the Monarch acted this way today and the people did nothing. But it remains the fact that times change rapidly and the future is unknown ... any student of history would know this. I would be happier if the wording is qualified and did not sound so much like Monarchist propaganda. Simply state the facts - do not offer opinion - that is NPOV. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenzenith_aecc.html" title="User:Stevenzenith">Steven Zenith</a> 23:17, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The new intro isn't fine, it is misleading "The powers of the monarchy, known as the Royal Prerogative, are still very extensive. In practice, however, the Sovereign does not personally exercise most of these powers..." It says does not exercise <i>most</i>, implying that the monarch still exercises some power independently. Well, what are they then? The only two powers that the monarch exercises semi-independently are the power to appoint the Prime Minister and the power to dissolve Parliament, and even these are influenced by precedent and convention. The new intro should not suggest that the Queen exercises <i>any</i> power completelely independent of precedent, or the government, or convention, because that is just untrue. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeus_Ex_c1ba.html" title="User:Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a> 11:31, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find it hypocritical and rather ironic that you demand to "revise this article" without any material basis yourself at all. Here are some quotes to start with:</p>
<p>"In Britain the prime minister is still appointed by the sovereign, but the latter's participation in the selection process may now be said to be merely nominal." From Britannica 2003, "prime minster' article.</p>
<p>"The prime minister wields significant powers of patronage and has the exclusive right to appoint hundreds of ministerial and diplomatic posts, as well as the right to bestow certain Anglican church offices and numerous honours and decorations on individuals of his choice. The prime minister ultimately determines government policy, and all measures decided upon at meetings of the Cabinet must be approved by him. Finally, it is the prime minister who advises the sovereign to dissolve Parliament in preparation for a general election, a step necessary if his legislative programs are decisively defeated in the House of Commons. An official residence, 10 Downing Street, is assigned to the prime minister, and he also has the use of Chequers, a country mansionin Buckinghamshire." From Britannica 2003, "prime minster' article. Note that these powers are practice not decided by the monarch anymore.</p>
<p>"She is known to favour simplicity in court life and is also known to take a serious and informed interest in government business, aside from the traditional and ceremonial duties." From Britannica 2003, "Elizabeth II" article. This quote heavily implies that her official duties amount to nothing politically. Note the phrase "<i>informed interest</i> in government business"-interest in the government, rather than actual influence. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeus_Ex_c1ba.html" title="User:Deus Ex">Deus Ex</a> 15:20, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In responce to Mr Zenith: As an American I know that many of us are ignorant of British constitutional practices (after all we continue to think of George III as some sort of despot on the French model when in fact he was a constitutional monarch who claimed far less power than Mr Bush today claims); however I find your case to be particularly acute. Firstly: Though you are obvously skilled and logical in your thinking, your remarks show a distinct lack of knowlege of British constitutional practices and you approach the question from the incorrect context. Secondly: You seem to have little regard for the importance of proper context (a defect in thought that is, sadly, quite common for many of us US Americans.) You try to take what appears to be a semiotic approach to a legal and constitutional matter rather than attempting to understand the nature of the proper context which points to a certain degree of intellectual laziness and obtuseness in thinking. Third: The British use a more traditional definition of constitution, that defines it simply as the organisation and powers of government and governmental institutions. For example by the British definition of the word, the US Senates ability to filibuster would be considered part of the constitution of the US as it is one the Senate's recognised powers. Fourth: One important distinction ought to be made: Much of the British constitution is comprised of precedents that are rigourously adhered to by those who take part in the governance of that country whilst the US constitution comprises mostly of written statute (ie the 1789 Constitution) that is often ignored by those who govern the US. (For example, the written and entrenched bill of rights seems not to have prevented the President from throwing US citizens into navy brigs without any form of due process.) The difference is plain: when the British Executive wants certain powers it will first seek to obtain legislation and if it fails will back off, whereas when the US Executive wants certain powers, it simply takes them without bothering with legal niceties. A constitution is only as good as those it governs, Mr Zenith, and the British constution works because the British can better obey their customs and precedents than we Americans can our entrenched statutes. -Erik Seidel</p>

<p>Didn't William III dissolve parliament, too? The more notable thing about Charles is that he <i>prorogued</i> parliament for long periods and ruled without it, not that he dissolved it. At any rate, until the monarch lost the practical ability to appoint ministers largely as he chose (the late eighteenth century, probably), the distinction between dissolving parliament on advice and not on advice is unimportant. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 23:34, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Ending the Monarchy in England may be more difficult than some in this forum have suggested. The British Monarch holds a absolute veto. In spite of the fact that it has not been used since Queen Anne in the early 1700's does not mean that it can not still be used. All laws MUST receive the Royal Assent, if it does not the law fails or is vetoed. In addition, I must take issue with several parts of the entries directly above. The right to dismiss parliament without the advise of ministers IS important. King Charles II did dissolve parliamnt to prevent them from excluding his Catholic brother from the throne, and no new parliament was called, so it seems common sense that His Majesty must have ruled alone in their absense. King William III did dissolve parliament without ministers consent, how do we know? William also fired/dismissed the Prime Minister (the PM did not quit on his own or he would have resigned). Just because a group of people, or a political party say that a Prerogative/power doesn't exist is ludicrous. If a law has not been passed, and the Royal Assent given to remove a prerogative power from the Monarch, it is still a power that could be used. The powers of the Monarchy cannot be changed without the expressed consent of the Monarch. Even a law to abolish the Royal Assent would need royal assent. Further, it would be an extremely dangerous thing for one chamber of one branch being able to make all decisions without even the remote possibility of a check on them. The House of Lords has allowed itself to be little less than a delay to get whatever the House of Commons wants. The Royal Veto is the British Monarch insurance policy.</p>

But the reality is that there is a distinction and the Queen of Canada and the Queen of the UK are legally separate persons, both sharing the British Crown, i.e. the British monarchy does not rule over Canada - the Canadian monarchy does.</p>

<dd>Actually, there is (apparently) legally no such thing as a "Canadian Crown" - as another editor pointed out in the above listed talk, the term "Canadian Crown" has never appeared in any legal documents, whereas the "British Crown" has. This is due to the fact that the British Crown is shared equally, and is not connected to just one legal institution. That fact alone I would think would justify a separate article to reflect this equality, rather than to show what may be perceived as "preference" for a single institution (which might be construed as saying that the legal person of Queen of the UK is above that of Queen of Canada, and so on). <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 7 July 2005 13:30 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Really, where is this issue dealt with? "The monarch has to physically be somewhere" seems a silly statement, on one level she/he can hardly be physically nowhere.

<p>The fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in Britain. She has spent 2% of her reign in Canada and, I suspect, around that percentage or less in the other Commonwealth Realms.</p>
<p>The fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a) her British subjects and the British political system and b) her subjects and the political systems in the other Commonwealth realms.</p>
<p>The most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the Governor General in the Commonwealth Realms is played by the Queen herself in Britain. i.e. The Queen, with increasingly rare exceptions, does not give royal assent to bills passed in Commonwealth legislatures or even give the Throne Speech (what in Britain is called the Queen's Speech because the Queen herself gives it). She does not name the Prime Ministers in Commonwealth Realms, does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in Commonwealth Realms and does not have weekly meetings with her Commonwealth PMs.</p>
<p>Now monarchists like to believe that the Queen is fully informed and intimately involved in, let's say, Canadian affairs. The reality is that in the Commonwealth Realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity, much more so than in Britain.</p>
<p>Let me give you a hard example. We now know that the Queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in Australia in 1975. This was done by Governor General Kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happened.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. We now know thanks to the 30 year disclosure rule that the Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in Britain complaining of this or that government policy (this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being "above politics"). We also know from biographies and autobiographies that UK Prime Ministers do give some consideration to what the Queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister. It may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture. That is simply not the case for Commonwealth Realm PMs. There is no evidence of royals writing Canadian or Austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of Canadian or Australian PMs being particularly concerned about what the Queen might think, at least not to the extent as is the case in the UK.</p>
<p>Now you might say but the Governor General acts on HMs behalf so there's really no difference. But there is, the Queen's role in the UK is unmediated, in the realms it is mediated by a GG and she is almost a complete absentee from the process.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's quite clear that her role is much more important in the UK than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that the systems in the Commonwealth Realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a GG in place Britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where Commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the Queen's role in the UK.</p>
<p>The fact is if Britain became a republic the Commonwealth Realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the Windsors, or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where, say, she spends one month in each realm.</p>
<p>The fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family's wishes, including the possibility that they would not want to move to Canada or Australia but would prefer to either remain in a British republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in Europe (or even the US). That would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new monarch or even of splitting the monarchy into pieces.</p>
<p>Then there's the question of what happens to the GG and the other political and constitutional impacts of one of the realms suddenly having a resident monarch.</p>
<p>Bosh! you might say. Original research (actually no, because the differences between her role in the UK and elsewhere are well known and the realities of say, her not being consulted about the Australian constitutional crisis are well documented) Speculation! Well the possibility that the UK may become a republic is speculation, but the implications of that on the realms is based on the facts that her constitutional, political and social role in the realms is much more remote than in the UK and, in any case, quite a lot of constitutional theory has to deal with speculation (what happens if this happens in parliament, or if this happens in an election, or if a PM does this or refuses to do that). And the fact is that all these questions arise out of the fact that the Queen is resident in the UK and not resident anywhere else despite the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_fiction.html" title="Legal fiction">legal fiction</a> that she is as much a Canadian or Jamaican as she is a Briton.</p>
<p>"Although equal in legal terms, on a sentimental level the British angle has a kind of "first among equals" status" No, I'm sorry, its more than sentimental. Even putting aside the hypothetical situation of the UK becoming a republic the difference between her constitutional role in the UK and in the other realms is quite clear to anyone with eyes to see and lacking the tunnel vision caused by wishful thinking and sophistry.

<dd>I think that we are unnecessarily conflating the two ideas. There is no blurriness between the British and Canadian monarchies, just as there is no blurriness between the Canadian and Australian monarchies.

<dd>There is no separate dynasty in Canada, and it is a principle of the Canadian constitution that there isn't. What if the opening line were changed to something like this: <i>The British monarch or Sovereign is the head of state of the United Kingdom, and also head of state of each of the other Commonwealth realm, and Head of the Commonwealth.</i> If the Commonwealth realm article is mentioned in the very first line, it may be sufficient to put any further clarification there. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">Peter Grey</a> 19:20, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>It is the Sovereign's prerogative to declare war, make peace, and direct the actions of the military; as usual, the power is used only on ministerial advice.</i></p>
<p>I listened to an interesting discussion on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_4_eb17.html" title="BBC Radio 4">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="../../../t/o/d/Today_Programme_860a.html" title="Today Programme">Today Programme</a>" a number of years ago about the command and control of the launching of Nuclear weapons. A former member of the Royal Navy was explaining that one of the checks on the launch of Trident missiles was that as the minister who would request that a launch be made could not order a captain of a sub to the launch, Hence the expression "HMG on behalf of her majesty request and requires that HMS ...", this is because the commanders of the armed forces report to the crown not to the government, and the launch could not be made by the admiral ,in charge of the fleet of subs, without the explicit "advise" (permission) of the relevant government minister. This was constitutionally correct because the Sovereign "direct[s] the actions of the military". This was seen as a valid mechanism to prevent the ordering of a launch by a minister who had become deranged and wished to take out France or some other enemy^H^H^H^H^HAlly without the members of the armed forces breaking their oaths by refusing to obey orders. If someone could find a written record of this idea I think it would make an interesting addition to the article. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></p>

<p>Can the assertion that a "large majority" of people in Britain support the existence of monarchy be reasonably substantiated? This sounds like POV to me. Valiant Son 22:01, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to all MORI polls since the early 1950s when they began polling on the issue republicanism has ebbed between at 7-23%. (The most recent poll, if I remember correctly, put republicanism at 13%.) Support for the monarchy runs from 77-93%. A majority of all classes, creeds, ethnic groups and ages back the monarchy. Even the <i>weakest</i> supporters of the monarchy (ie, they aren't monarchists but don't see any point in abolishing it if it works well and see republicanism as pointless) outweigh the <i>entire</i> support for republicanism by a mile. And the weakest supporters are outweighed by the committed supporters by a considerable degree. That certainly qualifies as a "large majority" by any standards. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 23:29, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<dd>Of course the problem with this is that, as with all opinion polls, it depends upon how the question was asked and what the wording was. On many occasions studies of responses based on the format of a question have shown widely varying responses.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The second problem is that of sample. Who has been asked?</p>
<p>The thrid issue comes from the question of whether the phraseology in the article is pejorative or not. It implies that almost nobody supports the establishment of a republic. This is simply not the case. The most recent figures from MORI actually put the level at 19%. This is a substantial level. I'd be happy if the wording was changed to, "a majority", but the use of the word "large" is far too subjective. Valiant Son 23:39, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>MORI is a very professional organisation. Given that it works for all sides in all debates it cannot allow itself to issue one-sided questions to deliver a result. (In fact it, TNS/MRBI and other highly regarded polling organisations regularly refuse point blank to ask one sided questions. They are ultra-careful to ask clinically neutral to the extent of running mock polls to test out the objectivity of the questions.) Those paying for polls don't want propaganda but facts. The polls were based on qualitative and quantative research involving the required statistical numbers to produce accurate results. MORI is famous for always using a fully representative national sample and they have polled for both British republicans and the Royal Family on public attitudes to monarchy. All aides absolutely trust their reliability. The fact that the results in different polls by them all match show that there were no rogue poll results and that all were fair and accurate to within 3%. And no, BTW a 70% majority is not merely "a majority". Calling it large is an understatement. In polling and electoral terms such numbers are usually called a "landslide" or indeed "a consensus". <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 23:48, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>

<dd>Anyone who understands anything about language will acknowledge that there is no such thing as a "neutral" question. This is simply nonsense.

<dd>Your statement about a large majority is POV. You may consider it a "large majority". I (and others) would consider it to indicate a "large minority" of dissenting voices. I don't doubt that there is a tacit support for the monarchy within the UK (although it should be remembered that many of the respondents will be anxious about the unknown factors of change and many have no particualr interest either way and so opt for the status quo), but what I take exception to is the pejorative use of the word "large". It is semantically superfluous. The sentence reads perfectly well by stating that there is a majority of support. Valiant Son 11:05, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was recently thinking about the Queen's reserve power to withhold the royal assent to Acts of Parliament. I was wondering if any constitutional experts agree with my (somewhat disconcerting) possibility. Since most of the time the Government initiates and wins all bills in Parliament, they have every wish for the Queen to grant assent. But what if they lose a vote? Recently, the Blair Government dramatically lost the vote on their anti-terror legislation in the Commons. If this were to pass unamended by the Lords, it would need Royal Assent. However, since Blair disapproves of the legislation, he may see fit to exercise the Royal prerogative to change it. Since the Queen uses all prerogatives on the advice of the Prime Minister, would she be bound to follow Blair's advice if he advised her to withhold the Royal Assent? And if she refused, would this be considered improper defiance of the Cabinet's will? I was wondering if anyone considered this. It seems it would indicate the extraordinary powers the Crown possesses, and through it, the Prime Minister.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Government losses a key vote, then they will hold a "Vote of No Confidence" ie asking Parliament to vote on whether the Government should continue. If they loss that, the government would usually resign, and a general election would be called. However, they usually win these, as the MPs who voted against them on the key vote, are unlikely to vote against the existence of their own government. After a win, there is usually a revote and the government would likely win this, or some compromise effort is taken. This happened in the previous Conservative government when they were voting to approve the Maastricht Treaty. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 11:09, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, in summary, laws that had their last update in the 18th century give immense power to one person who must belong to a certain bloodline who must give up their place if there's a male candindate before her. Right. Can someone explain to me whether the people that accept that consider it a tourism attraction or a proper way of governance? Because, I don't want to believe it's the second. However, I tend to think the main reason this thing exists is because UK didn't have any major internal political crisis for a very very very long time so they didn't have a chance to see a change because it may have been more trouble than keeping things the way they work, "if it works and there's no much trouble, don't fix it" kind of thing. I also keep hearing brits humoring "we have an agreement, the queen doesn't make trouble and the people don't behead her". I wonder what's really going on in the background in those "monarchy acceptance" votes.</p>

<p>The introductory paragraph explains that the British Monarchy can trace its roots back to the Kings of the Angles, etc. This seems odd. Scotland is only mentioned via the Union of the Crowns.

<dd>The Scots king was given the English throne because he was descended from the kings of England. The English later tired of the Stuarts and deposed them in favour of the Hanoverians. When the Scottish parliament refused to agree to this, its members were bribed and bullied into voting for their own abolition. On 1 May 1707 a small group of appointed Scottish MPs arrived at the English parliament and took their seats.

<p>Then Wikipedia is misleading those who read its articles. Either Wikipedia takes the word of law, and the word of treaties coming into and changing law, or it changes all existing articles to reflect "Annexation".</p>
<p>This seems a clear indication of double standards -- Efforts are made to seperate "England" and the UK in wording, or when "English" is used instead of "Britsh", but apparently the truth wich has eluded me is that Scotland was simply annexed. Why then is this line of thought only allowed on the British Monarchy page?</p>
<p>We seem to have entered into a "Whatever the law said I know better ..."</p>
<p>Wikipedia is based on fact. The fact is the Treaty of Union -said- such, and that is law. The term "Whatever the Act of Union says, it was not ..." is abhorrent to that notion.</p>

<dd>You are confusing "law" with "fact" and there are numerous historical sources that discuss the true nature of the union with Scotland. If "law" was the only criterion allowed, then we would be forced to state that the USSR, for example, was a democracy, because that's what its constitution said. Under English law, the kings of England were also kings of France, because that was part of their title. And Idi Amin was king of Scotland, because he declared himself such. Please go and look up the difference between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i>. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 18:50, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The fact is that Adrian IV was an Englishman, and sided (in a case of COI) with the See of Canterbury in an internal ecclesiastical dispute with the See of Armagh. This section should be re-written. By the way, following the excommunication of King Henry VIII, another Pope "granted" Ireland to the King of Spain.

<p>Surely the idea of an encyclopedia is to reveal and not to cloud an issue? By redirecting <i><b>British Crown</b></i> to <i>British monarchy</i> confusion has been created. Several related articles on this same Wikipedia matter are obfuscating material. Perhaps the clearest that I have come across is the explanation of a British subject versus a British citizen. I think that article is clear and to the point. This one is anything but clear and to the point.</p>
<p>An issue arises because <i>the British Crown</i> is <b>NOT</b> the same as the <i>British Monarch!</i></p>
<p>The Crown is a corporation sole - an artificial person like a company that holds property and has rights. In the UK it also has subsidiary delegates such as the Cabinet and Judiciary.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Monarch is the representative of the Crown - in other words just as the president of a company is not the company, so the Queen is not the Crown. True she wears a crown on her head - but that can be compared to a trademark or a logo of a company represented by its president.</p>
<p>The Privy Council advises the Monarch but the Privy Council is not the Crown yet it acts within the corporation sole that is the Crown. However, there are missing links and explanations concerning the working of the Privy Council in context with related articles (there are several related articles that require a second look.)</p>
<p>These topics need to be revisited because they are as clear as mud in many instances and links will take a reader from subject to subject and back to where they started without ever learning the answer to the question that they began with.</p>
<p>A good starting point leading to an undoing of this confusion will be in unhitching the link that sends a researcher looking for the British Crown to an article about the Monarch when other articles plainly state that the Monarch is not the Crown!</p>
<p>I will defer this task to someone who has a lot more background knowledge than myself but I suggest that the person who undertakes this task is NOT a government employee who is used to writing gibberish - a great combination would be someone has studied this matter but who has the gift of cutting to the chase and can write in a clear and concise manner. 70.128.87.235 16:57, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_monarchy_b387.html" title="Edit section: What's that word: &quot;amnazing&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What's that word: "amnazing"</span></h2>
<p>In the "History", in the "English Monarchy" sub-section, the last paragraph talks of Elizabeth I. The sentance begins "The Elizabethan era is notable for its amnazing propaganda ...".</p>
<p>This is a rather obscure word, "amnazing". Perhaps the intended word was "amazing", but that raises other questions, especially in the context of the later remark of "... in the eyes of those who fell for it". Here the author seems to be expressing contempt.</p>
<p>Those of us to the west of the pond, myself in particular, think of amazing as 'overwhelming with surprise", "sudden wonder", "to be greatly astonished", or even "bewildered" or "perplexed". If that be the case, I would invite to author to illiminate the issue.</p>
<p>Amazment would seem to be a secondary reaction, and the author has glossed over the primary reaction, whatever it may have been. And then there is the issue of who was amazed; Her subjects at that time, people other than her subjects, or a few historians now?</p>
<p>I like the article, I liked the section, and I liked the paragraph. I'm not sure that "amnazing" is the right word. Thank you.</p>
