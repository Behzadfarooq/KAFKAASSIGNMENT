<p>as this indicates that it is to be used for an article about a <b>specific</b> bridge, rather than a <b>type</b> of bridge.

<p>If a bridge is notable for some reason, the article should say what makes it special. I'm removing the bridges from the list that have no notations. I think most of these bridges are notable. Feel free to return any to the article with an explanation of what makes them notable -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 23:00, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I think we need some discussion as to what makes a bridge notable. In my opinion, the word "notable" would in this context refer to a bridge that is either the longest/strongest/highest of its kind or internationally known (as in the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_Bridge_e830.html" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>). I have removed the latest additions since they don't appear to me to be significant to a global audience. While interesting, I think they should be kept to discussions of bridges in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, or possibly in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> as a whole.</p>
<p>To address the greater issue, I have doubts about the wisdom of having such a list. It can be extremely subjective, despite the best of intentions from those adding to it. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue">IntrigueBlue</a> 08:26, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I think it's pretty safe to say that redlinked bridges should not be considered especially notable. I've removed the following, although if somebody wants to start articles for them they're more than welcome. I've heard mention of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge on Wikipedia from time to time, so I guess it in particular would make a good article candidate. I'm going to add a request for it on <a href="../../../b/r/i/WP%7EBRIDGE_65a1.html" title="WP:BRIDGE">WikiProject Bridges</a>, but in the meantime it shouldn't be on there. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue">IntrigueBlue</a> 20:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a guideline in filling out the new templates <i>BridgeTypePix</i> and <i>BridgeType</i> I have drawn up a taxonomy for discussion. See <a href="../../../upload/5/53/BridgeTaxonomy.png" class="internal" title="BridgeTaxonomy.png">Media:BridgeTaxonomy.png</a>. The taxonomy needs to be checked against the Bridge article index of types for completeness. Each article with taxobox needs to be checked against the diagram and brought into conformity.

<dl>
<dd>The chart is a great idea, but I have some questions.</dd>
<dd>1.) Isn't the <b>cable-stayed</b> more derivative of the <b>suspension</b> than the <b>box girder</b>?
<dl>
<dd>Arguably so, but when the stresses an erection methods are considered I think it is more akin to the box girder - it is built as a sequence of cantilever box extensions which are then each in turn supported by a set of cables that impose longitudinal compression on all completed segments, while in the suspension bridge the entire tension cable is first built, suspender cables added, and the deck may be assembled from thin plate or light truss (without significant compression) from either end or middle outward. A much more expert opinion is needed here than I can provide.
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't agree, and I speak as someone who has designed a cable-stayed bridge. Not all cable-stayed bridges are built using the cantilever erection method - some are built directly on formwork. I think most practicing engineers would relate the cable-stay far more closely to the suspension bridge than to a box girder bridge. Also, many cable-stays use I-girders rather than box-girders, I think this confusion of form with construction method confuses rather than clarifies.<a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 23:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2.) Wouldn't the <b>box girder</b> be derivative of the <b>plate girder</b> and the <b>tubular</b> derivative of the <b>box girder</b>?
<dl>
<dd>The ordering would be an historical one and it appeared from reading the articles that the <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tubular_bridge.html" title="Tubular bridge">tubular bridge</a> preceded the <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_girder_bridge.html" title="Box girder bridge">box girder bridge</a>. This needs additional research to confirm.
<dl>
<dd>I would agree that this was the case, see for example John Rapley's book on the development of the Conwy and Britannia Bridge designs.<a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 23:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3.) Isn't the <b>inca rope</b> basically just a <b>simple suspension</b>?
<dl>
<dd>True, I set it up this way since there is currently a separate article for <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inca_rope_bridges.html" title="Inca rope bridges">Inca rope bridges</a>. I wrote the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_suspension_bridge.html" title="Simple suspension bridge">simple suspension bridge</a> article before discovering the IRB. These need to be combined and the IRB would be in the development history of the type. (Note 8 Oct 2006: the IRB is now listed as a bridge-related article, rather than a bridge type, with appropriate changes in the two articles - Leonard)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>4.) Isn't the <b>moon</b> just an <b>arch</b>?
<dl>
<dd>I have separated <i>compression arch bridge</i> (title simply <i>arch bridge</i>, which I think is confusing) from <i>truss arch</i>. A moon bridge is a bridge <i>style</i>, not a <i>structure</i> and can be composed of either types of arch. For comparisons of structures that have the appearance of an arch (see the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_bridge.html" title="Moon bridge">moon bridge</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arch_bridge.html" title="Arch bridge">arch bridge</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truss_arch_bridge.html" title="Truss arch bridge">truss arch bridge</a> articles. As shown, the arch can have three primary force distributions, true compression arch, <b>A</b> frame, and inverted <b>U</b>, with the latter two implementable as either bent beams or as trusses.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>5.) Isn't the <b>clapper</b> a slightly more complicated <b>step stone</b>, and therefore <b>compression</b>?
<dl>
<dd>The clapper has <i>spans</i>, which in this case are stone slabs that operate in bending and shear (as would logs or beams). I also consider it to be a direct ancestor of the true compression arch bridge ("Roman arch"), which can be built from masonry without mortar if properly designed and constructed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>6.)Where does <b>shearing</b> happen on a bridge exactly?
<dl>
<dd>Shear is an engineering term for a kind of force distribution. Grab a cylinder with each hand, the hands touching. Without applying a bending force, pull one hand and push the other. The stress at the junction of the two hands is <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shear.html" title="Shear">shear</a> - from that article:
<dl>
<dd><i>In physics and mechanics, shear refers to deformation in which parallel surfaces slide past one another (as opposed to compression and tension, in which parallel surfaces move towards or away from one another).</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Shear and bending stresses appear on the bottom chord of a <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truss_bridge.html" title="Truss bridge">truss bridge</a> in response to dynamic loads. The shear stress is zero at the center of a uniformly loaded beam and is greatest where the beam is supported.
<dl>
<dd>I'm startled to see that there is no Wikipedia article for <i>shear force</i>, this is clearly something to have a go at if time permits. Shearing occurs everywhere on a bridge where there is bending (i.e. the only places it doesn't occur are in members subject to pure tension (e.g. cable) or compression (e.g. pin-ended struts).<a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 23:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>This is a good set of questions you have posed and I hope I have responded in an informative way.

<dd>I was just coming here to ask about the Inca rope bridges myself. I would suggest that the most logical organization is to link only the simple suspension page from the index, then include mention of the Inca bridges as examples of early bridges of the type with a link on that page. There is no need to get into a particular culture's architecture in a section devoted to general elements and types of bridges. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue">IntrigueBlue</a> 19:28, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I would omit tilting (how many are there) and transporter (if it's a type, it isn't limited to trusses). I'm not sure what "side-spar" means under cable-stayed. And lattice girders are technologically midway between beams and trusses - they are as much a girder with lots of little holes cut in the web as they are a truss with lots of extra diagonals added. I believe this is also borne out historically in their development, although I don't have a reference to hand.<a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 00:02, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rather than just an article, the bridge article (a directory) and its referenced articles of bridge type and related articles (not specific bridges) seems like it will soon be suitable for featured article status.

<dd>I think this article could use a few more things. It should have:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>a more detailed history of bridges which includes:
<ul>
<li>The technological developements that led to developing the different types of bridges and the mention the bridge(s) that first employed the technology.</li>
<li>The political organization required to build bridges and the economic costs and benefits.</li>
<li>The effects on society from building bridges, positive and negative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a section that describes the parts of a bridge, what is common to all, what varies.</li>
<li>a section that compares the different types of bridges and the reasons one might be used instead of another, the materials used, comparison of construction technique, falsework, etc...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I've also wondered about turning the links with pictures into a table, which also might have some other info like: longest span, oldest example, relative cost, etc...</dd>
<dd>As for the other bridge articles, I think we should work on bringing one of them to feature article level, and use it as a model for all the others.

<dd>Perhaps the taxonomy would be suitable for inclusion in the main article - I could do a graphic with hot spot links. Re: suspension bridge, the section on construction needs images, perhaps I could track down an official source for historic images source for the GG bridge or the western SF-OAK BB.

<dd>I suppose there is a matter of interpretation here. A tunnel can be hollowed out and "accidentally" end up arch-shaped. That is, it is made highest in the center for the heads of the people walking down the tunnel, and flat on the bottom, and their shoulders must fit through, but beyond this a general rounded shape would be the easiest to carve out. Whether they realized that this arch shape could support more weight is debatable. If they did, why wouldn't they have used the same structure above ground&#160;? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 15:33, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My understanding is a causeway is generally NOT considered a bridge. Indeed, the only reference to bridge in the causeway article is some stuff in the US and the only reference to causeway in this article is about one of those causeways mentioned in the causeway article. If I am correct, them IMHO this clarification needs to be made in both articles. We also need to remove conflicting info. For example, we need to ascertain if the Lake whatever causeway is a causeway or a bridge. It looks to me like a causeway. If so and I'm correct about causeway =/ bridge, by definition it CANNOT be the longest bridge and should be removed from here (well unless you think Mount Everest is the highest building in the world). If I'm correct about causeway =/ bridge but the Lake whatever causeway is in fact a bridge it should be removed from the causeway article. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 04:28, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I have a science fair project to do and I decided to see which bridge was the strongest. I made three bridges according to a design I found on a website. I've been trying for days to find the website again but I've lost hope. I made a suspension bridge, or what I thought was a suspension bridge but I'm probably wrong.</p>
<p>Is this even a type of bridge? The photograph was taken by me. If it's a bridge which one is it? Can you give me a brief explanation as to why you think it's that bridge? Thank you for any help given.</p>

<dd>I agree that it is a truss arch. The top truss is a "Pratt style" truss <a href="http://www.matsuo-bridge.co.jp/english/bridges/basics/truss.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.matsuo-bridge.co.jp/english/bridges/basics/truss.shtm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> where the diagonals are in tension and the vertical members are in compression. Is there a reason that it is elevated so high? It looks like a good effort, let us know how much weight it holds. Here is some more info
<ul>
<li>"The Pratt truss was originally patented by Thomas and Caleb Pratt in 1844. In its earliest form, the Pratt truss was a combination wood and iron truss. The top chord and verticals acted in compression and were made of wood, while the bottom chord and inclined members acted in tension and were made of iron. This combination Pratt truss was built through the 19th century and was cited as a continued form by bridge engineers as late as 1908. The Pratt truss survived the transition to metal construction and was widely built as an all-metal truss well into the 20th century. In 1916, bridge engineer and historian J.A.L. Waddell claimed that the Pratt truss was the most commonly used truss type for spans under 250 feet.

<p>There has been a some controversy with this movie that will probably merit it's own article.

<p>This section seems to be growing constantly, and in my opinion the basic structural types should be separated from discussion of balsa wood competitions and experimental designs. Perhaps it should be divided into <b>Modern bridge designs</b>, <b>Simple and ancient bridge designs</b>, <b>Experimental designs</b> and <b>Bridge-related concepts</b>? --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue">IntrigueBlue</a> 06:24, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not sure your change was needed, an alphabetical list is much easier to navigate without having to know the category. I reverted the changes. Perhaps a little more consensus on this is in order. I am under the impression the same grouping could be done through the use of categories on the individual bridge articles.<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_E_Ester_6052.html" title="User:Paul E Ester">Paul E. Ester</a> 16:34, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I completely disagree. There is no reason why the main part of the list should be cluttered with topics such as the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balsa_wood_bridge.html" title="Balsa wood bridge">balsa wood bridge</a>, yet they are bridge related and as such do belong somewhere. The same goes for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transporter_bridge.html" title="Transporter bridge">transporter bridges</a>, which today exist mostly as a curiosity. Navigating an alphabetical list is useless, because it tells the reader nothing about the topic, and if they know what they're looking for they can simply search for it. I will not revert back for the time being but would appreciate further discussion, for or against, on this topic.

<dd>I agree that <b>balsa wood bridge</b> sould be removed from the article (and would argue against Steel bridges, Concrete bridges, etc.) on the basis that it only covers the material used. I think that transporter bridge should remain, as it is a unique type of bridge. To me a <b>Log bridge</b> is a type of beam bridge and should not appear here. There is no artlce for Caisson bridge, so <b>Cassion</b> should be located elsewhere. A <b>simple suspension bridge</b> is a type of suspension bridge. <b>Water bridge</b> is questionable.

<p><b>Hybrids do exist!</b> This London Millenium Footbridge bridge is effectively a hybrid between a suspension bridge, and a pure <b>tension ribbon bridge.</b> The latter is a distinct type that sholud be included within the fundamental list of about 5 or 6 <i>genotypes by structural action</i>. There are not too many of them (tension ribbons, that is), but bridge architecture publications do recognise them. Here are two nice examples of pure tension ribbons:</p>
<p>Main-Danube Channel Footbridge, Essing, Germany; Richard Dietrich/Heinz Bruninghoff, 1986</p>
<p>Punt da Suransuns, Viamala, Switzerland; Conzett, Bronzini, Gartmann AG, 1997.</p>
<p>The Main-Danube one has a nice illustration somewhere in Wiki, possibly on the German language version, I can't remember quite.</p>

<dd>There's already an article for the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stressed_ribbon_bridge.html" title="Stressed ribbon bridge">stressed ribbon bridge</a> type, and it's already linked from the bridge page. The <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Bridge_%28London%29_fb28.html" title="Millennium Bridge (London)">Millennium Bridge (London)</a>, however, is not this type of bridge, it's a pure suspension bridge, as the deck units only hang upon the cables and are not stressed longitudinally (I have a little bit of specialist knowledge here since I carried out some of the check calculations on this bridge!) I'd suggest you may want to take a look at the stressed ribbon bridge article - it could certainly do with expanding, both to cover other bridges of the type and perhaps to say a little about the theory behind them. As for whether the stressed ribbon is a different fundamental type, I'm not sure I'd agree - most of them are essentially similar to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_suspension_bridge.html" title="Simple suspension bridge">simple suspension bridges</a>, as is already noted at that article. -- <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 23:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text from book referenced above is simply wrong, if quoted correctly (nonsense is not limited to the internet or Wikipedia). Cantilever bridges may be constructed as beams, but are often seen as a form of truss. When constructed as a truss (as in a beam), the distribution of primary (non-shear) forces is opposite to that of an end-supported truss (or beam), with the cantilever's top chord in tension and the lower in compression. A cantilever bridge (usually a <i>balanced cantilever</i>) refers to the distribution of forces both within the structure and the way the forces are transmitted to the pylons (especially during construction as when finally supported there will be a mixture of forces present under live loads). Beam bridges are <i>typically</i> not cantilevers. <i>Cantilever(ness)</i> can also be a transient property. Often an arch bridge will be bult as a pair of <i>unbalanced cantilevers</i> (imposing an upward force upon a massive pylon or upon tensile ground anchors at the launching ends) until final completion, whence the free ends are jacked apart and connected to become one of the several forms of truss arch - thrust, beam (refering to gross force distribution to the footings), or A-frame.</p>
<p>In my (strong) opinion these should absolutely remain separate articles. (Would you consider the Firth of Forth bridge to be properly included in a surving Beam Bridge article or a simple box span (as is seen in many <i>end supported</i> freeway overpasses) to be included in a surviving Cantilever Bridge article? These two bridge topics are like apples and oranges, and like cantilever spans made as (or of) beams they are sometimes seen together in a fruit salad. - <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 23:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm afraid I agree with very little of the above and I speak as a bridge engineer of 16 years experience. You are confusing the appearance of the bridge with its engineering functionality. A cantilever bridge is indeed just a type of beam bridge. Structurally, the Forth rail bridge is no different from countless highway bridges which incorporate the half-joint principle i.e. girders cantilevering from the supports with a simply-supported span in the middle. There are also log-type cantilever bridges in southern Asia where no truss or girder at all is involved. Being a truss has nothing to do with it - in both a cantilever girder bridge and a cantilever truss bridge the top flange or chord over the supports is in tension, and shear forces are carried either in the truss diagonals or the girder web - their purpose is the same even though the details differ.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many multi-span truss bridges have no continuous upper chord - for example, the five end-footed trusses on the easter span of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_e5fc.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">SFOBB</a>, between the cantilever section and the truss causeway. Not even the upper deck segments between spans take any tensile stress, as witnessed by the collapse in the loma prieta quake due to excessive differential motion between the supporting locations. - <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 18:06, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, but those five spans are not cantilever spans. If anything they expand the point - those spans are each functionally equivalent to a simply-supported beam bridge; just as the cantilever spans are functionally equivalent to a continuous beam bridge. Equivalents would be a simply-supported prestressed beam bridge, and a continous concrete box girder bridge built using the balanced-cantilever method. I think the problem here isn't going to be resolved by piecemeal editing, it needs a more thorough think through the whole bridge article taxonomy. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 14:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would personally be very happy to see the Forth rail bridge in a surviving beam bridge article. Structurally, all that defines a 'beam' is that is a member which primarily resists bending. This is as true of the Forth bridge as it is of any simply-supported short span highway bridge.<a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 23:56, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

(This does not look good to me, but I just read and edit articles and have not <i>analytically designed</i> bridges, although I have designed and constructed inconsequential bridging truss structures for long fence spans). Sounds like all bridges except suspension and arch types are just some kind of <a href="../../../l/o/g/Log_bridge.html" title="Log bridge">log bridge</a>, with variations in materials and some minor details. Note that many of the various bridge type articles were taken from text originally in the Bridge article, but split off for reasons of article length and <i>improved focus of the resultant article</i> upon the types documented. -<a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 18:06, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think all the articles can remain in their own right but should relate to each other differently. <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beam_bridge.html" title="Beam bridge">Beam bridge</a> is a major topic heading, which should lead logically to separate articles both on truss bridges and girder bridges (both are beams, but one has holes in the web); it should also lead logically to separate articles or sections on simply-supported spans, cantilever spans, and continuous spans (any of which can be either a girder or a truss in their own right); and also logically to articles on different material types, which is where <a href="../../../l/o/g/Log_bridge.html" title="Log bridge">log bridge</a> would fit in. So I'm thinking more of a change in the way the articles reference each other rather than anything else.

<dd>I don't agree. If you look at early lattice girder railway bridges, certainly in the UK, they are in pretty much every respect similar to flat-plate girder bridges of the same era. Indeed, a lattice with members at 45 degrees to the horizontal is exactly what you'd come up with from an understanding of stress vectors (a vertical shear force, which the web is there to carry, is mathematically identical to a combination of compression and tension forces each at 45 degrees to the vertical). The Vierendeel isn't a logical development because the verticals carry bending - there is no significant in-plane bending in a girder web, only the vector sum of tension and compression components. Which came first I don't know - I guess either would have been of wrought iron and presume it would depend when the technology to create large iron plates was developed. According to Troyano's "Bridge Engineering - A Global Perspective" (which I'd heartily recommend as the best encyclopaedia on bridge engineering that there is), "plate gave rise to box girder bridges which commenced with the Conway and Britannia; sections gave rise to lattice girder bridges or trussed structures". In his chapter on beam bridges (which includes trusses - they don't get a separate section) he again implies that web girders came before truss/lattice girders, with things only swinging back again after WW2 when welding technology and a better theoretical understanding of plate buckling came into play. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 22:00, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So it sounds like you have some ideas concerning the taxonomy. If you desire and have the capability I can provide a Macintosh Appleworks 6 file, PNG, PDF or other file produced by this application. It is slightly out of date as it does not include the Burr Arch or Brunell Arch types. Note that the current taxonomy is largly by historical evolution on the vertical axis, with a rough attempt to show how various types have converged and diverged to form new types. Such a taxonomy could form the basis for your reorganization proposal. - <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 19:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I think the taxonomy isn't ideal but sorry I don't really have time to go over it at present! I would be keen to have a go if time ever permits, but I think there's a difficulty that historical development was never straightforward - I believe lattice girders developed from web girders, as stated above, but truss structures were built long before web girders were, and the theory of trusses does have many differences to the theory of beams, despite the basic similarity. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 22:00, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking again at the image, the poster suggests that the truss members are only there to hold up the parapet, not the deck. I find this highly unlikely, looking at the spans and relative member sizes. Even if correct, it's at best misleading and a more typical highway beam bridge would be a better illustration. I'll have a look. <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 22:00, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi I'm just beginning to get the hang of Wiki etiquette, syntax etc. A few weeks ago, more or less as a way of getting started, I jumped in on this article with "a cantilver is not a truss" and was quickly reverted (but politely greeted, thanks). I understand better now that feelings can run high on such apparently minor points. But sorry those folks who are agin this proposed change - there is absolutly no way that a cantilever brigdge can be said to have a truss bridge as an antecedent. For one thing, structurally speaking, a true truss can hardly be said to have existed in bridging before Palladio. Some Roman bridges (examples on Trajan's column) may have included triangulation, but these did not generally contain a truss as modern students are taught (in my book, must be triangulated; must have at least one internal element (normally a pair) in tension). Yes, the Forth Rail Bridge for example, utilises "trusses" or triangulation within the framing, and probably could not have been built at all without doing this, but that still doesn't make the truss the taxonomic fore-runner of the cantilever. Cantilevers utiising timber baulks encastre into stonework abutments are an anciernt Asian/Himalayan concept. Want a few photos of them?</p>
<p>Furthermore, whilst having a moan in this direction, I hate that current taxonomy figure on this page because A) Principal is mis-spelt and that really grates with me; B) As you can tell from this rant, I don't agree with some of its concepts. The spelling error cannot be corrected BTW, because the text is on the graphic. I request some changes please. I will gradually start to try to help build bridges across the pond - especially Timber (that is "Wood") ones!</p>

<dd>Response - Again! I have previously offered the source for this taxonomic graphic, but was declined because the complainent said he was too busy to become involved (despite having the time to compose an overly long essay on the defects in the graphic). I can repost as PDF, which could be edited with an appropriate application, and if <b>anyone</b> wants the Appleworks (Macintosh only, requires the application Appleworks) source they can obtain that from me via e-mail. - <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 04:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At this point, fully half of this article is devoted to listing specific bridges and bridge-related events, rather than defining the concept itself - and that's not including the quarter that the index to types of bridges occupies. I think the index is usedful and should stay, but the lists are both subjective and vary from region to region. As I have mentioned before, I disagree with a lot of additions, and spend a fair amount of time reverting them. I think we should be done with it altogether and give each section its own article, to which people can add their own pet bridges to their heart's content.</p>
<p>Particularly non-notable is the recent addition of a bridge collapse in Chile that injured 8 people and killed no one. I'm not one to say that it's not news without death, but I would hardly call that catastrophic. The collapse of a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/061001/n100106.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/061001/n100106.html" rel="nofollow">Montreal overpass</a> was more catastrophic than that. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue"><small>INTRIGUE</small>B<small>LUE</small></a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrigueBlue_96ec.html" title="User talk:IntrigueBlue">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IntrigueBlue_4dae.html" title="Special:Contributions/IntrigueBlue">contribs</a>)</small> 18:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree on all counts.

<p>There is clear consensus about splitting the one section and moving the other. Kvetner has suggested other titles for the notable bridges article, but it's easy enough to remain, so I'm going to go ahead and split the list off into what was originally suggested, "list of notable bridges".--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 05:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding the image on the right (Alkaff Bridge) it would seem to be a very unusual <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-anchored_suspension_bridge.html" title="Self-anchored suspension bridge">self-anchored suspension bridge</a>. The deck near midspan sits on crossbeams which in turn rest on the downward curved members - these members are the suspension cables in essence. In a normal self-anchored suspension bridge, the cables pass over towers and then back down to deck level, with the tension force in the cables balanced by a compression force in the deck. Here, the compression force is instead carried by the upper of the tubular members. The verticals seem to serve several functions - they make the main members act as a Vierendeel truss, which will improve overall stiffness and robustness; they brace the tension members by helping to hold them in their inclined plane (along with crossbeams); and they help to prevent the upper compression member from buckling. Any other opinions? -- <a href="../../../k/v/e/User%7EKvetner_6a6d.html" title="User:Kvetner">Kvetner</a> 21:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>[edit] Bridge Hello! You are obviously keen to feature the bridge at Vorobyovy Gory on the bridge article, however I don't think that 'double-decker' is a type of bridge that many people will recognise - there are many double-deck (and some triple-deck) bridges around the world, and they all fit within other recognised types (viaduct, arch etc). The gallery also isn't the place for specific bridges - only for links to general types or bridge related topics. Can I suggest that before adding it again you perhaps discuss your rationale on the Talk:Bridge page? -- Kvetner 23:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
