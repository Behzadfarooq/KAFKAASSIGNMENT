<p>There are many stereotypes being perpetuated in this article - while the issue of bride burning is more or less unique to India, it is not as if it happens all the time there. Statistically speaking, it doesn't happen any more often than a mother murders her children in the United States. I am adding a comment regarding the reaction of the average Indian citizen to this practice in order to counteract what this article suggested. This is not a neutral article. 09 May 05 67.101.113.10</p>
<p>I agree. It is domestic violence and murder and is unrelated to Hinduism, except that it is usually triggered by dowry demands. Burning as a tool for violence and murder is unique to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh among Hindus, Muslims, and Christians probably because it is the easiest way of killing and hardest to prove seeing that it could be disguised as a kitchen accident. It is also the most common means of suicide among women in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Bride burning is a <b>recent</b> phenomenon (the past century or the past few decades) also and should be related more to the rise of western style consumerism than any religion. Also, this is in the category of 'Culture of India'. Will remove that.</p>
<p>The original content of this article was lifted from an article in CNN. It is not surprising though, seeing that western media has been consistently insensitive to/uncomprehending of the culture of India and Hinduism.</p>
<p><b>Stats</b> - In 2000, 1,247 women were killed by an intimate partner in the US. Estimates range from 960,000 incidents of violence against a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend per year to three million women who are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend per year in the US.2 <a href="http://endabuse.org/resources/facts/" class="external autonumber" title="http://endabuse.org/resources/facts/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> US has little more than a quarter of the population of India, where police receive 2,500 reports of bride burning every year.</p>
<p>Will rewrite article. --<a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPranathi_f5a9.html" title="User:Pranathi">Pranathi</a> 15:11, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see how the link at the bottom is relevant. The article makes no claims about the relative violence level between India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and America. <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:54, August 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Rewritten to remove all the copyvio content, most of which was lifted from an old CNN article. I've also tried to remove any judgements related to hinduism or its practice as a religion or belief. It would be nice if we could get some additional factual and statistical information on the subject. The references I was able to find are mostly news articles that cite widely varying "facts", and often come across as overly harsh or judgemental towards the underlying culture. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarcrist_2924.html" title="User:Darcrist">Darcrist</a> 04:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This culture allows people to hold their wives hostage for their dowry, burn them to death, and then remarry more young women from the same family so they can do it all over again. These people consider marriage a form of hostage-taking and have not the slightest shred of common morality, and yet this is somehow related to the rise of western culture? Because America causes all the world's problems? Fuck you. I hope you racist sons of bitches go to hell.</p>
<p>And BTW, also fuck Wikipedia for crying about neutrality when you're writing about husbands setting their wives on fire. Twisted sacks of subhuman shit. Jboyler 01:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>National Crime Bureau has not published any data mentioning the exact number of Bride Burning in India. So far as 7026 deaths classified as "reported" dowry deaths by National Crime Bureau, a large number of them are suicides. How? Because, According to another source in National Crime Bureau<a href="http://ncrb.nic.in/" class="external autonumber" title="http://ncrb.nic.in/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the number of suicides by Indian women are about 43000 every year compared to 65000 by men. The number of murders of Indian women per year are 7952 compared to 27467 murders of men in year 2005. So, the overall fatalities of women by suicide and murder are 43,000 and 7952 respectively (with a ratio of about 8:1). When we apply the same ratio to "reported" (not convicted) dowry deaths of 7026, then about 6300 of them should be suicides and about 800 have to be murders. So, the maximum possible figure for Bride Burning (if any) in India is 800 deaths per year as Bride Buring is a kind of murder. How?? It is claimed in the beginning of the article that the husband or his relatives douse the woman with Kerosene and set her on fire. As murder can happen by various other means like murder by stabbing, hitting with objects or poisoning, it is highly unlikely that the actual bride burnings in India are even 100 as "Bride Burning" as defined in the beginning of article is too difficult for anyone to implement. When a person is set on fire in a small house, there is every possibility that the material and furniture in the house catches fire leading to a dangerous situation for even the murderers, as a person set on fire is inherently unstable rushing all around till death.<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewageindian_b1bf.html" title="User:Newageindian">Newageindian</a> 11:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is a important to note that the wikipedia article <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowry_death.html" title="Dowry death">Dowry death</a> gets redirected to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bride_burning.html" title="Bride burning">Bride burning</a>.

<p>I have lived in India for 30 years. I have been to and stayed at about 35 odd places spread across 15 odd(out of 29)states of India. I(or more than 1000 people I have known thoroughly over 30 years) am yet to see a case of bride burning. On the contrary I see some feminists on net talking about it with much more frequency than perhaps these incidences actually occur spread over 1.1 billion of Indian population. Another practice of "Sati" has reported mere single digit cases( I think 5 to be precise) in last 20 years in India. In light of this, would it be relevant to have a topic devoted to this scarce phenomenon of "bride burning" which has a potential to mislead any reader about the actual state of affairs in modern India.</p>

<p>Just had a look at the criticism section. The first paragraph needs a bit of editting for NPOV. However the 3 short paragraphs, in the middle are in essay style <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">WP:SYNT</a> and are argumentative. Becuase of this I've deleting them, if anyone can rewrite them and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">source them with verfiable info</a> please do. The final 2 paragraphs of the criticism section needed to be adjusted for NPOV (I added {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">citation needed</a>}} just to show where refernces should be added when found). On a more general note, the whole article is in very poor shape. Both sides of it need references - may I recommend JSTOR as a source of reliable research articles (i found 5 substantial and balanced pieces there with only a quick search) unfortunately it's not a free service but anyone with access should use it or any other <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information to improve this page--<a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECailil_97aa.html" title="User:Cailil">Cailil</a> 19:43, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"we need to sound a note of caution that the police and investigating authorities should not improperly and technically jump to the conclusion that merely because death has occurred that ipso facto a criminal offense has been committed . In as many as 44% of these cases prosecution is thoroughly unjustified . Unless there is cogent and convincing evidence and unless there is material to sustain these charges , it would be totally impermissible and completely unjustified to embark upon legal action . The consequences of these charges are extremely grave because the accussed husband and invariably family members are placed under arrest . There are serious social and economic repurcussions."</i></dd>

<p>i totally object to referring to Save Family Foundation`s claims on the number of dowry deaths and/or bride burning. their claims are unsubstantiated and at best rash estimation. if they have arrived at the number by a research or through authorities, which i doubt,why there no citation for that?</p>
<p>also, there has to be a mention of how hinduism treats its women, about the way women are told to be inferior, treatment of widows and women who don`t have sons or are childless. female baby killing, selective abortion, deep seated discrimination against women in family and also how the corrupt tradition of dowry affects women`s self-esteem. all these factors contribute to bride burning and have to be addressed.</p>

<p>I have to agree with you <a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhimirebhumika_219b.html" title="User:Ghimirebhumika">Ghimirebhumika</a>, there is no notable or reliable claim from Save Indian Family about bride burning - there's a lot of opinion and argument but no evidence. If you have or know of a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> source for how dowry is effecting (affecting) women please add it.--<a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECailil_97aa.html" title="User:Cailil">Cailil</a> 15:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
