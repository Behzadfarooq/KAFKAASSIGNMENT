<p>Does anyone know what this is? Eno is credited with playing one on Taking Tiger Mountain and the wikipedia page for "snake guitar" redirects to this page. I am not sure how I feel about there being a wiki page for something that we don't know what it is. My feeling is that the snake guitar page should be deleted or perhaps the redirect should be changed to point to Taking Tiger Mountain? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikikob_d1e8.html" title="User:Wikikob">Wikikob</a> 10:01, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a Playlist to all of Brian Eno's stuff on Rhapsody, it links to my website only because wikipedia doesn't allow rpl upload's.. I'm wondering if there is a better way to do this because people may download it thinking its a virus or something.. I'm going to work out a way to do this better I think.. But that RPL file is a <a href="../../../r/h/a/Rhapsody_%28online_music_service%29.html" title="Rhapsody (online music service)">Rhapsody Playlist</a>.. I've been using Rhapsody (version 2.1 ) since September of last year and love it.. They convert about 3000 albums a month, and I scour the collection for tasty stuff and put rhapsody playlists to the stuff on my site.. So far I have all top 100 hits from every year 1976 through 1986.. But it looks like Billboard is finally starting to shut down all the sites with copies of their picks (stupid).. Anyhow, I'm starting to use a service in england to get more precise, like month by month references, like I have the top ~400 hits for the UK in 1990, and making playlists with that.. I'm trying to push Real to associating dates and times to the content so people can say reproduce the music for a particular time of the day on a certain year.. Anyhow, having playlists for each musician is a related dream, I've had.. Anyhow.. Take it or leave it, I don't care.. I'll leave it up for each community to decide.. --<a href="../../../r/o/f/User%7ERofthorax_83ce.html" title="User:Rofthorax">Rofthorax</a> 07:13, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure Eno was a "founding member" of Roxy Music. I thought that he was a friend of Andy Mackay, who asked him to join as they had a synthesiser which no-one knew how to use? Can anyone confirm this? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy-106_3003.html" title="User:Andy-106">andy-106</a> 20 May 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well you are more-or-less correct, however Eno was only joining Ferry &amp; MacKay at this point (and possibly the original bass player?) - Manzanera &amp; Thompson were recruited much later. --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 15:28, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Roxy was the brainchild of Ferry, who recruited his bassist friend Graham Simpson, then placed an ad that drew MacKay, who in turn pulled in Eno. Given that Eno was part of the first incarnation of Roxy Music--including their first gigs and demo recordings-- I think it is fair to call him a "founding member." <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 16:34, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's makes him part of the original line-up but doesn't make him a founder of Roxy Music. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy-106_3003.html" title="User:Andy-106">Andy-106</a> 09:19, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I recently quoted the "cofounder" term from the article and was promptly told that Ferry and MacKay co-founded Roxy, which may also not be correct according to <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a>. Anyway, if Eno was later dismissed by Ferry, these facts collectively suggest <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy-106_3003.html" title="User:Andy-106">Andy-106</a>'s position is correct: Eno was an original line-up member, but not a cofounder. It's been a year since this issue was posted -- how about a regular here making that change from "cofounder" to "original line-up" or similar edit, and see if there's any significant rv objection? Milo 20:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't been much of a regular, but I nevertheless made a few changes in response to your note. I just made him a "member" of the early Roxy--I think wrangling over the who-did-what-when in that band can be reserved for the Roxy Music article. Make sense? <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 00:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a>, you've nicely finessed the contentions. And sure, why not let <a href="../../../r/o/x/Roxy_Music_508e.html" title="Roxy Music">Roxy Music</a> handle them. The rest of the section reads a lot better too -- I now get clearly get what Eno was doing at the mixing desk. I suggest putting back the bit at the end where Eno thinks about his laundry on stage. It's harmless and a great line to quote to friends. Milo 06:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the laundry bit isn't from Roxy Music - that's a quote about when he decided to give up playing solo gigs (with "the Winkies"). --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 12:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) I had inserted in the Brian Eno article a paragraph where I noted the influence Miles Davis had on Eno, backed with an Eno quote and sourced with an url to his liner notes:</p>
<dl>

<p>2) In a second edit, I had also updated one of the external links, the one about the site I had just visited for sourcing the Eno quote about Miles Davis (they host the liner notes). The original uninformative link was:</p>

<p>In this context, Krash's unjustified reversion to the Eno article sure looks like petty abuse, wiki-stalking, and vandalism. And not providing a rational for reverting my edit, which clearly wasn't vandalism, sure looks like plausible denial for it.</p>

<dd>1) This is a misunderstanding.

Sorry to say, anonymous editors don't get the respect they so often deserve around here.</dd>

<dd>3) Combining my (incorrect) assumptions from #1 with my dislike for linkspam/linkfarming of #2, I feel that I was more than justified to revert. I guess this has been a terrible burden on you.

<dd>1) &amp; 2) are valid concerns, granted … 3) but the edit summaries of 62.147.* (who should really consider creating an <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">account</a> by the way) definitely were descriptive enough to justify a second look. A certain disgruntlement over a completely unexplained revert is understandable. And if this is a tantrum, then the dick is name-calling. Don't. (Curious though, under which reversion policy does "<i>You lost your case when you started ranting like a lunatic.

<p>The section "Solo work" has no information on anything Eno recorded or performed between 1980 and 2004, with the exception of a brief mention of <i>Nerve Net</i> (1992). I realize Eno was focusing more on producing during this period, but I know he's done some of his own work during this time.

<p>Was just wondering if there was a reason why some albums are not referenced in Eno's discography. What comes to mind are some of his "best of"s, such as 1986's "Desert Island Selection" or his two box set collections. There are also other albums that feature his work, typically along with other Edition EG artists, and his work on individual soundtracks (like the piece he composed for the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28movie_soundtrack%29.html" title="Dune (movie soundtrack)">Dune</a> soundtrack for example). Any objection to adding these to the listing, maybe under different sub-categories (i.e. "Best of", "Compilations", "Soundtracks", etc)? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptmondo_9b48.html" title="User:Captmondo">Captmondo</a> 21:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was removed as vandalism by John Baez. I put it back.</p>
<p>I feel it's a legit link, it's a record I had nothing to do with, a complete reinterpretation of "Taking Tiger Mountain." Eno has heard the record, loves it, and there's a recording of a phone message from Eno on the page and on the record of Eno saying how much he loves it.</p>

<p>I went to St Joseph's College in Ipswich and I remember my chemistry teacher telling us stories about "Young Ferry". However, he never mentioned Eno.
