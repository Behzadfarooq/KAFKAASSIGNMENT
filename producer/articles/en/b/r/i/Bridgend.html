<p><b>Bridgend</b> (<a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a>: <i>Pen-y-bont ar Ogwr</i>) is a town in the traditional county of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glamorgan.html" title="Glamorgan">Glamorgan</a> and the main town in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_borough.html" title="County borough">county borough</a> of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend_%28county_borough%29.html" title="Bridgend (county borough)">Bridgend</a> in south <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>.

<p>Several burial mounds have been found in the vicinity of Bridgend suggesting that the area was settled before Roman times. The <a href="../../../a/4/8/A48_road.html" title="A48 road">A48</a> between Bridgend and <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowbridge.html" title="Cowbridge">Cowbridge</a> has a portion, known locally as "Crack Hill", a Roman road. The <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_of_Glamorgan_8b1b.html" title="Vale of Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a> would have been a natural low-level route west to the Roman fort/harbour at Neath (<i>Nidum</i>) from settlements in the East like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caerleon.html" title="Caerleon">Caerleon</a> (<i>Isca</i>).</p>

<p>After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the new establishment looked westwards in the following decades to create new seats for lords loyal to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_The_Conqueror_e088.html" title="William The Conqueror">William The Conqueror</a>. Groups of Norman Barons arrived in Wales and in the South and East created what would later become the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Marches_048b.html" title="Welsh Marches">Welsh Marches</a>, while the North and West remained largly unconquered due to the harsh terrain.</p>
<p>At Coity, the local chieftain Morgan Gam already had a stronghold. Sometime in the 11th Century <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Norman</a> Lord Payn de Turberville approached Morgan to turn over control of the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">Coity Castle</a> to de Turberville but only if he (de Turberville) either fought Morgan for the land, or took his daughter Sybil's hand in marriage. Turberville married Sybil and became Lord of Coity, rebuilding the castle <a href="http://www.castlewales.com/coity.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.castlewales.com/coity.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In 1106, Newcastle Castle (on Newcastle Hill, overlooking the town centre) and <a href="../../../o/g/m/Ogmore_Castle_4269.html" title="Ogmore Castle">Ogmore Castle</a>(1116) were build by Robert Fitzhammon and William de Londres respectively<a href="http://www.bgfl.bridgend.gov.uk/Resources/History/BCBC%20history/BH%20main1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bgfl.bridgend.gov.uk/Resources/History/BCBC%20history/BH%20main1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. About 2 miles north-east of <a href="../../../o/g/m/Ogmore_Castle_4269.html" title="Ogmore Castle">Ogmore Castle</a>, Maurice de Londres founded the fortified <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a><a href="../../../e/w/e/Ewenny_Priory_5bd7.html" title="Ewenny Priory">Ewenny Priory</a> in 1141 <a href="http://www.ewenny.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ewenny.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>These three castles provided a "defensive triangle" for the area. (A quadrilateral if you include Ewenny Priory.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend.html" title="Edit section: The Formation of Bridgend">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Formation of Bridgend</span></h3>
<p>Bridgend itself developed at a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford.html" title="Ford">ford (Crossing)</a> on the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Ogmore_e80a.html" title="River Ogmore">River Ogmore</a>, which was on the main route between East and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Wales_4687.html" title="West Wales">West Wales</a>. Just north of the town, there is the confluence of three rivers, the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Ogmore_e80a.html" title="River Ogmore">Ogmore River</a>, the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Llynfi_902b.html" title="River Llynfi">Llynfi River</a> and the <a href="../../../a/f/o/Afon_Garw_ad7a.html" title="Afon Garw">Garw River</a>. South of Bridgend the Ewenny River merges with the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Ogmore_e80a.html" title="River Ogmore">River Ogmore</a> and flows into the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Channel_127c.html" title="Bristol Channel">Bristol Channel</a>. In the fifteenth century, a stone bridge was built to connect permanently each side of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Ogmore_e80a.html" title="River Ogmore">River Ogmore</a> (later rebuilt). Originally this bridge had four arches but in the eighteenth century a massive flood washed two of them away. The rest of the bridge still stands and still remains a focal point of the town, with aesthetic restoration taking place in 2006.</p>
<p>Bridgend grew rapidly into an agricultural town important to many of the local farmers. Although still small by today's standards it became an important <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_town.html" title="Market town">market town</a>, a tag that remained with it until well into the twentieth century.</p>
<p><a name="The_Industrial_Era" id="The_Industrial_Era"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend.html" title="Edit section: The Industrial Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Industrial Era</span></h3>
<p>The discovery of coal in the valleys north of Bridgend would have a massive impact on the town. The first coal mines opened north of Bridgend in the seventeenth century, with the Llynfi valley being the first to be industrialised. Bridgend itself never had coal and remained a market town for some time, but the valleys of the three rivers grew into an important part of the South Wales <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalfield.html" title="Coalfield">coalfields</a>. Ironworks and brickworks (notably at <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tondu.html" title="Tondu">Tondu</a>) were also established in the same period, by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bedford_3705.html" title="John Bedford">John Bedford</a>, although the ironworks faltered after his death and ceased operating entirely in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> arrived and Bridgend was at the junction between the main <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishguard.html" title="Fishguard">Fishguard</a> line and the branch to the three valleys. Coal trains regularly sent coal down the valleys and with the opening of the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_of_Glamorgan_8b1b.html" title="Vale of Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a> railway, coal could be sent directly to port at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry%2C_Wales_9e97.html" title="Barry, Wales">Barry</a> or through other branch lines to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porthcawl.html" title="Porthcawl">Porthcawl</a>.</p>
<p>Bridgend itself saw several <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarry.html" title="Quarry">quarries</a> open in and around the town centre, the remnants of which, (near Brackla) can still be seen today. An engine works was opened in the town and a larger farmers' market also opened in the town centre, where it remained until at least the middle of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In 1801, the population of Bridgend County was around 6000. By the beginning of the twentieth century this had risen to 61,000. By this time Bridgend was a bustling market town with prosperous valleys to the north, a thriving community and good links to other towns and cities.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend.html" title="Edit section: The Second World War and Bridgend">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Second World War and Bridgend</span></h3>
<p>Bridgend played an important part during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. It was home to a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_War_9e23.html" title="Prisoner of War">Prisoner of War</a> Camp at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Farm_a65f.html" title="Island Farm">Island Farm</a> and a large <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munitions.html" title="Munitions">munitions</a> factory (<a href="../../../r/o/f/ROF_Bridgend_f1ae.html" title="ROF Bridgend">ROF Bridgend</a> — known as the "Admiralty") at Waterton, as well as a large underground munitions storage base at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackla.html" title="Brackla">Brackla</a> (known as the 8 x's). This was an overspill of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Arsenal_d4eb.html" title="Royal Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolwich.html" title="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>.</p>
<p>At its peak the <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal.html" title="Arsenal">Arsenal</a> had 40,000 workers, many of them women. Large numbers of them were transported by bus from the <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhondda.html" title="Rhondda">Rhondda</a> and the valleys. At the time the Arsenal was the largest factory (employee-wise) ever in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>.</p>
<p>The factory complex had three sites in Bridgend, all linked together by a huge network of railways. There are many reminders of the factory sites left to this day <a href="http://www.bracklaordnance.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.bracklaordnance.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Brackla Ordance Site</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, seventy prisoners of war from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Farm_a65f.html" title="Island Farm">Island Farm</a> managed to escape through a tunnel although all were recaptured. While Bridgend was as important during the war as any other part of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and although it <i>was</i> photographed by the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>, it was never "<a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz.html" title="Blitz">blitzed</a>". This was largely due to the area's <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Pocket_a391.html" title="Air Pocket">air pocket</a>, which made bombing extremely hazardous for incoming planes. The close proximy of the P.O.W Camp at <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Farm_a65f.html" title="Island Farm">Island Farm</a> may have been something of a deterrent as well. Unlike Bridgend, both <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> did not escape such massive attacks but the area immediately around Bridgend did suffer bombing raids. Had Bridgend been bombed it would have likely been a massive blow to munitions supplies to the allies and could have changed the course of the war in the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_powers_of_World_War_II_4f4a.html" title="Axis powers of World War II">Axis</a>' favour.</p>
<p>The Admiralty ceased full scale production in December 1945 after 5 years.

<p>Bridgend remained a solid market town after the War. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, Newbridge Fields (a short distance from the town centre) hosted the 1948 <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Eisteddfod_b27b.html" title="National Eisteddfod">National Eisteddfod</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, the River Ogmore burst its banks and flooded the town centre. Subsequent floods and extreme weather led the Welsh Water Authority to develop concrete flood defence walls along the banks of the <a href="../../../o/g/m/Ogmore_River_9ab2.html" title="Ogmore River">Ogmore River</a> in the town centre. The town centre has not been flooded since. During this time Bridgend was chosen to become the headquarters for <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Wales_Police_bea7.html" title="South Wales Police">South Wales Police</a>. This action was ideal as geographically, Bridgend stands equidistantly between both <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> to the west and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to the east.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeching_cuts.html" title="Beeching cuts">Beeching cuts</a> of the 1960s saw the loss of passenger rail links in the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_of_Glamorgan_8b1b.html" title="Vale of Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a> and to the northern valleys. The Vale of Glamorgan link to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry%2C_Wales_9e97.html" title="Barry, Wales">Barry</a> via <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhoose.html" title="Rhoose">Rhoose</a> was re-instated in June <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Bridgend would begin to see the catalyst of arguably its biggest growth period. The "missing section" of the <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_motorway.html" title="M4 motorway">M4 motorway</a> was constructed around the town, plans were afoot to change the Waterton Admiralty into an Industrial Estate, and the water supply was improved including new <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewage_treatment.html" title="Sewage treatment">sewage treatment</a> works near <a href="../../../o/g/m/Ogmore.html" title="Ogmore">Ogmore</a>.</p>
<p>Two major multinational <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation.html" title="Corporation">corporations</a>, the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> set up factories in, or on the outskirts of the new <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend_Industrial_Estate_1e07.html" title="Bridgend Industrial Estate">Bridgend Industrial Estate</a> (former Waterton Arsenal).</p>
<p>During the 1980s with the development of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackla.html" title="Brackla">Brackla</a> housing estate the future of Bridgend seemed bright. By the 1990s the estate had grown to become the largest privately-owned housing estate in Europe.</p>
<p>The closure of the Welsh coal industry brought mass-<a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> and social problems to the valleys to the north. However, this led to a greater general standard of living for many in the areas previously dominated by coal mining but many of the problems stemming from unemployment, including drug-use and economic inactivity still remain today. By the late 1980s all coal mines in the area had ceased operations and the former mine workers either commuted or moved to central Bridgend to work at the newly-developed industrial estates. This was typical for much of South Wales which was at the time moving from a mining-based economy and into a new service, electronic, manufacturing and textile-based one.</p>
<p>A new <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securicor.html" title="Securicor">Securicor</a> operated prison (<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parc_%28HM_Prison%29_e9a2.html" title="Parc (HM Prison)">HM Parc Prison</a>) was built near Coity in the late 1990s. The prison opened in November 1997 and is the only private prison in Wales.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend.html" title="Edit section: Modern Bridgend">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Bridgend</span></h3>
<p>Further new housing developments at Broadlands (near Newbridge Fields) and the never ending expansion of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackla.html" title="Brackla">Brackla</a> have caused Bridgend's population to swell dramatically. Traffic became a real problem in the archaic town centre, in 1997 a new link road/<a href="../../../b/y/p/Bypass_route.html" title="Bypass route">bypass</a> was built to link the town centre directly to the <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_motorway.html" title="M4 motorway">M4 motorway</a> as well as redirect traffic around the town centre.</p>
<p>The local council started a scheme to pedestrianise the town centre. This has been met with criticism by the traders and shoppers alike because of poor construction, poor design and poor access. Excessive car parking charges as well as the dominance of UK retail giant <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> in and around the area (2 large superstores and one small convenience "Tesco Express" store) has led Bridgend to be jokingly called "a little town beyond Tesco" (cf <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_England_beyond_Wales_0cbc.html" title="Little England beyond Wales">Little England beyond Wales</a>).</p>
<p>Out-of-town shopping, mismanagement of the pedestrianisation scheme and the construction of the McArthur Glen Retail Complex (Bridgend Designer Outlet) near the <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_motorway.html" title="M4 motorway">M4 motorway</a> had led to a decline of the town centre. Competition from Cardiff and Swansea in terms of retail choice and ease of access has led to the town becoming a less popular choice with locals. The amount of mobile phone and greetings card shops has become something of a running joke.</p>
<p>The construction of an award-winning new bus station in 2004 and a rethink to traffic movement around the town centre has seen a halt to the decline. Local committees, together with the council started to use the pedestrianisation of the town-centre to its advantage, cumulating in several popular fairs including Continental Markets, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celt.html" title="Celt">Celtic</a> Festivals, a small <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mardi-Gras_8678.html" title="Mardi-Gras">Mardi-Gras</a> and Seasonal markets and events.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend.html" title="Edit section: Future Plans for Bridgend">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Future Plans for Bridgend</span></h3>
<p>Bridgend is still seen by many as a "scruffy" town. <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective_1.html" title="Objective 1">Objective 1</a> investment in regeneration of some of the more untidy parts of the town has understandably been welcomed. One scheme is to create a "riverside culture" by constructing a walkway along the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Ogmore_e80a.html" title="River Ogmore">River Ogmore</a> near the old bridge, opening up the rear of properties facing the river. £2million has been secured and it is hoped the scheme will be completed by 2009.</p>
<p>To counteract the dominance of <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco.html" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> in the area, <a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="ASDA">ASDA</a> is understood to have been given planning permission for a new superstore just outside the town centre, which will hopefully open in 2007. At the nearby Brackla Street Centre, plans have been drawn up for a top-class, attractive residential/retail mix redevelopment. However a similar development was withdrawn a few years ago.</p>
<p>Construction on a 1500-home sustainable "village" at Parc Derwen near Coity is due to begin imminently. The scheme has been painstakingly planned and although there are concerns from Coity in particular, this may soften the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_sprawl.html" title="Urban sprawl">urban sprawl</a> that has affected <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brackla.html" title="Brackla">Brackla</a> and Broadlands.</p>
<p>Ambitious plans for a 20000-seat stadium, hotel and railway station at Wern Ddu near the <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_motorway.html" title="M4 motorway">M4 motorway</a> north of Bridgend near <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tondu.html" title="Tondu">Tondu</a> have been submitted.<a href="http://www.keyworkerhomeswales.co.uk/stadium-and-hotel.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keyworkerhomeswales.co.uk/stadium-and-hotel.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> An equally ambitious scheme for a 650-home "Garden Village" of affordable housing, community facilities and distributor road to the north west of the town has also been submitted by the same company, Keyworker Homes.<a href="http://www.keyworkerhomeswales.co.uk/llangewydd-garden-village.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keyworkerhomeswales.co.uk/llangewydd-garden-village.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> It is highly unlikely either of these projects will be given the go ahead due to the lack of top-level sport in the area, comparable facilities in nearby <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiff.html" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, flooding risk, and that the latter development is on green-belt land.</p>

<p>Bridgend and nearby <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neath_Port_Talbot_df95.html" title="Neath Port Talbot">Neath Port Talbot</a> recovered quickly from the decline of traditional industries, particularly coal-mining due to other alternative forms of employment. Wages are generally higher here than in other parts of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Wales_Valleys_f402.html" title="South Wales Valleys">South Wales Valleys</a>. There are large industrial estates at Bridgend and Waterton (formerly Waterton Admirality) which host a number of small scale and multi-national companies, mainly manufacturing. The biggest single employer (outside of the public sector) in the area is probably the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a>'s engine plant near Waterton after <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a>'s closure of the Bridgend plant and downsizing of the Pencoed plant. It is hoped other businesses will relocate to the sites. Other manufacturers to have pulled out of the area include <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrigley.html" title="Wrigley">Wrigley Company</a>'s. Job losses resulting from the closure of RAF St Athan's next year will also affect the town hard as many of the workers live in and around Bridgend.</p>
<p>There are successes, IT Consultancy group <a href="../../../l/o/g/LogicaCMG_368e.html" title="LogicaCMG">LogicaCMG</a> opened an office in Bridgend (which has since been expanded) and several companies have moved to new office complexes on the outskirts of Bridgend.

The Crusaders will take part in <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_Two_be56.html" title="National League Two">Rugby League's National League Two</a> in 2007 as well as playing a lucrative match against <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a> and are aiming to be in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_League_%28Europe%29_b82d.html" title="Super League (Europe)">Super League</a> by 2009.</p>
<p>In the regionalisation of Welsh Rugby Union in 2003, Bridgend RFC and Pontypridd RFC merged to form the Celtic Warriors. The area represented was massive and there are obvious communication and transport problems in sharing the respective grounds. The decision was made to move the club permanently to the Brewery Field because current Crusaders owner Leighton Samuel, who then owned the Warriors, was the primary leaseholder. Attendances at Warriors matches had been poor but were showing signs of recovery in 2004. But despite a strong finish to the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_League_aa4a.html" title="Celtic League">Celtic League</a> season, the region was disbanded to the shock of everyone involved. Professional rugby union in Bridgend and the valleys ended in an instant. The people of the areas involved now have to identify with teams outside the locality, support their semi professional Welsh Premiership team the Bridgend Ravens or some have even switched to rugby league.</p>
<p>Bridgend's second rugby league side is the Bridgend Blue Bulls, the current <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_League_Conference_fbbf.html" title="Rugby League Conference">Welsh Conference</a> champions and one the UK's most successful amateur clubs having won two national amateur titles in four years. The Bulls played at Coychurch Road but following the announcement about the setting up of the Celtic Crusaders they were invited to play at the Brewery Field but the owner Leighton Samuel. Unfortunately on year on they were unceremoniously refused permission to continue playing at the Brewery Field by Mr Leighton Samuel in the middle of the season. They were helped out at the last minute by Porthcawl RFC and staged the remaining 2006 home games there. Their home ground for 2007 is under discussion but it will NOT be the Brewery Field.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgend_RFC_3936.html" title="Bridgend RFC">Bridgend Ravens</a> are a new rugby union club in the town. Formed out of the ashes of the original Bridgend RFC in 2004 following Bridgend RFC's owner Leighton Samuel taking the decision to withdraw from Rugby Union. The original company was finally wound up by its owner Leighton Samuel due to mounting debts in 2006. The Bridgend Ravens side are semi-professional, play in the Welsh Premiership and rent the Brewery Field from the Crusaders in the winter months. But most importantly they are debt free. Bridgend is also home to other rugby union sides including Bridgend Athletic RFC, Bridgend Sports RFC and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Wales_Police_bea7.html" title="South Wales Police">South Wales Police</a> RFC.</p>
<p>Bridgend has two main football teams, Bridgend Town FC, and Bryntirion Athletic FC, both sides play in the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Football_League_First_Division_0332.html" title="Welsh Football League First Division">Welsh Football League First Division</a>. Bridgend Town FC will need to relocate in the next few years from its Coychurch Road ground due to a planned road and housing estate on the ground in conjunction with the new <a href="../../../a/s/d/ASDA_86af.html" title="ASDA">ASDA</a> store.</p>
<p>Bridgend also has local <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> clubs, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a> courses and <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a> &amp; <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowls.html" title="Bowls">bowls</a> facilities at the local club, the Bridgend Lawn Tennis And Bowls Association.</p>
