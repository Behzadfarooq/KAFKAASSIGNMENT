<p>I've never heard tell of a <i>Proto-Brythonic language</i>. Also there is no article entitled Proto-Goidelic language, so I see no point in renaming it.

<dd>There are some issues with a name like "Proto-Brythonic". One is that it relies on our current ignorance of British Celtic languages other than Welsh. Brythonic as a term is usually contrasted with Goidelic. There was probably more than one Celtic languages in Britain even prior to the Roman conquest, and all of them were not Goidelic. So is "Proto-Brythonic" the ancestor of these, or the single language spoken by the Romano-Britons in, say, 400 A.D.? --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 06:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt the Romano-Britons in AD 400 spoke just one Brythonic language. There were probably several in different parts of the country, including the ancestors of Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and Cumbric (or at the very least, the ancestors of Welsh/Cumbric and Cornish/Breton), but probably also Brythonic languages in the east of what is now England that have been completely lost. Proto-Brythonic refers in principle to the ancestor language of all of these, but in practice can only be reconstructed on the basis of the surviving languages Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 06:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does the article give a geographical distribution up to but not including the Pennines? What language was spoken north of there?

<dd>I see that the article now asserts that Scottish Gaelic was spoken from the Pennines northwards. This seems extremely unlikely, given a) the history of Dalriada b) the clearly P-celtic names such as the Epidii, but maybe there are facts that I am unaware of? --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENantonosAedui_1bf2.html" title="User:NantonosAedui">Nantonos</a> 15:39, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Cumbric is indeed, like Welsh and Breton, descended from Brittonic. Looking at the tribal names from Ptolemys Geographica, its clear that they are Brittonic (or Gallo-Brittonic, since those seem to be the same language). For example the Epidii, in Kintyre; or the Parisii, in Yorkshire. For further information, look into the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Votadini.html" title="Votadini">Votadini</a> and the post-Roman Kingdom of <a href="../../../g/o/d/Gododdin.html" title="Gododdin">Gododdin</a>, in Lothian. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENantonosAedui_1bf2.html" title="User:NantonosAedui">Nantonos</a> 21:18, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Cumbric is certainly descended from Proto-Brittonic/Proto-Brythonic, but this page doesn't make it clear that Proto-Brythonic is the language under discussion. The concept of "Gallo-Brittonic" is controversial and probably a minority view among Celticists. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 22:17, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Angr, why do you refer to it as <i>proto</i> anything - such names should be reserved for languages that are unattested, surely. Brittonic is clearly attested (names on coins, place names, ogam stones, an the Bath inscription). So its not clear what proto-language is being discussed. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENantonosAedui_1bf2.html" title="User:NantonosAedui">NantonosAedui</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENantonosAedui_d3fa.html" title="User talk:NantonosAedui">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NantonosAedui_aea6.html" title="Special:Contributions/NantonosAedui">contribs</a>) 23:43, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</small>

<dd>The names on the coins aren't attestation of the language, because they're Latinized. Place names aren't attestation of the language either, because they're either Latinized or Anglicized or otherwise adapted.

<dl>
<dd>Oh dear. With that set of assumpions, I can see why you would draw erroneous conclusions. I started to write a well-referenced correction, then realised that it would be better in the article itself. However, briefly: (a) the language on British and Gaulish pre-conquest Celtic coinage is Celtic (Brittonic or Gaulish), not Latin. (b) Of the 371 Ogam stones in Britain, 191 are Brittonic. (c) The Bath inscription was already referred to below. I will hopefully get time to greatly expand this article in the next few weeks. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENantonosAedui_1bf2.html" title="User:NantonosAedui">Nantonos</a> 17:17, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since there are no references to back up this non-historical claim of Scottish Gaelic, I'm going to be bold and change it to a claim of Brythonic people up to the Great Glen, and perhaps beyond - since there <i>are</i> references (such as <a href="../../../y/_/g/Y_Gododdin_2f6d.html" title="Y Gododdin">Y Gododdin</a>) to back that up. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENantonosAedui_1bf2.html" title="User:NantonosAedui">Nantonos</a> 21:18, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been bold and removed the bit about Scottish Gaelic being spoken as far south as the Pennines. It run directly counter to all I've ever been taught; for starters, Gaelic wasn't even introduced to the island of Britain until after the Roman period, and it's attested that Strathclyde and Gododdin were British-speaking kingdoms, and Cumbric was definitely a British language.

<dd>Arwel is right. Just got out the other book from the library, and it says pretty much the same thing. It <i>does</i> say British was spoken up to the Pennines, but it also says it was spoken between the Pennines and the Scottish lowlands. It <i>does</i> say Gaelic was spoken north of the Pennines, but at a later stage.

<p><sup>This is ambiguous I think. Can it be proven that the people who spoke 'British' were actually driven away? My suspicion is that the bulk of the population remained where they were, but had adopted the cultures of invaders. Recent <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> studies have shown that, for example, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> make up a minority of the population of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> today - much smaller in number than had been previously assumed. I suggest that this sentence be revamped to reflect this fact. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 00:39, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</sup></p>

<dd><sup>I agree this needs to be expanded as it gives only one side to the centuries old academic to and fro on the fate of the native population of what later became England. Basically the options are massacre, emigration and assimilation and the academics (with propagandists cheering on the sidelines or muddying the waters!) argue over the evidence for dominance of each ingredient in the complex history of the British Isles. Currently the favoured theory is that a significant proportion of the native population survived in many parts of Britain where the British language was replaced by Old English or Gaelic. However there is evidence for a substantial population movement from South West England to Brittany carrying with them what was to become the Breton language. Emigration to Wales and Cornwall is a particularly difficult theory to prove since the immigrants would have been speaking the same language as the native population. The main new source of evidence during the past thirty years is from DNA studies.</sup></dd>

<p>I suspect this was edited from "there are no texts in the language" or some such.

<dd>Well, the question is, do we <i>have</i> anything written about the British language? What exactly do the Greek and Latin texts say? Do they just give names? Do they gloss a few words (e.g. "the Britanni call a fort a <i>dunum</i>")? How do we know that the language the Greek and Latin authors are describing is the same language as the one that evolved into the modern Brythonic languages? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 20:48, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
