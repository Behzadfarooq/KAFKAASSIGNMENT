<hr />
<p>On the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_UK_geography_6ecd.html#Resources_and_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography">project page</a> you can find detailed guides on how to write about counties and settlements, as well as where to find statistics, references and other useful things. Additionally, the following have been identified as specific improvements this article needs:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Add statistics to economy and industry section, such as <s>GDP and employment figures,</s> how many people commute from outside the city, how much different sectors contribute to the economy and how many tourists come to visit &amp; the attractions that draw them in. These pages may help: <a href="http://www.swo.org.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swo.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/statistics-and-census-information/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/council-and-democracy/statistics-and-census-information/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.intelligencewest.org.uk/economy/html/economydata.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.intelligencewest.org.uk/economy/html/economydata.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and Chapter 14 of <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_trends_2001/rt36.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_trends_2001/rt36.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The data should be easy to obtain, I just can't open PDF files on this computer.</li>
<li><s>Physical geography section including geology, landscape, ecology and climate with possible sub-page Geology of Bristol.</s></li>
<li><s>Possibly rename Arts and leasure to culture, and split to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Bristol_39ce.html" title="Culture of Bristol">Culture of Bristol</a> summary style.</s></li>
<li>Are there any more interesting demographics info? The raw census data is <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/explorer.asp?CTG=3&amp;SL=4696&amp;D=4697&amp;DCT=32&amp;DT=32#4697" class="external text" title="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/explorer.asp?CTG=3&amp;SL=4696&amp;D=4697&amp;DCT=32&amp;DT=32#4697" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and somebody may already have made graphs etc that are easier to read. I've started analysing age structure, but it's tedious working from the raw data with only google cache to read it in.</li>
<li><s>Transport statistics. We already mention the roads and claim that a lot of people cycle. Something could also be said about the busses, and their discontents. And statistics would be good to illustrate them. I looked through the city council website but couldn't find any.</s></li>
<li><s>Turn people section into prose?</s> After turning the people section into prose and moving the paragraphs to more relevant sections (and deleting a few "so and so lived in Bristol for a few months many years ago" items that weren't notable) I was left with the following which I was unsure what to do with:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Floyd_2dd0.html" title="Keith Floyd">Keith Floyd</a>, TV chef, ran several restaurants in Bristol, and got his start in TV at BBC Bristol. &lt;-- Possibly culture, but I don't even know if he's notable enough, being in the Bristol people category might be enough.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Harvey_ff2e.html" title="John Harvey">John Harvey</a> founded the Bristol wine merchants <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Harvey_%26_Sons_002e.html" title="John Harvey &amp; Sons">John Harvey &amp; Sons</a>, and their <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherry.html" title="Sherry">sherry</a> brand <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey%27s_Bristol_Cream_f1f6.html" title="Harvey's Bristol Cream">Harvey's Bristol Cream</a> has taken the name of Bristol all over the world. &lt;-- Possible culture: most cities/counties mention food and drink in culture.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_May_4035.html" title="James May">James May</a>, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <i><a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gear_4d67.html" title="Top Gear">Top Gear</a></i> presenter and <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a></i> columnist was born in Bristol &lt;-- No idea who this is, is he notable enough to be mentioned in the article?</li>
</ul>

<li>Populate Category:Natives of Bristol</li>
<li>Add to the Bristol images gallery and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bristol" class="extiw" title="commons:Bristol">commons:Bristol</a>.</li>

<p>Just a tiny bit more clarification sought:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "BAC" in the bit about Concorde is the same thing as the "Bristol Aeroplane Company" mentioned lower down - is that right?</li>
<li>Do I remember right about the massive runway extension being for the Brabazon? Or did I make that up? What [I think] I'm on about is the effect you can see <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=358520&amp;Y=180470&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=3" class="external text" title="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=358520&amp;Y=180470&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=3" rel="nofollow">here</a> where the extension clearly zaps the road and (istr) a village or hamlet or something was lost - is that right?

<dd>What BAC means depends on the time you're talking about. In the earlier years it was Bristol Aeroplane Company and later, by strange chance, it was British Aircraft Corporation. So when BAC is used in an article which one is meant should be put somewhere.<br /></dd>

<dd>According to Peter Aughton, <i>Bristol: A People's History</i> (2000), the 1377 <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll_tax.html" title="Poll tax">poll tax</a> returns (persons over 14 years) were: London 23314, York 7248, Bristol 6345, Coventry 4817, Norwich 3952, Lincoln 3412. Bristol did not join in the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peasants%27_Revolt_9c75.html" title="Peasants' Revolt">Peasants' Revolt</a> against the poll tax in 1381, so maybe there was under-reporting in the other towns and cities but not in Bristol.

<p>I diagree that rainfall in Bristol is "similar to the national average". The previous two sentences refer to "cities" rather than national average, and so should the third. Huge swathes of the UK are scotland and welsh hills, so the "national average" for rainfall is very much wetter than most urban areas. Bristol is one of the wettest urban areas in England...but I cant find a reference right now!... Also, under prevailing W/SW winds Bristol is only sheltered by the very edge of the Mendips - hence the rain <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFig_wright_153c.html" title="User:Fig wright">Fig</a> 23:02, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, a list of wards would be just that - wards. They don't necessarily correspond to the areas that people talk about in real life. "Cabot", for example, is a completely synthetic ward; there's not much that can be said about it as a community. On the other hand "real" places like Shirehampton and St Paul's would be off the list. --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a><a href="../../../r/b/r/User_talk%7ERbrwr_b76f.html" title="User talk:Rbrwr">ˆ</a> 20:22, 13 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK - How about putting a list of wards under the "Local Government" heading, matching up each ward with its two councillors, and removing the errors from Areas and Towns (being Catbrain, Filton, and Patchway - all of which are in South Gloucestershire), as well as expanding the section to include other areas (Broadmead, Montpelier etc). Thus, wards are associated with government, and areas and towns are separate. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick04_a2be.html" title="User:Nick04">Nick04</a> 09:58, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That sounds promising. Another source of "areas and towns" that occurred to me would be the areas which are identified on well-known maps of Bristol (the A-Z and the OS 1:50k spring to mind). As the article as a whole deals with some things that are outside the city limits but belong to Bristol from a global perspective (i.e. BAC/Concorde at Filton) we should probably have a (separate) list of adjoining suburbs and towns alongside it. Does that sound like a good idea? --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a><a href="../../../r/b/r/User_talk%7ERbrwr_b76f.html" title="User talk:Rbrwr">ˆ</a> 10:44, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Cabot - I used to live in Cabot ward in the early 80s and also viewed it as illogical (though not synthetic) - but older hands pointed out that it was the old 'Docks' ward, and up until the 50s/60s rundown of the City Docks would indeed have had a character and cohenrence all of its own.<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinuxlad_bd3a.html" title="User:Linuxlad">Linuxlad</a> 17:16, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Go right ahead if you want. It's an old one of mine from a great nostalgia pilgrimage to Bristol a year or two ago. It's a pity the tower is so small but it was hacked out from a MUCH larger 35mm pic. Pending anything better of the CT it's not bad. One day perhaps we can get a better one... I think I had trouble getting a good angle on it, was somewhere down near the Central Library or somewhere istr and there was buildings in the way everywhere so this was probably between two pubs and a telegraph pole or something ...&#160;:) --<a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 14:35, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I contributed a vertically stretched panorama initially. This was deliberate. In my opinion a streched panorama is easier to view on a web browser than an undistorted version that ends up looking like a very long and thin bar. Vertical streching does not really make a picture of buildings look that much worse. It looks a bit like photo taken with a wide angle lens.

<dd>Klafubra, I'm very surprised you would find a highly distorted pic acceptable on WP and it certainly isn't the effect a wide-angle lens gives. There's nothing wrong with a long thin bar on the page because it's only a thumbnail and the reader (if interested) will immediately enlarge it. Thank you for leaving my corrected pic in the article. In any case, de-stretching it in Photoshop took me only about ten minutes including pulling it off WP , correcting it with EDIT TRANSFORM SCALE and then reuploading it. (PS New contributions to Talk go at the bottom of the page so I've moved yours to here) Best Wishes,<a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 12:44, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear all, I have today proposed that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Bristol_91b4.html" title="Greater Bristol">Greater Bristol</a> article be merged into this one. My reasons are that I don't feel the Greater Bristol piece adds anything that shouldn't be covered in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> article. The Bristol article already makes clear that Bristol is a unitary authority, a ceremonial county, a city and a large urban area so, while I would envisage using the population data, I don't see that having a separate article on Greater Bristol is worthwhile. Clearly, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_London_d0dd.html" title="Greater London">Greater London</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Manchester_23f4.html" title="Greater Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> are formal entities in their own right and deserve separate articles, but I don't believe the same is true of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Bristol_91b4.html" title="Greater Bristol">Greater Bristol</a>.

<p>There is no such thing as Greater Bristol anyway. The County of Avon was split into one city and County ("City and County of Bristol") and three unitary authorities ("North Somerset", "Bath and North East Somerset" and "South Gloucestershire"). Greater (city) usually refers to the most of the city, excluding the outskirts. In the case of Bristol, what is realistically the outskirts of the city (for example, Hanham, Kingswood or Little Stoke) are not officially part of Bristol (except in the sense of the posttown) anyway. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickg1980_9b87.html" title="User:Nickg1980">Nickg1980</a></p>

Can't promise I'll have time to look at all the others but, as long as each is judged on its own merits, I think checking to see whether each conurbation deserves its own article is reasonable. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncshine_d626.html" title="User:Duncshine">Duncshine</a> 12:45, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well, what ever you decide for GB perhaps you should also do for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Nottingham_a84a.html" title="Greater Nottingham">Greater Nottingham</a>, a very similar size of conurbation.

<dd>Greater Bristol is a borderline conurbation, but Greater Nottingham is a well accepted entity --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve</a> 23:00, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there is probably a larger point about conurbations. I do feel each one should be judged on its own merits. I am certainly not against 'Greater ---' articles in principle. I just don't feel Greater Bristol merits one. I don't know enough about Nottingham, but it may be worth someone putting a merger tag on there too just to see what the consensus is. There is certainly no reason why the consensus should be the same in both cases. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncshine_d626.html" title="User:Duncshine">Duncshine</a> 09:19, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bristol is a fantastic city to photograph, and there are several Wikipedians, and loads of non-Wikipedian photographers in Bristol. This is a proposal to use the Bristol Wikiproject to improve the already high-quality collection of Bristol photos and give all us Bristolian photographers some fun challenges. The proposal is to set up a series of photo contests, where we pick a different subject (either a specific article that needs illustrating, or a specific shot that we currently have a suboptimal image of) and give e.g. four weeks for people to shoot their entry followed by a week of peer review and voting for the best (several contests can overlap so there is always one in the voting stage). As far as I know no other Wikiprojects (yet) have anything similar to this proposal. I think it would be fun and good for Wikipedia, what do you think? How many people would be interested in taking part? I'm cross-posting this to flickr, if you know of anybody/group else who might be interested, please cross-post. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 03:36, 9 July 2006 (UTC) (ps: Since I'm out of the country until Aug 9 I don't plan on getting it running right away.)</p>

<p>Can anybody provide a reference for the statement regarding population in the 19th century. I'm googling "Bristol population growth 1801 1901" and not getting much yet. I'm worried that since the county was expanded in 1835 the comparison won't be legitimate, and I'm hoping the person who added the statement has a source that takes in to account the boundary changes. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 23:36, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>mmm, a number of issues here. The phrase "made a city" is pretty clumsy (IMHO). In the UK becoming a city involves receiving a royal charter: so there's a contradiction. Furthermore, there's no clear reference to help verify any of the dates. I'm no expert on Bristol's local history, but with some help from <a href="http://weldgen.tripod.com/bristol-history/" class="external free" title="http://weldgen.tripod.com/bristol-history/" rel="nofollow">http://weldgen.tripod.com/bristol-history/</a> I would suggest that Bristol received a charter in 1155 (but not necessarily to make it a city) and that the diocese of Bristol was chartered in 1542. According to the footnote to Bristol's entry in [City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom] Bristol's City Status confirmed by Letters Patent issued under the Great Seal dated 1974-06-25 -- so I guess from that one can infer that there was some ambiguity before then. I've made edits in an attempt to clarify this. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilbarker_03bb.html" title="User:Philbarker">Philbarker</a> 17:01, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've moved the photo of the suspension bridge above the map. It seems to be standard practice for cities to have a photo above the location map (cf. <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, etc), and in my opinion it makes for a nicer introduction to the article (it may even be policy somewhere?). I've fixed the width to try and make it fit with the infobox below.</p>
<p>I picked the suspension bridge as in my opinion it's the most iconic view of the city (rather than an aerial photo or similar) - does anyone think there is a better image to represent Bristol? MrBeast 22:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks alright, though that photo could do with being slightly sharper and with more contrast IMO.

<p>I've done some work on the references of this article. In one section in particular (Demographics) I've needed to add a few { { citationneeded } } and { { check } } tags. The former are where we had a Wikipedia article as a source (against policy unfortunately) and the latter are where the information quoted appears to my eyes to contradict the source.
