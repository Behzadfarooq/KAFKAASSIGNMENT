<p><a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> was another good year for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_c69f.html" title="British Caledonian">British Caledonian</a>. The airline took delivery of its delayed third and fourth McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodied aircraft during the first and third quarter of that year. This permitted the aircraft's introduction on its daily Gatwick-Houston schedule as well as the replacement of the remaining 707-operated services on its mid- and South Atlantic routes. The narrowbodied capacity thus released was used to add frequencies on existing routes as well as to launch services to new long-haul destinations. As a result, BCal launched a fourth weekly service to Brazil and added <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quito.html" title="Quito">Quito</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guayaquil.html" title="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a> to the mid-Atlantic schedule. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The company also increased frequencies on its short-haul routes. A fourth daily round-trip was added to both Gatwick-Manchester and Gatwick-Brussels. A third daily frequency operating on week days (Monday to Friday) was added to the Newcastle-Amsterdam portion of BCal's Glasgow-Newcastle-Amsterdam regional route. Furthermore, BCal began adding its two-letter BR airline designator to the BIA-operated flights linking its Gatwick base with Le Touquet and Rotterdam, with frequencies being increased on both of these routes as well.</p>
<p>During that year BCal also established a wholly owned helicopter subsidiary and it placed the launch order for a brand-new widebodied aircraft, the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_A310_f2dd.html" title="Airbus A310">Airbus A310</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, 1979 was the year BCal acquired its last Boeing 707 - a series 320C freighter - from <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia_Airlines_32e3.html" title="Malaysia Airlines">MAS</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, BCal came up with its own proposal to create a new network of European low-fare services to be marketed under the trademark "Miniprix" to counter Laker's plans for a pan-European "Skytrain" operation that was supposed to operate on up to 660 different routes criss-crossing the entire continent. <sup id="_ref-risk367_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk367" title="">[2]</a></sup> Including BCal's existing four European destinations, it envisaged linking Gatwick with up to 25 points on the Continent. <sup id="_ref-risk367_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk367" title="">[2]</a></sup> Most of these services were to be initially operated with the airline's existing narrowbodied equipment, i.e. both the BAC 1-11-500 and the Boeing 707-320C, at a frequency of one flight per day in each direction. BCal was evaluating both the <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-80_5c99.html" title="McDonnell Douglas MD-80">McDonnell Douglas MD-80</a> narrowbody as well as the Airbus A310 widebody as suitable long-term replacements for its existing narrowbodied aircraft on these routes. <sup id="_ref-risk367_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk367" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>BCal eventually began offering "Miniprix" fares on off-peak services on its existing European routes after it had obtained all necessary approvals from the UK authorities and their respective European counterparts. <sup id="_ref-risk367_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk367" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another important development that helped enhance BCal's network connectivity for its oil industry customers occurred on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. On that day Dan-Air replaced BA's service on the Gatwick-Aberdeen route with an improved schedule - including more flights, all of which were operated with that airline's BAC 1-11 jet aircraft. (Aberdeen's local business community, which was dominated by the oil industry, depended on a fast and frequent link to London Gatwick to be able to make connections at that airport with long-haul flights serving other important oil industry centres such as Houston, Lagos and Tripoli, which were all served by BCal at the time. However, BA had begun replacing the Aberdeen-based 1-11 it was using to operate its early-morning schedule to Gatwick with a Vickers Viscount turboprop at the start of the 1978 summer timetable period because the 1-11 was apparently required to operate another regional BA route from Heathrow. The substitution of the 1-11 with the Viscount considerably increased the non-stop flying time between Aberdeen and Gatwick because of the turboprop's lower cruising speed compared with the jet it replaced. As a consequence, by the time the Viscount reached Gatwick, most of the onward, long-haul connecting flights had already departed, thereby rendering this service useless for the Aberdeen business community. They therefore backed a lobbying campaign initiated by Dan-Air who were prepared to take over this service, offering an expanded jet schedule of up to three return flights per day at times that suited the requirements of the business community and ensured they could connect to/from other services at Gatwick with ease. This resulted in an application to the CAA to transfer BA's Gatwick-Aberdeen licence to that airline, which - following a successful hearing - the CAA agreed to do.)</p>
<p>Brymon Airways' takeover of BCal's regional, domestic Gatwick-Birmingham schedule, which it operated at an increased frequency of up to three daily return flights using an 18-seat Twin Otter, furthermore contributed to enhancing BCal's overall network connectivity during that period.</p>
<p>However, BCal also suffered a few setbacks during 1979. These included continuing frustration of the airline's desire to launch scheduled services to Scandinavia despite the conclusion of a new Anglo-Scandinavian bilateral air services agreement and the temporary grounding of the airline's widebodied fleet - then comprising three McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s - during the second quarter following the crash of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_flight_191_1533.html" title="American Airlines flight 191">American Airlines flight 191</a>, a DC-10-10, in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> during May of that year. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>As far as the former was concerned, the new air services agreement the UK had negotiated with Denmark, Norway and Sweden during December 1978 contained an important clause that effectively restricted the provision of scheduled services on trunk routes from/to London to BA and SAS, thereby continuing to prevent BCal from using the licences the CAA had awarded it the year before. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> (As a concession to the UK Government's desire to develop Gatwick as an alternative international gateway airport serving London, SAS agreed to transfer its twice-daily London-<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stavanger.html" title="Stavanger">Stavanger</a> service and one of its daily London-Copenhagen services from Heathrow to Gatwick as well as to launch a brand-new, daily Gatwick-<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aarhus.html" title="Aarhus">Aarhus</a> route at the start of the 1979 summer timetable period. BA agreed to launch a daily Gatwick-<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm.html" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> service at the same time. BCal's senior management described the then new Anglo-Scandinavian air agreement as a real "can of worms".)</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, the grounding of the worldwide DC-10 fleet in the aftermath of American's May 1979 Chicago crash necessitated the short-term lease of another 747 to enable BCal to provide adequate capacity on its Nigerian trunk routes during that period. BCal also operated a Dan-Air Comet on short-term lease between Gatwick and Tripoli while the 707s normally used on that service were redeployed to operate a reduced schedule to Houston and South America during the aforesaid period. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another setback BCal suffered at the time was the CAA's decision to turn down the airline's application to extend its existing Gatwick-Lusaka service to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harare.html" title="Harare">Harare</a> (then still called Salisbury) from the start of the 1980 summer timetable period and instead to approve BA's rival application to begin serving the <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwean.html" title="Zimbabwean">Zimbabwean</a> capital from Heathrow via <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johannesburg.html" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_in_1979_639a.html" title="Edit section: Launching a new widebodied aircraft">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Launching a new widebodied aircraft</span></h4>
<p>In 1979 BCal became the European launch customer for the Airbus A310 when the airline placed a firm order for three A310-200s plus an option on another three aircraft. <sup id="_ref-risk369_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk369" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_Industrie_ea94.html" title="Airbus Industrie">Airbus Industrie</a> had offered BCal a generous discount as an independent launch customer who ran its business along commercial lines and was not depending on any government's financial backing. It thought that this would significantly enhance the new widebody's sales prospects in the US, the largest and most important market for large, commercial aircraft in the world.</p>
<p>Two of the aircraft BCal had on firm order were to be delivered during the spring of 1984 while the remaining aircraft was to be delivered during the autumn of that year. <sup id="_ref-risk369_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk369" title="">[6]</a></sup> BCal chose <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/_/GE_f803.html" title="GE">GE</a>) CF6-80 engines to power its A310s. <sup id="_ref-risk369_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk369" title="">[6]</a></sup> These aircraft were intended to replace BCal's remaining, aging and increasingly fuel-inefficient 707 narrowbodies on higher volume medium-haul routes, primarily Gatwick-Tripoli, as well as on "thin", long-haul routes to West and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Africa_7a65.html" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a>.</p>
<p>In the event, only two aircraft were delivered. In addition to replacing BCal's 707s on the North, West and Southern African routes, the airline also used these twin-engined widebodies on its <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> services - chiefly Gatwick-<a href="../../../r/i/y/Riyadh.html" title="Riyadh">Riyadh</a>, for which it had subsequently obtained a licence. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> During the summer period BCal's A310s occasionally operated peak-time services on the Gatwick-Charles de Gaulle route on week days and on Gatwick-<a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey.html" title="Jersey">Jersey</a> on week-ends as well.</p>
<p>However, both aircraft only had a short career with BCal. They were sold during the mid-1980s following the loss of the highly profitable Libyan routes. (At the time BCal's senior management decided that these aircraft no longer suited its requirements and chose to standardise the airline's widebodied fleet on the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Boeing 747, respectively. <sup id="_ref-risk530_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk530" title="">[8]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Following the aircraft's sale to a company based in Hong Kong, BCal became the subject of a major controversy involving both the UK and the US governments when Western <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence.html" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a> sources discovered both aircraft in Libya - minus their engines. <sup id="_ref-risk530_1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk530_1" title="">[9]</a></sup> In spite of the imposition of international sanctions denying Libya access to anything <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_tech.html" title="High tech">high tech</a> - including commercial airliners, their powerplants and systems - at that time, these aircraft had somehow managed to reach there via <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. <sup id="_ref-risk530_1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-risk530_1" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Caledonian_in_1979_639a.html" title="Edit section: A helicopter subsidiary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A helicopter subsidiary</span></h4>
<p>In 1979 BCal established <b>British Caledonian Helicopters</b> as a wholly owned subsidiary headquartered in Aberdeen as a result of purchasing <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferranti.html" title="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> Helicopters.</p>
<p>BCal's decision to set up its own helicopter subsidiary at Aberdeen, the leading North Sea oil industry centre, at a time when North Sea oil production was in full swing was driven by the airline's desire to cash in on the North Sea oil boom. It was also part of a strategy to offer a seamless service to the oil industry as an extension of BCal's contemporary "linking the oil capitals of the world" <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_strategy.html" title="Corporate strategy">corporate strategy</a>. BCal felt vindicated in its decision to launch a helicopter subsidiary when the price of a barrel of crude oil had reached an all-time high in the aftermath of the second global oil price shock of the 20th century triggered by the Shah of Iran's fall from power in 1979.</p>
<p>However, the airline decided to sell off its helicopter unit in 1987 as a result of its growing financial difficulties as well as the steep decline in oil-related business due to the collapse of the oil price in the mid-'80s.</p>
