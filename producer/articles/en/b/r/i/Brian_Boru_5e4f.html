<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boru_5e4f.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Brian Boru was likely born in 941, although some sources place his birth as early as 926. He was born near <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killaloe%2C_County_Clare_11d3.html" title="Killaloe, County Clare">Killaloe</a>, a town in the region of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomond.html" title="Thomond">Thomond</a> where his father, Cenn-tig (Cennétig macLorcáin), was king.</p>
<p>When Brian's father died, the kingship of Thomond passed to his older brother, Mathgamain, and when Mathgamain was killed in 976, Brian replaced him. Subsequently he became the King of the entire kingdom of <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a>. His mother <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/b/B%C3%A9binn.html" title="Bébinn">Bé Binn</a> was also killed by <a href="../../../v/i/k/Vikings.html" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> when he was a child.</p>
<p>By 1002 Boru had forced the reigning <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_King_of_Ireland_05c4.html" title="High King of Ireland">High King of Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/e/M%C3%A1el_Sechnaill_mac_Domnaill_ba7c.html" title="Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill">Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill</a>, to surrender his title to him. Boru sought to make good that title in a way that previous holders of the title of High King had not; to make himself the actual ruler of Ireland rather than in name only. By 1011 all of the regional rulers of Ireland recognised him as their superior, this however was short lived. The following year the King of the province of <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> rebelled against Brian's authority and, although his forces were decisively defeated in 1014 at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Clontarf_13ed.html" title="Battle of Clontarf">Battle of Clontarf</a>, Boru was killed along with most of the leaders of the province of Munster. He is buried in the grounds of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral%2C_Armagh_%28Church_of_Ireland%29_783d.html" title="St. Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a> in the city of Armagh (currently <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Ireland_72de.html" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>). Legend dictates he is buried at the north end of the church.</p>
<p>The origin of his <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognomen.html" title="Cognomen">cognomen</a> Boru or Boruma (Tributes) is believed to relate to a crossing point on the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Shannon_1493.html" title="River Shannon">river Shannon</a> where a cattle-tribute was driven from his <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sept.html" title="Sept">sept</a>, the <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/l/D%C3%A1l_gCais_8632.html" title="Dál gCais">Dál gCais</a> to the larger sept to which they owed allegiance, the <a href="../../../e/%C3%B3/g/E%C3%B3ganachta.html" title="Eóganachta">Eóganachta</a>. Later legends originated to suggest that it was because he collected monies from the minor rulers of Ireland and used these to rebuild <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monasteries</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">libraries</a> that had been destroyed during <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norsemen.html" title="Norsemen">Norsemen</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a>) invasions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boru_5e4f.html" title="Edit section: The Dál Cais">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Dál Cais</span></h3>
<p>Brian Boru belonged to the <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/l/D%C3%A1l_Cais_dcb4.html" title="Dál Cais">Dál Cais</a> (or Dalcassians) who occupied a territory straddling the largest river in Ireland, the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Shannon_1493.html" title="River Shannon">River Shannon</a>, a territory that would later be known as the Kingdom of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomond.html" title="Thomond">Thomond</a> and today incorporates portions of counties <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Clare_1390.html" title="County Clare">Clare</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Limerick_f64c.html" title="County Limerick">Limerick</a>. The Shannon served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the province of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connacht.html" title="Connacht">Connacht</a> (to the river's west) and Meath (to its east). Both Brian's father, Cennétig mac Lorcáin and his older brother Mathgamain conducted river-borne raids, in which the young Boru would undoubtedly have participated. This was probably the root of Brian's appreciation for <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy.html" title="Navy">naval forces</a> in his later career.</p>
<p>An important influence upon the Dalcassians was the presence of the <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno-Norse_1b64.html" title="Hiberno-Norse">Hiberno-Norse</a> city of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> on an island in the estuary of the Shannon River (known today as <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Island%2C_Limerick_15ad.html" title="King's Island, Limerick">King's Island</a>). Undoubtedly the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick and the Dalcassians frequently came to blows, but it's unlikely that the relationship was always one of hostility; there was probably peaceful contact as well, such as trade. The Dalcassians may have benefited from these interactions, from which they would have been exposed to Norse innovations such as superior weapons and ship design, all factors that may have contributed to their growing power.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boru_5e4f.html" title="Edit section: Mathgamain">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mathgamain</span></h3>
<p>In 964, Brian Boru's older brother, Mathgamain, claimed control over the entire province of Munster by capturing the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_of_Cashel_acd4.html" title="Rock of Cashel">Rock of Cashel</a>, capital of the rival Eóganacht dynasty. The Eóganacht King, Máelmuad mac Brain, organised an anti-Dalcassian alliance that included at least one other Irish ruler in Munster, and Ivar, the ruler of Limerick. At the Battle of Sulchoid a Dalcassian army led by Mathgamain and Boru decisively defeated the Hiberno-Norse army of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> and, following up their victory, looted and burned the city. The Dalcassian victory at Sulchoid may have led Máelmuad to decide that deception might succeed where an open contest of strength on the battlefield had failed. In 976 Mathgamain, attended what was supposed to be a peaceful meeting for reconciliation, where he was seized and murdered. It was under these unpromising circumstances that Brian, at age thirty-five, became the new leader of the Dalcassians.</p>
<p>Brian immediately set about avenging his brother's death and reinstating the control of the Dalcassians over the province of Munster. In quick succession, Brian attacked and defeated the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick, Máelmuad's Irish allies, and finally, Máelmuad himself. Boru's approach to establishing his control over the Munster demonstrated features that would become characteristic of all of his wars: he seized the initiative, defeating his enemies before they could join forces to overwhelm him, and although he was ruthless and horribly brutal by our standards, he sought reconciliation in the aftermath of victory rather than continuing hostility. After he had killed both the ruler of Limerick, Ivar, and Ivar's successor, he allowed the Hiberno-Norse in Limerick to remain in their settlement. After he had killed Máelmuad, he treated his son and successor, Cain, with great respect, giving Cain the hand of his daughter, Sadhbh in marriage. Cain remained a faithful ally for the rest of his life.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boru_5e4f.html" title="Edit section: Extending authority">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Extending authority</span></h3>
<p>Having established unchallenged rule over his home Province of Munster, Brian then turned to extending his authority over the neighboring provinces of <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> in the east and Connacht in the west. By doing so, he came into conflict with High King <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/e/M%C3%A1el_Sechnaill_mac_Domnaill_ba7c.html" title="Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill">Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill</a> whose power base was the Province of <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meath.html" title="Meath">Meath</a>. For the next fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King Máel Sechnaill repeatedly led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, like his father and brother before him, led his naval forces up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath on either side of the river. Brian suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but he appears to have learned from his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career; the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland's coast. Brian's naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control, provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where King Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a strategic pincer, the army forming the other arm.</p>
<p>In 996 Brian finally managed to control the Province of <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a>, which may have been what led Máel Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. By recognising King Brian's authority over 'Leth Moga', that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), Máel Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over 'Leth Cuinn', that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connacht.html" title="Connacht">Connacht</a>, and <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>.</p>
<p>Precisely because he had submitted to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by Máelmorda mac Murchada. Given the circumstances under which Máelmorda had been appointed, it is not surprising that he launched an open rebellion against King Brian's authority. In response, King Brian assembled the forces of the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by Máelmorda's ally and cousin, <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigtrygg_Silkbeard_e0ad.html" title="Sigtrygg Silkbeard">Sigtrygg Silkbeard</a>. Together Mael Máelmorda and Sigtrygg determined to meet King Brian's army in battle rather than risk a <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a>. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the Battle of Glen Mama. The <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annals.html" title="Annals">Annals</a> all agree that this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had in the aftermath of the Battle of Sulchoid thirty-two years before, by capturing and <a href="../../../l/o/o/Looting.html" title="Looting">sacking</a> the enemy's city. Once again, however, Brian opted for reconciliation; he requested Sigtrygg to return and resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, just as he had with the Eoganacht King, Cain. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg's mother and Máelmorda's sister <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gormflaith.html" title="Gormflaith">Gormflaith</a>, the former wife of Máel Sechnaill.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boru_5e4f.html" title="Edit section: The struggle for Ireland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The struggle for Ireland</span></h3>
<p>King Brian made it clear that his ambitions had not been satisfied by the compromise of 997 when, in the year 1000, he led a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army in an attack on High King <a href="../../../m/%C3%A1/e/M%C3%A1el_Sechnaill_mac_Domnaill_ba7c.html" title="Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill">Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill</a>'s home Province of Meath. The struggle over who would control all of Ireland was renewed. Máel Sechnaill's most important ally was the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Connacht_4079.html" title="King of Connacht">King of Connacht</a>, Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg (O'Connor), but this presented a number of problems. The Provinces of Meath and Connacht were separated by the Shannon River, which served as both a route by which King Brian's naval forces could attack the shores of either province and as a barrier to the two rulers providing mutual support for each other. Máel Sechnaill came up with an ingenious solution; two bridges would be erected across the Shannon. These bridges would serve as both obstacles preventing King Brian's fleet from traveling up the Shannon and as a means by which the armies of the Provinces of Meath and Connacht could cross over into each others kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Annals state that, in the year 1002, Máel Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about how or why this came about. The <i>Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh</i> provides a story in which Brian challenges High King Máel Sechnaill to a battle at the <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_of_Tara_05aa.html" title="Hill of Tara">Hill of Tara</a> in the Province of Meath, but the High King requests a month long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. But Máel Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian. This explanation is hardly credible, given Brian's style of engaging in war; if he had found his opponent at a disadvantage he would certainly have taken full advantage of it rather than allowing his enemy the time to even the odds. Conversely, it is hard to believe, given the length and intensity of the struggle between Máel Sechnaill and Brian, that the High King would surrender his title without a fight.</p>
<p>Where that fight may have occurred and what the particular circumstances were surrounding it we may never know. What is certain is that in 1002 Brian Boru became the new High King of Ireland.</p>
<p>Unlike some who had previously held the title, Brian intended to be High King in more than name only. To accomplish this he needed to impose his will upon the regional rulers of the only Province that did not already recognise his authority, <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>. Ulster's geography presented a formidable challenge; there were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the Province, and all three favored the defenders. Brian first had to find a means of getting through or around these defensive '<a href="../../../c/h/o/Choke_point.html" title="Choke point">choke points</a>', and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal which, considering he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed Brian to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. But gaining entry to the Province of Ulster brought him only halfway to his goal. Brian systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boru_5e4f.html" title="Edit section: Emperor of the Irish">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Emperor of the Irish</span></h3>
<p>It was during this process that Brian also pursued an alternate means of consolidating his control, not merely over the Province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the Christian Church in Ireland was centered, not around the bishops of <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocese.html" title="Diocese">diocese</a> and archbishops of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdiocese.html" title="Archdiocese">archdiocese</a>, but rather around <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monasteries</a> headed by powerful abbots who were members of the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armagh.html" title="Armagh">Armagh</a>, located in the Province of Ulster. It is recorded in the '<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Armagh_52a3.html" title="Book of Armagh">Book of Armagh</a>' that, in the year 1005, Brian donated twenty-two ounces of gold to the monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland to which all other monasteries should send the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King. Therefore, it was in the interest of Armagh to support Brian with all their wealth and power. It is also interesting that Brian is not referred to in the passage from the 'Book of Armagh' as the 'Ard Ri' – that is, High-King – but rather he is declared "<i>Emperatus Scottorum</i>," or "Emperor of the Irish."</p>
<p>Though it is only speculation, it has been suggested that Brian and the Church in Ireland were together seeking to establish a new form of kingship in Ireland, one that was modelled after the kingships of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, in which there were no lesser ranks of regional Kings – simply one King who had (or sought to have) power over all. In any case, whether as High King or Emperor, by 1011 all of the regional rulers in Ireland acknowledged Brian Boru's authority. Unfortunately, no sooner had this been achieved than it was lost again.</p>
<p>Máelmorda mac Murchada of Leinster had only accepted Brian's authority grudgingly and in 1012 rose in rebellion. The <i>Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh</i> relates a story in which one of Brian's sons insults Máelmorda, which leads him to declare his independence from Brian's authority. Whatever the actual reason was, Máelmorda sought allies with which to defy the High-King. He found one in a regional ruler in Ulster who had only recently submitted to Brian. Together they attacked the Province of Meath, where the former High King Máel Sechnaill sought Brian's help to defend his Kingdom. In 1013 High King Brian led a force from his own Province of Munster and from southern Connacht into Leinster; a detachment under his son, Murchadh, ravaged the southern half of the Province of Leinster for three months. The forces under Murchadh and Brian were reunited on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">9 September</a> outside the walls of Dublin. The city was blockaded, but it was the High King's army that ran out of supplies first, so that Brian was forced to abandon the siege and return to Munster around the time of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>Máelmorda may have hoped that by defying Brian, he could enlist the aid of all the other regional rulers Brian had forced to submit to him. If so, he must have been sorely disappointed; while the entire Province of Ulster and most of the Province of Connacht failed to provide the High King with troops, they did not, with the exception of a single ruler in Ulster, provide support for Máelmorda either. His inability to obtain troops from any rulers in Ireland, along with his awareness that he would need them when the High King returned in 1014, may explain why Máelmorda sought to obtain troops from rulers outside of Ireland. He instructed his subordinate and cousin, Sigtrygg, the ruler of Dublin, to travel overseas to enlist aid.</p>
<p>Sigtrygg sailed to <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney_Island_9a67.html" title="Orkney Island">Orkney Island</a>, and on his return stopped at the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>. These islands had been seized by the Vikings long before and the Hiberno-Norse had close ties with <a href="../../../o/r/k/Orkney.html" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>. There was even a precedent for employing Norsemen from the Isles; they had been used by Sigtrygg's father, <a href="../../../o/l/a/Olaf_Cuaran_dbe3.html" title="Olaf Cuaran">Olaf Cuaran</a>, in 980, and by Sigtrygg himself in 990. Their incentive was <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loot.html" title="Loot">loot</a>, not land. Contrary to the assertions made in the <i>Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh</i>, this was not an attempt by the Vikings to reconquer Ireland. All of the Norsemen, both the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norse-Gaels_1b44.html" title="Norse-Gaels">Norse-Gaels</a> of Dublin and the Norsemen from the Isles, were in the service of Máelmorda. It should also be remembered that the High King had 'Vikings' in his army as well; mainly the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick (and probably those of Waterford, Wexford, and Cork as well), but also, according to some sources, a rival gang of Norse mercenaries from the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>Essentially this could be characterised as an Irish civil war in which foreigners participated as minor players.</p>
<p>Along with whatever troops he obtained from abroad, the forces that High King Brian mustered included the troops of his home Province of Munster, those of Southern Connacht, and the men of the Province of Meath, the latter commanded by his old rival Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill. He may have outnumbered Máelmorda's army, since Brian felt secure enough to dispatch a mounted detachment under the command of his youngest son, Donnchad, to raid southern Leinster, presumably hoping to force Máelmorda to release his contingents from there to return to defend their homes. Unfortunately for the High King, if he had had a superiority in numbers it was soon lost. A disagreement with the King of Meath resulted in Máel Sechnaill withdrawing his support (Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad and ask him to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late). To compound his problems, the Norse contingents, led by <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigurd_Hlodvirsson_724d.html" title="Sigurd Hlodvirsson">Sigurd Hlodvirsson</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Orkney_0f1a.html" title="Earl of Orkney">Earl of Orkney</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brodir.html" title="Brodir">Brodir</a> of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, arrived on <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Sunday_ff40.html" title="Palm Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>, the <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">18 April</a>. The battle would occur five days later, on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Friday_4f29.html" title="Good Friday">Good Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The fighting took place just north of the city of Dublin, at <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clontarf%2C_Dublin_1802.html" title="Clontarf, Dublin">Clontarf</a> (now a prosperous suburb). It may well be that the two sides were evenly matched, as all of the accounts state that the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Clontarf_13ed.html" title="Battle of Clontarf">Battle of Clontarf</a> lasted all day. Although this may be an exaggeration, it does suggest that it was a long, drawn-out fight.</p>

<p>The popular image of Boru - as a ruler who managed to unify the regional leaders of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> so as to to free the land from a 'Danish' (<a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a>) occupation - originates from the powerful influence of a work of 12th century propaganda, <i>Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh</i> (The War of the Irish with the Foreigners) in which Boru takes the leading role. This work is thought to have been commissioned by Boru's great-grandson, <a href="../../../m/u/i/Muirchertach_Ua_Briain_b8b2.html" title="Muirchertach Ua Briain">Muirchertach Ua Briain</a> as a means of justifying the Ua Briain (O'Brien) claim to the High-Kingship, a title upon which the Ui Neill (O'Neill) dynasty had had a monopoly.</p>
<p>The influence of this work, on both scholarly and popular authors, cannot be exaggerated. Up until the 1970s most scholarly writing concerning the Vikings' activities in Ireland, as well as the career of Brian Boru, accepted the claims of <i>Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh</i> at face value. Most popular authors, though often relying on older books as source material, continue to perpetuate a mythical version of Boru's career.</p>
<p>Boru did not free Ireland from a Norse (<a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a>) occupation simply because it was never conquered by the Vikings. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, beginning in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterford.html" title="Waterford">Waterford</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/x/Wexford.html" title="Wexford">Wexford</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork</a>. Within only a few generations, the Norse citizens of these cities had converted to Christianity, inter-married with the Irish, and often adopted the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish language</a>, dress and customs; thus becoming what historians refer to as the '<a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno-Norse_1b64.html" title="Hiberno-Norse">Hiberno-Norse</a>'. Such Hiberno-Norse cities were fully integrated into the political scene in Ireland, long before the birth of Brian Boru. They often suffered attacks from Irish rulers, and made alliances with others, though ultimately came under the control of the kings of the Provinces of <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meath.html" title="Meath">Meath</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a>, or <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a>, who chose those among Hiberno-Norse who would rule the cities, subservient to their loyal subordinates. Rather than conquering Ireland, the Vikings, who initially attacked and subsequently settled in Ireland were, in fact, assimilated by the Irish.</p>

<li>The descendants of High King of Ireland Brian Boru were known as the Ua Brian (O'Brien) clan, hence the surnames O'Brien, O'Brian, Ó Briain, etc. "O" was originally Ó which in turn came from Ua (originally hUa), which means "grandson", or "descendant" of a named person. The prefix is often incorrectly written as O', using an English apostrophe instead of the Irish fada mark.</li>
