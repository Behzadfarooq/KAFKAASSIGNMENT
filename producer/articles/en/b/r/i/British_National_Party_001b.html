In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_2005_e0e0.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 2005">2005 general election</a>, the British National Party received 0.7% of the popular vote.</p>
<p>According to its constitution,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> the BNP "stands for the preservation of the national and ethnic character of the British people and is wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples." The party is "committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948." Accordingly, the BNP proposes "firm but voluntary incentives" to remove non-Whites from the UK,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> advocates the repeal of all anti-discrimination legislation, and restricts party membership to "Indigenous <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">Caucasians</a>."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The BNP is often described as racist and fascist.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The party states that they are merely standing up for the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white</a> British <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a>. The BNP believes that there are patent, inherent racial differences that go beyond skin color and appearance and therefore describes its supporters as "realists".<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The BNP is marginalised by mainstream political parties, and has been criticised by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cameron_8722.html" title="David Cameron">David Cameron</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menzies_Campbell_5339.html" title="Menzies Campbell">Sir Menzies Campbell</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-fascism.html" title="Anti-fascism">Anti-fascist</a> magazines such as <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searchlight_Magazine_ecca.html" title="Searchlight Magazine">Searchlight</a> and organisations such as <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unite_Against_Fascism_c354.html" title="Unite Against Fascism">Unite Against Fascism</a> dedicate a substantial portion of their efforts to denouncing the party.</p>

<p>The modern BNP has its roots in the New National Front, founded in 1980 by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyndall_%28politician%29_8d7b.html" title="John Tyndall (politician)">John Tyndall</a>, a former chairman of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Front_%28UK%29_1189.html" title="National Front (UK)">National Front</a> (NF). Tyndall was a member of the 1960s <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_%281960s%29_c21c.html" title="British National Party (1960s)">BNP</a>, and he was chairman of the NF for most of the 1970s. Following the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1979_73bc.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">1979 general election</a>, Tyndall was heavily criticised after the NF's strategy of nominating a large number of candidates appeared to have failed. He resigned from the NF in January 1980 after failing to oust its national organiser, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Webster_17d0.html" title="Martin Webster">Martin Webster</a>. The New National Front called for an "Anglo-Saxon Alliance" of the UK, Germany and the USA.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="1980s"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="Edit section: 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1980s</span></h3>
<p>In 1982, the New National Front and a faction of the then-disintegrating <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Movement_9c8c.html" title="British Movement">British Movement</a> led by <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Hill_61a6.html" title="Ray Hill">Ray Hill</a> merged to form the new British National Party. Tyndall was elected leader and Hill became his deputy, with much of the early funding provided by Tyndall's father in law <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Parker_%28UK_politician%29_c306.html" title="Charles Parker (UK politician)">Charles Parker</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> The launch was announced in a press conference in the spring, and on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_24.html" title="April 24">April 24</a>, the party had its inaugural march in London.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> At its first general election, in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983_c3e4.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983</a>, the party sponsored 53 candidates, three more than was required to obtain a Party Election Broadcast on television. The broadcast went out on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a> and consisted of Tyndall, flanked by two <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Jacks</a>, speaking to camera. Images of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brixton_riot_%281981%29.html" title="Brixton riot (1981)">Brixton riot</a> were shown as Tyndall's speech attempted to encourage nationalism over racism - one observer noted that the "emphasis was less heavily anti-black... than the [National] Front's".<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> The giving of television time to the BNP was controversial and was debated on <i><a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_Reply_4e6b.html" title="Right to Reply">Right to Reply</a></i> on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>.</p>
<p>During the campaign Tyndall stated that the only significant differences between the BNP and the National Front lay in the fact that his party would bar homosexuals from high office, and that he was hopeful the two could reunite.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The party's candidates won 14,621 votes: it was noted that the BNP's average vote was less than the National Front and that in the two constituencies where both stood, the NF was clearly more popular.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> However, unknown to the party, Ray Hill was actually working for the anti-fascist group <i>Searchlight</i> and observers have suggested that the party's relatively low profile in its early years may have been related to his sabotage.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The increase in the deposit required of Parliamentary candidates hindered the party during the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1987_8979.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1987">1987 elections</a> when it received 553 votes having put up 2 candidates. However, the party formed some strong international links.</p>

<p>After some financial troubles, the party's national headquarters were established at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welling.html" title="Welling">Welling</a> in south-east London in 1989, above a bookshop operated by the party. In the early 1990s, the party saw a growth in popularity mainly in London and the urban <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_East_England_f096.html" title="South East England">south east</a>, and especially in the borough of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets_8d1f.html" title="London Borough of Tower Hamlets">Tower Hamlets</a> in the inner East End where increasing immigration from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in an area of housing pressure led it to campaign for "Rights for whites" (a campaign directed by <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddy_Butler_f1ac.html" title="Eddy Butler">Eddy Butler</a>). At two local council by-elections in 1990, the party came in third, and on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">October 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> the party won 20% of the vote in the Millwall ward.</p>
<p>A second by-election in Millwall in September 1993 saw a renewed BNP campaign to take the seat. The party obtained its first councillor, <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Beackon_a2da.html" title="Derek Beackon">Derek Beackon</a>, with a majority of seven votes.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> Although Beackon was able to achieve little on the council before the full council elections (in which he lost his seat, after anti-fascist campaigners flooded the area), the by-election win led to a great increase in publicity for the party. The party headquarters site increasingly became a venue for anti-fascist protesters who frequently linked its presence to racial crimes in the surrounding area.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> A near-riot ensued on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">October 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> when the police forced a 15,000 anti-BNP protest march to change its route away from outside the party building (31 people were arrested and nineteen police officers injured).<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Their slogan during this period was "Defend Rights for Whites".<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Griffin_3b7e.html" title="Nick Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> joined the BNP in 1995. In 1999 he replaced Tyndall as BNP leader after a leadership election. Once elected Griffin began a programme of modernising the BNP's image, dropping the policy of the compulsory repatriation of non-whites and replacing it with a "firm encouragement" for "voluntary" repatriation.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 2002 local elections, the BNP gained 3 seats in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnley.html" title="Burnley">Burnley</a> and averaged 20% of the votes where it stood councillors. The party was accused, however, of exploiting the high tensions in areas that had recently undergone racially-motivated riots.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Increasing electoral success led to increased scrutiny from the press. In <i>The Secret Agent</i>, a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> documentary broadcast on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, filmmaker <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Gwynne_d6de.html" title="Jason Gwynne">Jason Gwynne</a> went undercover and joined the BNP for six months. His secret filming recorded party leader Nick Griffin calling Islam a "wicked, vicious faith"; party member Steve Barkham confessing to assaulting an Asian man in the 2001 <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford_Riot_afb2.html" title="Bradford Riot">Bradford Riot</a>; ex party member Stewart Williams stating that he wanted to "blow up" <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford.html" title="Bradford">Bradford</a>'s mosques with a rocket launcher; and council candidate Dave Midgley confessing to pushing dog faeces through the letterbox of an Asian takeaway, a claim denied by the proprietor. In his speech, Griffin also stated that "For saying that, I tell you, I will get seven years if I said that outside", referring to the maximum sentence for the criminal offence of <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incitement_to_racial_hatred.html" title="Incitement to racial hatred">incitement to racial hatred</a>. The day after the documentary was broadcast, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclays_Bank_8776.html" title="Barclays Bank">Barclays Bank</a> froze, then suspended, the BNP's bank accounts.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> The BNP's response to the programme was that it had featured "the loudest and most hot-headed BNP activists [who] were deliberately plied with drink and subject to suggestive provocation". In the wake of the documentary, the party expelled Barkham and Midgley (but not Williams). Griffin did not apologise for his own comments, stating that "it's still not illegal to criticise Islam". He and BNP member <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Collett_eed1.html" title="Mark Collett">Mark Collett</a> were subsequently prosecuted for incitement to racial hatred, of which they were found not guilty.

The increase in support for the BNP was notably demonstrated by a poll released by YouGov, a British polling firm, that indicated that the BNP vote had surged to 7% in the wake of media attention, a more than tenfold increase over the previous general election.<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=4Y4JMTFDWR4INQFIQMFCFGGAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2006/04/21/npoll21.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/04/21/ixportaltop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=4Y4JMTFDWR4INQFIQMFCFGGAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2006/04/21/npoll21.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2006/04/21/ixportaltop.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>A <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouGov_c387.html" title="YouGov">YouGov</a> poll in April 2006 found that the majority of Britons agreed with many BNP policies, when unaware they were associated with the BNP. 59% supported the halting of all further immigration, and average support for the BNP propositions cited in the poll among those who did not know they belonged to the BNP was 55%. However, there were also certain BNP propositions which were strongly opposed by those polled, including non-white citizens being inherently "less British", and the party's policy of encouraging the "repatriation" of ethnic minorities. Support also fell among those who were told that the policies were those of the BNP.<a href="http://yougov.com/archives/pdf/omi060101069_1.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://yougov.com/archives/pdf/omi060101069_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_5.html" title="May 5">May 5</a>, 2006, the results of the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_local_elections%2C_2006_ba9d.html" title="UK local elections, 2006">2006 local elections</a> were reported by the BBC and showed a dramatic increase for the BNP. The party presented about 350 candidates, of which 33 were initially declared to be winners and a further 70 were placed second: the second highest gain of any party in the elections. This more than doubled the number of seats held by the BNP (before the elections, the BNP was estimated to have held about 20 local political seats). Also noteworthy is the fact that the constituency of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Barking_and_Dagenham_323b.html" title="London Borough of Barking and Dagenham">Barking and Dagenham</a> became, according to many newspapers, the first council in the United Kingdom to have the BNP as the second-biggest party <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4974870.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4974870.stm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. However, the BNP were briefly the second largest party on Burnley Council in 2003.</p>
<p>Critics of the BNP, however, said that the voters were simply punishing the unpopular Labour Party, rather than expressing an increased interest in supporting the BNP; they also noted that the party's gains leave it with 53 out of over 20,000 councillors in the UK, a very low proportion.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="Edit section: Local government">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Local government</span></h3>
<p>Like other minority parties in the UK, the majority of the BNP's electoral success has come in local government elections. The BNP's first electoral success came in September 1993, when <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Beackon_a2da.html" title="Derek Beackon">Derek Beackon</a> was returned as councillor for <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millwall.html" title="Millwall">Millwall</a> (in London) on a low turnout. He lost his seat in further elections the next year, although his personal vote actually increased by 30% (on a turnout of 70%). The Millwall seat was the Party's only electoral victory in John Tyndall's seventeen year reign as leader.</p>
<p>In the council elections of May 2002, three BNP candidates gained seats on <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnley.html" title="Burnley">Burnley</a> council. This was interpreted in some quarters as an indicator of the mood of the British electorate. The BNP had fielded 68 candidates nationwide. In the council elections of May 2003, the BNP increased its Burnley total by five seats, thus briefly becoming the second-largest party and official opposition on that council, a position it narrowly lost soon afterwards after the resignation of a BNP councillor who had been disciplined by the party after unruly behaviour at the party's annual 'Red, White and Blue' festival. The BNP lost the subsequent by-election to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_%28UK%29_9480.html" title="Liberal Democrats (UK)">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p>
<p>During these 2003 elections, the BNP contested a record 221 seats nationwide (just under 4% of the total available). They won eleven council seats in all, though Nick Griffin was unsuccessful in his attempt to gain a place on <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldham.html" title="Oldham">Oldham</a> Metropolitan Council. In some areas, such as <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderland.html" title="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>, it contested all wards and failed to get a seat; in others areas such as <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex%2C_England_d78d.html" title="Essex, England">Essex</a>, parts of the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Country_1da1.html" title="Black Country">Black Country</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28region%29_e8bd.html" title="West Midlands (region)">West Midlands</a> and in <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertfordshire.html" title="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> it gained council seats.</p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_Election%2C_2004_%28UK%29_85b2.html" title="European Parliament Election, 2004 (UK)">2004 elections to the European Parliament</a>, the BNP had stated that it believed it could win "between one and three seats" in the 2004 <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_a87a.html" title="European Parliament">European Parliamentary</a> elections. In fact, although their share of the vote increased to 4.9% (placing them as the sixth biggest party overall), they failed to win a single seat. The Party also hoped to pick up an increased share of the vote in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_West_England_127e.html" title="South West England">South West</a> of England, where its strongly <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurosceptic.html" title="Eurosceptic">eurosceptic</a> policies were believed to be most popular. However, in that region it gained only 3.0% of the vote <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2004/euro_uk/html/36.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2004/euro_uk/html/36.stm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. Given that parties with other lower total percentages of the vote, but a higher regional concentration of support, gained seats <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2004/vote_2004/default.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2004/vote_2004/default.stm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, their lack of a geographical stronghold can be seen as a disadvantage against the party.</p>
<p>Many researchers have put the electoral successes of the BNP down to voters' casting a 'protest vote' against the perceived incompetence of local councils, and disillusionment with the mainstream parties, rather than as positive support for the BNP's policies <a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/natarch/x-bnp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/natarch/x-bnp.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>The party's biggest election success was a gain of 51.9% of the vote in the Goresbrook ward of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barking.html" title="Barking">Barking</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">16 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. However, the turnout was just 28.8%, and the councillor Daniel Kelley retired just 10 months later, claiming that he had been an outcast within the council. A new election was held on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">23 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, in which this time the Labour candidate gained 51% of the vote, and the BNP came second with 32%. <a href="http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/9-democracy/elections/results/elect-by-goresbrook-05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/9-democracy/elections/results/elect-by-goresbrook-05.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>The BNP claims that the mainstream media in the UK do not mention BNP policies, or make reference to statements made by the BNP, though this assertion ignores their level of support nationally.</p>
<p>Due to campaigning from anti-fascist groups, the BNP has encountered difficulties finding a company prepared to print their monthly publication <i>Voice of Freedom</i> <a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/freedom/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/freedom/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. The Party acquired a printing press in the run up to the 2005 general election, thereby removing its dependency on external printing houses. In September 2005, 60,000 copies of <i>Voice of Freedom</i>, which had been printed in <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovakia.html" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, were seized by British police at Dover.

When asked in 1993 if the BNP was racist, its deputy leader <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Edmonds_7bd2.html" title="Richard Edmonds">Richard Edmonds</a> said, "We are 100 per cent racist, yes".<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> Founder John Tyndall proclaimed that "<a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> is my bible".<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11375,1028498,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11375,1028498,00.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></p>
<p>When <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Griffin_3b7e.html" title="Nick Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> became Chairman in 1999, however, the party began to change its stance with regard to racial issues. Griffin claims to have repudiated racism, instead espousing what he calls "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_nationalism.html" title="Ethnic nationalism">ethno-nationalism</a>". He claims that his core ideology is "concern for the well-being of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ethnic nations that compose the United Kingdom"<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p>The BNP publicly disavows any interest in white supremacy. Its detractors argue that its definition of white supremacy as the "wish to rule over foreign peoples", is too narrow. The BNP requires that all members must be members of the "Indigenous Caucasian" "racial group" <a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/resources/constitution_8ed.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/resources/constitution_8ed.pdf" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. The party does not regard non-white people as being British, even if they have been born in the UK and are British citizens. Instead, Griffin has stated that 'non-Europeans who stay', while protected by British law, 'will be regarded as permanent guests'<a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/articles/race_reality.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/articles/race_reality.htm" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>.</p>
<p>Race is still important to the BNP’s understanding of nation and identity. The BNP is opposed to mixed-race relationships on the stated ground that racial differences must be preserved; it argues that when a white person produces a mixed-race child, "a white family line that stretches back into deep pre-history is destroyed." The party does however have a half Turkish half British councillor in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Rustem_8ee5.html" title="Lawrence Rustem">Lawrence Rustem</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this in 2006, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharif_Abdel_Gawad_8883.html" title="Sharif Abdel Gawad">Sharif Abdel Gawad</a>, a grandson of an Armenian refugee was chosen as a council candidate in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford.html" title="Bradford">Bradford</a>.

"Mr Gawad fulfilled the BNP criteria of being "a member of the white European race of people", they affirmed). <a href="http://news.monstersandcritics.com/uk/article_1153806.php/BNP_at_odds_over_asylum_candidate" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.monstersandcritics.com/uk/article_1153806.php/BNP_at_odds_over_asylum_candidate" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>
<p>Nick Griffin describes his views on race as follows: "... while the BNP is not racist, it must not become multi-racist either. Our fundamental determination to secure a future for white children is restated, and an area of uncertainty is addressed and a position which is both principled and politically realistic is firmly established. We don't hate anyone, especially the mixed race children who are the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism, but that does not mean that we accept <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscegenation.html" title="Miscegenation">miscegenation</a> as moral or normal. We do not and we never will." Griffin's use of the phrase "secure a future for white children" seems to allude to the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_nationalism.html" title="White nationalism">white nationalist</a> "<a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourteen_Words_fbe7.html" title="Fourteen Words">Fourteen Words</a>".</p>

<p>The party states that "The BNP has moved on in recent years, casting off the leg-irons of conspiracy theories and the thinly veiled anti-Semitism which has held this party back for two decades.

<dd>We bang on about Islam. Why? Because to the ordinary public out there it's the thing they can understand. It's the thing the newspaper editors sell newspapers with. If we were to attack some other ethnic group — some people say we should attack the Jews ... But ... we've got to get to power. And if that was an issue we chose to bang on about when the press don't talk about it ... the public would just think we were barking mad. They'd just think oh, you're attacking Jews just because you want to attack Jews. You're attacking this group of powerful Zionists just because you want to take poor Manny Cohen the tailor and shove him in a gas chamber. That's what the public would think. It wouldn't get us anywhere other than stepping backwards. It would lock us in a little box; the public would think "extremist crank lunatics, nothing to do with me." And we wouldn't get power.</dd>

<p>Explaining the BNP's stance, BNP Press Officer Phil Edwards stated that homosexuality "is unnatural" and "does not lead to procreation but does lead to moral turpitude and disease". Thus, alongside the suggestion that "it undermines social/marital cohesion by adding confusion", the BNP would make it unlawful to promote homosexuality and "return it to the closet where it belongs".<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[54]</a></sup> The BNP are particularly worried about the possibility of homosexuality being promoted in <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">schools</a>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the run-up to the 2005 general election it was reported that Richard Barnbrook, then the BNP candidate for Barking, had produced and directed a homoerotic student art film in 1989. The story was picked up by the mainstream press after the 2006 local elections, when Barnbrook a councillor and the BNP's <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> leader.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[56]</a></sup> Although some portrayed this as gay <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, Barnbrook and the BNP claimed that the film was artistic, and about "sexuality, not homosexuality"<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this, some members of the BNP have shown hostility to homosexuals. For example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Collett_eed1.html" title="Mark Collett">Mark Collett</a>, former chairman of the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_BNP_8c68.html" title="Young BNP">Young BNP</a>, described homosexuals as "AIDS Monkeys", "bum bandits" and "faggots" and said the idea of homosexuality was a "sickening thought".<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>

<p>Historically the BNP has been associated in the public mind with violent protest and clashes with anti-BNP organizations. Critics of the BNP assert that a significant minority of elected BNP politicians have criminal records and that the party is more tolerant of the criminal actions of some of its members than other parties would be.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence in furthering the party's aims. After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote: "The electors of Millwall did not back a postmodernist rightist party, but what they perceived to be a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate." In 1997, believing he was addressing members of the French <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Front_%28France%29_9962.html" title="National Front (France)">Front National</a>, he said: It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers." <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,783675,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,783675,00.html" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> In January 1986, when Griffin was Deputy Chair of the NF, he advised his audience at an anti-<a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_cef2.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> rally to use the "traditional British methods of the brick, the boot and the fist."<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The BNP defends itself by arguing that over 20% of the working population has some criminal record or another and that a large proportion of MPs, councillors and activists in the other three main parties are hardly in many cases a shining example either.</p>
