	    <p>I would just like to state that I feel the "citation needed" on helps conceal erections is... ridiculous. Every male who has ever worn briefs and also, at some point, has worn traditional boxers can state that this is true. Also, the typical material used to construct briefs intrinsically will help hold in "Mr Happy" when he gets playful, which should be obvious to everyone with a moment's thought. Do we really need a citation to "prove" the bleeding obvious? Just an observation, no disrespect to anyone is intended... I just think that "citation needed" is sometimes used a bit over-zealously and in rather unnecessary places, this being one of them. 12.216.229.177 06:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In regards to both sperm quality as well as skinn rashes and other heat related issues. Breifs has always been to blame. But since no there is a company that solved this problem. FriGo Ltd ( I think..) They have made a very simple and effective solution, separating the genitals from the rest of the body, just put the genitals in the ventilated pocket, and a cooler and healtier sensation will occur. FriGo comes, as far as I know in breifs, trunks and boxers.</p>
<p>These are tested and aproved for underwear, swimwear and sportswear. Militaries are testing as well as hospitals. The least important for most of us, but not to forget FriGo entertains the user ( and his closest ) by cosmetical favours, such as increasing the looks. A whole lot.</p>

<p>Because, when the pouch is warm, it's sagging out. When using this FriGo, the pouch contracts, as if you were naked outside at wintertime. This make things look more presentable, to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the comfort they provide, that realy matters. Because, when the pouch is warm, it's sagging out.

<p>Odd that there's no mention of this popular myth. Does anyone know if there is any truth to the story that briefs can cause lowered sperm counts? I'm watching an episode of Seinfeld about it right now! As a fellow whose boys need a house, I'm somewhat concerned! 24.62.27.66 23:11, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's just an old wives' tale -- I don't have a source for that handy, but everything I've seen says that <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamdaly620_a833.html" title="User:Liamdaly620">Liamdaly620</a> 00:59, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is not just an old wives' tale. Research has demonstrated that if a man wears <i>tight-fitting</i> briefs for an extended period, his sperm count will decrease. It is theorized that this will occur because the temperature inside the scrotum will increase by a few degrees, which will inhibit the production of sperm. This makes sense, as the temperature inside the scrotum has to be somewhat lower than inside the rest of the body; that is why the scrotum was designed as an outpocketing of the body wall, so that the sperm could be manufactured and stored at a temperature slightly lower than inside the body. However, if I recall correctly, the effect is reversible, when tight underwear is replaced by looser ones. That is, it is tight briefs which lower sperm count, not briefs per se. Particularly if the briefs are made of a non-porous material, like a synthetic nylon, etc., which used to be non-breathable, and kept the scrotum at an even higher temperature. Today's wickable fabrics like microfiber etc. have eased this difficulty somewhat; I'm not certain, tho'. 66.108.4.183 08:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC) Nash's Companion</dd>

<li>I've read about such research too in a Flemish quality newspaper, but also that later studies came up with the inverse result; as neither was reported with a statistically significant test group, I fear definitive results aren't yet abailable; and possibly the explanation just doesn't make sense without some third factor. <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 08:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is white really the most common colour in the US? While I don't have any surveys or sales figures to back me up, I would say based on the availability and other factors that darker colours are more common here in NZ. This isn't that surprising to me since darker colours reduce the visibility of staining... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 21:34, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added United States to the trivia:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>In the 1990s, briefs were seen as uncool in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, especially among teenagers. In cartoons, usually the victims of <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedgies.html" title="Wedgies">wedgies</a> wore "tighty whities."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have no idea whether the above is true but I think we can safely true it wasn't universally true. Perhaps it was in much in the Western world or the anglophile world or something (although I doubt that) but it seems unlikely it was true in large parts of the world <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 21:38, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
