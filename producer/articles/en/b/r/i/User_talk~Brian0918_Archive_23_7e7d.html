<dd>When they're on the talk page, I focus on the interest of the fact, not its grammar. That can easily be fixed once its being finalized. When I update, I usually check the grammar before submitting the new entries. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-16 02:03</small>

<dd>OK, makes sense, but still, try to make all your fixes in one pass instead of 6, please, it clutters the history up badly. Makes it harder to find the last pic to unprotect sometimes... I'm not sure I agree that 4000 needed to be 4,000 in this particular case though... more importantly I have a larger concern with changing more than just grammar, like you did for that ruminant and the scent gland. That again is something that should have been corrected while it was a nom, in my view, if it mattered that much. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:08, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, just so you know, editing a template that is included on the main page is not a problem. The main page is only one page, and it only has to be regenerated that one time. Editing a template that is included on thousands of pages, like a stub template, is much worse, because those thousands of pages all have to be regenerated (I just checked with a dev to make sure). But the dev said neither are a problem. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-16 02:10</small></dd>

<dd>Already knew that, thanks. I'm referring to the amount of real change visible in one page of the history for the template. 6 small edits in a row means less real change visible.

<p>It's been changed recently, but in a very biased way. There was a treaty between all the jews of Medina and and Muhammed formed in 622, and the current version of the article doesn't mention it at all, citing <i>The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book,</i> which probably doesn't mention it either. The treaty was broken in 623 with each side accusing the other of treachery -- which again, the current version of the article omits, but earlier versions covered. I think you've been trolled. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicola_d78a.html" title="User:Publicola">Publicola</a> 06:26, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed they are:
<ul>
<li><i>Saturnalia</i> i.7
<ul>
<li>Is that the "saturnalia" entry in one of the ref, a book title, a classic work? Same for all otehr similar entries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Pisonem. 4; Ascon. l.c.
<ul>
<li>This one looks like a classicalwork, but the abbreviation of the author's anme makes it impossible for the layman to know who it is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Am I mistaken in saying you are giving the same references as Smith? I don't think that is necessary. I think these refs use a system that is explained somewhere in the book itself (e.g. for abbreviations and "standard" titles), but in Wikipedia becomes simply impossible to understand. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">Circeus</a> 23:39, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brian!</p>
<p>I believe the News section on the Main Page of the English Wikipedia has an omission today... Maybe if you read this in time, it could still be fixed. I have put a little piece about this in the News Items on the Main Dutch Page as well. Here's the English translation of what I wrote there... Something along these lines should be carried by the English version too, I believe...:</p>

<dd>It is not necesary to fix things while the update is in progress. It's rude and causes errors and wasted communication.

<dd>It's not just that, Brian, it's your whole approach to editing. That whole ordering thing really demonstrated it nicely... you made a change without checking for consensus first, fought tenaciously against reverting it back in the teeth of everyone else saying you needed to do it, that it was a bad change, and that it was the wrong way to do things, all the time refusing to admit that you had done anything wrong and when finally, someone else did your cleanup for you, your attitude was "oh gee, it doesn't matter, you all are wrong but whatever". Totally not the right way to be collegial. When I review your other contributions to the DYK process, in many (but not all) cases, the same pattern emerges. Really, I strongly ask you to change your approach, admit that you're sometimes incorrect, and when you are, make amends instead of ignoring the messes you caused, and discuss things in a way that appears less abrasive. I've asked around and I'm by far not the only person that reads your words and finds them offputting. Not just on DYK, mind you, but that's the part of the site I wanted to be able to edit that caused me to want to be an admin in the first place, so it's the part I care about most, and you're just making it a lot less pleasant, and I wish you'd change your approach. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 20:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm talking about a pattern of behaviour here, and so the different actions are indeed related, they are part of a pattern. As for the quotes around "oh gee, it doesn't matter, you all are wrong but whatever"... that is how I (and others) interpreted your words, the quotes were a setoff, not an intent to quote you, since I said "your attitude" not "your words". I would dispute that you properly dealt with that ordering incident, admitting your mistake but refusing to undo it is not collegial.

Even Britannica Encyclopedia has a much better version. A novice reader has the right to know the story from both sides. If you can do something in this regard, it will be very much appreciated.

<p>Good evening. You recently speedy-deleted this userpage as a copyvio. I have to admit I suspected that as well but could not find anything that was an obvious copyvio. I found a few similar pages but they appeared to be released by the original author and did not appear to me to violate GFDL. Can I ask where you found the copyvio?</p>
<p>By the way, I still think this was deletable. I'm just not sure it was <i>speedy-</i>deletable.

<p>While I empathise with your suggestion, what choice do I have with all these DYK candidates becoming stale by the time of next update?

<dd>Once you make a relaxation to the 5-day limit, there is no end to it. As it is, updating admins are accused of favoritism many-a-time. I know as I've been at DYK updation much longer and earlier than you. My reading of the situation is that there has been a pile-up not because of too many suggestions but because the admins couldn't get round to updating DYK. btw, I deleted the image you c-uploaded for the last update - you didn't add the attribution information to the image page while uploading; please do so in future as instructed on {{<a href="../../../c/-/u/Template%7EC-uploaded_423e.html" title="Template:C-uploaded">C-uploaded</a>}}.

<dd>btw, just to stress that I felt that the noms were diverse. In fact my only worry about balance was that the update was more of art and music (3 entries). I actually looked at it as one on science, one from Russia, one from America (sculptor), one from music and one from Christianity in East (Siam=Thailand).

<p><i>"(rv personal attack; leave it on his talk page if you want to criticize my every move. do you have my talk page on your watchlist, or my contribs page?)"</i> I watch this page, as with many other talk pages of editors I interact with, because I have started conversations here, more than once, so watching for replies (I prefer threads kept together) is natural, hope that explains it. I have no issue with others participating in conversations on my page when they have something to say that's relevant, which I thought my comment was. However I don't believe I've ever had a comment reverted, so clearly we're at loggerheads here, it's not my desire to <i>ever</i> say anything that is taken as a personal attack, and I apologise if you took it that way, and for giving offense...</p>
<p>To the point though... you're saying you don't like having your every move criticised? That's a sentiment I strongly share, I do not like having my every move criticised either.. I'm sorry if you think I'm too critical of you and your actions. I think you're too critical of my actions as well. I'll go further, I'd like to try to see if we can all come to some understanding that results in your being less critical of others as well as others being less critical of you. I'll be on IRC tonite, perhaps we could chat directly, you and I, as a starting point? <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It seems like every single page I edit, you're right behind me with a snide remark.

You'd think with your 25 years of professional experience you'd learn how to interact with people in a civilized way and not resort to ad hominem nonsense.

<dd>Guys, please cool it - you are both mature individuals with great track record on WP. May I make a suggestion? Lar has decided that he'll no longer update his DYK noms to the template. The objective I guess, is to show that there is no conflict of interest. This would have been a bad idea if only one admin were updating DYK (like I was doing for a couple of months or Peta was doing before me). Now that we have at least 3 regular admins updating DYK (both of you and Catus.man have been doing a decent job) with part-timers chipping now and then, I think this suggestion makes immense sense. I wish you guys make up. May I take the liberty to propose that Brian do the next update with Kar's photo suggestion on Artrain making it to the top? We will resolve remaining issues of the updation process etc. in due course of time. All of us have erred however minute in this situation, now let's extricate ourselves from this mess with grace. We as admins are supposed to be role-models for others. Please ignore my message if it has offended either of you and let me unconditionally apologise in advance.

<p>Sorry, I didn't know where to go with this, I'm not the best Wikipedian in the world. You put up an article of mine for deletion (but did not carry out the final deletion action(?)), back in December, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/YouThink.com" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/YouThink.com" rel="nofollow">YouThink.com</a>. I have rewritten the article so that it is more clear that it isn't an advertisement (because that was not its purpose), and the facts that it has more than 270,000 members, as well as the Links section of the site (I-Am-Bored.com domain name) has an Alexa rank in the 2000s, which are at least two requirements that make it an acceptable Wikipedia article (which it only needs one, I believe). I don't really need the article un-deleted, because I've already written it over and all.. so I wasn't sure if I had to go through the formal undeletion procedure (which confuses me just a little), or if I could just put it back up? Thank you for help if you give it to me. <a href="../../../e/g/y/User%7EEgyptianSushi_9de4.html" title="User:EgyptianSushi">EgyptianSushi</a> 09:10, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
