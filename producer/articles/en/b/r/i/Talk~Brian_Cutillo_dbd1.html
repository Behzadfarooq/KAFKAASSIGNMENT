<p>sorry for the delay -- This is my first WIKIPEDIA entry and I am learning the process.</p>
<p>This is original material based upon my friendship with Brian Cutillo for 35+ years. However, I believe all material is properly referenced and I have faithfully followed the WIKIPEDIA guidelines as to verifiability, no original research, and neutral tone.</p>
<p>The cognition section was written with the assistance of Dr. Gevins. All other writing was by myself.</p>
<p>I personally possess the original editions of all the out-of-print publications and I scanned the book covers. I also took the photographs of the textiles.</p>
<p>The references come from just knowing where to look -- I personally visited the Hopi reservation with Brian, visited Geshe Wangyal with Brian many times, etc.</p>
<p>I will take the 'cut and pasted' comment as a compliment. Jem bac 12:58, 14 December 2006 (UTC)jem_bac</p>

<dd>Ah, just so you know, Wikipedia discourages <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. You will likely need to source many of the statements in the article more specifically. See the <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citation guidelines</a> for examples. Anything based <i>only</i> on your personal knowledge of the subject should be removed. Also, when other editors add tags, please don't simply remove them. This article is not up to style standards (sorry, I don't have a link). The thing about tags is that the put the article in a "cleanup category" which will attract other editors more familiar with policy and style guidelines to improve the article. If you remove the tag, you prevent that from happening. I may drop by later to make improvements but don't have time now, thus the tag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another point, please don't add a link to this article from <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_Buddhism_3b98.html" title="Tibetan Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</a>, the relation is too distant. If every lama and teacher can't be listed there, why should this individual. I will look at putting him into the proper categories so he can be found, but please don't promote the article in loosely related articles. Every article is subject to scrutiny, and if the <i>deletionists</i> think the subject is insufficiently notable, attempts to promote the article may be used against you to support deleting the article. Sorry to have to tell you that WP works this way, but it does.&#160;:-( <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 03:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Sir -- I will delete several refereces that could be considered based on 'personal information.' The rest I believe are fully documented. I may choose to add them back at a later date with further documentation. I will leave the clean-up tag just as I notice you have left the clean-up tag on your entry.</p>
<p>This is my first entry. I am just learning the WIKIPEDIA style. As far as being 'insufficiently notable', a 'Brian Cutillo'search on Google retruns 14,500 results. First you said that it appears that I have 'cut and pasted' this from somewhere else. Now you say it is possibly not notable and too much based on personal knowledge. I did not think that I was 'promoting' the article, just that it might become known to those unfamiliar with Mr. Cutillo. I now know better. Also, the clean-up tag says that this article MAY require clean-up not providing any specific sugggestions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am doing my best to meet <i>ALL</i> WIKIPEDIA requirements. This article was only posted a week or so ago. I notice that your article has been tagged "This article or section does not cite its references or sources" since July 2006. Jem bac</p>

<dd>Thanks for your understanding. I'm trying to explain clearly and not simply <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">BITE</a>. Feel free to contact me on my <a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">talk page</a> if you need any help with Wikipedia policies or other users. It can take a whle to learn the ropes here. Oh, and by the way, it's "Miss"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have added now, for the second time, a reference to Milarepa in 'See Also' on the 'Tibetan Buddhism' page. Please, Ms. Ekajati, tell me why you consider 'Milarepa' to be an inappropriate reference but Mo-ho-yen, who is Chinese, is an appropriate reference. Also, please explain why you consider removing 'Milarepa' to be an 'improve to list'. Jem bac 01:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Mr/Ms A Ramachandran: Thank you so much for your assistance. I started this page on 11 December 2006 and it is my first contribution. I am a self-admitted neophyte to WIKIPEDIA. I have restructured the first sentence. I will study your edits -- I was unable to figure out how to get the poetry to work. I now see you have inserted a semi-colon. I also notice that you re-arranged all the graphics. I now have to properly tag the book/book cover images but I have the original editions of all the books mentioned so I do possess all the information requested -- I just have to figure out how to do it properly.</p>
<p>WIKIPEDIA at its best is truly a community effort and I very much appreciate your contribution. Jem bac 06:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)Jem_bac</p>

<dd>You are most welcome. I don't think you need worry about the book covers. Since the books are used as references in the text directly next to the covers, anybody with a lick of sense will find the reference link and thus the publication data. Or they can simply click on the image itself as you have properly put the publication data on the image entry. I do note that you used full-size scans: I think that the common understanding on WP is that use of book covers is fair use as long as they are small, low resolution images. I looked for the proper policy or guideline page, but couldn't find it. You might ask around on <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a>.
