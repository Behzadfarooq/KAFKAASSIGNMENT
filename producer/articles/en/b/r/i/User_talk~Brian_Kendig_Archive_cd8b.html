<p>Sorry, we've not been previously acquainted, (I'm Wally, good to meet you), but do you actually <i>live</i> on the Disney property? Or are you in <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebration%2C_Florida_535d.html" title="Celebration, Florida">Celebration</a>?</p>
<p>This is very weird, I know. But I was reading through the Disney articles (I'm a Florida native of a sort myself) and when I saw that on your user page my eyes got big as saucers.&#160;:P <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:59, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I figured. &#160;:P I traveled to Celebration once - the place scared me to death, I have to tell you. I'm unused to such a level of perfection; it felt like I was in <i>The Stepford Wives</i> or <i>The Truman Show</i>. Especially the latter, lol.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I've always heard that the administration by "Disney forces", if you'd like, are rather heavy-handed and draconian in Celebration, and that the townspeople have comparitively little control over things. Any truth to that?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before I conclude, great job on those Disney articles, and also on the one regarding that woman, can't remember her name, that fell victim to bystander apathy (read that a while ago, but saw you contributed to it). All first rate work. You should consider nominating it for featured article status! <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 19:29, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you very much for the compliments! Maybe I will nominate it, just to see what happens.&#160;:-) As for Celebration, no, the rules aren't draconian - there are rules in place to keep the town looking neat (like, no pink flamingo ornaments on the lawn and no cars up on blocks in the driveway - but all residents are held to them, and they're a good thing. No, we own our own property here, and there's no curfew and no gates on the town. There have been some issues in the past where Disney only allowed stores in the downtown area which sold touristy stuff instead of things residents needed, but those issues are being ironed out as townspeople are being placed on the Celebration Company board. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 23:10, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Just for the record, I like your new edits. Sorry for the heat before, it's just that Windows XP article was <i>very</i> biased before and we only just managed to improve it. Now that you've incorporated many of the edits, I think the article is a lot cleaner and more smooth flowing (if that's the word) than it was before! Incidently, I replied on the talk page. Please don't think I'm being harsh - I can sometimes come across that way through text. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:07, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi Brian, as I said before, I appreciate your good work on the Windows XP article. Could you be a bit more careful with phrases like "though Linux is generally considered to be harder to use and has a smaller variety of software than is available for Windows". Firstly, Linux is considered harder to use for <i>certain things</i>, like GUI configuration. Remote administration through the command line is remarkably easy once you know how. Secondly, there is arguably <i>more</i> software for Linux than Windows. You should really investigate this yourself. This is not an attack on you, by the way, I'm justing pointing a few things out. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 11:51, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Got your message, and I tend to agree. Mind you, I actually agreed with pigsonthewing (however not in the form that he wrote them - I just think I know what he was talking about), but I also understand it's fairly POV to say that Linux has no restrictions. I tightened up the language used to clarify the statement. I hear your frustration though, especially as I can see how much effort you've put into the articles here! pigsonthewing should have really done the rephrasing as it's his sentence, and his refusal to do this or even compromise is kind of bad. Compromise is really how Wikipedia works, after all. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 13:55, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I wonder if it's okey to use the pictures of different <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a> models that you have created and uploaded on the article <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>. I am currently writing an Ipod article on the swedish Wikipedia (<a href="../../../../sv/i/p/o/Ipod.html" class="extiw" title="sv:Ipod">sv:Ipod</a>), and need more pictures.

<p>Hi Brian. On your user page you wonder why prohibiting commercial use of your images isn't allowed on Wikipedia. The short answer, that I'm sure you've gotten before, is that it isn't allowed under the terms of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, which prohibits additional restrictions beyond those in the GFDL itself. Specifying the restriction of non-commercial use makes the license you release your images under incompatible with the GFDL, and as such cannot be used on Wikipedia. Jimbo Wales, founder of Wikipedia, has requested that such images <a href="../../../p/o/s/Wikipedia%7EPossible_copyright_infringements_9deb.html#Instructions_for_special_cases" title="Wikipedia:Possible copyright infringements">not be uploaded to Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>I also notice however that several of your more recent uploaded images are released under the GFDL. I was wondering if this indicated a change in your stance on this issue. If so, would you be willing to relicense your earlier images under the terms of the GFDL?

<p>Am I correct in assuming that you're not using the default Wikipedia UI skin? Because the image alignment bug you're describing, IIRC, affects some of the other available skins, but not the default MonoBook skin, which automatically "stacks" right-aligned images vertically, rather than horizontally. The end result is that the "clear: all" break leaves a very, very large amount of empty space smack dab in the middle of the article for the vast majority of Wikipedia users, equal to the height of all three images. The basic problem, of course, is that there's just not enough text to comfortably align so many pictures, but, in lieu of just getting rid of some of them, I've thrown in a right-floating div that should force vertical arrangement of the images. On the other hand, if that still presents a problem (or if I've misinterpreted your complaint), the best solution would seem to be to move all of the images to the end of the text, in a miniature screenshot gallery or something of the sort, not forcing a clear, which is a very messy, brute-force way of fixing things, and looks, well, <i>really</i> bad on my end of things. โ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 01:45, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Heh, no problem. It was one of those things I found out by accident: when I first started editing Wikipedia (anonymously) a few years ago, the classic skin was then the default, and when I finally started participating seriously I went to change it since I was the most familiar with it, which led me to notice the difference in rendering. I think the MonoBook default stacking is a better way of doing things, but it creates serious problems when it comes to keeping everything looking consistent. โ <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 16:11, Apr 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The template bunches up in the sense that it squishes the width without:</p>
<p>From</p>
<p>|aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|<br />
|aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>|aaaaaaaaaaaaaa|<br />
|aaaaaaaaaaaaaa|<br />
|aaaaaaaaaaaaaa|</p>
<p><br />
This looks rather bad in terms of formatting, and makes the page unnaturally longer. It might have something to do with the fact on templates, links become bold when put on the page they refer to...but there's no reason why it should make itself so small. There's a similar problem on the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Template%7EShaw_bfe1.html" title="Template:Shaw">Template:Shaw</a> page. If a width isn't set <i>there</i>, it looks like this:</p>
<p>|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|<br />
|aa|</p>
<p>You can imagine how ridiculous that looks on a template with over thirty plays listed. In other words, I'm not sure what can be done about this. There may be some piece of wiki coding that could resolve this, but it's not known to me yet...I'm sure we can figure this out though. What would you suggest (aside from what you've already suggested)?</p>

<dd>We'll always luv ya for doing that, We've been bothered by the lack of a good picture for some time. Heidi's health has kept us away for a couple of years from a place that we frequented once or twice a year since 1987. Anyways, as the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney%27s_Contemporary_Resort_36df.html" title="Disney's Contemporary Resort">Contemporary</a> is where we were married (1992-before the pavilion), and where we <i>always</i> stayed (after that first time in '87, she wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else). Anyway, we noticed that the pics on the article didn't show the iconic A-frame feature. We have our own pics but the're not on digital format (poor old us), so getting them uploaded to <i>Wikipedia</i> would take some doing. I was gonna do it anyway but then happened across you today and thought <i>what the hell</i>, lets see if <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian</a> can do it for us.

<p>Hello again Brian. I don't quite know how to deal with the latest edits by <a href="../../../c/s/a/User%7ECsaribay_061f.html" title="User:Csaribay">Csaribay</a> about the refurbishing going on. They seem non-encyclopedic (if thats a word) and more like an essay. Anyway, as always, your edits (or comments) are welcomed.

<p>Hey there. I'm pleased to let you know that, consensus being reached, you are now an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator</a>! You've volunteered to do housekeeping duties that normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops can't do a lot of stuff: They can't delete pages just like that (except patent nonsense like "aojt9085yu8;3ou"), and they can't protect pages in an edit war they are involved in. But they can delete random junk, ban anonymous vandals, delete pages listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> (provided there's a consensus) for more than one week, protect pages when asked to, and keep the few <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected pages</a> that exist on Wikipedia up to date.</p>
Almost anything you can do can be undone, but please take a look at <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_how-to_guide_237e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide">The Administrators' how-to guide</a></b> and the <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">Administrators' reading list</a></b> before you get started (although you <i>should</i> have read that during your candidacy ;). Take a look before experimenting with your <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">powers</a>.

<p>Thank you for your comments. And I will browse other articles however my focus is keeping the article on VMK accurate. The articles has many errors and misinformation, however I do not yet have the time to go through and edit everything. The Space Mountain Guest Room is not officially listed however it is coming, along with several other rooms and costumes. Many players are updating biased opinions and personal feelings about the game into the article.

The quick version of the installation procedure for admins is to paste the following into User:Brian Kendig/Archive/monobook.js:</p>
<pre>
// [[User:Lupin/popups.js]] - please include this line 

document.write('&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="'

<p>brian, thank you very much for your help, taking charge &amp; calming things down with this little dispute. as of this time, the vote for "leader" is a solid majority (11-6). especially noteworthy, in my opinion, is that all votes for "leader" (except for myself) come from people with no previous involvement in this article (as far as i can tell), whereas 4 of the 6 votes for "ruler" are from the previous gang of reverters. i've been restrained in commenting or editing the article since the self-evident vote, but the same group is at it again, trying to add the same connotative wording that most reasonable people think is wrong. can you just get them to respect the citations &amp; the poll, or should i take this to mediation or arbitration? i know it seems silly, but it's the whole pattern &amp; grip that has to be broken, to make wikipedia what it was meant to be. thanks again for taking the time.

Please let me know, thank you. --<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeStar_2a7c.html" title="User:LifeStar">LifeStar</a> 22:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>I noticed your proposal to delete <a href="../../../m/i/c/Template%7EMicrosoft_ee58.html" title="Template:Microsoft">Template:Microsoft</a>. In case you had not already seen it, I wanted to ask you to please examine <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Business_and_Economics_Navigation_templates_e8ce.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Business and Economics/Navigation templates">WikiProject Business and Economics/Navigation templates</a>, where navigational templates for companies are collected and listed. I would ask you for which companies, if any, would you support the existence of a navigational template. You may wish to add to your original proposal or make a new one to include the deletion of other corporate navigational templates. I'll be responding to the arguments you've made in favour of deletion at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_e2bf.html" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion">Wikipedia:Templates for deletion</a> instead of here.

<dd>Hi Brian, I've read your comments and I wanted to ask you for clarification on a matter - You've proposed <a href="../../../m/i/c/Template%7EMicrosoft_ee58.html" title="Template:Microsoft">Template:Microsoft</a> for outright deletion, an action that I must interpert as saying that a navigational template based on the current directors/assets/info model does not merit existing for the subject of Microsoft. However, at <a href="../../../n/a/v/Wikipedia_talk%7ENavigational_templates_06ff.html#What_should_be_the_purpose_of_a_navigation_template.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Navigational templates">Wikipedia_talk:Navigational templates</a> you've made comments regarding what should/should not be in or linked to in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisney_9f32.html" title="Template:Disney">Template:Disney</a>, but you're not contesting whether or not the template should exist, you're only questioning its content. Given that the content of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Template%7EMicrosoft_ee58.html" title="Template:Microsoft">Template:Microsoft</a> is equally modifiable, I wanted to ask what makes it deletable, but not <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisney_9f32.html" title="Template:Disney">Template:Disney</a>? Also, I wanted to say that I think the best place for a discussion of the minimum/maximum content of these corporate navigational templates would be at <a href="../../../n/a/v/Template_talk%7ENavbox_Company_e80a.html" title="Template talk:Navbox Company">Template talk:Navbox Company</a>. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurieeto_060a.html" title="User:Kurieeto">Kurieeto</a> 15:24, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You won't find it on materials printed by Disney for the public... you'll find that all TV ADs, all 3rd Party materials, and all international material refers to the park as Magic Kingdom Park. I have called Disneyland 's Press Department and Walt Disney World's, and it is actually illegal to use the term "Magic Kingdom" without the word park on it in a publication that can be accessed outside the United States due to the trademark. That is the reason it is vital to rename the page. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicalbill_2f9b.html" title="User:Magicalbill">Magicalbill</a></p>

<p>Brian, I have been monitoring the Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) article currently listed for deletion. <b>Background:</b> There are several users who may be one in the same, particular <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">user:Ideogram</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> whom have been overly involved in this case. If you look at all the pages involved and the history tabs of these to see how <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">user:Ideogram</a> craftily edits everything to lean one way -- even the comments on the so-called Mediation Cabal in which he was supposed to be the "neutral" mediator in this case! I originally voted to keep the article in some form of compromise, but also to delete it if it cannot be protected because of the endless attacks it has sustained. Then I was personally attacked by <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> on one of the talk pages. Apparently, the above "two" users are not only resorting to cyber stalking, but now the comments are becoming downright libelous on their own user talk pages and on the talk pages of the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28band%29.html" title="Steam (band)">Steam (band)</a> article. It is obvious that the <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> account was created to add to the attack formation based on its creation date, and the contributions which are solely limited to anything connected with or linked to Greg Bravo or Steam. The only time I have ever seen this was when someone had known the subject in real life and had a sworn blood vendetta.</p>
<p><b>Help:</b> Such frequent and flagrant violations of NPOV, <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALKing</a>, no personal attacks Wikpedia:Civility, and a host of other polices by these users remain unbridled and unchecked. How is it that this can be made to stop? This does not seem to be in the spirit of which this organization and site was created. In this case at least, the attacker(s) have even lined up his (their) friends (and/or sockpuppets) to form what amounts to be a vigilante committee or something of that nature and that just isn't right.

<p><b>Hi Brian, and thanks for getting back to me.</b> I would like to give you all of the best examples of what I was talking about, but Iโm afraid that many of them have since been deleted along with the Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) article itself. Some evidence is still around though.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a> was supposed to be a โneutralโ third-party mediator in the case until he was kicked off by one of the article supporters. As a reward, Ideogram easily had him blocked and labeled a โsockpuppetโ because he knows exactly what he is doing. (My advice to anyone is not to try debating on here unless you have supporters and โโreallyโโ know what you are doing.). Anyway, if you will note on this link [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29" rel="nofollow">Articles for deletion page</a>] Ideogram himself voted for deletion of the Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) article that he was mediating. That is not neutral in any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>If you will note here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Steam_%28band%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Steam_%28band%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">Steam (band) talk page history</a>] Ideogram has been overly involved in the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28band%29.html" title="Steam (band)">Steam (band)</a> article, too. It comes as no surprise that so is <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a>. If all users are supposed to maintain a neutral point of view <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>, etc., then why is it that Ideogram seems to encourage the obvious sockpuppet to keep on with the edit war while ignoring any invective from him as he does here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ideogram/Archive_3" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ideogram/Archive_3" rel="nofollow">Ideogram user talk archive</a>] . In that particular instance (and in several others), <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> goes as far as to boldly state that Greg Bravo himself was the perpetrator of some sort of hoax and fraud as can be seen here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Steam_%28band%29&amp;oldid=60933882Steam" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Steam_%28band%29&amp;oldid=60933882Steam" rel="nofollow">(band) talk page</a>] like it was really okay to do that to someone who is apparently the trademark owner of the band. Weโre not about talking attacking an anonymous or fictitious character here. <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">User:Ideogram</a> has also cleverly had every existing page related to the Greg Bravo article semi-protected so that no one can add any comments to them. What would be the point? He only conveniently edits them right out anyway! He does that anytime he doesnโt like what someone has to say. Check this out [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-13_Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29&amp;diff=60522492&amp;oldid=60521719" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-13_Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29&amp;diff=60522492&amp;oldid=60521719" rel="nofollow">Mediation Cabal page</a>]. You can see that even I had to tell him to stop it on the proposed deletion page right here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29" rel="nofollow">Articles for deletion page</a>]. Itโs was like going to circus every time!</p>
<p>You may ask how I have determined that <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">user:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> is a sockpuppet, and that can be determined here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Fortheloveofhampsters" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Fortheloveofhampsters" rel="nofollow">User:Fortheloveofhampsters contribs page</a>]. He is shockingly free with the personal attacks and potentially libelous remarks, and his account was only created after a controversy suddenly erupted -- after years of its existence -- about the now-deleted Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) article in mid June. All Fortheloveofhampsters has done since he has joined Wikipedia is attack anything to do with Greg Bravo or his band, Steam, and edited any related articles to him. He also knows how to manipulate the system as is evidenced here where another administrator can be seen consoling him [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fortheloveofhampsters" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fortheloveofhampsters" rel="nofollow">User:Fortheloveofhampsters talk page</a>].</p>
<p>Because of the close working relationship between <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">user:Ideogram</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> and at one point, <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">User:JLaTondre</a>, these accounts may somehow be interrelated. In addtion, I have observed that a number of those involved here are also involved with Wikpedia mediation and -- Ideogram!</p>
<p>Iโm not sure what a meatpuppet is, but Iโve seen people called this in various articles on here, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">user:Fortheloveofhampsters</a> may be that instead of a sockpuppet. If he is not one of the other involved editors, it sounds like he definitely may know Bravo or Gary DeCarlo (his candidate for who should be labeled lead singer of the band) in real life because he is pushing his own agenda very aggressively. This while repeatedly breaking and ignoring all the rules about neutrality, civility, no personal attacks, credible and verifiable sources, etc. Much of it can still be witnessed on the links, and goes completely unchecked. I would like to note here that in all fairness, I actually tried to look up references listed by <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">User:Fortheloveofhampsters</a>, but they were either unverifiable or are in direct conflict with other credible sources. As you can see, none of that matters because the article was deleted, but they are now working on the second stage with the (Steam (band) band article. - Ronny Stabile - <small>โThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.10.html" title="User:205.188.116.10">205.188.116.10</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.116.10.html" title="User talk:205.188.116.10">talk</a> โข <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.116.10_12d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.116.10">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dl>
<dd>A couple of notes on that:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When you say "a neutral third-party mediator in the case", what "case" are you referring to, exactly? There is no such thing as "mediating" a request for deletion; it's an open forum for opinions on the status of the article, and after the alloted time an admin will decide the page's fate. I don't see how Ideogram had any responsibility to avoid offering his opinion.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Brian, I will try to interject my notes in between your questions. As I said in the beginning, a lot of the good evidence has been deleted, but I had included a link for the Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) Mediation Cabal. In other words (a) there was a mediation case in existence at one point, and Ideogram was the certainly the โneutralโ mediator for that case until he closed the case after getting booted by one of the parties involved in the dispute. My question is if he was so โneutralโ in the first place, why did he vote for deletion?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>From Ideogram's talk page, I don't see him as encouraging the continuation of an edit war, I see him advising another editor not to back down in the face of vandalism. Hampsters appears to be going about the situation properly, giving supporting reasons for his edits and asking for advice on what to do. I don't see anything particularly untoward going on there.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>โHampsters use of inflammatory words like โhoaxโ and other malicious statements made in conjunction with someoneโs real name to defame them, etc. is not IAW Wikipedia policies for obvious reasons. What do you think about that? Do you know that personal attacks of any sort are not allowed? Ideogram should have asked him not to do that or edited these type of remarks out instead of saying 'I encourage you to keep up the good work!'</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As for <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-06-13_Greg_Bravo_%28Gary_Scott%29_94ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-06-13 Greg Bravo (Gary Scott)">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-06-13 Greg Bravo (Gary Scott)</a>, I don't agree that someone is "conveniently editing out" comments he doesn't like - I see a mediation which was closed with a request to bring the issue to the article talk page in question, and then someone inappropriately tried to continue the discussion on that page after the mediation was closed. It doesn't appear to have been an issue of censorship.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I donโt know, perhaps I was wrong there, but I do see a clearly marked box on the bottom of the page for comments, and that should be allowed whatever the case may be. Itโs like having a two way debate but only one person is allowed to speak while the other is bound and gagged! What is <i>that</i> about?</dd>

<ul>
<li>A meatpuppet, by the way - because you asked - is a real-life person recruited by someone with a point to prove, so that the meatpuppet can stand up for the person's opinions. Another word for it might be "shill".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, that is basically what I said in my remarks on the votes for deletion page. In any event I do not think that it's a good thing!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I would still like clarification on your original statement above: <i>the above "two" users [Ideogram and Fortheloveofhampsters] are not only resorting to cyber stalking, but now the comments are becoming downright libelous on their own user talk pages and on the talk pages of the Steam (band) article.</i> Would you point me to the specific comments to which you refer on these pages?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently certain bitter remarks have been edited out on the Steam (band) talk page in a pitched battle between Ideogram and another user, Cooperstown77, but Ideogram has since stopped replacing them after one or more third parties joined in and made comments about the silliness. If you look at the times, dates, and frequency of Ideogramโs edits they are almost instantaneous, and are made at all hours of the day and night as though they were automatic or there is one ore more persons using his account. When does he sleep? Could this be considered stalking, which is also against Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>? Whatever the case may be, it seems to have gotten a little more civil in the past day or so in any case but who knows?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>What is your goal - what, specifically, would you like to see happen to correct the problems as you see them?</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that is a tough one, Brian. Since the article has already been deleted it would be like beating a dead horse. My only request would have been to unprotect any remaining associated pages to allow anyone concerned to leave final remarks. From what I think you were saying that is not okay, and whatever comments that are already on the related Mediation Cabal page, for instance, will stay protected with no replies allowed regardless of appropriateness. If you ask me it looked like a set up from the beginning, and due to the controversy it should be deleted altogether like the article in the interest of fairness. The Greg Bravo (Gary Scott) mediation cabal page implies that the supporters of the article did something wrong and they cannot even reply to that! Is that fair? I donโt think so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, lastly, in the interests of good faith: would you please let me know what other accounts have you used, and what other names have you gone by, in discussing this issue? Is there a reason that you're using an anonymous account right now? - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 16:52, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is a fair question, and the answer is that (like you) I use my own name. The difference is that I am not really interested in being a registered user or editor on here because I do not want to belong to something that I really cannot commit enough time to in order to do it properly. I just liked the music of the 1960โs and 1970โs, and got to know some of those artists while I was working at some events in a public safety capacity. Those experiences kind of made me feel like part of the scene, and that certain feeling of nostalgia brought me here by following links to Wikipedia and eventually to the article. What I saw looked like a type of lynching in progress, without any real regard for the rules, and I was a bit disturbed by that having always fought for the underdog. I have since seen much worse on a lot of other pages on here, and now figure that this must be Standard Operating Procedure for Wikipedia users regardless of written policies and guidelines that are only loosely enforced (if at all). I only wrote to you because you were the only one involved who seemed to be a voice of reason in unprotecting the Greg Bravo article just before it was deleted.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Itโs all water under the bridge now, but what happens on the Steam (band) article may become interesting. I still say that โHampsters is not legitimate because even Stevie Wonder can see from reviewing his user contributions and history tabs he has done nothing else but obsess about anything Bravo Bravo Bravo la la la. He has an all out vendetta against Bravo for whatever reasons there may be, and he appears to be determined to suppress the musician in anyway he can on here, and who knows where else. Does that seem normal or okay to you? Hey, maybe Iโm wrong, but my experience tells me otherwise. Anyhow, happy Fourth to you, Brian, got to finish packing for a flight departure in the AM!

<p>Somewhat of a belated footnote to the above treatise on how I was conspiring with other editors to bring down a "decent" man, I want you to know how Mr. Bravo has compensated for the fact that his article on Wikipedia was removed.</p>
<p>He is now on MySpace.com, advertising himself as a 37 year old single man. profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=76097970 .

As if it weren't hard enough to believe that he was the 13 year old "one hit wonder" (as he has lied to us on previous websites including Wikipedia), now he is saying that he was an infant when he sang the song "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye". (Well, maybe he sang the Na Na Na Na chorus.)--<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFortheloveofhampsters_b18d.html" title="User:Fortheloveofhampsters">Fortheloveofhampsters</a> 17:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
