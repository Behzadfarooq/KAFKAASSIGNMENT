<p><b>Bristol Harbour</b> is the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbour.html" title="Harbour">harbour</a> in the city of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. The 70 <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">acre</a> (0.28 km²) harbour was created by installing <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canal_lock.html" title="Canal lock">lock gates</a> on a <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tide.html" title="Tide">tidal</a> stretch of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Avon%2C_Bristol_c099.html" title="River Avon, Bristol">River Avon</a> in the centre of the city, giving it the name <b>Floating Harbour</b> as it is not affected by the tides. The harbour branches from the navigable River Avon at <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netham_Lock_c3c6.html" title="Netham Lock">Netham Lock</a> in east Bristol. The first mile of the harbour is the artificial Feeder Canal, the River following its original route. Beside <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Temple_Meads_railway_station_c140.html" title="Bristol Temple Meads railway station">Bristol Temple Meads railway station</a> the harbour rejoins the original route of the Avon and meanders through, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_city_centre.html" title="Bristol city centre">Bristol city centre</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canons_Marsh%2C_Bristol_816a.html" title="Canons Marsh, Bristol">Canons Marsh</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotwells.html" title="Hotwells">Hotwells</a>, where it rejoins the river and flows into the <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Gorge_4df0.html" title="Avon Gorge">Avon Gorge</a>. Between Temple Meads and Hotwells, at a distance never more than one kilometre south of the harbour, the Avon flows through the artificial New Cut, reducing currents and silting in the harbour and preventing flooding.</p>
<p>Bristol Harbour was the original <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_of_Bristol_880b.html" title="Port of Bristol">Port of Bristol</a>, but as ships, and their cargo, increased in size, it has now been largely replaced by docks at <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avonmouth.html" title="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Portbury_Dock_8580.html" title="Royal Portbury Dock">Portbury</a>, 5 km downstream at the mouth of the River Avon. The harbour is now a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourism.html" title="Tourism">tourist attraction</a>, with museums, exhibitions, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">bars</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclubs</a>. Old workshops and warehouses have now largely been converted or replaced by cultural uses, such as the <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnolfini.html" title="Arnolfini">Arnolfini</a> art gallery, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watershed_Media_Centre_bd24.html" title="Watershed Media Centre">Watershed media and arts centre</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Industrial_Museum_0a34.html" title="Bristol Industrial Museum">Bristol Industrial Museum</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/-/At-Bristol_d16f.html" title="At-Bristol">At-Bristol</a> science exhibition center as well as a number of fashionable apartment buildings. Museum boats are permanently berthed in the harbour, including <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel_5402.html" title="Isambard Kingdom Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>'s <a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_Great_Britain_57c4.html" title="SS Great Britain">SS Great Britain</a>, the first iron hulled, propeller driven ocean liner, a replica of the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_%28ship%29.html" title="Matthew (ship)">Matthew</a>, in which <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cabot_6901.html" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a> discovered, in the modern era, North America at what is now known as <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, and a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam.html" title="Steam">steam</a> <a href="../../../t/u/g/Tugboat.html" title="Tugboat">tug</a>, the Mayflower.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Ferry_Boat_5636.html" title="Bristol Ferry Boat">Bristol Ferry Boat</a> operates on the harbour, serving landing stages close to most of the harbour-side attractions and also providing a commuter service to and from the city centre and Bristol Temple Meads railway station. Two other independent ferry companies, Boatsatbristol.com and Number Seven Boat Trips, offer similar services. The Bristol Packet offer regular harbour tours with commentaries, also river cruises up the Avon to Conham, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanham.html" title="Hanham">Hanham</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a> and downstream to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avonmouth.html" title="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a>. The historic vessels of the Industrial Museum, the steam tug Mayflower, firefloat <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyronaut.html" title="Pyronaut">Pyronaut</a> and motor tug John King are periodically operated.</p>
<p>In late July each year, the Bristol Harbour Festival is held, with an influx of interesting boats, for example, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tall_ship.html" title="Tall ship">tall ships</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> vessels and <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifeboat.html" title="Lifeboat">lifeboats</a>.</p>

<p>Bristol grew up on the banks of the Rivers Avon and <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Frome%2C_Bristol_abdc.html" title="River Frome, Bristol">Frome</a>, and since the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a> the rivers have been modified for use as docks, including the diversion of the River Frome into Saint Augustine's Reach.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The River Avon, like the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Severn_0fa3.html" title="River Severn">River Severn</a>, has heavy <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tides.html" title="Tides">tides</a> of about 30 <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_%28unit_of_length%29.html" title="Foot (unit of length)">ft</a> (10 m) between high and low, being easily navigable at high-tide but reduced to a muddy channel at low tide in which ships would often run aground in the Avon Gorge. Many ships were deliberately stranded in the harbour for unloading, giving rise to the phrase "shipshape and Bristol fashion" to describe boats capable of taking the strain of repeatedly being stranded.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Coastal trade was also important with the area called "Welsh Back" concentrating on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trow.html" title="Trow">trows</a> with cargoes from the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_industry_in_Wales_9176.html" title="Slate industry in Wales">Slate industry in Wales</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">stone</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timber.html" title="Timber">timber</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The poor quality of Bristol's docks were causing problems to business so in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1802.html" title="1802">1802</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jessop_bb98.html" title="William Jessop">William Jessop</a> proposed installing a dam and lock at Hotwells to create the harbour. The <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_Sterling_0249.html" title="Pound Sterling">UK£</a> 530,000 scheme was approved by parliament, and construction began in May <a href="../../../1/8/0/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a>. The scheme included the construction of the Cumberland Basin, a large wide stretch of the harbour in Hotwells where the Quay walls and bollards have listed building status.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tidal new cut was constructed from <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netham.html" title="Netham">Netham</a> to Hotwells, with another dam installed at this end of the harbour, the Feeder Canal between Temple Meads and Netham provided a link to the tidal river so that boats could continue upstream to Bath. However, the new scheme required a way to equalise the levels inside and outside the Dock for the passage of vessels to and from the Avon, and bridges to cross the water. Jessop built Cumberland Basin with two entrance locks from the tidal Avon, of width 45 feet and 35 feet, and a junction lock (width 45 feet) between the Basin and what became known as the Floating Harbour. This arrangement provided flexibility of operation with the Basin being used as a lock when there were large numbers of arrivals and sailings. The harbour was officially opened on May 1 1809.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The size of the lock caused problems when the SS Great Britain was launched. Jessop's 45-foot lock could not accommodate Brunel's 48-foot beam SS Great Britain. She was being towed away from her builders to have her engines and interior fitted out on the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Thames_9174.html" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> but unfortunately was fractionally too big to go through. The ship was moored in the Floating Harbour for a year or more before proceeding into Cumberland Basin, with coping stones and lock gate platforms removed from the Junction Lock.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The harbour cost more than anticipated and high rates were levied to repay loans, countering any effect the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates and employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who had already built the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Harbour_Railway_8e0e.html" title="Bristol Harbour Railway">Bristol Harbour Railway</a> (a branch of his <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a>) to make improvements, including new lock gates, a <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dredger.html" title="Dredger">dredger</a> and a sluice gates designed to reduce <a href="../../../s/i/l/Siltation.html" title="Siltation">siltation</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a> ships were getting larger, and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over 300 ft (90 m) reaching the harbour. A scheme to install a much larger lock at Avonmouth to float the entire river and to straighten the sharper bends was dropped after work began on the much cheaper docks at Avonmouth and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portishead%2C_Somerset_878f.html" title="Portishead, Somerset">Portishead</a>.</p>
<p>The present entrance lock was designed by Thomas Howard and opened in July 1873. This has a 62 foot width and is the only entrance lock now in use at the City Docks.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1908 the Royal Edward Dock was built in Avonmouth, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> the large deepwater Royal Portbury Dock was constructed on the opposite side of the mouth of the Avon, making Bristol Harbour redundant as a freight dock. Amey Roadstone Corporation (formerly T B Brown and Holmes Sand &amp; Gravel) sand dredgers worked from Poole's Wharf in <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotwells.html" title="Hotwells">Hotwells</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.

<p>The damming of the river to make the harbour had created new land where the docks maintenance facility was established and remains today. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this was known as the 'Overfall'. By the 1830s the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting so Isambard Kingdom Brunel devised a solution. In place of the Overfall he constructed three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide.
