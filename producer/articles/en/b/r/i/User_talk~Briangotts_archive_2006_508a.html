<p>This article is wrong. The original source of this information - the Encyclopedia Mythica - states that Ak Ana is an Altaic deity, and gives Khanty and Mansi in parenthesis. Well, Khanty and Mansi are not Altaic peoples, and I have never before heard of an Ob Ugrian or Uralic deity with a Turkic name Ak Ana. She may be an Altaic deity, but Khanty and Mansi should not be mentioned here at all. Somebody do sth about it! (Same goes for Kara Khan). --Gene K 20:47, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for replying. I've never personally seen more than one stub notice used on an article before, and I felt that putting a biography stub notice, then two notices about what she did in her life, made them a bit redundant.

<p>Hi, I was just admiring your historical maps, after I stumbled across the one in the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol_Empire_05c7.html" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a> article. In particular, I really liked the whole-world cross-section of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:World_820.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:World_820.png" rel="nofollow">World 820</a>. I'd been trying to put together something similar as part of an animation of the global rise and fall of empires. That project turned out to be very difficult (I never finished anything outside Central America), so I thought I'd ask what techniques and sources you used to put together your map. -- <a href="../../../x/e/r/User%7EXerxes314_1cb4.html" title="User:Xerxes314">Xerxes</a> 19:46, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Xerxes. In response to your query, I use a number of historical atlases, including the old Shepard's, various of the Penguin Atlases, and most importantly Cassesl's Atlas with tis maps by John Haywood (this, for example, was my main source for the world map in 820 CE). I also use some color photocopies I made of a Turkish-language historical atlas I found in the stacks at Harvard's Widener Library (unfortunately, I don't remember the name or publication info, but I may have it at home and will check). If you like I can provide publication info for some of the (in my opinion) better historical atlases.</dd>
<dd>Obviously all the borders are approximations and are hand-drawn either copying from historical maps or by roughly following descriptions in primary or secondary sources that don't actually provide detailed maps of their own. To the extent I'm able, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about any particular map or about the maps in general. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 20:55, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am working on the article about this quite-notable individual. In the future, when you see an article created by someone with thousands of contributions to WP over the years, it might be prudent, as a courtesy, to give a little leeway for editing time instead of slapping on a speedy note less than 60 seconds after the article is first saved. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 19:02, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most articles qualifying for speedy under A7 are caught by "recent changes patrol". As things stand, the article qualifies for speedy deletion as there is no assertion of the importance or significance of the subject. While I do not assert his non-notability, I do assert that notability is not claimed. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 19:05, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your speedy tag was literally less than a minute after the initial article was created and while it was in the process of being created. Generally if I see a newly-created article by a user with thousands of edits under his belt, I let it sit for a little while before coming back to put a delete note on. I find it's best to give long time users the benefit of the doubt in such cases. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 02:07, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>as you may have seen, I have been working on the French version of this article. I have been trying to improve the current map which seemed not that great. You can see <a href="../../../../fr/r/a/d/Image%7ERadhanites_essai.jpg_a460.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Image:Radhanites_essai.jpg">here</a> what I have been doing and the map in the article is <a href="../../../../fr/r/a/d/Radhanites.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Radhanites">here</a>. However, before going further I would need your comments. Basically, I am somewhat confused on the eastern part of the road(s). Basically, I would like to know from which sources you drew the map from. It seems to me that the road which is going from India to China is to low and instead of being on the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk_road.html" title="Silk road">silk road</a> (see this map from the german wikipedia <a href="../../../../de/s/e/i/Bild%7ESeidenstrasse_GMT.jpg_3093.html" class="extiw" title="de:Bild:Seidenstrasse_GMT.jpg">de:Bild:Seidenstrasse GMT.jpg</a>), it's right in the middle of Himalaya. Could you explain where this road is supposed to pass in India/Pakistan (if I am not clear, you can see what is missing on the current map)&#160;?

<p>Hi again, Brian. No set criteria for this sort of thing, so far as I know. When I was removing the AfD template after closing the AfD it just seemed to me that the bibliography and three solid paragraphs about his career made the entry rather more informative than most academic bio stubs.

<p><i>I have reverted your changes to various categories including Category:Moab, Category:Midian, Category:Edom, and others. The category "Torah people" includes both individual people and "peoples" in the sense of ethnic or national groups. Thus it is appropriate to include these various Biblical peoples' categories as subcats even if not every individual item within the subcat is mentioned explicitly in the Torah. Briangotts (Talk) (Contrib) 22:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>In that case, the <b>article</b> Midian or the <b>article</b> Edom should be tagged; but not the category.

<dd>Please respond, otherwise I will assume you agree with my reasoning and then tag the articles with the categroies and untag the categories. I may poll other editors on this, if so, I will link this to the category talk page. Thank you. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 16:31, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>I disagree. Midian is a "Torah people", thus the category should be included. It's not necessary for 100% of the individual items within the category to be expressly mentioned in the Torah. By the same token, Category:Turkic peoples is included in Category:Eurasian nomads, because historically and generally speaking, Turkic people were nomadic and lived in Eurasia. Not every single Turkic nation is currently nomadic.</i> That said, if you wish to poll other members and see what they think, I am not opposed to that course of action. But it should be carried out on as broad a basis as possible (for example, by posting to the Judaism Wikiproject and/or a Bible-studies-related Wikiproject, not just by polling a tiny select group.) Briangotts (Talk) (Contrib) 17:18, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midian.html" title="Midian">Midian</a> is a "Torah people" and that is why the <b>article</b> should be tagged. I do not think that <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabal_al-Lawz_2bda.html" title="Jabal al-Lawz">Jabal al-Lawz</a> is a Torah people (it's actually a place). I agree with you that <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moab.html" title="Moab">Moab</a> is a "Torah people" and that is why the <b>article</b> should be tagged. I do not think that <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemosh-nadab.html" title="Chemosh-nadab">Chemosh-nadab</a> qualifies as a Torah person. At the risk of being redundant; your argument is exactly 100% correct—<b>for the Midianite or Edomite nation <i>as described in their respective articles</i></b>. It is not true that Midian is a proper subset, or even a subset, of Torah people. There exits Torah people who are not Midianites and their exists Midan-related articles (both people and places) that are not Torah-related.</dd>
<dd>However, I think that it would be a good idea to obtain some other comments on this issue. I will be transcribing this to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Category_talk%7EMidian_0944.html" title="Category talk:Midian">category talk page of Midian</a>, with the note that this applies to Edom, etc. as well.

<p>Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.</p>

<p>Hi Brian: I have just placed the following on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Judaism_1a41.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a> <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalom.html" title="Shalom">Shalom</a>, <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<div style="padding:1em;border:1px solid black">
<dl>
<dd>Shalom to everyone: There is presently a very serious phenomenon on Wikipedia that effects all articles. Let's call it "The New Deletionism". There are editors on Wikipedia who want to cut back the number of "low quality" articles EVEN IF THEY ARE ABOUT NOTABLE TOPICS AND SUBJECTS by skipping the normal procedures of placing {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}} tags on the articles' pages and instead wish to skip that process altogether and nominate the articles for a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">vote for deletion (VfD)</a>. This can be done by <i>any</i> editor, even one not familiar with the subject. The implication/s for all articles related to Jews, Judaism, and Israel are very serious because many of these articles are of a specilaized nature that may or may not be poorly written yet have important connections to the general subjects of Jews, Judaism, and Israel, as any expert in that subject would know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Two recent examples will illustrate this problem:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1) See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Zichron_Kedoshim%2C_Congregation_4d2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zichron Kedoshim, Congregation">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zichron Kedoshim, Congregation</a> where a notable Orthodox synagogue was deleted from Wikipedia. The nominator gave as his reason: "Scarce material available on Google, nor any evidence in those results of notability nor any notable size." Very few people voted and only one person objected correctly that: "I've visited this synagogue, know members, and know that it is a well established institution" which was ignored and the article was deleted. (I was unaware of the vote).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2) See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Berel_Wein_cbec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Berel Wein">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Berel Wein</a> where the nominator sought to delete the article about Rabbi <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berel_Wein_8718.html" title="Berel Wein">Berel Wein</a> because: "It looks like a vanity project to me. While he does come up with many Google hits, they are all commercial in nature. The article is poorly written and reads like a commercial to me." In the course of a strong debate the nominator defended his METHOD: "... what better way to do that than put it on an <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a> where people who might know more about the subject might actually see it and comment rather than slapping a {{<a href="../../../n/p/o/Template%7ENPOV_75c8.html" title="Template:NPOV">NPOV</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} template on and waiting for someone to perhaps come across it." But what if no-one noticed it in time and it would have gone the same way as "Congregation Zichron Kedoshim"? Fortunately, people noticed it, no-one agreed with the nominator and the article was kept.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As we all know Googling for/about a subject can determine its fate as an article, but this too is not always a clear-cut solution. Thus for example, in the first case, the nominator saw almost nothing about "Congregation Zichron Kedoshim" on Google (and assumed it was unimportant) whereas in the second case the nominator admitted that Berel Wein "does come up with many Google hits" but dismissed them as "all commercial in nature". So in one case too few Google hits was the <i>rationale</i> for wanting to delete it and in the other it was <i>too many</i> hits (which were dismissed as "too commercial" and interpreted as insignificant), all depending on the nominators' <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> of course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This problem is compounded because when nominators don't know <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> or know nothing about Judaism and its rituals then they are at a loss, they don't know variant <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterated</a> spellings, and compounding the problem even more Google may not have any good material or sources on many subjects important to Jewish, Judaic, and Israeli subjects. Often Judaica stores may be cluttering up the search with their tactics to sell products or non-Jewish sites decide to link up to Biblical topics that <i>appear</i> "Jewish" but are actually missionary sites luring people into misinformation about the Torah and the Tanakh, so while Googling may yield lots of hits they may mostly be Christian-oriented and even be hostile to the Judaic perspective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Therefore, all editors and contributors are requested to be aware of any such attempts to delete articles that have a genuine connection to any aspect of Jews, Judaism and Israel, and to notify other editors</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Please, most importantly, place alerts here in particular so that other editors can be notified</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for all your help and awareness. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:43, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aaand after looking over your interest i have the specific request to do. There is article about the bielski brothers. It is now about the book, instead that over the controversial heroes; Also, for me as a Pole it is hard to write the NPOV version of the article. Bielski's are both heroes and bandits, they saved hundreds of people and yet are remembered as simple bandits by mnay Polish witnesses; maybe you could take a look whether current version of the article is NPOV enough? I think I will abstain from the article for some time. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 13:57, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you didn't bother to answer any of my concerns, but preferred - as you always do - to call your opponents "vandals" and "trolls". Moreover, you invited your buddy to protect the page which he did. For the umpteenth time, you abused your admin tools by using rollback to revert my edits as if they were vandalism and deleting the redirect <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg.html" title="Oleg">Oleg</a> (which had a history of several edits) in order to move <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg_%28name%29.html" title="Oleg (name)">Oleg (name)</a> back there, rather than requests it on <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> as it should have been done.

<p>Hi Briangotts, I removed citations from the article as it was taken from the Jewish Encyclopedia. Thats fine. However, does <i>wikipedia</i> need the citations given by the JE? I'd contend not. As it is, the JE has been credited and anyone seeking further info can go there. Wikipedia has <i>its sources</i> (i.e. here the J.E.), while further down the line wikipedia's sources have <i>their own</i> sources (i.e. the JE's numerous sources). I believe I've conformed to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. It clutters up the article and I've seen many other removals of such citations from other JE-based articles. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoel_Sirkis&amp;diff=52159010&amp;oldid=51883146" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yoel_Sirkis&amp;diff=52159010&amp;oldid=51883146" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
<p>Would you not agree that it would be impractical and bordering on the ridiculous if, apart from every source quoted on wikipedia (e.g. Britannica, Encarta), those sources own sources were quoted?

<dd>Your point is well-taken but I think the example you give is inapplicable. An article might be written that cites to or quotes from an Encarta, Britannica, or other encyclopedia article. I totally agree with you that in such a case, it would be silly to list separately all the sources cited in that article (unless, of course, the source itself was also used in the WP article).</dd>
<dd>I think the situation with JE articles is somewhat different. In many cases, due to the public domain status of the JE, JE articles are copied in their entirety and reproduced verbatim on Wikipedia. So what usually ends up happening is that the article on Wikipedia is in fact the JE article. In such a case you can't really say that the JE article was a "source", because in fact the WP article IS the JE article- because of this, I think it's appropriate to cite both the JE and the JE sources in these situations. But I'm open for further discussion and willing to be convinced that I'm wrong.</dd>

<dd>I completely accept the point that many JE articles are copied verbatim - but my point still stands. Do <b>"Heilprin, Seder ha-Dorot, ii"</b> or <b>"Schürer, Gesch. 3d ed., ii. 202, 352, 357"</b> mean anything to anyone but the erstwhile scholar? A resounding NO. However, <i>many</i> users understand the link to the JE below - and if they want to continue in greater depth (and know where to find these dusty volumes!) then they can easily see the citations there. Only every millionth person or so knows what these sources mean (and even less will look them up).</dd>

<dd>Many, but by no means all, of the JE articles brought over to Wikipedia are eventually copyedited to a degree sufficient to render them a different article than what we started out with. As for the text being "unnecessary", I'm not sure we can assume that Jewishencyclopedia.com will always be a viable site, or that it will forever be available.</dd>
<dd>I guess my argument would be that if the originally JE article is revamped to refer to all new references, it would be appropriate to remove older materials no longer directly cited. But in my experience it works the other way- usually incomplete articles and stubs are replaced by JE articles wholesale, and then the changes to those JE clones are usually relatively minor.</dd>
<dd>As for few people bothering ot look up those citations, very few people will bother to look up any kind of reference whatsoever so it seems to me no kind of argument against their inclusion.</dd>
<dd>The esoteric nature of many of the citations used in JE is a problem, but I think the solution would be to either have a separate page giving all the abbreviations used in the JE (as, I assume, the original JE did) or trying to go through and make them more clear, not to simply remove them. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 18:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm discerning an underlying rationale here, one that I don't entirely disagree with. I remain unconvinced as to the relevancy of these citations (even if the article is essentially always remaining a JE clone), since what's good for JE doesn't work with wikipedia and the paradigm (although not the current reality) is that these articles <i>should not</i> just be copied from JE - even if its legally 110% OK - but rather edited over time. However, I see a major point you refer to in passing that has a firm basis in my eyes - the JE website won't be here forever and these valuable notes could be lost. Looking at it from my perspective, there's only one question: Is it wikipedia's role to preserve (arcane) history, however important? Or is it the recording of facts; whatever isn't critical isn't included? Many thanks, <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesher_2ed4.html" title="User:Nesher">Nesher</a> 18:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you're asking whether I think Wikipedia should be a historical archive for all sorts of irrelevant references simply because they might be lost, of course I don't. But I do think that articles, generally speaking and when possible, should be cited. Now the JE articles are full of citations which may be cumbersomely (is that a word?) phrased but still have value as identifying the source of the information.</dd>
<dd>Look at it this way. Let's say an article is generated regarding a rather obscure topic, by taking the JE article and copying it wholesale. I think we both agree that these articles should be edited to make them more readable (I do love the old prose and regret that it's seen as irrelevant, but I acknowledge that it's a bit much for the average reader). But just changing the language of the article doesn't mean that you've made it a new article- it is still the old JE article, with the same sources, modified for legibility. I still think that doesn't justify calling JE the "source" for the article when in fact the sources are the works of Messrs. Graetz, Kohler, et al; some Biblical passage, or the Talmud (to name a few possibilities).</dd>
<dd>I'm all in favor of fixing the citations, to the extent we're able, and make them more comprehensible to the average reader; but realistically speaking, notes and references have real value to only a tiny minority of readers in any case. Even a "Pesik II, iv.", incomprehensible to most people, has value to a few (to quote <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_ibn_Ezra_261e.html" title="Abraham ibn Ezra">Abraham ibn Ezra</a>, "the wise will understand...") and I don't really see it detracting too much from the rest.</dd>
<dd>One thing I do agree with you is that inline citations should be replaced, wherever practical, with footnotes. But I would hate to see these valuable (if esoteric) references simply tossed. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 18:43, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I find myself agreeing with you, but for different reasons. As citations for the sake of citations, I believe that just because one has copied a JE article, that doesn't mean that the person is obliged to copy the entire article <i>with citations</i> et al. In my humble opinion, no injustice is rendered to the fine JE (I also admire the prose but find it impractical sans certain contexts) by leaving out their citations. So on that we agree to disagree, I take it. You remain convinced of the relevancy of these citations, if only to a fraction of readers. Fine.</dd>

<dd><b>However</b>, I would argue that the citations are valuable in and of themselves as a historic record, and <i>if</i> they can be integrated in a <i>visually pleasing/acceptable</i> way into the article, i.e. nice format and inline citations definately replaced with footnotes, then its fine that they stay. In light of this partial retraction, I'm only opposed in cases where the citations (especially those inline) stick out like a sore thumb and disrupt the flow of the article. I take it that you don't regard wikipedia a historical archive - and might oppose the inclusion of citations on those grounds alone were it not for their relevancy to the article.

<dd>I guess it's better to agree, for the "wrong" reasons, then to disagree for the "right" ones.&#160;:-) I agree with you that irrelevant citations are pointless - it defies the very purpose of citations altogether to have ones that don't relate to the article. But sourced material should be preserved unless the source is abandoned. As I add JE articles in the future, I will try to fix up the inline citations to make them footnotes, and where possible fix the deficient citation format in the references.

Nor did I post a request to vote on a blatantly POV wikiproject page requesting votes.

<dd>On the contrary suppose people who you asked, voted in support of you? Wouldn't that be gaming the system? See brother, my idea is not to threaten you or anything..

<p>Hi Brian, you wrote: <i>My information on these cities is that they were in the north caucasus, possibly in Daghestan but definitely not in Armenia.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>My mistake. Most of the similar articles on such places in Wikipedia are on places in Armenia, so I'd just assumed these were too. It should be noted that all the caucasus countries have separate stub types though, so whichever present-day country the places are in, that country's country-geo-stub should be used (in this case, I'll change those two to Russia-geo-stub). Euro-geo-stub is only used for places that straddle several countries (like rivers) or ones in countries too small to have their own geo-stub (like San Marino). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 01:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings Briangotts.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat puzzled by this image you've uploaded. May I ask, what is your source? (My guess is this page <a href="http://www.fotw.us/flags/de-sh_hi.html#1696" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fotw.us/flags/de-sh_hi.html#1696" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) The <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_of_Denmark_64d9.html" title="Flag of Denmark">Dannebrog</a> was indeed the flag used in Schleswig and Holstein during the Danish reign, but this period goes back many centuries before 1814. True, Schleswig effectively became independent from Denmark during the troubles in the fourteenth century, but parts of both Schleswig and Holstein were quickly returned to Danish rule. The entire province of Schleswig had been returned under the Danish crown by 1721 and Holstein followed suit in 1773. Since the Danish flag was originally a symbol of the monarch and his army and navy, I see no reason to assume that this was not the flag flown over all strongholds belonging to the Danish kings. The Dannebrog was also the only flag allowed in use on the monarchy's ships, including merchant ships. This includes ships of the two duchies.</p>
<p>The "end dates" are somewhat problematic as well. The page I found mentions 1845 as the year the symbol was made official. To me this seems like an attempt to outlaw the secessionist flag of the pro-German Schleswig-Holsteiners which had been created a few years earlier (around 1843, I think). Btw, the secessionist blue-white-red flag is now the official flag of Schleswig-Holstein. The end dates mentioned as 1849 / 51 looks like the years when the Dannebrog was officially outlawed by the secessionist administrations in Schleswig and Holstein, but the northern (pro-Danish) areas of Schleswig used the flag throughout the 1848-51 war. On the other hand, its use was immediately scrapped by the Holsteiners and the southern (secessionist) parts of Schleswig. The case of the merchant ships of the two duchies during the war is a bit more complex, but on land, the case was more clear-cut. I've taken the liberty of removing the image from <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic_Cross_Flag_38d3.html" title="Nordic Cross Flag">Nordic Cross Flag</a> for the time being.

<dd>Hi Brian, the discussion prior to the article creation was with respect to the title "Tourism apartheid in Cuba" or "Tourist apartheid in Cuba" -- see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa#Rationale_for_splitting_Tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_into_its_own_article" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Apartheid_outside_of_South_Africa#Rationale_for_splitting_Tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba_into_its_own_article" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. It was you, in my opinion, that arbitrarily picked a new title and imposed it without discussion, not myself. So far, it is just you who feel that it should be called "Allegations of Cuban apartheid" - it was not agreed to by Jayjg (who didn't comment at all), Homey (who seemed to support the new article and didn't comment on the name), myself (who suggested the name "Tourism apartheid in Cuba), and Zleitzen (who makes him opinion clear above.)</dd>
<dd>It is important to say what type of apartheid it is in the title since normally one assumes apartheid has to do with race, when in fact, in the case of Cuba, it is related to tourist vs. non-tourist divide. Also the whole article is oriented around the term "tourist apartheid" -- you'll notice this if you read through the article. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 19:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I grant that I'm not up to snuff in American scholarship, but this Pr Miller you quote is one I never heard of before... also, I note that, although he himself quotes Icelandic sagas as an area of interest, I notice they can hardly be his specialty, and since he seems something of a polygraph, unless he's also a polymath, I doubt he can be a Sigurdur Nordal, Herman Pálsson or Régis Boyer level authority. and honestly, I don't care who may have originally suggested a substitution of targets, it's one thing to pass one king for another when saying who the kennings refer to, but if the actual name is there... no way substitutions can be made, especially when you notice the variation in length the fact that alliterations for one name will never work for the other. This means that, to change names, you have to get the whole verse out and make up a new one. I'll try and find a net site with the poem on it to try and see how many times Eirik's name is present.

<p>Sorry... I fear I can't contribute much to the matter. It's been an awfully long time since I last made a reasonably thorough reading of those sögur. I could read them again, and check my Régis Boyer French version to see what analysis he may have added onto the text (but since Njála is the last in the volume, I guess he'll have commented it less than others), but even if I do get onto it, and I have a lot of reading that's late, and if I find useful stuff to add, it won't be fast work.

<p>Hi Briangotts, I just wanted to leave a message about the map you've made for the <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatherland_%28novel%29.html" title="Fatherland (novel)">Fatherland</a> page. It's very impressive and thankyou for making it! However I was wondering if you could explain why on the map you have left India, large sections of Africa, and the Middle East in grey. The novel suggests that India is still British, the whole of Africa is under European control, and it can be assumed that the Middle East is still under British control. Maybe those areas could be coloured in orange along with the rest of the colonies? <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 12:43, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well I was just wondering why the map has most of Africa orange but some areas (eg: Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt, Sudan etc) as independent - where did you get that from? Surely all of Africa should be orange? Also I think those three little countries in north-east South America, and Honduras, should be orange. They were all still under European control in our world until recently, so I guess they would have been in Fatherland's world. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 12:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

So far I have 509 translations, which you can see <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/n_true/273399.html" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/n_true/273399.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Can you help and tell me how to say and write 47 in Middle English? I'd be most thankful; please reply on my talk page.

<p>Hi. I saw your reply on the talk page above. I have responded. I Am Not A Lawyer, and am not too sure about copyright law... <i>However</i>, their terms of service seems to make things clear for me. Of course, I might be misinterpreting everything. My reasoning, though, is as follows: If I take something in the public domain, then modify it, I have the copyright on my modification. I'd appreciate your thoughts, and a response to the extract of the TOS I posted on the talk page. Thanks, --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 12:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From your statement, I gather that I can remove the copyright tag on the photo. I'll procede to do exactly that. Thanks for your clarification. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 13:08, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree about leaving the tag. It is not copyright JE, and it is confusing to anybody who uses Wikipedia as an encyclopedic source. It raises the question of whether they can use the image. Besides, the image page <b>clearly</b> states that it came from JE.com, as does the image talk page. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 16:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll do them as I find them, when I find them. That's generally how I go about fixing things like grammar and spelling on Wikipedia... as well as all the other painful things that I correct. I'm not going to go on a crusade for all JE images to remove the (C) tag, I'll do them as and if they annoy me. Thanks again for your input though. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 16:02, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, The main problem is related with the "(disputed)" tag, cause this leads misunderstanding. There exists Altaic Languages but there is going on discussion about Altaic thesis. This "(disputed)" tag causes the misunderstanding that "--- language's being Altaic is disputed". For this reason, i'm supporting to remove the "disputed" tag. The discussion should be done either in the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altaic_Languages_21bd.html" title="Altaic Languages">Altaic Languages</a> page or maybe better in the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altaic_hypothesis.html" title="Altaic hypothesis">Altaic hypothesis</a> page. <a href="../../../e/1/0/User_talk%7EE104421_cfd3.html" title="User talk:E104421">e104421</a> 3 September 2006, 20:22 (UCT)</p>

<p>Hi, in the Wikipedia article 'Effendi', you added a link of a source by Baranovitch to support the idea that the word 'Apandi' also appears in the Old Uyghur language. Do you have detailed information about that source? May I find a link on the internet that reaches the source you mentioned? Or, if this source is within your reach, is it possible for you to you send me a snapshot of the 'Apandi' related article? 85.102.185.136 17:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your action in editing the protected page <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folke_Bernadotte_e7d0.html" title="Folke Bernadotte">Folke Bernadotte</a> was an unjustified violation of procedures.

<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Your action was very justified and showed that violation of wikipedia rules won't be tolerated. There was also indeed the vandalism of sourced material which was collaborated with 4 different books, and removed without any explanation and without the proper procedures - asking for citations, introducing rival sources and so on. At any case, there was a violation of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> unrelated to this and you did correctly and wisely by maintaining the version prior to the violation.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You seem to be pretty good at learning languages. A current talk is pending ins FR Wikipedia, in which you'll recognize a map you downloaded.</p>

I let you guess the purpose of what is discussed there. To sum it up, we try to separate legend from historical facts in history of British Isles &amp; peninsulas (finisteres) time 4thCE-6thCE.</p>
<p>Quite hard, since everything was mixed up during the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter_of_Britain_af25.html" title="Matter of Britain">matter of Britain</a>, 12thCE. That's my idea, at most.</p>

<p>I can be of no help there.

<li>I am really offended by the ex post facto "christianization" of this article. How can this possibly be justified? The article in question is a Jewish history article; and the arguments to remove Jewish references are so weak that an inference of bigotry is manifest. My recent interest in the article is that I had forgotten Josephus' Hebrew name; the current form of the article is not encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELance6968_1aef.html" title="User:Lance6968">Lance</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELance6968_1f77.html" title="User talk:Lance6968"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 09:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

If necessary, I will demonstrate this; but I think any reasonable reading of the discussion fails to accept an alternative conclusion. It appears that you have made too many concessions in the past. Generosity is admirable, but not to the point of diminishing logic, well established historical conventions, and Jewish dignity. I am not sure what course of action to take.

<dd>I generally concur with the Hun. I'll see how the discussion develops but like he says, there has been absolutely no concrete objection raised, based on WP policies, why the image should be removed, other than a general iconoclasm based on a particular interpretation of a religion not shared by the majority of WP users. I believe removal would be outrageous- the image is souced and is a historical relic (made by, it should be noted, Muslims). Since those objecting to the image maintain that Islam objects to images of all of its prophets, are we to now remove images from <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>, etc.? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 13:25, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From your latest message, I am not sure our views are at all reconcilable. In my opinion the image is neither offensive nor obscene; it was created by people who revered and honored Muhammad. The only reason it is "offensive" is because there are some people who object to all images of Muhammad, and by extension images of religious figures in general.

<dd>Hi, what I wrote was that the image is <i>considered offensive by a large number of people</i>. I consider this a question of fact. Do you disagree that large numbers of people find the image offensive? It is entirely possible to reconcile the belief that "a large number of people find the image offensive", with a personal valuation that does not find the image offensive.</dd>

<p>(unindenting)I see no contradiction between including the image and the policy you cite. My interpretation is that image must be both subjectively and objectively offensive and this falls far short of that standard. You also seem to maintain that while these images should not be included in the Muhammad article, they might be appropriate for a separate article on images of Muhammad. I encourage you to establish such an article and see if the attempts at censorship are any less frequent there. Briangotts (Talk) (Contrib) 14:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, I don't see <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProfanity_f9e3.html" title="WP:Profanity">WP:Profanity</a> as being based upon the subjective values of the editor, but that is my reading. Yes, I do believe that images of Muhammad are appropriate in other articles. For example, articles on Persian art, or <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depictions_of_Muhammad_33b0.html" title="Depictions of Muhammad">Depictions of Muhammad</a>. If fact, the image in question is found in the latter article. You write "I encourage you to establish such an article and see if the attempts at censorship are any less frequent there." As a matter of fact, you can see that <i>that</i> article is extraorinarily stable -- 50 edits since June 1. There is an occasional blanking vandalism, and although I haven't read the talk pages, there <i>may</i> be someone who argues there that the article shouldn't exist, or shouldn't have images in it. But even if the article were vandalized on a regular basis, and even if people who did not support Wikipedia's encyclopedic goal argued for deletion of the article, it would not mean that attempts at censorship <b>there</b> means that application of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProfanity_f9e3.html" title="WP:Profanity">WP:Profanity</a> guideline is inappropriate <b>here</b>. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 14:49, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>what is the image of? Who are the people in it? Why are they gathered round? Why are some wearing persian-like Shia caps? Who is the woman? When was this set? We know so very little about this image, it does <i>seem</i> important, but its done on a large minbar, which would appear to make it late-<i>ish</i>, but that would rule out Abu Talib from being present, but maybe that was artistic license. Is there a copy of the image <i>in context</i>, that is atop of the text that accompanies it, as that would explain what we are seeing. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 15:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>That's ludicrous. Your standards would eliminate virtually every image on Wikipedia. You are clearly searching for excuses to remove an image you find personally offensive. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 15:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The fact is, we don't know what the image in question is about. However, we <i>do</i> know what is going on in a depiction of Jesus being crucified, or Abraham preparing to sacrifice his son, or any number of other images. Applying a standard that says that if we can't say anything sensible about what an image depicts, then that image is not informative seem reasonable, and it clearly would not apply to many, hopefully the vast majority, of images on Wikipedia. But note, the majority of images do not need to meet even this minimal requirement, because they are not considered offensive by significant populations. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 15:29, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are not representing the situation accurately.

<dd>The source, unless I am missing something, says the image is a depiction of Muhammad. Being made several centuries after Muhammad's death, and without any attestation that the image is a reasonable likeness, the image does not inform us of anything in particular about Muhammad's appearance. Given that we don't know anything else about the image, the information content of the picture, <b>related to Muhammad</b> is essentially nothing. The image <b>is</b> informative about Persian art. It <b>is</b> informative about the variation in attitudes about depictions of Muhammad in Islam. But I don't see how it is informative about <b>Muhammad</b>. If I am mistaken, could you please write a paragraph describing things I might learn about Muhammad from the image. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 15:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The image illustrates the veneration in which Muhammad was held by Muslims of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Biruni_98a7.html" title="Al-Biruni">al-Biruni</a>'s time, and how they viewed him.

<li>Yes, the image illustrates the veneration in which Muhammad was held by Muslims after Muhammad's death. The image might therefore appropriate in an artcle on Islam (assuming no better images available). The Muhammad article is about Muhammad, and only tangentially about Islam as it evolved after Muhammad's death.</li>
<li>Wikipedia does include images of figures such as Buddha, Leif Erikson and Ghangis Khan which are not historically accurate. These images usually add aesthetic value to an otherwise barren textual landscape. But we should be clear they are not informative. They are acceptable for the purpose of providing aestheic value, in part because they do not violate any other policy or guideline. To my knowledge, no good-faith complaints have been made that these images are offensive.</li>
<li>You say you disagree with my interpretation of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EProfanity_f9e3.html" title="WP:Profanity">WP:Profanity</a>. Do you disagree with the part that says: "Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not"? I would <b>really</b> like an answer. Do you disagree with the part that says "Words and images that might be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by other Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available."? If you disagree, could you explain how you would amend this guideline?</li>
<li>There is obviously a conflict between writing an encyclopedia and not offending people. An encyclopedia, if it is really "encyclopedic" will cover material which will unfortunately offend some people. It would be nice to avoid being <b>unnecessarily</b> offensive, while still covering offensive material in an encyclopedic way. But how do we decide what is "unnecessarily" offensive? To me, that is the purpose of the section: "Words and images that might be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by other Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available." If an image is not <b>informative</b> in a given context, and it further is considered <b>offensive</b> by many people, then, in my opinion, it is probably unnecessary to have that image in that context. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 17:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>You and I are in fundamental disagreement about the nature of "offensiveness". You appear to believe that because a group of people, based on subjective criteria, regard an image as offensive, it should not be included. I believe that it is a consistent principle of both law and common sense that offensiveness must be measured objectively and subjectively. The fact that a particular group is offended by the inclusion of an image that, as you admit, adds aesthetic (and as I maintain, informative) depth to the article does not warrant its deletion. There is no objection to the image on the grounds that it depicts Muhammad in an offensive manner (and, I do not believe that such an offensive image could be excluded from an appropriate article, such as <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_7433.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a> or Piss Christ, for that matter), only that it is offensive <b>because</b> it is an image of Muhammad. This is an encyclopedia and is governed by the general principles and obligations adhering thereto. It is not governed by <i>sharia</i> and arguments based on sharia cannot exclude images or material from being included if they are otherwise well-sourced. That's really all I have to say on the matter, and I refer you to the additional arguments made by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hungry_Hun_2802.html" title="User:The Hungry Hun">User:The Hungry Hun</a>, with which I concur. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 19:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Several points</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>You have mis-characterized (or misunderstood) my position as:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"You appear to believe that because a group of people, based on subjective criteria, regard an image as offensive, it should not be included."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That is <b>not</b> my position. My position is that, in accordance with Wikipedia guidelines, if a group of people regard an image as offensive <b>and if that image is not informative in the context of a given article</b>, then the image should not be used <b>in that article, but it may be used appropriately elsewhere</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>You state that you maintain that the image is informative. I agree that the image is informative. A picture of a butt-plug may be informative to someone who does not know what one looks like. (I still don't). However, while removing a picture of a butt-plug from the butt-plug article may make that article less informative, removal of a similar butt-plug image from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaelangelo.html" title="Michaelangelo">Michaelangelo</a> would not make that article less informative about Michaelangelo, even if it could be established that Michaelangelo used a butt-plug. So, as I have asked before, please write a paragraph detailing the information <b>appropriate to the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammed.html" title="Muhammed">Muhammed</a> article</b> which the image in question provides. I really do not understand what is, or could be, that information.</li>
<li>In reference to the following paragraph:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Words and images that might be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by other Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have asked you a number of questions. Unfortunately, I don't feel you have responded to them. To make the discussion fruitful, I think we really need to engage with each others concerns. If I have not engaged your concerns, please let me know, and I will try to do better. However, I would very much like to know with regard to this paragraph:
<ul>
<li>Do you agree with the first sentence?</li>
<li>Do you agree with the second sentence?</li>
<li>If you disagree with either, how would you amend this guideline?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I think the references to Sharia are out of place. It is not Wikipedia's mission to offend, although we must do so incidentally in the course of writing an encyclopedia. In my opinion, if there are guidelines that say that doing X causes offence which is <b>unnecessary</b> from the point of view of writing the encyclopedia, then it should not matter which group is offended, but rather all groups should be treated equally, whether they are Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, women, Blacks, gays or whoever. That is <b>my</b> opinion, I would like to know yours.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I look forward to your response. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 23:12, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have said nothing new here. I have responded to your questions to the best of my ability - you simply choose not to accept my answers, which is your right. However you continue to attempt to impose an artificial standard of "offensiveness" on this project which it was never the intention of its founders to follow. I accept in its entirety the paragraph you quoted. But as I said offensiveness must be measured both objectively and subjectively. A Jew might find the visual depiction of the <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetragrammaton.html" title="Tetragrammaton">Tetragrammaton</a> to violate the tenants of his faith, but it would be unreasonable to expect Wikipedia, which is not bound by the laws of any religion, to adhere to religious law (or one subgroup's interpretation of the laws of a religion it shares with other subgroups, some of whom actually created the image in question). For this very reason the image of "Piss Christ", which is FAR more offensive than the Muhammad image you object to, is not censored from WP. I don't know how I can explain this any more clearly to you. I am trying to assume good faith but you do not seem inclined to accept my view or acknowledge that I have even made any points. Therefore I don't know that continued discussion will be fruitful. I will not agree with your imposition of an entirely subjective standard of offensiveness which would only lead to more images being censored in the future.

<dd>I'm sorry that communication seems to have broken down. Please remain cool. I appreciate that you believe that you have answered my questions, and that you believe that I have failed to address your issues or acknowledge your points. However, from my perspective, I did not, until this last comment, an answer to my question about the paragraph from the guideline that I had quoted. I am very thankful that you have stated that you accept in entirety the paragraph I quoted. That clarifies things for me a bit. Also, from my perspective, you have not told me what information you think the image supplies that related to Muhammad that is appropriate to the subject of that article. Perhaps you feel you have answered that, but I have not been able to "hear" that answer. From my perspective, I have also acknowledged many of your points. If you feel that we are unable to communicate, would you be amenable to having a mediator assist in our communication?

<dd>Hi, it has been a while since I have heard from you, and I see that you are active on Wikipedia. I will assume that you may still be considering my suggestion that we obtain the help of a mediator. If you are not amenable to discussing with me with the help of a mediator, please let me know. Also, if that is the case, would you object to my copying this discussion over to the Muhammad talk page, so that it would be visible by more editors?

<p>Hi. I think your name may be Brian. You corrected the intro and made it easier to read. Thank you. Yesterday was my first time on the site and I appologize in advance if this post is not where it should go. I am learning about the site. Thank you anyways for respecting my passage. FYI, I am a non native speaker/writer.</p>
<p>Comment on the Khazars: There is no evidence so far, despite what Prof Hammer at Univ. of Arizona may say, that the Ashkenazi population clusters around what is considered to be proper Middle Eastern populations (Syrians, Lebanese, etc). Prof Nebel has been very clear about this but since these are very political issues that may or may not be used by people to dismiss a nation and start wars, then it is in everybody's interest to water down the facts. It is sometimes better to steer clear from these controversies as job security may or may not be jeopardized. FYI, Prof Nebel used to work at Hadassah Hospital at prestigiuos Hebrew Univ. He is now at Institute for Clinical Molecular Biology, University Hospital of the Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany. Needless to mention the case of the Spanish scholar who had the unfortunate luck to get mingled in the "Palestinians don't exist" controversy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, mtDNA is quite of a thing to work on in laboratories. There is a lingering doubt that mtDNA is not as fire-proof as people may think as it may lend itself to recombination events. This itelf is hotly disputed in the scientific literature. As a rule of thumb, anything DNA is in a way or another more akin to quantum mechanics and Schrodinger's cat that many people may be aware of. It all boils down to probabilities. If not so, what are the recombination enzymes doing dancing around mtDNA then?</p>
<p>Lastly, yours truly is a trained biotechnologist with trainig in both the natural and social sciences. Thus the intertest in the subject matter. Thank you again. Hazael</p>

<p>Interesting notion. It is possible, because Chacanus appears in Bertin's work to be a name... But of course ibn Rustah and others also refer to a khagan Rus.

<p>Basically, chronicles have no data about his "family life". Everything is speculation: that he had an elder brother, whose wife Predslava is mentioned in the Russo-Byzantine treaty (Vernadsky); that Oleg's mother was a Czech woman (because he escaped to Bohemia, according to some very late sources), etc. I don't think it's wise to spawn unsubstantiated speculations. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 06:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brian, thanks for your response. I don't think the citation tag is particularly helpful, although it would be intereting to know which word is used by Skylitzes. Kinship terms in Middle Greek were rather vague. Some Russian authors seem to interpret the passage as indicating that Sphengel was Svyatoslav's uncle, not brother. Another problem concerns the statement that Svyatoslav asked Slavic tribes not to pay tribute to Khazaria. I checked the Primary Chronicle: these words are actually attributed to <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg_of_Novgorod_c793.html" title="Oleg of Novgorod">Oleg of Novgorod</a> and addressed by him to the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radimichs.html" title="Radimichs">Radimichs</a>! --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 12:47, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Repeatedly removing sourced materials without consensus, as you have done in the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> article, is tantamount to vandalism. I have engaged in no personal attacks on you. Calling an editor's edit what it is is not violative of NPA, as it is the action, not you, that is being called into question. Moreover, I find your attitude perplexing, in light of the fact that you devote a considerable portion of your own user page to an extended attack on another user, disguised as an attempt at diplomacy. Please immediately cease your harrasment of me on my user page.

<dd>There was a consensus image in the article from August 2005 until the recent conflict. The image was changed without consensus, and repeatedly insisting that you have consensus does not make it so. Whether the personal attack was directed at me or not is irrelevant.

<dd>Regarding your perplexity, statements such as "It figures that you should feel so strongly about my comment about "clueless Indians" since you are obviously one of them." are not civil. Therefore, I have an issue with the editor who made them. However, when another editor deletes an image that was inserted <b>without</b> consensus, and which does not have consensus, that is not vandalism. I hope that helps to clarify your perplexity. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 21:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the period you specify, I recommend Peter Hopkirk's <i>The Great Game</i> and <i>Setting the East Ablaze: Lenin's Dream of an Empire in Asia</i>. Svat Socek's <i>History of Inner Asia</i> is good for general refernce.

<p>Hi there.

<dd>As I noted in my edit summary, your "consensus" is the ephemeral conclusion of a handful of editors who, were I not assuming good faith, I might think were <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">"owning"</a> the article, with no discussion or presentation of opposing points of view.

<dd>So, erm, YOU get to decide that it's merely "the ephemeral conclusion of a handful of editors"? So can you go to any article you like and make any edit you like (whatever everyone else thinks) by claiming *YOU* know it's not REALLY a consensus? Frankly, some humility is in order. Besides, if the consensus is indeed "ephemeral" you can easily follow <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONSENSUS_977c.html" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> and argue your case on talk. (Which I note you have not done). And I wasn't implying you were in violation of 3RR, your behaviour led me (erroneously) to believe you were new so I wanted to alert you to the rule. Anyhow, I tried to post a friendly message, your hostility is not appreciated. Perhaps you are the one in violation of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>?

<p>Actually, I specifically said that I was assuming good faith and therefore would NOT assume that you were "owning" the article. Yet after implying that I was in violation of 3rr, you now assert that I am in violation of the good faith principle. Curious. In any case, when I have time I will assemble a cogent and detailed argument for inclusion of the satirical material. Frankly it's not high on my priority list. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 22:19, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(1) At the "Jew" page under "Ethnic Divisions", please change the word Gruzim to Gruzinim in the phrase "...and such smaller groups as the Gruzim..." I don't have an account here so I don't have the permission to modify locked pages. (2) Concerning the "Crimean Karaites" page, I asked for an update to the existing sentence: "At the time of this writing (March 2005), genetic testing is being conducted to ascertain their ethnic origin." As we discussed, I am the first and apparently only person to conduct genetic research on the Crimean and Polish Karaites, but unfortunately I could not find more than 8 qualifying and willing people to participate. They had to be men and unrelated paternally to any other in the study, and I had to approach Karaites living outside of eastern Europe because those who are still there have clung to the Khazar myth and are hostile to Jews. I cannot claim that my research is anywhere near statistically significant. However, it does prove a relationship exists between at least some Crimean Karaites and Middle Eastern peoples, and does provide avenues for further exploration (such as the question of whether the Karaite family we found to have haplogroup Q obtained it from a Turkic ancestor). Since there are a limited number of Crimean Karaite paternal lines to begin with, because of heavy interbreeding within the group, the 8 lines I studied are examples that probably reflect many other families. The debate over whether Karaites are kin to other Jews is effectively resolved in favor of Yes. Any person wishing to dismiss such a relationship will expose himself to be either an apologist for Seraya Szapszal's fraud or someone who was misled by the apologists. It is most potent in combination with the historical evidence showing many Crimean Karaites used to live in Istanbul. In the future if I can locate other bona fide European Karaite men I can expand the study; if another genetics team wants to continue the study that is also welcome. - Kevin Brook</p>

<p>Brian, I don't know much about Khazaria, so I let you rule on this. I do not like bulky templates, but it's only my personal opinion. I normally create templates when I feel that articles on a certain subject may be lost to our readers, because they are almost linkless and categorization is of little help. In other words, I use templates as a surrogate for "see also" section, which I find generally annoying. If some area may be covered by existing categories, it's better not to clutter the template with a simple list of items. But I'm sure you know as much and more! --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 19:44, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with Cassell's Atlas (goes to look it up right now). Well, I guess my goal is to reproduce the best of Cassell's most comprehensive work in a free (as in GNU liscensed) electronic medium. I'm strong on programming skills (in theory at least, if not in practice), but weak in the artistic department (though I've been wrangling around with the <a href="../../../g/i/m/GIMP_b6ef.html" title="GIMP">GIMP</a> these last few days, tweaking with a 39-frame series of the Roman republic/empire). There's a lot I could learn from you, I think (like what programs you use).</p>
<p>My visions are grand and will probably need trimming down to a practical size. With the proper programming setup, I should be able to mark and name arbitrary geographic regions on an image, then use a script to control a simple program to overlay all the pretty colors we like to see. I think I'm imagining a unwieldingly high level of customization, but I won't know until I try. So far, I've found <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generic_Mapping_Tools_68ce.html" title="Generic Mapping Tools">GMT</a> to offer the kind of controls I'm looking for, but those tools aren't geared for animation (yet; if I could gain the right kind of UNIX programming skills, I'm sure I would wind up working with the GMT programmers to the point where my influence would inspire an animation plugin or something). <a href="../../../x/a/x/User%7EXaxafrad_ba3a.html" title="User:Xaxafrad">Xaxafrad</a> 18:35, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually most of the maps I've created for Wikipedia have been with very basic tools like Paintbrush.

<dd>Cassells has a series of world maps showing the major states in any given time period. the maps are color coded (green for hunter-gatherers, beige for pastoral nomads, pink for simple farming cultures, light brown for chieftaincies and complex farming cultures, purple for state societies and dark brown for empires. certain long-lived empires (Roman, British, etc.) are delineated in unique colors.</dd>

<dd>Suppose we drafted a series of individual maps for each time period, then had them animated to show changes over time.

<p>Brian, I was just noticing your recent map that you mentioned on <a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">Ghirlandajo's Talk page</a>. I like the detail on that one, and went on to review all the maps you've put together.</p>
<p>I am particularly impressed with your extensive "Source" listings. Most historical mapmakers here in wiki-land seem to ignore this critical documentation (or perhaps lack it all together).</p>
<p>What program do I use? <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a>. It's freeware and is very powerful. The best thing is that my maps are very very editable. I notice that you, like I, make changes to your maps, so Inkscape comes in very handy. Yes, there is a learning curve, but it's worth it in my opinion. And, yes, it's probably a bit harder to develop a multi-color map, but again it's worth it.</p>
<p>Regarding your maps, I would urge you to use the standard colors listed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Maps#Map_colors" class="extiw" title="w:en:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Maps">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps</a>. In particular, I think it's important to use the standard color for bodies of water and "#FFFFD0" (a light tan or cream color) for the land -- whenever possible.</p>
<p>I also list my own guidelines on my user page, if you're ever short of reading.</p>

<p>Hi, Brian. I am pleased with the newest edition of your map. I have some comments, but they are not essential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you sure that early <a href="../../../p/s/k/Pskov.html" title="Pskov">Pskov</a> may be qualified as a Scandinavian settlement (it is red in your map)? At least nearby <a href="../../../i/z/b/Izborsk.html" title="Izborsk">Izborsk</a> was a tribal centre of the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krivichs.html" title="Krivichs">Krivichs</a>, with no traces of a Varangian presence (although it was burned to the ground simultaneously with the settlements of the Rus' Khaganate, towards the end of the ninth century).</li>
<li>Per Tatiana Jackson and the Machinskys, Alaborg was situated on the <a href="../../../s/y/a/Syas_River_f8a8.html" title="Syas River">Syas River</a> rapids, immediately east of Ladoga. The Syas River flows from Lake Ladoga southward, in parallel to the Volkhov. There is a minority opinion that Alaborg was pre-historic <a href="../../../o/l/o/Olonets.html" title="Olonets">Olonets</a> but it does not enjoy much support.</li>
<li>I don't understand why you persist in spelling Rostov as Rostofa. This is a ridiculously distorted Slavic name, used in several quite late Scandinavian sources. The original Norse name for Sarskoe Gorodishche is not known. I also don't understand the question mark and the frame at this point of the map. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 14:39, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<dd>1. Re:Pskov: I based this on the fact that <a href="../../../o/l/g/Olga_of_Kiev_bb01.html" title="Olga of Kiev">Olga of Kiev</a>'s family were supposed to be prominent Varangians who settled there. Given that she married Igor in the early 900's, it's not unreasonable to classify Pskov as the situs of a Varangian settlement at least in tradition. I don't know how the archaeology measures up. Christian definitely identifies it as a Rus Khaganate site, as do (I believe) Franklin and Shepard.</dd>
<dd>2. Re:Izborsk being burned with the Rus' Khaganate sites; I imagine that the line between Slav and Varangian was not particularly clear-cut in many areas and that there were "Viking-ized" Slavic ruling classes in some regions just as there were Slavicized Viking rulers in others. It was probably more of a spectrum than a clear cut "I am Viking, you are Slav" dichotomy. Not that that affects the map, it's just a thought.</dd>
<dd>3. Rostofa- this is clearly what Norsemen called the town in later times. Sarskoe G. is a more modern designation so I don't see why it would be a more appropriate name. However, I will add a note to the map description discussing the issue since you think it is important.</dd>

<p>Brian, I don't take such projects seriously. One doesn't have to spam thousands of project banners on talk pages of articles written by others if he really wants to improve their coverage. I have seen most such projects fall apart rather quickly after much ado with banners and assessment scales. I suppose it was Mr. Lokshin who introduced this practice to Wikipedia and I recall that he regrets it now. Probably I'm getting lazy with time, but I don't feel myself able to embark on the series of the Rus' history articles. It would require examination of too many sources, too much time and too much energy, now that I have some other projects to pursue. <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kievan_Rus_36a8.html" title="Kievan Rus">Kievan Rus</a>, however, needs serious expansion, so I plan to tweak it after we are through with the khaganate.

<dd>To clarify one issue: I don't consider your edits vandalism, but rather unconstructive (I dislike most deletions). If done by a newcomer or anon, I'd not hesitate to warn them more sternly, when done by a more experienced editor like yourself, I am assuming much more good faith - that either you had a bad day or a good reason (which, unfortunatly, you failed to explain sufficiently to my satisfaction in the edit summaries). This was not a 'best start' but I hope we can edit together peacefuly and constructivly in the future; through I'd still prefer to see a note at the end of this para telling the reader that it is not an idle speculation about number of sources but they are explained below, I'll let it pass - it's a minor point (I have also withdrawn my objection at FAC, the article looks good). I might have also been a little too blunt with my last comment, but I most certainly don't appreciate how it was refactored above. I am sorry I forgot to notify you eariler, but I am kind of busy in RL and few things slip my mind: regarding the above edit by Ghirla I asked for input <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Spamming_of_citation_needed_template" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">at ANI</a>. I don't appreciate editors replacing my comments with false accusations of personal attacks, but I don't want to start a revert war on your page; I'll leave it up to you what to do with the comment above.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 00:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Makes sense, I'll try to remember. However, there was a period when everyone referred to the land of Israel as Palestine. Therefore, to say something like "in 1940 Shlomo Pines emigrated to Israel" would appear to be an anachronism. Don't we have to use the term "Palestine" during a certain period for historical accuracy? What is this period? From Roman conquest until 1948?

<li>Hi Dfass: Note: The term "<a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>" is an old one of Biblical origin, whereas the name "Palestine" is considered offensive by many Jews because it was coined by the Romans after they crushed the Jews of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a>-- and needless to say today it refers exclusively to the Arab Palestinians and never to Jews. Note also that the "<a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>" article is <i>not</i> the same as the "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>" article because the latter refers to the modern post-1948 Jewish state. My main concern was about rabbis from the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras, up until about a hundred years ago being called "Palestinians" on Wikipedia as a follow-through from the many articles that have been copied and pasted from the old <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Encyclopedia_760d.html" title="Jewish Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> and which collectively create the wrong impression. Such are the hazards of relying on dated information, long-discarded terminology, and unsuitable writing and communication styles. Wikipedia as a modern encyclopedia should not be relying on archaic terms such as "Palestinian rabbis" that could potentially cause grave misunderstanding. I think that from the time of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a>, also shortened to "the British Mandate" and sometimes "Palestine," that Jews were associated with those terms from <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> when the modern State of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> was declared. I hope that you have noted that I am most definitely NOT saying that whenever the <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i> uses the term "Palestine" that the single word "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>" should be used -- obviously I do not mean that because when <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> is used alone on Wikipedia it refers to the MODERN State of Israel only. On the other hand, what I am saying is that when the word "Palestine" is used in archaic sources that predate modern Israel, and when writing about Judaic topics that relate to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Talmudic, or Biblical times, then the better, more accurate, less controversial term for Wikipedia to use is "<a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>" which is historically what the Jewish people, and everyone else in academic life, have and do still call it. Hope I have clarified myself, and thanks for caring. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, I think I get the drift. I will pay attention to it in the future. (Don't be so down on the Jewish Encyclopedia though! It's an incredible work, written by some tremendous scholars. I think these articles significantly <b>raise</b> the quality of Wikipedia, whether their English is somewhat archaic or not. If you compare a JE-borrowed Wikipedia article to one written by "the masses," you can't but be struck by the difference in quality and scholarship. The typical Jewish Wikipedian (myself included) is not capable of producing articles of anything like that caliber. Most Wikipedians cannot even be bothered to cite the sources for the couple of factoids they manage to dredge up from their memory of 10th grade.) Thanks again for the clarification. <a href="../../../d/f/a/User%7EDfass_f166.html" title="User:Dfass">Dfass</a> 15:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi Dfass: I am not down on the old Jewish Encyclopedia at all, and I fully agree with you that it is a more than masterly work of scholarship. But is was written in the context of the culture of over a <i>hundred</i> years ago as a product of the <i>nineteenth</i> century! My specific concern at this stage was <i>only</i> about how the <i>meaning</i> and <i>application</i> of the word/s "Palestine" and "Palestinian" are getting "lost in the cut-and-paste process" because one hundred years ago, "Palestinian" was used as an academic <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjective.html" title="Adjective">adjective</a> as for example, together with "rabbis" ("Palestinian rabbi/s") or the Talmud ("Palestinian Talmud"). Up until 1948 the words "Palestine" and "Palestinians" still had application/s to Jews because of the existaence of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> until 1948 in the territories of historically Jewish <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>. Since then, the name "Palestine" and "Palestinians" has shed any connection to Jews and the modern Jewish State of Israel which was set up in contradistinction to an Arab Palestine. Particularly since the rise of the <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLO_68c8.html" title="PLO">PLO</a> (the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_Liberation_Organization_12a1.html" title="Palestine Liberation Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a>), following the 1967 <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six-Day_War_9c92.html" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, the term and notion of "Palestine" and "Palestinians" has become thoroughly and exclusively connected with the Arab Palestinians to the point that no-one (not in politics, academics, the media, religion, etc) associates the name "Palestine" and "Palestinians" with the Jews or Judaism, so that it can safely be said that the notion of a "<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Jew_730f.html" title="Palestinian Jew">Palestinian Jew</a>" is an archaic anachronistic discarded notion. So when cutting and pasting articles from the one hundred year old Jewish Encyclopedia, one should not fall into a "<a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_warp.html" title="Time warp">time warp</a> trap" by blindly pasting articles from it without some sensible updates, and not to inadvertantly recreate and foster terminology for Jews and Jewish Israelis that neither they nor the world accepts or recognizes. One needs to be conscious that the term "<a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>" is a well-established name that has survived for a long time and is still the preferred term of choice when speaking in modern terms, so that Jews not be confused with Arabs and <i>vice versa</i>. By speaking of the <a href="../../../r/a/b/Category%7ERabbis_of_the_Land_of_Israel_72a1.html" title="Category:Rabbis of the Land of Israel">Category:Rabbis of the Land of Israel</a>, meaning rabbis (or any Jews) associated with a historic <i>geographic</i> area, one also avoids problems such as calling pre-1948 rabbis or people "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israelite.html" title="Israelite">Israelites</a>" -- used only for people in the Biblical era or "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israelis</a>" -- which refers to citizens of the modern State of Israel.

<li>Hi Shira: I noticed this comment. Their assertion is outrageous and false and should be rejected and disputed to the full. There is no "supreme council of religion" on Wikipedia and there never will be. Each religion has its experts and contributors on Wikipedia and none of them will ever tolerate interference from outside busy-bodies. Judging by their user pages, the members of this "religion" project are obviously coming from a Christian <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> and seems they now wish to "<a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_dipping.html" title="Double dipping">double dip</a>," pretty funny actually.

<p>They are not "personal editorial comments." They are facts. Your refusal to recognize them does not make them less factual. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 02:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Editorial comment would be "he is wrong". Saying "he cites no source" is recognizing a fact evident from the face of his work. If you have further comments to make do so on the talk page. This is not the place for this type of discussion. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 02:52, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello and Merry Christmas,</p>
<p>I noticed you have nominated <a href="../../../t/m/u/Tmutarakan.html" title="Tmutarakan">Tmutarakan</a> for <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article status</a>. The article seems concise and very well referenced, however I think it would benefit from an infobox (for both cosmetic improvement, and for summerising the text) - I'm assuming that infoboxes for defunct/ancient Russian (or otherwise) settlements may not exist however(?).</p>
<p>I've had a breif search on similar articles but have not found anything appropriate. If you also do not know of such an infobox, or simply disagree, do please let me know, other than that I'd be very much happy to pass this article.</p>
<p>Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhamez84_48a9.html" title="User:Jhamez84">Jhamez84</a> 20:16, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you watch the Simpsons? I was like Homer when he sees a giant box of jelly-filled donuts. Your new map is absolutely awesome. I wish I could commission you to reproduce as much as you could from Cassell's (especially as I was hoping to get a copy for Christmas, but copies are hard to find, I guess I'll have to drop-ship it), but everything you've produced so far is already more than I would hope for (compared to every other free map on the internet). There's a small group of historical fans trying to put together a comprehensive historical atlas...I'm going to add a link to your category of images at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_historical_atlas_0a8c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject historical atlas">project page</a>.

<dd>There's the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_historical_atlas_0a8c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject historical atlas">historical atlas WikiProject</a>, and the more current-events-themed <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas" class="extiw" title="commons:Atlas">commons:Atlas</a>. From my point of view, the emphasis in the Historical Atlas project is on as-accurate-as-possible maps of various areas prior to the 19th and 20th centuries, all the way back to when the earth's crust cooled and the first ocean formed. I'm not sure how many other project members share that view, but it's mine. I'm sure your point of view as a historian and cartographer would add a great shot of vitality to the Historical maps project (I'm not sure there's a definitive mission statement, we all just want to make really great maps of places that have never been mapped before, I think). <a href="../../../x/a/x/User%7EXaxafrad_ba3a.html" title="User:Xaxafrad">Xaxafrad</a> 01:36, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
