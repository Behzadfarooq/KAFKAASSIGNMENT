<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dylan/Dixie</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure "fan" is the right way to describe folks like me; "excitable obsessive" is closer, if a bit too much. Anyway, I've been trying to remember where I'd recently seen a reference to Dylan's use of "Dixie" in his movie, Masked &amp; Anonymous, and finally turned it up. <a href="http://www.change-links.org/Masked.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.change-links.org/Masked.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I'm not sure you can fit it into the article, but I wanted to contribute something that might offset what I removed. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 22:07, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the pointer. I don't think it was a major loss to remove the Dylan mention. You were right to point it out as fraudulent.

<p>I noticed you're having some trouble with the refs on this article, particularly ref_label/note_label. I was going to fix those (I've fixed them up in a couple other articles), but the notes section seems to have been moved to another page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peace Corps</span></h2>
<p>I was enjoying your response to the ridiculous little mix-up about the "Henry Ford" infection of the generic name graphic in the featured articles, and then enjoying your Cameroon articles. I've been interested in the Peace Corps for awhile, especially the teaching aspect. Being a lover of anthropology etc. etc. I would apply to volunteer in Africa.</p>
<p>Would you mind telling me about your experiences? I have researched the peace corps website but there is nothing quite like a firsthand account. What did you do to prepare for your service? Was it difficult to become integrated into the community? What was the process of interviewing and applying like?</p>
<p>Just, anything you feel like contributing would be greatly appreciated. I still have to do the whole college dance before I could apply, but knowing what languages or other experiences helped you would be very kind.</p>
<p>Thanks a ton, Chelsea</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, Chelsea. I'm glad you're finding my stuff useful and interesting; I'm just trying to accomplish Goal 3 of Peace Corps, which is to tell Americans about the rest of the world. And I'd be more than happy to tell you about my experience. However, here probably isn't the best place. Send me an email instead. Look on the left side of your screen and you should see a link in the "toolbox" that says "E-mail this user". Then just drop me a line so I've got your email address and can respond properly. (You could just leave the email address here, but Wikipedia is crawled by who knows how many spammers looking for live email addresses; if you end up going this route, write the thing out so it's human-readable but not machine-readable; e.g., with "at" instead of @, etc.) Let me know if you have any problems.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Udham Singh</span></h2>
<p>While assassins and murders are both killers, I think we use it different contexts. Going by the wikipedia definition, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> <i>has come to mean the killing of an important person. An assassin — one who carries out the assassination — is usually ideologically- or politically-motivated reasons.</i>, whereas <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> is the killing of an ordinary person without any serious motive. I changed it because 'assassin' seems to fit here but not 'murderer'.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will wait until we agree on this before attempting a revert. I am more concerned at the moment about the validity of the article Deepak Kamboj which seems to be an exact copy of <a href="../../../u/d/h/Udham_Singh_2570.html" title="Udham Singh">Udham Singh</a>. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Talk</a> 20:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS&#160;: Note that the category 'assassin' was already there. I removed only 'Indian murderers' <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Talk</a> 21:14, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kappas in Final Fantasy</span></h2>
<p>It's a bit complicated, actually, and I probably unintentionally muddied the waters in my edit. In summation, the sentence I changed was incorrect on two points: one, kappas have never been present as an enemy monster in any <i>Final Fantasy</i> game, and two, kappas have only ever appeared in one <i>Final Fantasy</i> game to begin with (<i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_VI_262d.html" title="Final Fantasy VI">Final Fantasy VI</a></i>). In the North American release of the game, yes, they were redubbed as "imps." I suspect that whoever inserted the sentence, though, was getting confused because of the monster "goblin," which has appeared in <i>most</i> games in the series (sort of as an <i>FF</i> equivalent to the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goomba.html" title="Goomba">goomba</a>), and which, in the original English language versions of both <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_%28video_game%29_7553.html" title="Final Fantasy (video game)">Final Fantasy</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_IV_f351.html" title="Final Fantasy IV">Final Fantasy IV</a></i> were renamed "imps." The name duplication is unfortunate, but the long and short of it is that kappa/imps are only in <i>Final Fantasy VI</i>. I'll make a change to the article to clarify this a bit. – <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 18:22, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Hu. The "Fictional whatever" categories don't really bother me, honestly, as long as they're set up correctly. My problem with this user in the past has been because he/she was 1) adding non-existent categories to articles, 2) adding "Fictional species" categories to articles on singular creatures like the <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabberwocky.html" title="Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a>, and 3) adding "Fictional whatever" categories to articles on series rather than characters. He/she seems to be doing much better now that the weeklong block has expired.</dd>

<dd>As for what to do about recreations of previously created categories, I can only suggest that you flag them for speedy deletion for that reason.

<dd>I had a couple of new kokopelli pictures that I was thinking of posting [I'm not thrilled with the ones there-tho they are mine?] but when you quashed that vandal I figured I'd just give it to you. I just sort of threw it together, so, yes, it is an original, one of a kind - from one RPCV [Belize, 1976-77] to another.

<p>Thanks so much. I should say it was fun to do a bit of on-the-hoof gumshoeing for the 'pedia. I only found the place by following street directions– I was a bit disappointed, I admit, when I walked up to find that the building was gone, and hadn't, oh, say, been converted to a Chinese restaurant or a syngagogue or something. But that whole neighborhood is today dominated by the so-called "Civic Center" of state and federal court buildings.

<p>Noticed you removed the categories Japanese mythology and Japanese folklore from quite a few articles today. I assume this has to do with the JPMyth project, but as far as I can tell from the page, all of those articles ought to have at least one of those categories, since they're all about either gods, spirits, monsters, and so forth, or folk heroes/folktales.

<p>Hello Brain,</p>
<p>I read your message regarding duplicate linking (Toddy). Actually I gave linking twice because usually people wont read an article fully (top to botom), they simply read a specific topic, that is usually seen. So if they read an article and find no link they omit it, and they wont search for that link elsewhere in the same artile, that is a fact. So for some specific topics we have to duplicate links.</p>

<dd>If I may step in here, I believe it's a common (but not required) practice to mark reversions as minor, the logic being that there is no difference between the page before the reverted edit and the newly-reverted page, so the net effect is minor. The semi-automatic tool admins use to revert pages automatically marks such an edit as minor. <b><a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak"><font color="#8855DD">Pagra</font></a><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPagrashtak_d273.html" title="User talk:Pagrashtak"><font color="#6666AA">shtak</font></a></b> 23:09, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's been my thinking, anyway. It is a bit confusing when, as you say, rollback marks edits as minor, but I guess the difference is when removing fancruft (which most of the edits I believe Oni is referring to were), it's not quite the same as reverting vandalism. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 23:36, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When reverting vandalism, marking the edit as minor should be standard. For other reversions it's not so clear.

<dd>Even with vandalism you have to be careful to a small extent, because something's status as vandalism is not always clear. For the most part though I wouldn't see it as too huge of a problem, because if someone sees that as enough of an issue, chances are they're watching that page closely anyway. After reading deeply into the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edits_650d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edits">Wikipedia:Minor edits</a> page and the larger <a href="../../../m/i/n/Help%7EMinor_edit_e212.html" title="Help:Minor edit">meta page</a>, it becomes somewhat apparent that minor edits have 4 or maybe 5 very specific cases in which they are appropriate. If you ask me there should be a more obvious statement of the guidelines though, as to avoid the confusion of people not reading, or often not knowing about the policies.

<dd>No, you are correct that Brunel was not involved with City Hall. As for the title, there was a Park Theatre built in Brooklyn a few years after the first Park burnt down. The disambiguation is difficult, since most information on the second Park Theatre comes from sources on New York City and discusses the area covered by the current city. On those grounds, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park_Theatre_%28New_York%29_712f.html" title="Park Theatre (New York)">Park Theatre (New York)</a> is confusing, in my opinion.

<dd>An image with no tags at all displays at the full size, but an image with the thumb tag but no size tag displays according to the user's preferences (the default is 180 pixels), or the full size if the full size is smaller. <a href="../../../p/i/s/User%7EPissant_7c5c.html" title="User:Pissant">Pissant</a> 16:47, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I see. I suppose it doesn't matter if the hardcoded size is removed for a lot of images. I'm unconvinced, though, that when the image is, say, horizontally oriented rather than vertically that a hard-coded size isn't a good idea, as many of these images would be swallowed up at a mere 180px in width.

<p>Hi, I appreciate your help. I think I know what you mean now. You rule man. Anyhow, I would like to create an African music link to the Djembe Radio Show in Mali. And it will not be spamful in any way. I just happend to think it's a great resource for the African music scene in Mali. An external link is by nature an extension of the main theme. And if music is the theme, a site reflective of African music ought not to be deleted. So, I plan to put it under Music of West Africa -- not in your Africa piece, but in the more specific one as you suggest. Thank you so much for your help.

<p>Hello - I'm curious as to why you removed Category:Shreveport from that city's television stations. Best, <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 20:42, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Paul. It's because the TV station articles are already part of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Category%7ETelevision_stations_in_Shreveport_5723.html" title="Category:Television stations in Shreveport">Category:Television stations in Shreveport</a>, which itself is in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Category%7EShreveport%2C_Louisiana_51ef.html" title="Category:Shreveport, Louisiana">Category:Shreveport, Louisiana</a>. Standard practice is to only place an article in the narrowest applicable daughter category. Hope this explains things! —&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 20:49, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additionally, it appears someone on your campus has flooded my e-mail inbox with about thirty attempts to reset my password. If I had noticed that at the time, I would have opted for a longer block. — <small>May. 17, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[02:29] &lt;<u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freak</a>|<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a></u>&gt;</b></tt>
