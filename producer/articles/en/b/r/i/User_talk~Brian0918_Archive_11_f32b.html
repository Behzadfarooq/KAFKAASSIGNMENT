<dd>OK got it. In putting the template on retroactively I <i>was</i> doing MONTH DAY which works fine. Last night however I was invoking with DAY MONTH which isn't fine. The reason for my switching formats was to remind me of when the template was being used to replace the FA date statement (before there was a template). There is no problem with going <i>back</i> and changing the DAY MONTH input sequence but I don't know to enforce this requirement with future users. --<a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydnjo_a2ba.html" title="User:Hydnjo">hydnjo</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/User_talk%7EHydnjo_4abf.html" title="User talk:Hydnjo">talk</a> 15:28, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm. Other than removing the articles that do not have both of them, or seperating them to two different cats, I am not sure what to do about it. I posted the Cfr notice on it last week and allowed all of them to be dicussed. I gather most people wouldn't know that, so didn't get any comments about it.

<p>Brian, the best suggestion we've had for what is the meaning of those initials Babyface is writing is that it could well be his name.

<p>Brian, Sorry if you felt like I was being a contrarian, but I found your comment to be quite rude. I would hope you would assume good faith that there was a reason for what I was doing. <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a> has a long history of which you seem to be a recent contributor. The problem has been the large number of people adding films because they are personal favorites. I try to track down the legitamacy of what people add and remove things without citations. This has been the consensus of the editors of the articles. There is also a general organization to the article which has been first listing broad critical acclaim, then audience/box office favorites and then academy awards. It seemed to me to make sense to keep the academy award musicals together. One historian does not make broad critical acclaim, (indeed, perhaps there is broad enough acclaim to list <i>Gigi</i> on top, and I was trying to encourage you to document it more.) My last edit was basically the same information that your has, just ordered differently. I have tried in my edits to give the musical section the same editorial approach that other sections in the article have. Also, the lists have been slowly turning into complete paragraphs and I thought this a good time to make that change also. If I am guilty of anything, it is not leaving you this message sooner to explain thing and I am sorry for that. I just have not had time to do much of anything on Wikipedia recently. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 09:27, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I suppose, however, that we'll just have to live with our difference of opinion on this, since this issue is a lot broader than websites dedicated to bashing some crazy televangelists. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="black">Jersyko</font></a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 14:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Heya, you are aware you're supposed to warn people before blocking them, right? Also, please try to avoid personal attacks, especially in block messages. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 14:18, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As above. I became aware of this issue on IRC, #en.wikipedia on freenode, you're welcome to join there to explain your actions if you like. SOme concern has also been expressed at <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html#Brian0918.27s_instant_blocks" title="WP:AN">the administrators' noticeboard</a>. I feel that your actions are at the least a severe abuse of discretion. A block for a month for two tests, with the block message of "sneaky bastard" is not acceptable, especially without warnings. <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pak</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">aran</a> 14:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What they said. A representative sample of all the blocks you've done suggests that they were all done far too hastily, and the personal attacks are also uncalled for. Blocking is a measure to be used when a warning doesn't help, not the first line of defense; you create more problems than you solve when you block too quickly. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 14:46, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tnx for showing an interest on its talk page (which i make a pt of <i>not</i> lk'g to, lest the added Google attention to it further grieve Dr. Lotspeich). I don't want to call the AfD on the article, given my heavy (and not necessarily entirely wise) involvement in the debate, but for his sake, i'd like to see it quickly drop off the world's radar. Would you consider making the call?. I'd be glad to follow up on the call if you preferred. Tnx.<br />

<p><b>By the way</b> I know that you have established quite the reputation for yourself here at WP, but I found the comments that you left on the talk page of this article less than helpful. As a "newbie" my first article published was a tribute to a dear friend of mine, recently tragically dead. Upon realizing that the article would not meet inclusion criteria, I was eager to see it taken down. Your comments were less than helpful, to say the least. I wish you well and I am a believer in the potential of WP to bring a quality encyclopedia to every person with internet access.

<p>Thanks for your note about my user page. Seems like you're doing a grand job on 1911 (hopefully the information you are putting in isn't too archaic&#160;;-)). I also get frustrated by people using the Google "test" as authoritative - if the web already knew it all there would be less need for Wikipedia! Although I am hestitant to waste much time on the GNAA, it seems like your alphabetic solution is a reasonable way to do it, given that there is no consensus about relative importance. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 13:25, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - why are you adding the unknown source (and uploaded by you) Image:Walmart_greeter.png to new user's pages? It doesn't help those of us trying to deal with backlog of dodgy images to have one seemingly officially placed on new user's pages. It also doesn't have any cultural reference outside North America. From the caption I presume that US supermarkets employ people to welcome new customers. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secret</a><a href="../../../s/e/c/User_talk%7ESecretlondon_8864.html" title="User talk:Secretlondon">london</a> 15:18, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey! Pleas stop calling me a vandal, I just changed Maurice Utrillo's birthdate because I misread his birth certificate (1896 or so was the year his father *recognized* him). And why did you change my Inducks edits? The link to the interview was fine I think (it was used by sebjarod on the french wikipedia, who is also a moderator) so with your permission I've added it back. "Inducks" is not a website but really a database, or maybe a "project". Bye, Herve. Herve661 21:24, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah I think that would be a great idea, but I think for best results wiki should use quicktime VR tours. But either way the more photos to illustrate places around the world the better. Wikipedia would become the first port of call for anyone planning a vacation if we could provide numerous photos on landmarks.<br />
I'm not sure if I have anything really suitable for a tour as yet (I will keep it in mind in future though) but I have lots of photos of my local area which I will upload these long holidays when I have some time for wikipedia. I also have about 200 photos of canberra from our school camp - which I'm slowly preparing (I have exams in four weeks and I'm also heavily involved in our annual school magazine SCOBE). Probably the best example for what you are looking for is <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_War_Memorial" class="extiw" title="commons:Melbourne_War_Memorial">Commons:Melbourne War Memorial</a>, but even that could do with some more pix. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Gardens%2C_Melbourne" class="extiw" title="commons:Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Melbourne">Commons:Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne</a> has a fair few as well.<br />
Anyway the project works, but I don't have too much time more to devote to other projects so I'll just make an effort to photograph things from numerous angles and maybe some nice pano's which can be made into quicktime VR tours if possible. BTW, your flattery is flawless! "premier photographer on Wikipedia"! I would have supported any project&#160;:-)! But I <i>do</i> think this will be a good idea. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 02:26, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On my way to bed, Brian, it's 4:30 AM here. Mostly, I think your changes are of wording that's fine into other wording that's also fine. For instance "as a consequence" --&gt; "consequently". Matters of taste, as I said. Maybe that one's not the best example. Anyway, these I thought detrimental:</p>
<p>"Then came the paid employees"--&gt;"Then were also paid employees"; "Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly superseded" --&gt; "Sicilian Baroque gradually and slowly was superseded"; "To fully appreciate Sicilian Baroque" --&gt; "To appreciate fully Sicilian Baroque".</p>
<p>The first two are strange to my ear, perhaps they weren't meant to be that way? The third I understand is an expression of your regard for the rule against splitting infinitives, but I (along with most professional grammarians) disagree that there is an absolute or mechanical rule, or that it ought to be applied in such a case, where it means pushing in the adverb between verb and object (the rule against <b>that</b> has well-defined exceptions, but this ain't one of them). I mean, would you actually <b>say</b> "To appreciate fully Sicilian Baroque"? <b>Can</b> you even say it? Me, I can't get my tongue round it. The original is much more natural. I don't mean to say you didn't do good fixes also. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:48, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 1911 encyclopedia is very old, antiquated, and sometimes errors. Often the names given to a certain style change during 100years. Perhaps, it would be a good idea if you find an example of this word relating directly to Norman architecture - an illustration would be helpful too. As a rule the Norman's favoured "chevron moulding" - sometimes confused with "dog's tooth moulding" and occasionally "rope moulding" and "billet moulding". I would also remind you that the title of the page is "Bezantée". I have looked through many reference books on the subject I can find no mention of "Bezantée moulding" relating directly and exclusively to Norman architecture. From the tone of your edit summary you know better. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 19:33, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought from your tone you understood architecture. The word is a corruption of Byzantine, and can be applied to architecture in any one of a number of ways from domes to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribune_%28architecture%29.html" title="Tribune (architecture)">tribunes</a> to windows and brickwork. It does not apply to one specific moulding; and if it did "Bezantee" would probably not be the chosen version of the word today. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 19:49, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Absolutely nothing I'm happy to say. It is full of antiquated ideas and errors. Until recently Wikipedia was in danger of becoming a 1911 text dump. Happily that situation is now being resolved.

<li>I am not reverting you, merely trying to make this project as accurate and up to date as possible. In English (this is an English language encyclopedia) an accent, acute or grave, counts for nothing. In fact many people consider it unnecessary. It is used in certain words of French origin "fiancee" and "nee" immediately spring to mind, it is not an error to omit it, in fact its inclusion for a word in common English parlance could be thought of as an affectation. Oh, and your yellow "leave a new message sign" is irritating because for a millisecond it immediately makes one thinks one has a new message oneself. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 23:11, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Uh huh. And the contradiction with sentence one...? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:41, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the Find-a-Grave lists, it might be worthwhile to add alphabetical headings so that edits can be made in more managable bites (see B and S for an example). I'll hold off doing more chunking till you see if you agree or disagree. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 05:54, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, true...headings alone won't cut down on the initial load time. Smaller pages, then! - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:01, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I think it almost made sense. Take a look at <a href="../../../f/i/n/Wikipedia%7EFind-A-Grave_famous_people_W_0c94.html" title="Wikipedia:Find-A-Grave famous people/W">Wikipedia:Find-A-Grave famous people/W</a>. I can't quite make the subpage links work yet, so I'll hold off again... I think they may be red waiting to be cached, but we'll see. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:30, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, it seems to be a capitalization problem (capital W diff from lowercase w). I'll move the pages. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:34, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>W now seems functional but perhaps I'd better leave making subpages to you. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:49, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
