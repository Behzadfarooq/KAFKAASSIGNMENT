<p>Is it correct that each Lion's tour features are least one player from one of the Unions that has not yet had an International cap, thus giving a chance of recognition to potential talent? <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDainamo_f808.html" title="User:Dainamo">Dainamo</a> 13:19, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the amateur era they often took an uncapped player on tours - but this hasn't really happened for about 20 years now. (Danny 22nd June 2005)</p>
<p>Will Greenwood was uncapped before he went on the 97 Lions tour.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a></p>

<p>Following the edit war between <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyBriggs_eadb.html" title="User:PaddyBriggs">PaddyBriggs</a> and other editors. I'm opening up a discussion on how the 'British and Irish Lions' name paragraph should look. This is obviously a very sensitive area and I think we should try to avoid giving unnecessary offence to any party.</p>
<p>As I see it the reference to 'arguably correct' is POV even if it tries not to be POV. It is also inaccurate, the Lions are officially known as the 'British and Irish Lions' and therefore that is their correct name.</p>
<p>The other statement that the original name was the the British Isles Lions AFAIK that is not correct I believe they were known as the British Isles XV and the LIons tag was added later.</p>
<p>Some of <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyBriggs_eadb.html" title="User:PaddyBriggs">PaddyBriggs</a> other edits i.e. largely those not listed above are good and I think add to the article.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 12:40, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I haven't managed to find anything yet on the official reason why the name was changed but this link (<a href="http://www.sluggerotoole.com/archives/2005/04/mccausland_take.php" class="external free" title="http://www.sluggerotoole.com/archives/2005/04/mccausland_take.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.sluggerotoole.com/archives/2005/04/mccausland_take.php</a>) should show my point about NI Unionists not seeing the change as necessary. One Mr McCausland actually objected to the change.</p>

<p>I think the song should be refered to in this article and at the very least there should be a link to it. Although it has only been used on the 2005 tour it is likely to be used in future and so should IMO be on the main page. As there seem to be differing views can we please discuss it here before deleting it again.

<p>Ireland being described as a home nation in the context of rugby union is justified by the following sources, courtesy of <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwekubo_9160.html" title="User:Kwekubo">Kwekubo</a> (for full discussion see archive).</p>

<dd>Which doesn't stop "Home Nation" being an offensive and controversial term.

<p>I have yet to see from you, MacRusgail, or anybody else a documented reference for any individual (of substance) or organisation (of standing) who thinks that the term is "offensive and contraversial"! <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddyBriggs_eadb.html" title="User:PaddyBriggs">PaddyBriggs</a> 16:19, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Am I wrong for saying that one of the two (although I know this is contested) earliest formed Rugby Football Clubs was in Ireland (I believe Dublin University/Trinity College)? So, wouldn't it then be quite easy to see the whole of Ireland as a Home Nation (this is obviously in addition to the above stream of quotations already supplied from non-arguably reliable sources)? <a href="../../../r/o/w/User%7ERowlan_b02d.html" title="User:Rowlan">Rowlan</a> 15:34, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Archive it by all means but take it away. It is repetitive and little to do with the article. What has devolution and the SFA's decision not to participate in a British football team got to do with the Lions? <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 20:34, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've no problem with an archive, <i>for the older discussion</i>, but some of other material was posted within the last week or so. I made the devolution point as a comparison (something you don't seem to be able to grasp), of a supposed problem that some would have us believe doesn't exist, in the same way that political controversy over the Lions is supposed not to exist. The SFA remark is also a comparison. The lack of a "British" Football Team shows that there are issues over sporting teams of this kind. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:47, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you'll find I can grasp many things. Devolution has got nothing to do with the Liona. If the Lions is a geniune problem then you'll have no trouble finding sources. Wikipedia is not here for your opinion on the Lions, if it were the opinion of a major political party for example that would be different. If you ever take the time to read the Wiki principles, you'll see that what is included in an article should be sourced and be noteable. MacRusgail's opinion on the Lions isn't noteable.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 20:52, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You certainly have given an opinion on the Lions, aka there is no controversy. I used devolution as an example of how pretending a problem with the Celtic Fringe (for want of a better term) doesn't exist, will not make it go away. I have pointed out a number of problems with the Lions, and you claim that they don't exist, ergo no problem. Such an approach was tried with devolution, hence the reference. I am going to add a sentence about the under representation of Scots in the 2005 squad. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 21:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you want to nitpick, I believe that the Manx and Channel Islanders field national teams at the Island Games and Commonwealth Games. People from these places are eligible for the other teams, but do not compete for the national Manx/Guernsey/Jersey sides. Seemingly though, anyone with a granny born in the right place is eligible. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 20:36, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know about the Channel Islands but I'm pretty sure that the Isle of Man comes under RFU jurisdiction (so I'd guess that the Channel Islands did as well). Neither field 'national' teams AFAIK and as far as rugby union is concerned they are honourary Englishmen. You must be eligible for one of the four home unions to play for the Lions, AFAIK you could be a New Zealander born and bred but if you qualified for say Scotland you could play for the Lions. I think it is more accurate to say that the Lions can draw from players eligible for one of the home unions rather than they can draw from players from the British Isles. A player might be from England but be qualify to play for a non-home union team and therefore AFAIK make themselves ineligible for Lions selection.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 20:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Manx do have a national team (no inverted commas), but they don't field it much (Commonwealth Games). By the way, they are not necessarily "honorary Englishman" (that's the imperialist streak showing again), they are in fact eligible to try out for Scotland and Wales too. Matt Le Tissier for example, isn't English (or a rugby player!), but tried out for Scotland at one point. The same would apply in rugby terms. Their qualification would be different to that of a NZer with a granny born wherever. Your last sentence is perfectly true. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 11:51, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the IRB who run the game they do not. 'Honorary Englishmen' imperialist good grief! Where did I say that they were English. Your last point is wrong the rules for soccer are different from rugby union. By UEFA rules anybody holding a British passport can play for any of the four 'British' teams, however, there is a gentlemen's agreement between the different associations not to abuse this rule and to restrict selection to those who at least have a grandparent from that country. Channel Islanders and the Manx are exempt from this and can play for any of the four nations. The national teams in fact represent their union which is why teams exist that don't represent nation states England, Scotland and Wales don't exist as nation states and neither does a united Ireland. THe RFU administers the game of rugby union in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands (AFAIK) and therefore they are eligible for selection by the RFU team i.e. England.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 20:24, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You automatically said/assumed "Honorary Englishmen", whereas as you yourself point out, they can play for three other national teams.

<p>I removed the reference to 'British Isles' as although the IRFU may use the term 'Home Nation' to describe themselves I'm pretty damn sure they'd object to 'British Isles'. IMO this term should only be used in this article when refering to the Lions when they were then known by this name.</p>
<p>I also don't believe it to be accurate. For example Dallaglio (or Lol) could have qualified for England (through birth and residency), Wales (through his mother) or Italy (through his father). As an uncapped player he would have been available for one of two home nations and therefore eligible for Lions selection. If he had chosen to play for either England or Wales he would still be eligible, however if he had chosen to play for Italy he would not be. The fact that he is from the 'British Isles' isn't sufficient. All this is to the best of my knowledge, if you know better then correct me.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 22:31, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

The fact is, it's not that "some" people in the island of Island object to being labelled "British", it's that the vast majority do. Hence, sensitivity (and respect) is appropriate in this case.</p>

<p>The British "Lions" are a Rugby League tradition as well and the name "Lions" originated from the 1925 tour. Union copied it. I think that a disambiguation should be created between the two. Licinius</p>
<p>The rugby league Lions did in fact use the name 'Lions' before the rugby union Lions. I have never heard of any allegation of 'name theft' though.

<p>I took the tricolour flag out because he is from Ballymena, Northern Ireland and to my knowledge does not have a RoI passport. There is an on-going problem with Irish players, using a RoI flag to represent players from the North is nonsensical. There needs to either be a symbol used for both Irelands or use the RoI flag only for those from RoI (or those who have a RoI passport) and the NI flag for the rest. <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.93.21.40.html" title="User:195.93.21.40">195.93.21.40</a> 13:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)(GordyB)</p>

<dd>Yes it is. As I have repeatedly pointed out, the Lions carry a great deal of political baggage with them. For one, they date from a time when the "British Isles" were far more united (especially amongst the anglicised upper middle classes, who were often rugby supporters), and centralised under London, and for another, their logo is an English lion (Norman leopard, if you wish to be precise). The team has increasingly sidelined three out of the four nations as time has gone on. The GAA was set up specifically to counter such anglocentric tendencies in Ireland. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 16:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article deals with this POV far more already than it should. Remove IONA, leave the fact that some in Ireland disagree with the term <i>British</i>, even though the name dates from the Romans and possibly derives from a celtic word. Why do people object? ignorance? hate? political gain? insecurity? Whatever it is it is not an issue for this article. Besides this, has an Irish player ever refused selection because of the name? --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 07:41, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This debate seems rather pointless. The team is now called the British and Irish Lions. Historically it has been called the British Isles, it's not anymore so who cares. If anyone can find a match programme that calls the team the IONA Lions then let me know, otherwise this is a waste of time. I think some of the discussions mentioned here go well beyond the scope of an article about a combined team that represents the home unions. I think the major points regarding the name have been covered pretty comprehensively in the article. No point continuing this debate. - <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShudda.nz_8088.html" title="User:Shudda.nz"><font color="blue"><b>Shudda</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/h/u/User_talk%7EShudda.nz_dbfc.html" title="User talk:Shudda.nz"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 08:27, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
