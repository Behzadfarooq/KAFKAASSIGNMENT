<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Bannister_dd65.html" title="Edit section: Amateur Baseball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amateur Baseball</span></h2>
<p>Bannister, the oldest son of former major-league pitcher <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floyd_Bannister_2c39.html" title="Floyd Bannister">Floyd Bannister</a>, was born in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottsdale%2C_Arizona_bd9b.html" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. He had a remarkable high school career at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaparral_High_School%2C_Scottsdale%2C_Arizona_a9d8.html" title="Chaparral High School, Scottsdale, Arizona">Chaparral High School</a>, former home of Chicago White Sox star Paul Konerko, as he was named All-Region and All-City in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Chaparral was the runner-up to the state title in 1997 and 1998, but in Bannister's senior year, he helped take home the state championship by striking out seven of the nine batters he faced in the championship game.</p>
<p>He began his college career as a walk-on at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_California_4e4b.html" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a>. Entering as a second baseman, he made the decision to become a full-time pitcher before the start of his freshman season. He posted an <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_Run_Average_b497.html" title="Earned Run Average">ERA</a> of 4.35 in ten games out of the bullpen in his freshman year. Acting as the team closer during his 2001 sophomore campaign, he compiled a 2.80 ERA in thirty-five relief appearances. Bannister helped the Trojans to the College World Series in both 2000 and 2001 while pitching alongside current major leaguers Mark Prior of the Chicago Cubs and Anthony Reyes of the St. Louis Cardinals. He <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshirt_%28college_sports%29.html" title="Redshirt (college sports)">redshirted</a> in 2002, due to arthroscopic elbow surgery to remove impinged scar tissue in his elbow. However, he returned in 2003 to play his junior year which was also his first year as a starter. In eighteen games (fourteen starts), Bannister compiled a 6-5 record with an ERA of 4.53.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Bannister_dd65.html" title="Edit section: Baseball career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Baseball career</span></h2>
<p>Bannister was drafted by the Mets in the seventh round of the 2003 <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_Draft_7b74.html" title="Major League Baseball Draft">amateur draft</a> and, after signing, was assigned to the Class-A <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Cyclones_174e.html" title="Brooklyn Cyclones">Brooklyn Cyclones</a>. There he put together a strong season, posting a 4-1 record with an ERA of 2.15 in twelve games (nine starts) and was named a New York Penn League Postseason All-Star. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a>, Bannister was assigned to play for High-A <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Lucie_Mets_2acf.html" title="St. Lucie Mets">St. Lucie</a> in the Florida State League, where he put together a 5-7 record with a 4.24 ERA in twenty starts and was a Florida State League All-Star. His experimentation with throwing a two-seam fastball and circle change-up led to this decline in numbers, but prepared him for the competition at higher levels of professional baseball. Bannister was then promoted to AA <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binghamton_Mets_873a.html" title="Binghamton Mets">Binghamton</a> following the trade of Scott Kazmir to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, where he had a 3-3 record and an ERA of 4.08 in a mere eight starts. After the 2004 season, Bannister played for the Peoria Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League. He posted strong numbers, going 2-0 with a 3.77 ERA against the top prospects in the minor leagues. More importantly, he developed his cut fastball while in the AFL, which would develop into one of his strongest pitches. The next year, Bannister began the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005</a> season in Double-A Binghamton, where he posted numbers that reflected the quality of his newly-developed pitches: a 9-4 record with a 2.56 ERA in eighteen starts. This earned him an all-star selection for the third consecutive season, and the honor of starting pitcher for the Double-A All-Star Game. This display caused Bannister to earn a promotion to AAA <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk_Tides_1e97.html" title="Norfolk Tides">Norfolk</a>, where he showed further promise against better competition. He finished his AAA campaign with a 4-1 record and an ERA of 3.18 in eight starts.</p>
<p>Bannister made his major league debut against the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Nationals_035f.html" title="Washington Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> on April 5, 2006, pitching a no-hitter for his first five and one-third innings. His first major league win came in his second start, also against Washington, on April 11, 2006. A former second baseman, Bannister also excelled at the plate, acquiring four hits in his first ten at-bats, including 3 doubles.</p>
<p>After making five solid starts, Bannister was put on the 15 Day Disabled List with a strained right hamstring which he injured while running the bases in the fifth inning of a April 26 game against San Francisco. Bannister was later moved to the 60 Day DL, because the hamstring was more damaged than originally believed. Bannister made 5 starts for the Mets and had a record of 2-0 with a 2.89 earned run average.</p>
<p>Brian spent a month on a major league rehab assignment, pitching for the St. Lucie Mets and the Norfolk Tides. When Orlando "El Duque" Hernandez was unable to pitch in late August, Bannister made a spot start against the Phillies, giving up 4 runs in 6 innings in a 4-3 loss. The game was Bannister's first major league defeat. Immediately after the game, Bannister was optioned to AAA Norfolk to allow Oliver Perez to make a spot start the following day. Bannister returned to the Mets for the month of September and made two relief appearances. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">September 6</a>, 2006, the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Cyclones_174e.html" title="Brooklyn Cyclones">Brooklyn Cyclones</a> honored Bannister with his own <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobblehead.html" title="Bobblehead">bobblehead</a> and retired his number, 19. Bannister was the first pitcher from the Cyclones to make his major league debut with the Mets.</p>
<p>Because his hamstring injury reduced the number of innings pitched in 2006, Bannister joined the Tomateros de Culiacan in La Liga Mexicano del Pacifico. He won in his debut, pitching five innings against Los Algodoneros de Guasave. After completing the first half of the season with the Tomateros, Bannister returned home with a 3-2 record and a 3.68 ERA.</p>
<p>On December 5, 2006, during the MLB Winter Meetings, Bannister was traded from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mets_19ff.html" title="New York Mets">New York Mets</a> to the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Royals_78c3.html" title="Kansas City Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> for <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief_pitcher.html" title="Relief pitcher">relief pitcher</a> <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambiorix_Burgos_bdc4.html" title="Ambiorix Burgos">Ambiorix Burgos</a> to help strengthen the Mets' bullpen. Bannister's father Floyd pitched for the Royals for two seasons from 1988-1989.</p>
