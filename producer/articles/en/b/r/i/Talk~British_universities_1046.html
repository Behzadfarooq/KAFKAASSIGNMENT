	    <p>Who keeps putting Warwick in the elite group? What rubbish! They only got 6 x 5* in the last RAE. That's not top notch. Bristol, Manchester and Edinburgh way out-gun that. UCL's credentials are a class above again. Even Southampton got 8 x 5*! _________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I think that it is important that we don't disadvantage small or big universities. So a big universities with good research should be included with small universities with good research. It is very hard to come up with a definitive list. Thanks.</p>
<p>OK, I concede that Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester all have greater RAE scores than either Lancaster or Southampton. I leant too much weight to the Sunday Times table. However, if the number of departments at grade 5 or 5* is the accepted criteria, then Southampton (8 x 5* and 16 x 5) and Nottingham (5 x 5* and 21 x 5) have much more right to be in this list than St. Andrews (2 x 5* and 15 x 5) or York (3 x 5* and 15 x 5), or, arguably even Warwick (6 x 5* and 20 x 5). And what about the LSE (7 x 5* and 5 x 5) which, in fairness, is a more specialised university than most?</p>
<p>152.78.18.145- The article should be NPOV and you have an obvious bias for certain universities. You are focussing too much on newspaper tables. The article should be based on the actual RAE results. Look at the link provided below for your attention. The newspaper league table rankings you point out are measured diferently compared to actual RAE results. Even in newspaper tables Bristol and Edinburgh always completely dominate lower-tier universities like Southampton or Lancaster.</p>
<p>"lower tier"??? Well that snide comment must come from a superior oxbridge ####! Probably a public school graduate to boot!</p>
<p>To anon 152.78.18.145 you have got it wrong here. Please look at RAE results as Bristol, Manchester and Edinburgh have far more right to claim to be post-graduate universities than Lancaster, St Andrews or Southampton. Look please don't delete again as you are simply incorrect.</p>
<p>Can we edit from a NPOV (neutral) perspective here. Read my comments as yours are wholly inaccurate, you obviously ignored my comments below. Read my comments and look at the RAE for yourself. How on earth can you say Bristol is not at the cutting edge of research is amazing? It got 15, 5* RAE ratings, the most behind Oxbridge and UCL. That means that only 3 other universities in the UK were conducting more cutting-edge research. You can't just select random newspaper league tables that favour the university you study at. Can you read my comments below. Every newspaper league table uses different methods of calculating their research statistics. To dispute your claim that Bristol is not at the cutting edge of research lets compare Bristol and Lancaster's RAE results. Bristol: 1,6* rating 15,5* ratings and 21,5 ratings. Lancaster: 4,5* grade ratings 10,5 ratings. On this evidence Bristol has 'far' more right to claim to be a research university as opposed to Lancaster. It has more than double the amount of postgraduate students, has far more departments conducting cutting-edge research ie: at 5* level and is generally perceived by everyone except you as being a top research university, It gets more than triple the research funding. Even if we use your Sunday Times league table the difference is minute, about 6 points and is an average calculated by individuals based on subjects etc- giving favour to 'arts' and small universirties. The Sunday Times and Times research statistics seriously favour smaller institutions as well. And even on those the differences are minute. Please lets comprimise here, and list some common choices although I and serious analysts would seriously disagree with you on this one. Remember these articles are meant to be neutral. I don't go to Bristol or Manchester I just want this article to be accurate. If you still don't agree with me at least answer the points I have made during my two posts. Thanks. Please discuss before you delete again. Follow this link for RAE results <a href="http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/" class="external free" title="http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/</a> . Once again based on the ST table, the differences a minute- so to say one university is cuttin-edge based on a difference of 5 statistical points is absurd.</p>
<p><br />
The Sunday Times Top Ten for Research table is based on the RAE and on the amount of research funding received. Check out the following link: <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8405-1246315,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8405-1246315,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8405-1246315,00.html</a> Whatever their past glories, Bristol and Edinburgh are simply not at the cutting edge of research today!</p>
<p><br />
That is not true and is a ridiculous statement. Bristol gained 15, 5* top research grades in the latest research assesment and a further 21 departments were awarded the 5 grade. This means that 36 departments were conducting research at standards of international excellence. Only Oxford, Cambridge and UCL can match these figures. 78% of Bristol's departments were rated as intenationally excellent in the RAE. Bristol is only one of 4 British universities in the Coimbra Group of leading European reseach universities and is a member of the Russell Group, which is based on research funding. The university has also attained 5 Nobel prizes for the quality of its research and has more research students than half of the universities you mention. Bristol was also ranked in the top 100 in two recent league tables for top reseach universities in the world behind only Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and Edinburgh in the UK on average. As far as newspaper league tables Bristol consistenly ranks in the top ten. The measures you were using were newspapers calculations of averages and vary massively depending on the newpaper you look at. A more serious list would take into account the types of departments, research reputation, citations, postgraduate students, research funding etc. The new list is not comprehensive but is far better than the one previously stated. How can you say that Lancaster, Southampton or Bath is a better research university than Bristol, this is a ridiculous statement. Look at the RAE results please. Also using the words 'clearly lead the field' is completely incorrect as even by the measures you were using Bristol, Edinburgh, Manchester and others were either very close or ahead in some newspaper league tables of the universities already listed. I refer you to The Times and Sunday Times league tables. Please don't change the list again- we are editing from a neutral perspective here. Everything I say also applies to Manchester- a university with 23 Nobel prizes. I think that makes it slightly more legitimate as a research university than Southampton or Lancaster.</p>
<p>While it is an undeniably popular undergraduate university, Bristol is not among the top group of research universities according to either the RAE or any of the newspaper league tables. Nor is Edinburgh.</p>

<p>sorry to shunt this on again, but it should probably be at the singular form, "British university".

<p>Recent academic analysis of published statistics has pointed to the existence of 4 groupings of universities in terms of academic performance: the elites, the top old universities, the other old universities, and the new universities (ex-polytechnics and others that have achieved university status since 1992) (WHAT IS THE SOURCE FOR THIS??? - It doesn't seem credible!) (NB, I'm moving the above from the main page, not expressing it myself.)</p>

<li>Splash's changes just now:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I added the new tuition fees system to the funding sections and left what was already there with minor corrections.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I removed the silly list about 'popular' postgrad places. There was no cited basis for any of those, popular as they may appear to be. To revert that, would, I think need some ratio of oversubscription for PG places. HESA have simple numbers <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/holisdocs/pubinfo/student/institution0304.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/holisdocs/pubinfo/student/institution0304.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> for 2003/4, but that is not necessarily a 'popularity' indicator since using that table in rank order would be nothing other than a measure of raw size. I couldn't quickly find a ratio statistic anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oxbridge not being in the top-20 for engineering is one of the most often abused statistics in these tables, for the reasons I have given here. It is fair to say that the other engineering faculties are to blame for the misuse in no small part. Still, it had no place on Wikipedia, and providing the explanation ought to help dissuade reverts on that. I'm not at Oxbridge, for the record.</li>

<dd>EU citizens must be treated the same as British citizens. They pay the same tuition fees (if applicable) and they are eligible for the same social welfare benefits as British citizens. I don't think they can take out student loans however.

<p>Hi, the comment about the UK being unusual in that most students go to uni far from home. Fair enough - but is there any reason for this that we can write about? --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimmywimmy_7e29.html" title="User:Timmywimmy">Timmywimmy</a> 12:44, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess it might be because the original English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were far from the bigger cities so there was always a tradition of studying away from home. I’ve met many students from England who talked about student life as a rite of passage involving moving away and cutting the apron-strings. Growing up in Scotland I found the reverse; it was traditional there to pass from local school to local uni, and commute from your parents home; the Scottish universities were mostly in the cities and a 17-year old facing a four-year degree could financially cope better with family support. This might be more common to the rest of the world but I’ve no figures on this (although I have heard that English degrees are the shortest in the world). I now teach in London and find a huge proportion of sixth formers only applying to universities they can commute to for reasons of expense, so I wonder if its still such a rite of pasage as it was.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd presume the tradition grew, or was cemented by the fact that until the early 1990s, students got grants which more than covered their rent, plus in the case of Scottish students in England, they also got travel allowance. So why not go and have fun out of sight of the parents? I went from a Scottish city to an English University and had a great time.&#160;;) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 11:38, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Has it also anything to do with English students historically being used to studying far away from home by going to boarding schools, which might have fed a lot of students into English universities in past times? Whereas Scots originally couldn't attend University south of the border anyway unless they were Anglican, so they'd have to study locally?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it has more to do with the original comment being a load of cobblers. It's not my perception that British students are any more prone to studying far from home than students in other countries, but if supportive stats can be shown then fair enough. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 22:13, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
