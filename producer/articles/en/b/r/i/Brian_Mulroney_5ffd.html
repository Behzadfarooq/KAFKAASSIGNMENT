<p><b>Martin Brian Mulroney</b> was born in <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baie-Comeau%2C_Quebec_adfc.html" title="Baie-Comeau, Quebec">Baie-Comeau, Quebec</a>; a lumbering town in eastern Quebec. He was the son of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Canadian_6343.html" title="Irish Canadian">Irish Canadian</a> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> parents, Benedict and Irene (O'Shea) Mulroney. Benedict Mulroney was a paper mill electrician, and Brian received his high school education at a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> boarding school in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatham%2C_New_Brunswick_7472.html" title="Chatham, New Brunswick">Chatham, New Brunswick</a> operated by <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Thomas_University_bff6.html" title="St. Thomas University">St. Thomas University</a>. Mulroney would frequently tell stories about publisher <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_R._McCormick_c6a4.html" title="Robert R. McCormick">Robert R. McCormick</a>, whose company had founded Baie Comeau. Mulroney would sing Irish songs for McCormick,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the publisher would slip him $50<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> (Which, as is rarely pointed out, went to the family's grocery funds). He grew up speaking English and French fluently.<sup id="_ref-Donaldson310_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Donaldson310" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mulroney attended a Progressive Conservative leadership convention while still a student at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Francis_Xavier_University_c0c7.html" title="St. Francis Xavier University">St. Francis Xavier University</a>. While initially undecided, Mulroney was captivated by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Diefenbaker_9dea.html" title="John Diefenbaker">John Diefenbaker</a>. Mulroney joined the "Youth for Diefenbaker" committee which was led by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Samuel_Rogers_f1e6.html" title="Edward Samuel Rogers">Ted Rogers</a>, a future <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scion.html" title="Scion">scion</a> of Canadian business. Mulroney struck an early friendship with Diefenbaker, and received telephone calls from Diefenbaker.<sup id="_ref-Donaldson310_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Donaldson310" title="">[3]</a></sup>. After graduating from St. Francis Xavier, Mulroney at first pursued a law degree from <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalhousie_University_2b3a.html" title="Dalhousie University">Dalhousie University</a>. It was around this time that Mulroney also cultivated friendships with the Tory premier of Nova Scotia, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stanfield_f05d.html" title="Robert Stanfield">Robert Stanfield</a>, and his chief advisor <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalton_Camp_c6af.html" title="Dalton Camp">Dalton Camp</a>. It is a minor bit of controversy as to whether Mulroney flunked out of Dalhousie his first year, or whether he simply transferred to the <a href="../../../l/a/v/Laval_University_2331.html" title="Laval University">Laval University</a> in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_City_5f2c.html" title="Quebec City">Quebec City</a>.</p>
<p>In Quebec City, Mulroney befriended future <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Quebec_a3df.html" title="Premier of Quebec">Premier</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Johnson%2C_Sr_0df5.html" title="Daniel Johnson, Sr">Daniel Johnson, Sr</a>. At Laval, Mulroney built a network of friends that would play a prominent role in Canadian politics for years to come,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> including <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucien_Bouchard_485e.html" title="Lucien Bouchard">Lucien Bouchard</a>, Bernard Roy, Michel Cogger, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Meighen_cfbb.html" title="Michael Meighen">Michael Meighen</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Bazin_14e9.html" title="Jean Bazin">Jean Bazin</a>, and Peter White. During this time, Mulroney was still involved in the Conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the President of the Student Federation, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Clark_415b.html" title="Joe Clark">Joe Clark</a>.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Dalton Camp, who was now President of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what was widely believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker's leadership. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay out of the spotlight. With Camp's narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a leadership convention in 1967. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._Davie_Fulton_1be9.html" title="E. Davie Fulton">E. Davie Fulton</a>. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stanfield_f05d.html" title="Robert Stanfield">Robert Stanfield</a>. Mulroney, then 30, would become a chief advisor to the new leader in Quebec.</p>

<p>After graduating from Laval, Mulroney joined the Montreal law firm now known as <a href="../../../o/g/i/Ogilvy_Renault_1242.html" title="Ogilvy Renault">Ogilvy Renault</a>. After ultimately passing his bar exams, Mulroney became a labour lawyer, which was then a new and exciting field of law in Quebec. He gained notoriety for ending several strikes along the Montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._David_Angus_cd15.html" title="W. David Angus">W. David Angus</a>. Mulroney's reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the Montreal newspaper <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Presse_1edc.html" title="La Presse">La Presse</a>. In doing so, Mulroney became friends with the paper's owner, Canadian business mogul <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Desmarais_1c2c.html" title="Paul Desmarais">Paul Desmarais</a>.</p>
<p>Mulroney's big break would come during the ClichÃ© Commission in 1974,<sup id="_ref-Lotz_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lotz" title="">[5]</a></sup> which was set up by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bourassa_a134.html" title="Robert Bourassa">Robert Bourassa</a> to investigate the situation at James Bay. To ensure the commission was non-partisan, Bourassa placed Robert ClichÃ©, a former leader of the provincial <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a> in charge. ClichÃ© asked Mulroney, a former student of his, to join the commission. Mulroney would ask Lucien Bouchard to join. The committee's unravellings made Mulroney well-known in Quebec.<sup id="_ref-Lotz_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lotz" title="">[5]</a></sup> A notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the Premier of Quebec. Although Bouchard favoured calling in Robert Bourassa in as a witness, Mulroney refused, deeming it a violation of 'executive privilege'. Mulroney and Bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when Mulroney ran for his re-election in 1988.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Mulroney_5ffd.html" title="Edit section: Rise to the top">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rise to the top</span></h2>
<p>Stanfield lost the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Federal_election%2C_1974_6066.html" title="Canadian Federal election, 1974">1974 election</a> to <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Eliott_Trudeau_9282.html" title="Pierre Eliott Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>. Following his third consecutive loss, Stanfield decided to resign the leadership. Mulroney was encouraged to run in the race to replace Stanfield and along with rival <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Wagner_035d.html" title="Claude Wagner">Claude Wagner</a>, both were seen as able to appeal to Quebec which had supported the federal Liberals for decades. In the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_leadership_convention%2C_1976_d0c5.html" title="Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1976">1976 leadership convention</a>, Mulroney would spend an estimated $500,000, at the time an incredible sum, placing second on the first ballot behind Wagner. However, his expensive campaign and slick image did not endear him to many delegates and he was unable to build upon his base support, being overtaken by eventual winner Joe Clark on the second ballot. Following the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_leadership_conventions_2b88.html#1976_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_convention" title="Progressive Conservative leadership conventions">convention</a>, Mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in Clark's caucus.</p>
<p>Mulroney took the job of Executive Vice President of the <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Ore_Company_of_Canada_c29a.html" title="Iron Ore Company of Canada">Iron Ore Company of Canada</a>, a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, he was appointed company President, and he successfully negotiated the closing of the Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup>. Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests.</p>
<p>By mid-1983, Joe Clark's leadership of the Progressive Conservative party was being questioned. Mulroney organized to defeat Clark at the party's leadership review. When Clark received an endorsement by less than 67 percent of delegates at the party convention, Clark resigned and ran to regain his post at the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_leadership_convention%2C_1983_c0d5.html" title="Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1983">1983 leadership convention</a>. Mulroney ran against him again, and he campaigned more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. He was elected party leader on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">June 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, beating Clark on the fourth ballot. He attracted broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec. Two months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Nova_2068.html" title="Central Nova">Central Nova</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, winning a <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a> in what was then considered a safe Tory seat after <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmer_MacKay_11a8.html" title="Elmer MacKay">Elmer MacKay</a> stood down in his favour. This is standard practice in most parliamentary systems.</p>
<p>When Trudeau retired in June <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the Liberal Party chose <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Turner_ef44.html" title="John Turner">John Turner</a> as its new leader. Turner called a general <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1984.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1984">election for September</a>. Mulroney is remembered for his performance in the leader's debate in which he attacked the Liberals for a raft of patronage appointments. Trudeau had outraged the country by recommending several patronage appointments to <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanne_Sauv%C3%A9_7b14.html" title="Jeanne SauvÃ©">Jeanne SauvÃ©</a> in his last days in office. Turner had the right to recommend that SauvÃ© cancel the appointments--advice that SauvÃ© was bound by constitutional convention to follow. However, Turner not only did not do so, but made several more appointments per an agreement with Trudeau.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ironically, Turner had planned to attack Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory. He launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on Mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Nationale_%28Quebec%29_cb56.html" title="Union Nationale (Quebec)">Union Nationale</a> in Quebec. However, Mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of Liberal patronage appointments.<sup id="_ref-Secret7172_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Secret7172" title="">[8]</a></sup> He demanded that Turner apologize to the country for making these "horrible" appointments. Turner replied that "I had no option" except to let the appointments stand. Mulroney famously responded:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<a href="../../../y/o/u/You_had_an_option%2C_sir.html" title="You had an option, sir">You had an option, sir</a>. You could have said, 'I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir--to say 'no'--and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party."<sup id="_ref-Secret7172_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Secret7172" title="">[8]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney.<sup id="_ref-Secret7172_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Secret7172" title="">[8]</a></sup>--usually paraphrased as "You had an option, sir. You could have said 'no.'" He could only repeat, "I had no option." A visibly angry Mulroney called this "an avowal of failure" and told Turner, "You had an option, sir. You could have done better." Many observers believe that at this point, Mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister,.<sup id="_ref-Secret7172_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Secret7172" title="">[8]</a></sup> as the exchange made Turner look weak, indecisive and a carbon copy of Trudeau.</p>
<p>In September, Mulroney and the Tories won the largest majority government in Canadian history. They took 211 seats, three more than their previous record in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1958.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1958">1958</a>. The Liberals won only 40 seats, their worst performance ever. They won 50.0% the popular vote (compared to 53.4% in 1958) and led in every province, emerging as a national party for the first time since 1958. Especially important was the Tories' performance in Mulroney's home province, Quebec. They won 58 seats out of a possible 75 after only winning the most seats in that province once since <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1896.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1896">1896</a>. Mulroney himself yielded Central Nova back to MacKay in order to run in the eastern Quebec riding of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manicouagan_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Manicouagan (electoral district)">Manicouagan</a>, which included Baie-Comeau.</p>

<p>The first Conservative majority government in 26 years--and only the second in 49 years--was considered by many to be a breath of fresh air at first, but growing pains soon surfaced. Many of his ministers had little government experience, resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals. Many Tories expected <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patronage.html" title="Patronage">patronage</a> appointments due to the long time out of government.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> Indeed, Mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage, including the reference to a colleague as "there's no whore like an old whore," and announcing "everyone up to the trough!" The new Prime Minister's handlers were concerned by his seeming unpredictability and rumours of drinking.</p>
<p>On paper, Mulroney entered office in a very formidable position. No other party crossed the 50-seat mark, and he could have theoretically taken Canada in any direction he wanted. His position was far more precarious than his parlimentary majority would suggest. His support was based on a "grand coalition" of socially conservative populists from the West, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_nationalism.html" title="Quebec nationalism">Quebec nationalists</a>, and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and the Maritimes.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, such diverse interests became difficult for Mulroney to juggle. He attempted to appeal to the western provinces, whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success, by cancelling the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Energy_Program_7e10.html" title="National Energy Program">National Energy Program</a> and including a large number of Westerners in his Cabinet (including Clark as minister of external affairs). However, he was not completely successful, even aside from economic and constitutional policy. For example, he moved <a href="../../../c/f/-/CF-18_2a00.html" title="CF-18">CF-18</a> servicing from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> to Quebec in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, even though the Manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup> and received death threats for exerting pressure on Manitoba over French language rights.<sup id="_ref-Newman427_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Newman427" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of Mulroney's main priorities, at least publicly, was to rein in the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deficit.html" title="Deficit">deficit</a>, which was running into the billions of dollars. However, the country's <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debt.html" title="Debt">debt</a> increased substantially through his term. His attempts to cut spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises. Also impeding his progress was the Liberal controlled <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Senate_c1b3.html" title="Canadian Senate">Senate</a>, led by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_MacEachen_9025.html" title="Allan MacEachen">Allan MacEachen</a>, which took on a very assertive role in legislation, forcing the government to compromise some points.</p>
<p>A major undertaking by Mulroney's government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity. Mulroney wanted to include Quebec in a new agreement with the rest of Canada. Quebec was the only province that did not sign the new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Canada_20b2.html" title="Constitution of Canada">Canadian constitution</a> negotiated by <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> in 1982. In 1987, Mulroney negotiated the <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meech_Lake_Accord_6d9a.html" title="Meech Lake Accord">Meech Lake Accord</a> with the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_%28Canada%29_f2b0.html" title="Premier (Canada)">provincial premiers</a>, a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy Quebec's demand for recognition as a "<a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinct_society.html" title="Distinct society">distinct society</a>" within Canada, and to devolve some powers to the provinces.</p>
<p>The Air India Flight 182 bombing which originated in Montreal happened during this first term. This was considered the largest terrorist act before Sept 11, 2001 with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney given that the majority of victims were Canadian or lived in Canada. Many Indo-Canadians considered this to be a racist act in that Mulroney didn't consider them to be true Canadian citizens because they were not of Anglo descent. Further to this, there were several warnings from the Indian government to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights. Questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[14]</a></sup>. A public inquiry into the Air India bombing is currently underway to answer some of these questions.</p>
<p>Another priority was the privatization of many of Canada's <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_corporation.html" title="Crown corporation">crown corporations</a>. In 1984, the Government of Canada held 61 different crown corporations.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[15]</a></sup> It sold off 23 of them. Air Canada was completely privatized by 1989, although the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/A-10.1/text.html" class="external text" title="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/A-10.1/text.html" rel="nofollow">Air Canada Public Participation Act</a> continued to make certain requirements of the airline. <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petro-Canada_80f3.html" title="Petro-Canada">Petro-Canada</a> would later be privatized.</p>
<p>Mulroney's government actively opposed the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> regime in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. Mulroney met with many opposition leaders throughout his ministry. His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere. Also, external affairs minister Joe Clark was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously-isolated <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopia.html" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> to lead the Western response to the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_-_1985_famine_in_Ethiopia_7078.html" title="1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia">1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia</a>; Clark landed in <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addis_Ababa_a075.html" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a> so quickly he had not even seen the initial <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">CBC</a> report that had created the initial and strong public reaction. Canada's response was overwhelming and led the US and Britain to follow suit almost immediately â€” an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time, since Ethiopia had a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> regime and had previously been isolated by Western governments.</p>
<p>The government took a strong stand against the U.S. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandinista.html#Sandinistas_vs._Contras" title="Sandinista">intervention</a> in <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua.html" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> under Reagan, and accepted <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugees</a> from <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Salvador_2636.html" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guatemala.html" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, and other countries with regimes supported directly by the Reagan administration.</p>
<p>Near the end of his first term, Mulroney closed a dark chapter in Canadian history with a formal apology and $300 million compensation package for the families of the 22,000 Japanese Canadians who had been stripped of their property and interned during the Second World War.</p>
<p>During his tenure as prime minister, Brian Mulroney's close relationship with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> helped result in both a landmark treaty on acid rain and the ratification of a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada-U.S._Free_Trade_Agreement_a1d5.html" title="Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement">free-trade treaty with the United States</a> under which all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by 1998.</p>
<p>Critics noted that Mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> leadership campaign.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[16]</a></sup> This agreement was controversial, and the Senate demanded an election before proceeding on voting, although Mulroney planned on calling an election before the treaty had been signed. The free trade was the central issue of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1988.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1988">1988 election</a>, with the Liberals and NDP opposing it. With the Liberals gaining the initial momentum, a successful counterattack by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Gregg_3198.html" title="Allan Gregg">Allan Gregg</a> resulted in the PCs being re-elected with a solid but reduced majority and 43% of the popular vote. Mulroney thus became the only Conservative to lead his party to two consecutive majority governments in peacetime during the 20th century. In this election, Mulroney was elected as the MP for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlevoix_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Charlevoix (electoral district)">Charlevoix</a>, which included Baie-Comeau after redistribution of the electoral boundaries.</p>

<p>Mulroney's second term would be marked by an economic recession. He proposed the introduction of a national <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sales_tax.html" title="Sales tax">sales tax</a>, the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goods_and_Services_Tax_%28Canada%29_4ee6.html" title="Goods and Services Tax (Canada)">Goods and Services Tax</a> (GST), in 1989. When it was introduced in 1991, it replaced the Manufacturers' Sales Tax (MST) that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in Canada. A bitter Senate battle ensued, and many polls showed that as many as 80% of Canadians were opposed to the tax. Mulroney would have to use Section 26 (the Deadlock Clause), a little known Constitutional provision, allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint 8 new Senators. Although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney's use of an "emergency" clause in the constitution.</p>
<p>The Meech Lake Accord would also meet its doom in 1990. It was not ratified by the provincial governments of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manitoba.html" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_4e85.html" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland</a> before the June ratification deadline. This failure sparked a revival of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_separatism.html" title="Quebec separatism">Quebec separatism</a>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[17]</a></sup> and led to another round of meetings in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlottetown.html" title="Charlottetown">Charlottetown</a> in 1991 and 1992. These negotiations culminated in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlottetown_Accord_5e55.html" title="Charlottetown Accord">Charlottetown Accord</a>, which outlined extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. However, the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in October 1992. Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's unpopularity for the fall of the Accord.</p>
<p>In 1990 Mulroney nominated <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Hnatyshyn_9ef4.html" title="Ray Hnatyshyn">Ray Hnatyshyn</a>, an MP from <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatoon.html" title="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</a> and a former Cabinet minister, to be <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General</a> (1990-1995).</p>
<p>The worldwide <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recession.html" title="Recession">recession</a> of the early 1990s further exacerbated the government's financial situation. His inability to improve the government's finances, as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it was a major factor in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base. Canada also suffered from the "Made in Canada Recession," in which the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Canada_e4fa.html" title="Bank of Canada">Bank of Canada</a> experimented with a <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_inflation.html" title="Zero inflation">zero inflation</a> policy. With Mulroney's permission, the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Canada_e4fa.html" title="Bank of Canada">Bank of Canada</a> raised interest rates, exacerbating the hardship experienced by Canadians. The <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Canada_e4fa.html" title="Bank of Canada">Bank of Canada</a> was the only central bank in the industrialized world to attempt to reach <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_inflation.html" title="Zero inflation">zero inflation</a> and the experiment was an abject failure, which saw many ordinary people lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Mulroney supported the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> coalition during the 1991 <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a> and when the UN authorized full use of force in the operation, Canada sent a <a href="../../../c/f/1/CF18_7abe.html" title="CF18">CF18</a> squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Regiment_be9d.html" title="Royal Canadian Regiment">Royal Canadian Regiment</a> to safeguard these ground elements. In August he sent the destroyers <a href="../../../h/m/c/HMCS_Terra_Nova_358c.html" title="HMCS Terra Nova">HMCS <i>Terra Nova</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/c/HMCS_Athabaskan_5b4b.html" title="HMCS Athabaskan">HMCS <i>Athabaskan</i></a> to enforce the trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship <a href="../../../h/m/c/HMCS_Protecteur_df66.html" title="HMCS Protecteur">HMCS <i>Protecteur</i></a> was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces. When the air war began, Canada's planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the fighting on <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in 1974 that Canadian forces participated directly in combat operations.</p>
<p>For the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Forces_060a.html" title="Canadian Forces">Canadian Forces</a>, the Mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment. Most members of the CF welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services, replacing the single green uniform worn since unification (1967-70). A White Paper proposed boosting the CF's combat capability, which had, according to Canadian Defence Quarterly, declined so badly that Canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the Gulf War had it desired to. The CF in this period did undergo a much-needed modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms. Many proposed reforms, however, failed to occur, and according to historian <a href="../../../j/2E/l/J.L._Granatstein_e9ca.html" title="J.L. Granatstein">J.L. Granatstein</a>, Mulroney "raised the military's hopes repeatedly, but failed to deliver." In 1984, he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to 92,000 troops, but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below 80,000 by 1993. This was, however, in step with other NATO countries after the end of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_%281985-1991%29_9a2a.html" title="Cold War (1985-1991)">Cold War</a> <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/mr112-e.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/mr112-e.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The Mulroney government would undertake a defence policy review, publishing a new statement in late 1991, but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the post-Cold War era was arrived at before the government's defeat in 1993. According to Granatstein, this meant that Canada was not able to live up to its post-Cold War military commitments.</p>
<p>The decline of <a href="../../../c/o/d/Cod.html" title="Cod">cod</a> stocks in Atlantic Canada led the Mulroney government to impose a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moratorium.html" title="Moratorium">moratorium</a> on the cod fishery there, putting an end to a large portion of the Newfoundland fishing industry, and causing serious economic hardship. The government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the Atlantic provinces.</p>
<p>The environment was a key focus of Mulroney's government, as Canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the UN Conference on the Environment. His government added significant new national parks (<a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Peninsula_b4db.html" title="Bruce Peninsula">Bruce Peninsula</a>, South Moresby and Grasslands), and passed the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Environmental_Protection_Act_90c9.html" title="Canadian Environmental Protection Act">Canadian Environmental Protection Act</a>.</p>

<p>Widespread public resentment of the <a href="../../../g/s/t/GST_65fa.html" title="GST">GST</a>, the fracturing of his political coalition, an economic slump, and his inability to resolve the Quebec situation caused Mulroney's popularity to decline considerably during his next term. An ominous sign was a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> by-election in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> riding of <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaver_River_%28electoral_district%29_b7aa.html" title="Beaver River (electoral district)">Beaver River</a>.

This turned out to be the first sign that Mulroney's grand coalition was coming apart at the seams; the PCs had dominated Alberta's federal politics since <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1968.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1968">1968</a>. Another sign came after the failure of Meech Lake, when Bouchard and several other Tories broke with the party to form the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois">Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois</a>, a pro-<a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_sovereignty_movement.html" title="Quebec sovereignty movement">sovereigntist</a> party.</p>
<p>Mulroney entered <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> facing a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1993.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1993">statutory general election</a>. By this time, his approval ratings had dipped into the teens, and were at 11% in a 1992 <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallup_poll.html" title="Gallup poll">Gallup poll</a>, making him one of the most (if not the most) unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in Canada in the 1940s.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[18]</a></sup> The consensus was that Mulroney would be heavily defeated by <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien_401f.html" title="Jean ChrÃ©tien">Jean ChrÃ©tien</a> and the Liberals if he led the Tories into the next election--ironically, the same situation that led to Trudeau's departure from the scene nine years earlier. He announced his retirement from politics in February and was replaced as Prime Minister by <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_National_Defence_%28Canada%29_e778.html" title="Minister of National Defence (Canada)">Defence Minister</a> <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Campbell_d510.html" title="Kim Campbell">Kim Campbell</a> in June.</p>
<p>In his waning days in office, Mulroney made several decisions that hampered the Tory campaign later that year. He took a lavish international "farewell" tour<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[19]</a></sup> mostly at taxpayers' expense, without transacting any official business. Also, by the time he handed power to Campbell, there were only two-and-a-half months left in the Tories' five-year mandate. Mulroney also did not immediately vacate <a href="../../../2/4/_/24_Sussex_Drive_2a89.html" title="24 Sussex Drive">24 Sussex Drive</a> after Campbell was sworn in as Prime Minister â€” as their new private residence in Montreal was still undergoing renovations, Brian and Mila Mulroney did not move out of 24 Sussex until their new home was ready. Instead, Campbell took up residence at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrington_Lake_2a3d.html" title="Harrington Lake">Harrington Lake</a>, the Prime Minister's official summer retreat.</p>
<p>In her memoirs, <i>Time and Chance,</i> as well as in her response in the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a></i> to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Mulroney_Tapes_213a.html" title="The Secret Mulroney Tapes">The Secret Mulroney Tapes</a>,</i> Campbell complained that Mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the Progressive Conservatives' tattered reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off. Campbell went as far as to claim that Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election, and wanted a "scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity" rather than a true successor.</p>
<p>The 1993 election was an unmitigated disaster for the Tories. The oldest party in Canada was reduced from a majority to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level. The 149-seat loss far exceeded the 95-seat loss the Liberals suffered in 1984. As an example of the antipathy toward Mulroney, his former riding fell to the Bloc by a lopsided margin; the Tory candidate finished a distant third, with only 6,800 votes--just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Mulroney_5ffd.html" title="Edit section: Airbus affair">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Airbus affair</span></h3>
<p>In 1997, Mulroney accepted a $2 million settlement to a lawsuit he had brought against the Government of Canada. At issue were allegations that Mulroney had accepted bribes in the so-called "<a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_affair.html" title="Airbus affair">Airbus affair</a>" concerning government contracts. The government said the charges could not be substantiated. The principal <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a> investigator on the case resigned a year later. The government later dropped the investigation entirely.</p>
<p>But Mulroney's actions continue to be the source of controversy. After stepping down as Prime Minister, Mulroney accepted $300,000 in cash from <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karlheinz_Schreiber_356f.html" title="Karlheinz Schreiber">Karlheinz Schreiber</a>, a German-Canadian businessman. The cash changed hands in three meetings in hotels over an 18 month period, beginning in 1993. Schreiber had at his disposal $20 million from Airbus for the payment of secret commissions. CBC television reported on February 8, 2006<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[21]</a></sup> that the money Schreiber paid to Mulroney originated in a Swiss bank account code-named "Frankfurt" which Schreiber also used to pay the secret Airbus commissions. $500,000 was transferred from "Frankfurt" to an account in ZÃ¼rich code-named "BRITAN" on July 26, 1993, from which withdrawals totalling $300,000 were made in 1993-4. But there is no evidence that Mulroney was aware of the source of the funds. Nor is there any evidence that Mulroney accepted bribes in the Airbus affair. But the appearance of illegal behaviour persisted.</p>
<p>Through a spokesman, Mulroney said Schreiber paid him the money for consulting services to promote Schreiber's pasta business. In the February 2006 interview with CBC television, Schreiber scoffed at the claim, saying the only (pasta-related) service Mulroney ever performed was sending him a brochure. "What had he done for the money? Well, I learned to my great surprise that he worked with me on spaghetti." Schreiber said the money was a gift made to assist Mulroney in the transition to private life.</p>
<p>For many years, Mulroney did not acknowledge receiving money from Schreiber. The payments were not disclosed in Mulroney's lawsuit and Mulroney testified under oath that he "never had any dealings" with Schreiber and knew him only "peripherally". According to the February 2006 CBC article, "In 1999, a spokesman for Mulroney denied any money was exchanged. But in 2003, Mulroney indirectly acknowledged he did receive money from Schreiber but as payment for his help in promoting Schreiber's pasta business." In his 2004 book "A Secret Trial," former law professor William Kaplan describes Mulroney's testimony as evasive, incomplete and misleading --but concludes that it did not rise to the level of perjury.</p>
<p>Schreiber is currently incarcerated in Canada. Having exhausted almost all recourses in a legal battle that lasted years, Schreiber is awaiting extradition to Germany, where he is at the centre of a bribery scandal that helped bring down the government. Mulroney supporters question Schreiber's credibility. Mulroney said he was "as clean as a whistle" in accepting the payment because he declared the money and paid tax on it. But the former Prime Minister's reputation was further tarnished, after the years of corruption scandals that his government had suffered.</p>

<p>In February 2005, Mulroney was diagnosed with a lesion on one of his lungs. In his youth, Mulroney had been a heavy smoker.

It was not until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">April 19</a> that his son, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Mulroney_032b.html" title="Ben Mulroney">Ben Mulroney</a>, announced he was recovering and would soon be released.</p>

Based in large part on unguarded remarks from the former prime minister which Newman had taped with Mulroney's knowledge, the book set off national controversy. Newman had been given unfettered access to Mulroney for a thorough biography. Newman claims Mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[22]</a></sup> After the falling out, Mulroney began work on his autobiography, without Newman's help. Mulroney himself has declared that he showed poor judgement in making such unguarded statements, but he says that he will have to live with it.</p>
<p>This led Mulroney to respond at the annual Press Gallery Dinner in Ottawa, <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">22 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Mulroney_5ffd.html" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>Mulroney's legacy is complicated and even emotional. Mulroney makes the case that his once radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments, and regards this as vindication.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[25]</a></sup> His Deputy Prime Minister <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Mazankowski_1fb5.html" title="Don Mazankowski">Don Mazankowski</a> said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as, "Dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century." Mulroney's legacy in Canada is associated mostly with the 1988 Free Trade Agreement<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[26]</a></sup> and the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goods_and_Services_Tax_fad8.html" title="Goods and Services Tax">Goods and Services Tax</a>.</p>
<p>Although the Tories were re-elected in 1988 campaigning on free trade, they only won with 43% of the popular vote, compared to 56% of the vote which went to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberals</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">NDP</a> who campaigned mostly against the agreement. However, when the Liberals under Jean ChrÃ©tien came to office in 1993 promising to re-negotiate key parts of the agreement, they continued the deal with only slight changes, and signed the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement_7224.html" title="North American Free Trade Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> which expanded the free trade area to include Mexico. Environmentalists, social activists, nationalists, labour leaders and members of the cultural community continue to complain today of alleged injustices Canada faces due to free trade.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_inflation.html" title="Zero inflation">zero inflation</a> policy pursed by the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Canada_e4fa.html" title="Bank of Canada">Bank of Canada</a> during Mulroney's tenure caused considerable economic hardship to individuals and businesses alike. As a result, the Canadian economy did not emerge from recession until well after the U.S. economy. Although this can be explained parlty by structural adjustments that resulted from <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade_agreement.html" title="Free trade agreement">free trade agreement</a>, the policy of <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_inflation.html" title="Zero inflation">zero inflation</a> hurt the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>The visibility of the GST proved to be very unpopular. The GST was created to help eliminate the ever growing deficit and to replace the hidden Manufacturer's sales tax (which Mulroney claimed was hurting business). Mulroney's usage of a rare Constitutional clause to push the tax through,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[27]</a></sup> prices not falling very much with the MST removed, and the "in your face" nature of the tax would infuriate politicians and/or the public. Mulroney's supporters argue that the GST helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit, and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable. Liberals have promised to remove this tax for years however, despite 12 years in office the tax remains intact. Only the recent conservative government has begun to reduce the tax.</p>
<p>At the international level, Mulroney was one of Canada's most influential prime ministers. His emphasis on strong personal relationships with other leaders made him a successful advocate in fighting apartheid within the Commonwealth and beginning the process of mobilizing international efforts to combat global warming. His cosy relationship with the United States, however, led some to question his judgement and impartality.</p>
<p>Mulroney's intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many Conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years. His government had flirted with 10% approval ratings in the early 90's. Mulroney's honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media, by Canadians in general and by his political colleagues.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[28]</a></sup> His reputation for arrogance and "sleaze" would further alienate him. He remains one of the most unpopular Prime Ministers in Canadian history. In the years following his defeat, the Progressive Conversative Party was left in the political wilderness, shunned by most voters. Many remember Brian Mulroney more for his offhand comments, which often landed him in hot water, and for a succession of corruption scandals which rocked his government.</p>
<p>Social conservatives found fault with Mulroney's government in a variety of areas. These include Mulroney's opposition to capital punishment<sup id="_ref-Newman427_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Newman427" title="">[11]</a></sup> and an attempted compromise on <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion_in_Canada_1f38.html" title="Abortion in Canada">abortion</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[29]</a></sup> Fiscal conservatives likewise didn't appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_government.html" title="Big government">big government</a>" programs and political <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patronage.html" title="Patronage">patronage</a>. While Mulroney's views on these issues helped him to be electable across Canada, the Canadian right wing would fracture during Mulroney's tenure. In the 1993 election, nearly all of the Tories' Western support transferred into Reform, which replaced the PCs as the major right-wing force in Canada. The Tories only won two seats west of Quebec in the next decade, and only recovered upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late 1980s. The Canadian right was not reunited until they merged with Reform's successor, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a>, in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> to form the new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_de3b.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada">Conservative Party of Canada</a>.
