<p>OK, I've created the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Brighton_97f0.html" title="History of Brighton">History of Brighton</a> page and copied all the text(expect the IRA bombing bit, which has its own <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_hotel_bombing.html" title="Brighton hotel bombing">article</a>) to the new page.

<dd>OK, I've given it a go. I've just rationalised the history section. I think my new section names might not be quite right.

<dd>Looking good&#160;:) I see the Brighton Pier image has gone from all articles.

<dd>Certainly the article has a tendency to grow longer and longer, so I'd agree some changes would be good. There is probably scope for more separate articles, such as those on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_Pavilion_19a7.html" title="Brighton Pavilion">Brighton Pavilion</a>, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_hotel_bombing.html" title="Brighton hotel bombing">Brighton hotel bombing</a> and the new one on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Pier%2C_Brighton_c7a6.html" title="West Pier, Brighton">West Pier</a>.</dd>

<dd>There is certainly a case for moving some of this article's content onto the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighton_%26_Hove_3414.html" title="Brighton &amp; Hove">Brighton &amp; Hove</a> page, as suggested some time ago.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I suspect if you make such radical changes all at once, you might find yourself embroiled in a bit of a debate afterwards! Just a thought here, but how would you feel about popping your proposed new page into <i>this</i> page—temporarily—first? Not standard procedure, but it would diffuse any complaints because the article any casual reader happened upon would still be the one which has been developed by consensus (the current one), until the new page had been given a once-over by the small band of regular editors at least. This way any debate would be less destructive&#160;;) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 21:39, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I might also go about with a camera and take pictures of the major brighton landmarks, and add to the article. Is this a good Idea, or is there some limit of only a picture or two per page?</p>

<dd>There's no limit to the number of pictures on the page, but I've noticed most articles keep the amount of images to just a few relevant ones. But upload new pictures and from time to time we can change the pictures.

<dd>Erm, no. That's just misinformed. We shouldn't have <b>any</b> links on Wikipedia to external copyrighted images, except where it is unavoidable and no other image would be possible. Also you retain copyright on all images licensed under GFDL and cc-by-sa, it is just that you also provide a free-use license.</dd>
<dd>Instead, upload your photos to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Wikimedia:Commons</a> (there is a link on the right of the external links section of the article page) and add them to [[Category:Brighton]].

<dd>Jooler, are you referring to the history of the <i>Brighton</i> article? I can't see what you mean in the West Pier one. But it's true that there are more photos available. I added one of them recently (the separated West Pier article had none when I first saw it) but didn't add them all since there is relatively little text and (on my wide-ish screen anyway) they'd have dribbled off down the page... not that there's any policy against that!&#160;;) If you'd like to add more pics, what about the other(s) on the Brighton page? – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 20:53, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anybody know if i could fnd any information on the Brighton riots regarding the mods and rockers conflicts?</p>

<dd>Brighton's council is one of the greenest in the country with a comprehensive recylcling and waste managment schemes leading to record council tax. the labour mp drives a autogas powered car and the city has a cycle lane network as well as excelent public transport.</dd>

<dd>At one point in about 1986 brighton was declared a nuclear free zone - until someone pointed out that the nuclear waste from Dungeness power station passed through the town on a regular basis in the dead of night. havent heard anything about it since - wonder if it still passes through?.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The best (almost contemporary) reference concerning the mods &amp; rockers clashes - not exactly riots - can be found in the encyclopedic work 'Life in Brighton from the Earliest Times to the Present' by Clifford Musgrave 1970. it is expensive to buy but local library will have it. alternatively look at the archives of the 'evening argus' held at brighton library. A spate of conflicts took place first in the late 60's early 70's these are the ones featuring in the film quadrophenia - they were then were nostalgicaly re-introduced in the mid to late 80's partly perhaps due to a contemporary revival of the film and all things mod. &#160;:<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidParfitt_fb4e.html" title="User:DavidParfitt">DavidP</a> 14:47, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely, but the local authority's "local plan", the set of documents which guide planning and development, cover both the Brighton and Hove areas of the city, and in the light of that, the King Alfred stuff is of interest when compared with the marina development (which is in the Brighton part of the city.) And by the way, my apologies for using the "city of Brighton &amp; Hove" as a justification of anything. I hate the city nonsense. Nobody I know in either town wanted it, except Simon Fanshawe. But it's the current reality so it makes sense to refer to Hove issues when describing Brighton ones. <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant">Kierant</a> 02:12, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone under 75 actually see Hove as more desirable? It's God's waiting room and that should be reflected more in the article. From reading the article one would think that Brighton is nasty and scummy whereas Hove is more respectable, this plain isn't true, there are plenty of well-off, or even not so well-off places in Brighton which aren't scummy or worth slandering in favour of the boredom of Hove.</p>

<dd>To report a POV is not in itself a POV. I'm going to reinstate the "Hove actually" para. It's an important part of the culture of Brighton and something everyone in Brighton knows about. And the point is it is "actually" a comment about Brighton as much as Hove. Q:"So you live in Brighton? - A:"No, Hove actually". As for the word "desirable" it is only a POV if the article says it is true. To report that it is viewed by some as more desirable is not POV. See the bottom of <a href="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/archive/2003_10_01_index.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.janeandrichard.co.uk/blog/archive/2003_10_01_index.xml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (notice that it's the Odeon in Brighton), also note that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Argus_1500.html" title="The Argus">The Argus</a> use the phrase all the bloody time <a href="http://search.theargus.co.uk/searchresults.asp?p2bq=hove+actually" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.theargus.co.uk/searchresults.asp?p2bq=hove+actually" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>Argh, where to put an indented reply, before or after the vote!?&#160;;-) I broadly agree, but I'd favour slightly expanding what's acceptable. Precise definitions are going to be problematic but I think good choices are sites which are clearly long-lived, and contributed to by either a very established organisation or a large group of people — and not sites run by the people who add them, which is usually vanity publishing unless the person happens to be the City Council's webmaster or something like that! Anyway, in this example, I'd suggest we also include "My Brighton &amp; Hove" because it's been going quite a long time and includes content not available anywhere else. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 17:43, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I changed the link because I think in the context of Brighton the name "Prince Regent" is taken to mean the same man who later became George IV.

<dd>Yeah, but I feel it's nice to have the definition of the term, as in the Pavilion article. I take your point and would agree were it not for the fact that the name "George IV" comes in the text very shortly after the title "Prince Regent", thus making it very clear that there are two different links available. Perhaps as a compromise we could make the main link on the name (George IV) rather than the title as it presently is?

<dd>I've uploaded a couple of these images to Wikimedia Commons. Ukbn2 asked me to link them in somewhere near the mention of the exhibit, so here they are&#160;:) I'd suggest one could be copied over to the main article, but perhaps at the same time somebody could write something about the new public library with its interesting energy-efficient building. Indeed we could also mention the fact that the redevelopment of Jubilee Street took 40 years to realise! (In the 1960s, some the adjacent streets didn't even appear on an infamous edition of a local street map, because they were all to be demolished... it was begun with the building of a Tesco (now Komedia theatre) but thankfully never completed.) However, I have no access to any documentary proof of this at the moment so I won't be putting it into the article. – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 13:22, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bit of insider stuff kierant - the once planned Tesco eventually became the "jubilee shopping hall" in gardner street and remained so for 25+ years until the site was renovated in the late 90's. The space where the new library sits [and the wheel clampers from hell] was an NCP car park for over 20 years. Much of the bottom of north road was hideously underdeveloped and delapidated as you will probably remember. The new library was finally opened after a usual Falmer/seagulls style planning disaster, eventually coming to fruition with mostly private funding for the site.</p>
<p>I dont really have much info about the library and find it stunningly boring. Predictably the area around the library, next to the courtyard, houses restaurants that really should be in the lanes and [yes] another Tesco metro. The whole site is privatley owned, and the road connecting north road and church street is one of the few private owned roads in central Brighton.</p>
<p>The Komedia closed about 5 months ago and venturing past it, looks like it will be divided into individual retail outlets again.</p>
<p>Local residents hint at "jubilee 2" just joking. <a href="../../../u/k/b/User%7EUkbn2_feb7.html" title="User:Ukbn2">Ukbn2</a> 14:47, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, the Jubilee Shopping Mall was quite enigmatic and always felt like a bit of a ghost ship. Komedia didn't close though, it's the Curve bar (a space Komedia let out on a long lease, which they quickly regretted I understand) which is changing, the theatre's still there and has in fact just opened a new cafe downstairs.

The reason I think it should be there is that it has been a major part of the direct action political movement in the UK (and has international contacts too) and (here comes the point) it's pretty hard to imagine that it could have evolved or had the success it did in any other town than Brighton. – KieranT 11:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,small point , the term "London-by-sea" originated from London gangster folklore. A place where "wrong uns" could abscond from the met etc<a href="../../../u/k/b/User%7EUkbn2_feb7.html" title="User:Ukbn2">Ukbn2</a></p>

<dd>You know, the phrase "London-by-the-Sea" has always troubled me. I've read loads of times that people refer to Brighton with that description in books, leaflets, websites, whereever you like. And yet I've never heard anyone actually say it. I suppose it must have been referred at some time in the past, but not now. It's one of those things that sounds good, but I'm not sure it's actually true.

<dd>In this case, I think it's you&#160;;-) I've heard it called that. I've even used the phrase myself. But we need a proper source and I take your point that reading <i>that people say it</i> is not the same as <i>reading people saying it</i>.

<p>I've just made a revert and given the edit summary as "revert (vandalism)" for something which <i>may</i> not have been vandalism. An anonymous user had added "It is sometimes known as 'the gay capital of the UK'.". The thing that's troubling me is that this is actually true. I've heard it called that, often after I've told taxi drivers that I'm going to get a train to Brighton! But saying it here, and so bluntly, seems out of place and likely to cause offence.

<dd>I have heard It reffered to often as the gay capital of Britain, for many years (keirant), by gay men from Brighton and further afield (even dallas and L.A) - It is usually said with a sense of pride, especially during 'pride' week. It is very thoughtful of you to consider the feelings of those who might be offended, but I think that the only ones likely to be so, are the minority of homophobes that may wander in here - and i feel certain that they would use a far more derogatory term (even if only under their breath). please revert the Gay Capital, I for one, as a long term resident, am proud of it being so. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidParfitt_fb4e.html" title="User:DavidParfitt">DavidP</a></dd>

<p>Saw this bit Kieran in your Brighton article: "In many ways, Brighton's postwar position has been a continuation of the 'fashionable Brighton'"</p>

<dd>The trouble with statements like that is that when the article gets edited over time, they end up referring to the wrong bits of text. And sometimes its very hard to track back and see who added what, when, and what was meant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I expect you're attributing it to me because I recently edited that section. (I'm not saying I didn't originally write it — I honestly don't recall!) However, the problem was that the previous user had left a single line-feed (not a blank line) after their edit, making the two paragraphs appear as one. When I edited, I simply didn't correct this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly I wouldn't dream of calling any of those estates "fashionable architecture" — they're all pretty bleakly functional. And that's coming from someone who <i>likes</i> a lot of 1960s and 1970s stuff.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The quality of this article</span></h2>
<p>I've just read through the whole Brighton article. I then read the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> article for comparison. I've also just read <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_perfect_article_2aff.html" title="Wikipedia:The perfect article">The perfect article</a> for guidance and inspiration. I've also been thinking about the number of contributors to the article.</p>
<p>I've tried putting myself in the place of a person from, say, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worthing%2C_South_Dakota_5fb8.html" title="Worthing, South Dakota">Worthing, South Dakota</a> whose never heard of Brighton, England. After reading the article has she been provided with enough encyclopedic information to understand the subject properly? In terms of <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia polices</a> does the article have a neutral point of view? Have we avoided <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Avoid_peacock_and_weasel_terms" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">peacock and weasel terms</a>?</p>
<p>I think most of the article does achieve those things. It certainly cites its sources better than the Liverpool article. But I still feel there is something wrong.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest problems is the number of contributors, their age, gender and perception of Brighton. I know I'm taking a risk saying that. I think I'm part of the problem as well. I'm a 32 year old male who has grown up, been to school and worked in Brighton (although really from <a href="../../../h/o/v/Hove.html" title="Hove">Hove</a>). My own bias comes out in my own edits. Its inevitable that I end up editing on subjects like music or nightlife that match my lifestyle or the local history aspect that interests me.</p>
<p>As far as I can see the only major <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/cgi-bin/contribution-counter?page=Brighton&amp;namespace=Articles&amp;dbname=enwiki_p&amp;hide_minor=on|major" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/cgi-bin/contribution-counter?page=Brighton&amp;namespace=Articles&amp;dbname=enwiki_p&amp;hide_minor=on|major" rel="nofollow">contrubutors</a> to this article (in recent times), include <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant">Kierant</a>, <a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/b/User%7EUkbn2_feb7.html" title="User:Ukbn2">Ukbn2</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeaweed_8015.html" title="User:Seaweed">me</a>. The rest of the edits are made often of just bits of unecessary "External links" edits (apart from grammar and spelling edits).</p>
<p>Going back to the hyperthetical Wikipedian from Wothing, South Dakota. Are we really providing her with the full story?</p>
<p>So how am I going to be part of the solution? Firstly I'm going to try harder to make better, more wide-ranging contributions. Secondly I'm going to encourage more people to make meaningful contributions to this article, especially people with different ages and backgrounds. Thirdly I'm going to continue to defend the article from the strange, insidious erosion that seems to occur.</p>
<p>For me the most compelling <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Avoid_peacock_and_weasel_terms" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia advice</a> is to "Believe in your subject.
