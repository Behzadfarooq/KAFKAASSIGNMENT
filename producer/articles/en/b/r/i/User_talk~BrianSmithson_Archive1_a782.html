<dd><i>the vidcap wasn't taken in 1936, right?</i> - I had a mental note to make the same change (the trouble with mental notes is that they aren't worth the paper they are written on).

<li>Wow, I hadn't seen that! The article stated that the character was dumbed down (my words, not the article's) when he went to color and the picture was listed as being Technicolor. The style is very 1930s compared to the TV show. Only other thing I can think of is a renewal of copyright, because I'm sure I never saw such a well-detailed Felix playing a lute on TV. &#160;:^) BTW, the article really does look great.

So I give you this Sunflower of Thanks for contributing content of exceptional high quality.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Daffy Dumas Duck</span></h2>
<p>I did some checking and found that name was used exactly once, in "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" (1950). It's the name Daffy puts on a script he is trying to sell to the studio. The script is a takeoff on the novel "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Baroness Emmuska Orczy. Alexandre Dumas was the author of "The Three Musketeers", "The Man in the Iron Mask", "The Count of Monte Cristo" and other tales contemporary with the Scarlet Pimpernel's time frame. It is reasonable to assume that this was just a joke (possibly a sly double-meaning joke, given the track record of the "Termite Terrace" guys, who brought us geographical names like "Bear Butte") and I'm guessing that some "ignoranimous", as Bugsy would say, took it literally. As a result, there are several Google references to "Daffy Dumas Duck" that imply that was his real name somehow. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:19, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

But, I saw him on television, in only the "Pup Named Charlie" show between 1987 and 1990, I don't remember what was the show about, and but it has been a long time. Because you deny these spinoff series that were on TV don't make any sense to me, COME ON, put these titles of the "spinoffs" back on there. You can find it on Google.

<dd>Brian. Sorry, I haven't been keeping up with my wiki edits in the last half year. The Charlie Dog Vandal has also come to my talk page under 4.160.219.227 and others if you check that page's history.

<p>It's not nonsense. I already have a pitcure of "Disco Dog", including Charlie/Scooby cartoons, but all printed from the computer, it's too late. Cartoon Network, along others seem to deny there's a 1970s cartoon series on television, would be thinking that I am crazy or a liar? How about the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and other English television networks, they don't know if this can be verified, and I am not "vandalizing" your talk page-</p>

<dd>Okay, I see your point; the two categories are not in conflict, so feel free to reinstate it. This does seem potentially problematic, however; should the same category be applied to <i>all</i> articles on Cameroon's ethnic groups? And since Cameroon is also considered part of West Africa, should <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndigenous_peoples_of_West_Africa_4c6d.html" title="Category:Indigenous peoples of West Africa">Category:Indigenous peoples of West Africa</a> be applied as well? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 30 June 2005 12:31 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Brian. No, not all ethnic groups of Cameroon (or elsewhere) would warrant inclusion in an indigenous peoples category; only those for whom there is evidence that specific recognition or claim is made, as per the particular sense of the term used at <a href="../../../i/n/d/Category%7EIndigenous_peoples_4ff6.html" title="Category:Indigenous peoples">Category:Indigenous peoples</a>. Although of course the vast majority of Africans may be said to be indigenous to the continent, originating there and nowhere else, only a minority of African peoples are identifying as <i>indigenous peoples</i> in the modern analytical sense of the term- see <a href="http://www.iwgia.org/sw2186.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.iwgia.org/sw2186.asp" rel="nofollow">this report</a> from the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Commission_on_Human_and_Peoples%27_Rights_0504.html" title="African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights">ACHPR</a> for some examples. Indigenous peoples would only be a subset of ethnic groups, if you like. As far as regional identification goes, perhaps inclusion in both Central &amp; West African subcats is appropriate, since as you mention the boundaries btw the two regions overlap in many interpretations.--<a href="../../../c/j/l/User%7ECJLL_Wright_6b89.html" title="User:CJLL Wright">cjllw</a> | <a href="../../../c/j/l/User_talk%7ECJLL_Wright_5710.html" title="User talk:CJLL Wright"><small>TALK</small></a> 2005 July 1 01:21 (UTC)</p>

<p>No one knows if there were a cartoon showing Charlie and Scooby as claimed, last year. I wouldn't startle. Despite with my parents ignorance, but they insisted there is a Charlie Dog cartoon series, and at only one time, told me to shut up about the character, but they deny all of that, and would later threaten them. But, I won't do it, now.</p>

<p>There is no written policy yet, but consensus is to skin table elements to match the rest of the site, e.g. image boxes. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 19:32, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With regards to image boxes, there was a big vote on meta a while ago, not sure where. The point is by using a stylesheet class, the appearance is tied to the skin, so it can be edited by the user, or change with different skin settings, as opposed to using whatever the user agent sets as the default. For an example look at all the box elements at the bottom of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html#External_links" title="Australia">this page</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 00:08, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
