<p>Can whoever inserted the photo of the Royal Family standing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace identify the personnel in the photo? There are some very obscure people there, if they are indeed members of the RF.</p>
<hr />
<p>The British Royal Family is always written with a capital B, capital R and capital F. Jesus, doesn't anyone here know how to capitalise <i>anything</i>??? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 04:46 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Come on, now, me old china, you know that isn't <i>quite</i> true. We had a conversation just the other day about how annoying we find it when national newspapers don't capitalise titles. Let's get this in perspective - we happen to like it this way, but it shouldn't be our number one priority.</dd>

<p>Yeah I <i>can</i> be sacastic!!! On the issue of capitalisation, an encyclopædia has to be very careful in the longterm, a lot more than newspapers that write today and are in the trash tomorrow. If they get it wrong, the next morning it is forgotten. Royal Families should be capitalised, unless when referring generically to royal families. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 21:26 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>The page says "Otherwise, as grandchildren of the Sovereign through the female line, the offspring of Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh would not have been entitled to use HRH or Prince or Princess until their mother became Queen, at which point, as children of the Sovereign, they would have been eligible." Is that true? I once read that the rule was changed for the children of the then Princess Elizabeth because she was "heir presumptive".</p>
<dl>
<dd>The children of then Princess Elizabeth were born princes and princesses with the style of HRH because her future children were granted those titles and styles in Letters Patent of 22 October 1948, not because their father is HRH.

<p>"However, civil list payments to the other royals were not abolished. Instead to them continued and the Queen pays an equivalent sum back to the Treasury. This was thought to be a technical arrangement to cover administrative and legal difficulties of stopping the payments. But Queen, saves about £536,000 a year in income by setting off the money she pays back to the Treasury against her own tax bill"</p>
<p>Is there a source for this? It seems very odd to me. (I'm not an accountant, though.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 14:19, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>(I previously posted the following elsewhere and was criticised for appropriateness. Perhaps it will be better received here.)</p>
<p>Although there are many other examples of self-indulgent and non-productive people, there are none that are so sedulously worshipped as the British Royal Family.

<dd>Only that I have a hard time understanding the amount of space given to this family, its ramifications, titles, and doings. Nothing they do will have the slightest influence on official policy, thought it may have done so in the rather distant past. Do we, for instance, concern ourselves, outside of the gossip tabloids, with the doings of Chelsea Clinton, or G. W. Bush's daughters? Is this an encyclopedia or a gossip rag? <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToo_Old_9c4f.html" title="User:Too Old">Too Old</a> 01:15, 2005 Apr 18 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, your analogy with the US is false because royalty and aristocracy are real institutions in the UK. What this comes down to then is your personal opposition to these institutions, which, while understandable, is totally irrelevent to what should or should not be included in an encyclopedia.

<dd>Very well, compare the space given to the British Royal family with that given to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Saud_0ea7.html" title="House of Saud">House of Saud</a>, a family with vastly more significance and power in the 20th and 21st centuries.

<dd>This is an English encyclopedia, so naturally there will be more people who know stuff about the British monarchy than about other monarchies. As to the other monarchies, this is an argument for having more information about those articles, not for removing information. The fact that wikipedia has uneven coverage of things is not an argument to remove detail. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 02:05, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First: it is an encyclopedia in the English language, not an English encyclopedia. Now, <i><b>detail</b></i>. The "royal" and "aristocrastic" families of Europe are all inter-related -- in fact are a single inbred family -- and have been around for a millenium, give or take several centuries. In that span of time, given the amount of screwing around that they are prone to, a large part of the population of Europe must have become related to them, say 40 million people. We are, of course, interested in them all because of the family connection. Prince Charlie's 17th cousin Joe Blow has just been killed by a bomb in Iraq. His wife, Bessie, has not yet heard, because she's busy "entertaining" Tom, Dick, and Harry in an effort to raise the bail for her boyfriend, who's in the hoosegow for pushing crack. Do we care? Why not? It's related to the British Royal Family!!! <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToo_Old_9c4f.html" title="User:Too Old">Too Old</a></dd>

<p>The use of TRH (presumably Their Royal Highnesses) on this page is confusing because in each case the link does not go to the pair, but to the male member of the couple.

<p>Someone made a nice chart of all the members.

<dd>I never edited it back, but I saw the chart. It just does not work. For example, it has a name and a separate title section. It doesn't work. Members of the Royal Family have merged names/titles. There is no such thing as a Princess of York. There are two Princesses of the United Kingdom who are styled Princess Christian name of York, because their father is The Duke of York. Titles and names are hard to put together in a table because it divides it up, and once divided its wrong. [User:Eddo|Eddo]] 23:30, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really don't think that the current members of the House of Hanover should be included. They descend from George III, who reigned in the 1800s. Although they style themselves Prince/Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, those titles are not 'officially' recognized in the UK. Furthermore, I took out a paragraph which stated "the Royal House of Hanover isn't really royal." That is completely wrong, just because the House of Hanover no longer reigns in any given jurisdiction doesn't mean it is no longer royal. <a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddo_c49f.html" title="User:Eddo">Eddo</a></p>

<p>"The British Royal Family enjoys a reasonably high level of popularity among the people of the United Kingdom. However, a sizable minority (between 15 and 30 percent) are opposed to it and would prefer a British republic." I cannot see a source for this statement. This <a href="http://www.populuslimited.com/poll_summaries/2005_01_18_SunRoyals.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.populuslimited.com/poll_summaries/2005_01_18_SunRoyals.htm" rel="nofollow">poll</a> from 2005 does give a figure of only 18% who want the monarchy abolished, but also gives e.g. 62% think they should receive no money from tax. I don't think that the statement in the article necessarily gives an unbiased reflection of public opinion.<a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDidsbury_ryder_5181.html" title="User:Didsbury ryder">Didsbury ryder</a> 13:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The British people have never elected a republican government. Every poll since 1940 has shown at least 50% in favour of the UK being a monarchy. Republicans dont like that but it remains fact that the majority of British people support the monarchy.</p>

<p>Stuarts were <i>the</i> <b>first</b> British Royal Family. I see above somebody's complaint about Hanoverian members still included. Why then, is the Duke of Grafton listed in the "extended" section? We might as well either list only the current Windsorians, or all members regardless of how they stand. Recall that the Mountbatten-Windsor family has not reigned yet, which would make it unfair to keep them and disclude the remnant Stuarts and Hanoverians. Distinctly English Royal Families are still around, such as those of the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Beaufort_c837.html" title="Duke of Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a> or <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Loudoun_63d4.html" title="Earl of Loudoun">Earl of Loudoun</a>. But then again, we are discussing illegitimates in the case of Grafton and Beaufort. I wonder how that managed to happen, especially when the legal Jacobite succession is in exile on the Continent. I am confused on the purpose of mentioning illegitimates in regard to this article. I would have to include myself in the article, because of many criss-crossing descents through legit lines that were never specified to succeed. Please, I don't think anybody wants that. Does Grafton or anybody like him need to be here? <a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_Address_b0c3.html" title="User:IP Address">IP Address</a> 09:53, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The illegitimate descendants of Charles II (or of the Beauforts) should clearly not be included - they are not British royalty. Nor is the Earl of Loudoun a member of anything remotely resembling an English royal family. He is simply the heir of the line of the Duke of Clarence. I'm not sure what you mean by post-Windsorian royals. The Queen's children and grandchildren are clearly members of the royal family - it would be ridiculous to exclude them. I would suggest that the article should largely confine itself to discussion of the descendants of George V. Brief mention can be made of the Duke of Fife, of other descendants of Victoria living in Britain, and perhaps of the Hanoverian royal family, since they claim the title of "Prince of Great Britain and Ireland," but this should be brief. Others simply do not belong. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 02:20, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it isn't only male line descendants of the current monarch. The Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge were still members of the royal family after 1901, for instance.

<dd>Do the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realms_2bc3.html" title="Commonwealth Realms">Commonwealth Realms</a> have a royal family? This seems to be the crux of the matter. There is no legal or formal definition of membership in the family, hence discussions of citizenship or succession rights is purely speculative. It should be sufficient to note that members of the Royal Family regularly visit Commonwealth Realms and perform public duties there, and do so as delegates of the sovereign of those realms. Their status as members of the Royal Family derives from their relationship to the sovereign, and nothing more. This was not only articulated by the Queen herself, as referenced in the Court Circular discussion by gbambino, but is more tellingly demonstrated in these visits and public duties performed, and by the fact that members of the Royal Family serve as regimental commanders-in-chief and in other public capacities in those realms.</dd>
<dd>So remind me again what is "rubbish" about this? <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 19:31, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They have <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_order_of_precedence_1828.html" title="United Kingdom order of precedence">legal precedence</a> in the UK (and rather high precedence, for that matter): no similar situation exists in any other country, which all only recognise the precedence of the Queen above their officers of state. That certainly looks like legal recognition of their status in the UK to me (and correspondingly lack thereof elsewhere). And the fact that they perform official functions as delegates of the Sovereign is meaningless — the Queen could appoint me as her personal representative in Canada if she so wished, but it certainly wouldn't make me a member of the Royal Family. (And what's "rubbish" is that you're basing your arguments not on the constitution or law of the countries concerned but on a single statement made by the Queen to a crowd and a couple of websites, neither of which can really be relied on as legally definitive sources. I could prove all sorts of rubbish if I could use "royal.gov.uk says so" as a conclusive argument.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProteus_e939.html" title="User:Proteus">Proteus</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProteus_c830.html" title="User talk:Proteus">(Talk)</a> 21:37, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's nothing rubbish about it. Proteus seems to think that because he says we, and the Queen, are wrong, it must be so. If he'd provide the evidence that debunks a book on the Crown and Canadian Constitution, the Ministry of Canadian Heritage, the Governor General of Canada, and the Queen herself (as he was asked to do) he might have more credibility. But so far only opinions on citizenship and place of residence have been offered.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I have no issue with this remaining as "British Royal Family" - it deals with the family's role in the UK, and has elements that don't pertain to the other Realms (such as the Civil List, Parliamentary Annuities, and peerages (since Canada blocked their issue in 1919)). <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Royal_Family_2789.html" title="Canadian Royal Family">Canadian Royal Family</a> now deals with their role within Canada.

<dd>Certainly, but it would be a long article if it dealt with their roles in every realm, one which might end up being broken down into separate articles, as is Wikipedia policy, anyway. As well, though it logically follows that they are the Royal Family of every Realm, currently I have no actual, tangible proof that the Royal Family is the Royal Family of any countries besides Canada and the UK.

<p>Ehhh no, not true "Astro train", Canada is officially a British Commonwealth Realm, alongside The United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, our flag has the official colours of Canada given to us by King George V, our military and cultural customs are influenced from Britain, our Royal Anthem is God Save the Queen, 9 out of 10 of our provinces have some depiction of a British symbol on their flags, we have a governer general and a Prime Minister, in a house of parliament, and no matter what you say you can not deny Canada's British (and French) heritage. They are officially the Royal Family of Canada, as of Australia and New Zealand. You know, I am not a "die hard monarchist", but I am of English and Irish descent, and am quite proud to be in a British country, for the main reason we are not part of (or as $%@#ed up as) the United States, is because we stayed British. And the main population of Canada is British, followed by French descendants.

<p>What sort of social rank would one have to bear in their family, in order to be a descendent of either?</p>
<p>How far up the totem pole, would you say?</p>
<p>This is intended to have broad answers and based on gradients of time and population, not going into specifics about exact descendents. About how common is their descent in the English or British genepool today?</p>
<p>I've noticed that American Presidents don't descend from either king, but the most common recent royal ancestor shared by many of us is Edward III. How common is it for anybody in the English or British genepool, to have a Protestant royal ancestor?</p>
<p>There is a general cutoff, isn't there?</p>
<p>Is it because of fratricide in the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors' "new men", or the Union of the Crowns, or the parliamentary union under Queen Anne (I can't think of any non-royal family descent from the Hanoverians within the UK)?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that there is a big difference between Plantagenet and Tudor descents, that the commons in all likelihood have the former and the latter is held by the lords. (just generally speaking) Then again, Tudor descent in the Welsh must be higher in general. I am further curious about pre-Royal Tudor blood in Anglo-British people today, since the status and/or concept of Welsh royalty/nobility is rather hazy in my mind. I found the Blevins aka Ap Bleddyn family of Powys in my ancestry, but have no real idea on what to make of it--or any other Welsh "native aristocracy". I might be able to find Stewart descent somewhere, from way back when. What percentage of Hanoverian background do you think that German colonists had in America?</p>
<p>On the British side, I have to go as far back as Welf himself...but any recent genetic relationship with the Hanoverians or the counts of Nassau are completely obscure. How does one research those other colonial people, such as the Hessians?</p>
<p>UK genealogy is relatively easy when focusing on English (and French) ancestries. What would a "national person" of Jerusalem (or Antioch, for example) in Crusader times be known as?</p>
<p>We say "American" for those Founders, but was there such a nationality-term for the Crusaders in their own domains?</p>
<p>I guess the term is supposed to be Levantine/Outremer, or "Crusader" as our national heritage says "Colonist"...</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. A) you can't really argue they are the "Royal Family" equally in every realm since "Royal Family" is just a convention, not a legally recognised institution. B) There seems to be some suggestion that the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html#Canadian_Royal_Family" title="Monarchy in Canada">Canadian Royal Family</a> at least is not necessarily the same thing as the British Royal family. C) "British Royal Family" is a well accepted phrase; "Royal Family of QEII" would be a neologism, and also sounds grammatically odd (it seems to suggest the Queen might have some other, non-Royal Family somewhere...) <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 07:46, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, in response to both your comments and those of Lethiere (see also below), I would respond that (A &amp; C) "The Royal Family" is a well-accepted phrase, ie., linguistic convention, in many, if not all, Commonwealth Realms, with no connotation that they are such by virtue of being British. Hence, news reports that such-and-such member of the Royal Family is visiting, say, Australia. (B) Parsimony should be the watchword here - the meaning isn't substantially different from one realm to another.I'm happy with a different solution, say "Royal Family of the Commonwealth Realms," since "Royal Family" alone is ambiguous. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 08:10, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They are members of a royal family by virtue of their status as princes and princesses of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They are not princes of Canada, or of Australia, or of Jamaica. They have no constitutional or political role in any of these countries. There is no Barbadian Royal Family, or Solomon Islands Royal Family. This is simply PC nonsense. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 14:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Royal Family existed as such by <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custom.html" title="Custom">custom</a> long before any laws or letters patent made them such in Britain. It's arguable if or when that custom was completely abandoned by each Commonwealth realm as it achieved legal independence. Since some citizens of these realms do seem to think of the Windsors as their Royal Family, and Windsors are occasionally sent to represent the Sovereign of those nations (not to represent the UK), not as paid employees but as part of their royal duties, I don't agree that the concept is nonsense. Members of the Royal Family also have minimal constitutional roles in the UK, and most Britons who accept them as their Royal Family don't do so because they are theoretically eligible to be appointed as <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counsellor_of_State_1eaf.html" title="Counsellor of State">Counsellors of State</a> (their only constitutional role in the UK not shared with other Windsor realms), but because of their dynastic kinship to the Sovereign. The Royal Family remains largely a <i>customary</i> institution, rather than a constitutional or political entity. The fact that it is paid out of the UK's <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exchequer.html" title="Exchequer">exchequer</a> is also a matter of custom, since this was the case even when the Commonwealth realms were part of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and certainly accepted its royal family as their own. That citizens in these realms, whether monarchist, nationalist, or both (here including Scotland) increasingly reject references to all aspects of the monarchy as British rather affirms than denies that the institution, including the Sovereign's family, should no longer be over-identified with only one of her realms. Yes, that's a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">PC</a> notion -- and a justifiable one, IMHO. In fact, it seems to me that this is more <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empiricism.html" title="Empiricism">empirical</a> than a matter of opinion: Do the media in these countries typically refer to the Windsors as "<i>the</i> Royal Family" or as "the <i>British</i> Royal Family"? If the latter, you're right. If the former, not. And if the former is the case, those here who reject such usage are not complaining as observers, but as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polemic.html" title="Polemic">polemicists</a>: They think of the Windsors as exclusively British, and think others ought to do so. Certainly there are Scots who insist the Windsors are really only England's Royal Family, and that titles and usages to the contrary are <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsolescence.html" title="Obsolescence">obsolescent</a>. Yet there are Scots who think otherwise. Clearly <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a>, a resident of one such Commonwealth realm, thinks otherwise. Whether he is wrong is, from a Wiki perspective, a matter of ascertaining Commonwealth reality rather than a vote based on the political perspectives of editors engaged in today's debate. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 20:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are the British Royal Family. Other than the queen herself, none has any official role in any other commonwealth realm.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - because it's not just about Queen Elizabeth's family, but the royal family in general.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - This article focuses on the Royal Family's connection to the United Kingdom. Though, much to John's chagrin, there is such a thing as the Canadian Royal Family (what else do you call the relations of, well, the Queen of <i>Canada</i>?), the specific information pertaining to that parallel, but conceptually separate group is covered elsewhere, and, as Figgy pointed out, the nature of one is actually somewhat different to the other. I might suggest an opening paragraph similar to the one at <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Monarchy_6f85.html" title="British Monarchy">British Monarchy</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Australia_2c0b.html" title="Monarchy in Australia">Monarchy in Australia</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_New_Zealand_05e0.html" title="Monarchy in New Zealand">Monarchy in New Zealand</a>, which outlines the shared nature of the Royal Family and leads to where further information can be found. --<a href="../../../g/2/b/User%7EG2bambino_708f.html" title="User:G2bambino">G2bambino</a> 16:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>One calls them, in fact, the British Royal Family.

<dd>Your example doesn't make any sense. Besides, as I keep saying to you John, you'll have to impart your vast wisdom on HM the Queen as she's clearly been mislead into thinking there's a Canadian Royal Family. After that you'll have to contact the Department of Canadian Heritage and the Governor General of Canada and tell them they're all wrong as well. And then I suppose you can start in on those who argue that the Queen's relations owe allegiance to the Sovereign in Right of Canada as a separate body to the Sovereign in Right of the UK. --<a href="../../../g/2/b/User%7EG2bambino_708f.html" title="User:G2bambino">G2bambino</a> 21:21, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, G2, I'm thinking that if this motion fails - as it appears it will - I'll simply begin creating separate articles, starting with Canada on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Royal_Family_2789.html" title="Canadian Royal Family">Canadian Royal Family</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Royal_Family_76fa.html" title="Australian Royal Family">Australian Royal Family</a>, etc (they are currently redirects). After all, no one has seriously argued that other Commonwealth Realms <i>don't</i> have a conception of the Royal Family as being socially, historically, and politically indigenous - if not physically so. If the discussion has convinced me of anything, it is that there are differences in the <i>concept</i> from Realm to Realm - but the same <i>individuals</i> are involved. I simply thought that it made more sense to include all the information in one article instead of splitting it into sixteen. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFishhead64_f25c.html" title="User:Fishhead64">Fishhead64</a> 20:22, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I see it, outside of the Canadian Royal Family, you'll be crossing into original research. Also, there was originally a separate Canadian Royal Family article, the contents of which were merged into <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a>. I don't oppose a separate article (Monarchy in Canada is getting excessively long), but it would be a relatively brief one. --<a href="../../../g/2/b/User%7EG2bambino_708f.html" title="User:G2bambino">G2bambino</a> 21:21, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
