<dd>Very good - I think I'll list it on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Wikipedia%7EBrilliant_prose_eabf.html" title="Wikipedia:Brilliant prose">wikipedia:brilliant prose</a> - though I think it could probably doing with being split into a section for Plantagenet, a section for Tudor, etc - with a main page that gives a summary. That'd make for easier reading, IMO. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></dd>

<p>Thanks -- I'll probably split it somehow into more logical chunks once I've finished the whole story, but for now the start of Elizabeth I is a reasonable place to break as she had the first machine-produced coins. <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a></p>

<p><i>This article refers to the <b>penny</b> coin which existed from its introduction in England in the reign of <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offa_of_Mercia_0a86.html" title="Offa of Mercia">Offa of Mercia</a> in the eighth century until decimalisation of the currency in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>.</i> - in the article; we don't need an extensive summary at the top</p>
<p><i>This article discusses the silver coins produced until 1820 (for later silver pennies, to the present day, please see the article on <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maundy_money.html" title="Maundy money">Maundy money</a>)</i> - stated what the article doesnt discuss "silver coins produced after 1820". What the article does discuss should be presented in the article itself.</p>
<p><i>and the copper or bronze coins produced from <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>.</i> - not sure whether these refer to pennies; i added it in and arwel removed it. since she wrote the article, we should trust her judgement on this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I removed part of your amendment because it was directing people interested in copper and bronze coins (pennies) from 1797-1970 to the Maundy money article, which doesn't discuss them -- this series of articles covers silver pennies 785-1820 and copper/bronze pennies 1797-1970, while the Maundy article covers not normally circulating silver pennies 1820-date. <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 23:59, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would agree with Jiang--I think the disambig at the top should be brief and only direct people to what isn't here, not what is (that's what the introduction is for).

<p>This article has been listed as a featured article lacking a picture, so I looked around and found a couple of useable penny images and combined them for 'contrast', as it were (in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPenny_EIIR_QRI.jpg_3324.html" title="Image:Penny EIIR QRI.jpg">horizontal</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPenny_EIIR_QRI_vertical.jpg_5f12.html" title="Image:Penny EIIR QRI vertical.jpg">vertical</a> forms). It's not great, but it's an image...<br />
Should we use it?<br />

<dd>It would be nice if we could find a picture of a medieval penny to compare with the late versions in these pictures. The history of the penny covers 1200 years, and these pictures only cover the last 80 or so! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 10:26, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_one_penny_coin_%28pre-decimal%29_4ab8.html" title="Edit section: English penny vs Frankish &amp; German coins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">English penny vs Frankish &amp; German coins</span></h2>
<p>The article presently begins, "<i>The penny, originally a coin of 1.3 to 1.5 g pure silver, was introduced to England around the year 785 by King Offa of Mercia, in the English midlands. Coins of the same value were in circulation continuously until decimalisation in 1971, at which time a new penny was introduced worth 2.4 times the value of the old coin. Offa's original coins were similar in size and weight to the continental deniers of the period.</i></p>
<p><i>The name penny comes from the Old English pennige (roughly pronounced "penny-yeah", IPA [penije]), sharing the same root as the German pfennig. Its abbreviation d. comes from the Roman denarius and was used until decimalisation in 1971.</i>"</p>
<p>This article really needs to start with a more accurate description. The penny was introduced by King Offa of Mercia as 1/240 of the Tower pound. The monetary system based on the penny, shilling, and pound persisted until decimalisation in 1971. The new penny introduced at that time is 1/100 pound, and therefore 2.4 times the previous penny.</p>
<p>I think using the term "value" to describe the <i>denomination</i> of a coin is very misleading. Inflation devalues currency. The English penny was increasingly debased (diminished in silver content) in the Plantagenet and Tudor periods. The coinage was reformed in the late Tudor period, returning to sterling silver by removing excess copper content. The new coins were about a third of the original sizes, and copper pennies replaced silver pennies altogether.</p>
<p>The present gives the impression that English and continental coinage was nearly interchangeable, which is grossly inaccurate. The Frankish denier was one third the weight of the English penny. Offa's penny was slightly larger than the old continental Saxon sceat. The primary German coin was the <i>schilling</i> of Cologne, which was about a third larger than Offa's penny. Charlemagne's monetary standard was only an accounting practice setting the ratios 1li=20s=240d.</p>
<p>The Germanic root word basicly means <i>small, thin</i>. Any small coin could have be called a penny, and nearly all medieval coins were very small, indeed. The old Saxon coin was almost certainly called a penny; the Saxon word sceat properly means "wealth" but was misinterpreted from some ancient texts to be the name of the coin.</p>
<p>Not all the above detail needs to be in the article introduction, but the errors should be corrected and a smooth introduction crafted.<br />

<p>I agree entirely that this is a very interesting and seemingly thoroughly researched piece of work. I would <i>suggest</i> one small change: In the following section, I feel that the word "value" is misleading:</p>
<p>The penny, originally a coin of 1.3 to 1.5 g pure silver, was introduced to England around the year 785 by King Offa of Mercia, in the English midlands. Coins of the same <b>value</b> were in circulation continuously until decimalisation in 1971...</p>
<p>Should this word be changed to "denomination"? A 1971 penny was almost valueless when compared with a penny of Offa's time, which would have had significant purchasing power. The two pennies are comparable only in name.</p>
<p>Sorry if this appears pedantic (it probably is) and also if, through missing a nuance of numismatist-speak, I am, in fact, wrong. As I say, I really enjoyed the article and the word usage just popped out at me as I read it. Best wishes, Dgriff 20:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>sorry, I hadn't read RgoNaut's comment who makes the same point in rather greater depth. Dgriff 20:46, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The penny, originally a coin of 1.3 to 1.5 g pure silver, was introduced to England around the year 785 by King Offa of Mercia, in the English midlands. Coins of the same <b>value</b> were in circulation continuously until decimalisation in 1971,</p>
<p>Should the text read "of the same <b>value</b>..." or "of the same <b>denomination</b>..."&#160;? A penny in 1971 didn't have the same value as a penny in 785, as the initial penny was made of silver and the later pennies were made of base metals - a penny in Offa's time could buy much more than a penny in 1971. The only thing the two pennies really had in common was their name.</p>
