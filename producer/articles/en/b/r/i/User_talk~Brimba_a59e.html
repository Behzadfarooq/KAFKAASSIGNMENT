<p>Nice work on this article! One thing I've noticed for a while, the 'Pests and diseases' section and the 'Extinction' section should really be merged as they cover the same ground; I don't know enough about the subject to do it confidently, would you like to tackle it? - thanks, <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 09:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! Have a good trip in Honduras. I don't think anyone will revert good work, but banana is one of the more frequently vandalised articles on wikipedia, so keep a check on the page's history to look out for silly additions and deletions at the start of editing (if you need to revert a vandal, click on the edition in the history immediately preceeding the vandalism, then click on edit that version and save with no changes, with 'revert vandalism' in the edit summary) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 17:21, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Brimba - thanks for the note; I'll take a look through, tropical agriculture is certainly a subject that's sadly missing on wikipedia (though alas not something I know very much about!). If you don't want it to get mixed up with discussions with other wiki-users on this page, you can make a sub-page for it at something like <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_Tropical_agriculture_f76a.html" title="User:Brimba/Tropical agriculture">User:Brimba/Tropical agriculture</a>, until you think it is ready for its own page - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 22:13, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brimba - thanks for the note, sorry I didn't have time to look it over before; I've given it a quick copyedit (things like wikipedia uses the IUPAC standard spelling for Aluminium, and added one or two extra links) but not made any major changes (not least because I don't know a great deal about the subject!). There are perhaps one or two general points (e.g. some of the fertiliser details) that might be better moved over to the <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> article (which says very little about them!) as they're not unique to tropical agric. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 10:31, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed your contributions to the permaculture site. Can you provide some evidence for the claim that growing trees is more energy efficient? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 13:50, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Hi Brimba</b>. I'm sorry it doesn't give you pleasure to agree with me. Life is supposed to be fun hey. Maybe I was a bit too hardcore about it all, but I thought it was really important to try and get some of the details out there, and flesh out the detials about the energy efficiency of permaculture in terms of input and output. I'm not going to have the time to contribute to the permaculture site, so I encourage you to continue the clean of up what's there. Some good ideas and research came out of the discussion it would be great if you and others can bring it together. I appreciated your comments re:ethics, and think that permaculture does have an important role to play. Have a good Xmas, and thankyou for having the patience to discuss things. Best. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 07:45, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just before I take off, i noticed your contribution to the Quality site, and thought you might be interested in the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_quality.html" title="Energy quality">energy quality</a> page that I've been trying to do justice to without much luck. But it's a start nonetheless ... you'll notice other links to Odum etc. etc. etc. I think there is something in the link between permaculture, quality, energy quality, Odum (et. al.), metaphysics of quality etc. To suggest links in an article would probably be OR though. I'd be interested in your thoughts. Regards, <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholto_Maud_822a.html" title="User:Sholto Maud">Sholto Maud</a> 12:29, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we might have a common interest in seeing underutilized crops used to provide food in developing nations. I've added a few odds and ends to your <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moringa_oleifera.html" title="Moringa oleifera">Moringa oleifera</a> article, for example. I've put together a category called <a href="../../../u/n/d/Category%7EUnderutilized_crops_31d7.html" title="Category:Underutilized crops">Category:Underutilized crops</a> (that's been CfD'ed and may therefore turn into a list). Perhaps we could combine forces a bit, and develop the general concept in WP a bit? <a href="../../../w/a/i/User%7EWaitak_08e1.html" title="User:Waitak">Waitak</a> 08:12, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the note. The trouble stems from "birth tourism", which is almost identical in practice but with different motives. Perhaps we shouldn't try to cover both in the same topic paragraph. Rather than stretching the one term to fit both uses, maybe we should split the birth tourism topic off into a seperate article? There are other sources available for it, I'm sure. What do you think?

<p>Well PoV is PoV, one group, MEChA's national constitution starts out: "Chicano and Chicana students of Aztlán must take upon themselves the responsibilities to promote Chicanismo within the community, politicizing our Raza with an emphasis on indigenous consciousness to continue the struggle for the self-determination of the Chicano people for the purpose of liberating Aztlán."</p>

<dd>I have replied to your reply on the talk page of the article. I see absolutely no evidence on the talk page that the Washington Blade newspaper (which was also sourced for its notability from two other sources - ABC News and USN&amp;World Report) was determined by the editors and/or an administrator as being a "poor" source for criticism within the journalistic community in response to Mr Cooper's own public statements a few lines above. In fact, what I think we have here from your edit is a case of WP:POV editing, esp since you called it "editorializing" -- the editorial page of a notable newspaper is in violation of POV rules?????

<p>What is the deal with completely deleting my entry out of that article without a good explaination. There are already many links in the article that source things. I don't think it would be appropriate to source every sentence. Then what would the purpose of wikipedia be? I see many other edit histories of that article that are attacked as if somebody is trying to censor a controversial topic rather than make a more suitable article. Somebody actually took the time to do all the google searches sourced in my image and claim it's a possible copyright infringement when the images were taken from public domain and that I'm supposed to go through some lenthy process to prove why it should stay. This sounds like a guilty until proven innocent situation. Still, just because you don't like the topic is no reason to attack my contributions. (Bart80 09:08, 12 November 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Hello, I noticed that you removed the merge tags form the econ growth pages. If you look at these pages, you will see that they are very much alike (first few paragraph are word for word.) I left them there because I wanted people to comment on my decision. Currently I have much work, but I will merge them as soon as I have a day to devote to it (I have never done it before, so I want to have some time.) I think it would be cool if you added the merge tags back and actually expressed your opinion on the merge in the respective talk. Take a look, and you will see that merging is defenetly right. Thanks and have a good one,</p>

<p>Well, that's an interesting point, but perhaps then the template is pointless? The present wording suggests that it's a deletion template ("someone says this should be deleted"). However, it actually isn't, because it's not part of any deletion process, and pages can keep that template for months without anything happening.

<p>Hi! Why did you reverse my changes to the page about Alex Jones? Why do you want his page to be so "toothless"? AJ IS fighting against The New World Order. He says so himself in every other sentence. Do you know better than him? (Seriously.) He DOES document conspiracy, not only sit and make up kooky "theories" about them. NWO is no "theory". I put up a hyperlink earlier to a speech by George H. W. Bush where the former president used this phrase himself. But, perhaps he too is just a "Conspiracy Theorist"?
