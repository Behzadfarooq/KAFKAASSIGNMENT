<p>Now that's an interesting question: Does the timer start when the article is created, or when it is moved into the main article space? Since moving a page doesn't restart the edit history... the first version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Lakes_Storm_of_1913&amp;oldid=9903145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Lakes_Storm_of_1913&amp;oldid=9903145" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <i>is</i> labeled "Revision as of 03:31, 3 Feb 2005" (UTC)... you might want to move it back anyway so it doesn't expire.&#160;:) And I'm not an expert, but it looks like you have the wrong image tag on the two maps (they're gov't pics not yours, right?), and none on the newspaper image (see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a>). But outstanding work on the references. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.81.231.127.html" title="User:68.81.231.127">68.81.231.127</a> 14:27, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but you used {{PD-self}}, which includes "I, the creator".&#160;:) I think you want {{PD-USGov-Interior-USGS}}. I don't think the front page print is public domain (it's not from a company that has been out of business for 50 years), but a fair use claim could be made though a rationale should be documented per <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.81.231.127.html" title="User:68.81.231.127">68.81.231.127</a> 15:54, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cosmotheism wasn't created 5 years ago, it was conceived of almost 30 to 40 years ago. Cosmotheism says that God is the final product of human self-directed evolution and thus is a valid link in the God Section of wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You'd put a 40-year-old religion created by a nazi who influenced Timothy McVeigh, alongside millennia-old religions believed by millions/billions? The religion doesn't even have its own article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">™</font></a> 17:47, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cosmotheism, had its own section (article), but people felt to diminish it by merging it with Dr. Pierce. This is unfortunate as this religion has thousands of members who follow it fanatically and its own web site, discussion forum and dedicated members. So what this really is an issue of is that the founder was racist and you don't like that. Because you make it a point to call him a nazi who influenced Tim McVey, that alone speaks for itself to your bias.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Historically, it's the tamest of the religions, although its history is pretty short, but its nowhere near the magnitude of popularity of the other religions, and wikipedia is not an advertisement. I know you'd like to categorize me -- it makes life easier. Go right ahead. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">brian0918</font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#BA0000">™</font></a> 19:02, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no idea, though using the Commons is always a great idea. Creating an image gallery (like gallery of Book of Kells pages) gives more control, but clumps of images that aren't directly associated with an article are sometimes depreciated.

<p>I would like to add an entry on the Battle of Spanish Fort. I was going to base it on your source for the Battle of Fort Blakely, but when I went to edit your article (to see the source), all I saw was the Sources section. How do I see the full source? I could enter the template values in manually but, I would want to get all the right hypelinks and all that. This will be my first contribution. Any help?</p>

Please take a look at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Spanish_Fort_5768.html" title="Battle of Spanish Fort">Battle of Spanish Fort</a> and make sure I did it right. Thanks!</dd>

<p>I am honored by your offer. I would embrace those responsibilities, and I believe I could a good job. Aside from vandalism, which almost always seems to come from mysterious IP addresses, I try to be very respectful and nurturing of the work of other editors. I would be cautious in exercising the additional power. I am retired from having a business with a peak of 200 employees, so I am not into power games. I have been enjoying working with you also, and appreciate your accuracy, focus, and the battleboxes. Thanks.

<p>I was surprised to realize that your unusual <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918">user page</a> and the red lk (not what most of us call a "redlk"!) to it, actually <i>appeals</i> to my own contrarianism, despite some initial misgivings. But would you consider creating more of a clear separation of your talk-link, so it is less overshadowed by the vestigial user-lk? Needs different color IMO, and perhaps could also profit from some kind of bracketing chars (not paren, i think, since they'd suggest the circle around the TM, defeating the purpose raising its prominence) and/or a short nick ("b918"?) for the user page.<br />
(I'm deferring detailed consideration of your admin nom, but so far i'm expecting &amp; hoping it succeeds.)<br />
Tnx for your attn.<br />

<p>Oh, how abt a blank between the two lks, so the underline between them is broken. I just tried that, above, with my own, and i'm going to take my own advice by adding that in my prefs.

<p>Again, I am flattered. Thanks, again. On my user talk page are some good comments from <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">User:Niteowlneils</a> about what admin duties entail. My <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_bus_yellow.html" title="School bus yellow">school bus yellow</a> article hit the Did You Know section of today's main page. Is your work limited to Civil War related items? We could use your skills over in railroads, where I have noticed the names of many civil war leaders from both sides have also surfaced. Maybe you have some interest? To whet your appetite, I could point your to some familiar names (if you're are not already aware). Also, have your read <i>To The Gates of Richmond</i> by Stephen Sears? A really good book about Geo. McClellan and the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula_Campaign_ba2d.html" title="Peninsula Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>.

<p>I left an update on my talk page since two of you are helping with it. The pics look good. 115 was a very popular model, among many choices on the linked page. the color one might also fit well for WP. 3 or 4 images wouldn't be unreasoanble, since the message was variety, 447 models in all!!

<p>Sears used the brand naming "Modern Homes". It occurs to me that this choice of wording (over house) was chosen because home tends to denote an occupied house/ However, I don't know if that differentiation was applicable then as it seems to be now. If the plural/singular issue is appropriate, then Sears Catalog Home would be best, since that is what the communities which have them and the books and publications seem to call them these days. So, I would support Sears Catalog Home as an alternate naming convention. <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 19:55, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I gave you my support. Sorry that I haven’t been adding more civil war battle articles it was just that school got rather busy for a couple of weeks. I am going to start editing more now that school has died down. bakuzjw (aka 578) 21:29, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I was editing Battle of Chalk Bluff I thought that it might be interesting to have a Union Victories and Confederate Victories Categories, it might be an interesting idea to play with. bakuzjw (aka 578) 21:58, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I like that idea. So, there would be a "Category:Union victories during the American Civil War", and "Category:Confederate victories during the American Civil War", or something like that, but what would you call the battles where nobody won? Could it just be "Category:Inconclusive battles of the American Civil War"?? Lemme know, and I'll get to work on it once I'm done with other stuff. --brian0918™ 22:10, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</i></li>

I have written this new article and a blurb for DYK consideration on the talk page. This is a good one. The <a href="../../../b/e/l/Beltway_Sniper_Attacks_c45e.html" title="Beltway Sniper Attacks">Beltway Sniper Attacks</a> perps were indigent and one just got a safe harbor from the death penalty by the March 1, 2005 Supreme Court ruling. What about the victims? No hope that either will pay even 1 cent of the hospital and funeral bills. The Brady Center went after the outrageously negligent gun shop (my opinion, but the settlement speaks to this effect) and the gun manufacturer and won a victory and some money for the families. Having run a bus company, I have usually sat on the defense side of our civil tort system, but here is an example of where it worked in a fair manner (IMHO).</p>

<p>thanks for your reply. I have no doubt you are a very valuable member of the community, and will do much good with your admin powers. My concern was not with "BAN THIS USER", or the "police", comments, which were both funny and justified, considering the context. I was more concerned that your</p>

<p>would in time, out of justified frustration, lead to ending disputes with the <a href="../../../z/w/e/Zweih%C3%A4nder.html" title="Zweihänder">zweihänder</a>. If this should happen, or if you are tempted to throw your weight as an admin around in disputes to which you are a party (it <i>is</i> tempting), I will humbly remind you of this conversation. Seeing the enthusiastic support you receive from editors whom I value very highly, I also feel I am in no position to lecture you, and I do hope my comments do not seem condescending. best regards, you have my support, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:07, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
