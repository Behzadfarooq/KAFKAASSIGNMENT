<hr />
<p>If you mean the changes brought about by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 then with effect from 30 April 2003 a British Overseas citizen (or a British subject or a British protected person) can register as a British citizen provided that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the person has no other citizenship or nationality (note - it is possible to be a citizen of another country without necessarily holding its passport); and</li>
<li>the person has not lost any other citizenship or nationality (whether by action or inaction) since 4 July 2002</li>

<p><b>Are citizens also subjects?</b> It's not clear from the article if a British Citizen is also a Subject. Would be good to clear up this old chestnut (long argued point). Fantastic work though, people, thanks. [mgaved 28 Oct 2004]</p>
<hr />
<p><b>No.</b></p>
<p>Section 37 (4) of the British Nationality Act 1981 states that "No person shall have the status of ... a British subject otherwise than under this Act."</p>
<p>People can hold British subject status under the following sections of the 1981 Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>s30 - former British subjects without citizeship connected with British India prior to 1949 and some women married to them</li>
<li>s31 - British subjects connected with pre-1949 Republic of Ireland</li>
<li>s32 - Minors registered as British subjects since 1983 (very uncommon)</li>
<li>s33 - Transitional entitlement to register as a British subject for a woman married to a British subject by virtue of s30 (expired on 31 December 1987)</li>
<li>s34 - provides for renunciation of British subject status</li>
<li>s35 - provides for automatic loss of British subject status should any other nationality be acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above it's clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the provisions for conferring British subject status do not extend to British citizens</li>
<li>any British subject who becomes a British citizen automatically loses British subject status, with the exception being a British subject from Ireland (s31) who can hold both statuses simultaneously upon naturalisation/registration as a British citizen. However, retaining British subject status is meaningless to someone who has become a British citizen. [24 June 2005] <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a></li>

<p>I am a british citizen living outside the UK. I gained British nationality by descent, my mother being born in Chagos island and lived part of her life there( a British Indian Ocean Territory). I am holder holder of a british passport , mentionned" british citizen" and would like to know if I can pass on my nationality to my three children, 9 yrs, 6 yrs and 1 1/2 years old.</p>
<p>I thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>Marie France Wang</p>
<hr />
<p>If you are a British citizen by descent and acquired this status by virtue of section 6 of the British Overseas Territories Act then it does not automatically make your own children British citizens. <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20008--a.htm#6" class="external free" title="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20008--a.htm#6" rel="nofollow">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20008--a.htm#6</a></p>
<p>There may be options available if your children are stateless (ie, have no nationality).</p>
<p>Otherwise, you would likely need to bring your children to the UK on settlement visas and apply for them to be registered as British citizens after taking up residence in the UK. The precise mechanics and residence period will depend on their circumstances.

<p>It is written: "The law on nationality was spread across many statutes, and much of it was unwritten. "</p>
<p>To me, statutes implies written. This contradicts the ending phrase. [2004.12.31 - JPiper]</p>
<p>Seems to make sense to (the law student in) me -- the law on nationality was spread across many statutes, but it wasn't exclusively contained in statute, being augmented by precedents handed down by the courts over the years -- is what I'd take from it. It could also, I suppose, be referring to the practice and internal rules of the Home Office etc. --Killiedaft 22:27, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I understand this correctly, you no longer live in the UK. If this is correct you will not be able to meet the residence creiteria to register as a British Citizen. However, if you are a BNO you do not lose your residence rights no matter how long you stay outside the UK. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 10:39, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While descent from the Electress Sophia may give rise to a claim to British nationality, it's primarily as a British Overseas citizen. Hence information on this section of the law has been mentioned in "Other Categories of British nationality".

<dd>However that part of the article deals with British *citizenship*.

<dd>It's not a part of British nationality law any more, as the Sophia Naturalisation Act was repealed by the British Nationality Act _1948_, i.e. it is pre-1949 nationality law. Given that we are now onto the 1981 Act, and have relegated the detail of most of the pre-1983 provisions to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_British_nationality_law_d9ce.html" title="History of British nationality law">History of British nationality law</a> article, the Sophia Naturalisation Act really belongs with the pre-1949 stuff there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, there will be some people still living who are BOCs because of it, but that will apply equally to any pre-1949 provision until say 2049, and there may be two or three further Nationality Acts by then. I have no problem with mentioning the Act in this article and referring readers to the History article for more information, but to put this into context, there will be far far more people alive who were affected by, say, the British Nationality Act 1965, than the handful of descendants of Sophia who may have qualified before 1949, but we don't deal with the 1965 Act in this article either. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 09:22, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By way of background, because British nationality law is so complex, in order to keep the article to a manageable size, detailed explanation of issues that relate to pre-1983/1949, or to categories other than British citizenship, were moved a few months ago to separate articles. A brief summary with a reference is usually left on the main page (because these can still affect the status of people today).

<p>In Citizenship by descent from 1983:</p>
<p>"In exceptional cases, the Home Secretary may register a child of British parents <i>by descent</i> as a British citizen under discretionary provisions, for example if the child is stateless."</p>
<p>I find this sentence a bit ambiguous, or at least clumsy.

<p>I've removed the comment (at least for now) "and is at the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor".</p>
<p>This is in the context of an exemption from the "Life in the UK Test" before 1 May 2006. I don't think the Lt Governor has discretion over this exemption, is there any reference otherwise?</p>
<p>As far as the naturalisation decision itself is concerned, naturalisation in the Channel Islands and IOM is at the discretion of the respective Lt Governor, just as naturalisation in the UK is at the discretion of the Home Secretary.</p>
<p>However, in the UK the discretion on naturalisation must be exercised in accordance with policy and since the Lt Governor's discretion on naturalisation is delegated from the Home Secretary, the same requirements ought to apply.</p>
<p>In the UK proper, naturalisation will not normally be refused if the statutory requirements are met, is it the same in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man? <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 18:57, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have attended my Citizenship Ceremony today, and I have thus acquired British Citizenship. I have a question for you.</p>
<p>The sheet entitled "Some Information for British Nationals", enclosed in the pack with the Certificate of Naturalisation, reads: "You now have the nationality shown on the enclosed certificate." However, I can see no mention of my acquired nationality on said certificate. I can only see that I have acquired British Citizenship.</p>
<p>According to the publication "Life in the United Kingdom - A journey to Citizenship" by the Home Office (in particular I refer you to page 17), Citizenship and Nationality are technically two separate things, although that section fails to provide clear definitions, and it certainly does not answer my question: What is my acquired nationality? I understand that I am now a British citizen, but am I an English national? Or am I a Welsh national? Scottish? Do I get to choose? If not, what is this based on?</p>
<p>(Please note my query is not about dual citizenship, on which I am clear.)</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is no such thing as an "English", "Scottish", "Welsh" or "Northern Irish" status. All British citizens have the same status in the United Kingdom, irrespective of what part of the United Kingdom they come from. In the Crown Dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man) it's different and you do need an additional 'local status' as well as British citizenship to be able to access full housing and employment rights.</dd>
<dd>In the United Kingdom, citizenship and nationality are not the same, that's because it's because it's possible to be a "British national" without being a "British citizen" - for example, if you are a British Overseas citizen or British subject <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 12:55, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you acquire British citizenship by descent from your grandparents? Let's say both of your father's parents were British citizens (and passport-holders) up until their deaths - wouldn't that make your father automatically a British citizen, and therefore you too, or does it "run out" if never taken advantage of by your father (e.g. he never applied for or held a British passport)? The article doesn't seem to answer this question, it only says from your father (but if your father got it from his father...). --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDub8lad1_c1b2.html" title="User:Dub8lad1">Dub8lad1</a> 22:54, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you can only inherit British citizenship if your parents are British citizens "other than by descent". So, in other words, if your parents have British citizenship only because they were born to British citizens, but outside of the UK or its territories, then you would not automatically get it if you're born outside the UK. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirty-seven_6aa5.html" title="User:Thirty-seven">thirty-seven</a> 15:54, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are quite right, the article does explain it, thank you. I think I was somehow misinterpreting "by descent" when I read it. That would probably place the father in this scenario in the interesting position of being able to claim British citizenship by descent AND British subject status by birth in the Irish Free State before 1949. I wonder, though, what would happen to the second generation born outside the UK if it was born (for argument's sake to two parents who were British citizens by descent) in a country with no jus soli. Presumably, to avoid statelessness, British citizenship would be perpetuated?--<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDub8lad1_c1b2.html" title="User:Dub8lad1">Dub8lad1</a> 19:23, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Birth in the Irish Free State prior to 1949 (even prior to 1922) does not confer British citizenship, other than in a few exceptional cases. It does allow for British subject status to be claimed, however this is not transmissable and hence the question of "by descent" or otherwise does not arise. <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 21:25, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Under the laws in place from 1983 (British Nationality Act 1981), there are some specific concessions to allow the second-generation born overseas to be registered as British, if the British "by descent" parent has lived for 3+ years in the UK before the child is born, section 3(2) of the 1981 Act. If child is brought to live in the UK for 3 years it can be registered as British "otherwise than by descent" under section 3(5) of the Act. Failing that there is the Home Office discretion to register any minor as British under s3(1) of the 1981 Act, this is often used to relieve statelessness, however Home Office policy does state that for the third and subsequent generations born overseas, there should not necessarily be a presumption that it is for the United Kingdom to resolve the statelessness issue. <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 21:32, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am an American citizen, my husband is British, born and raised there. We have a son together, born after we married. I have a daughter, who my husband has adopted, here in America. We currently live in America. He was consistently employed in Britain before, and would have no trouble getting a job again. Also, all of his family is there, so we would have someplace to stay immediately upon arrival. We are having trouble making a living here, as I became disabled, and am not able to work. I am awaiting approval for Social Security right now. If, in the future, we decide to move to the UK, would I qualify for any benefits before I became a citizen there? Would our son and (adopted) daughter be eligible for health care and benefits if we were in the UK? Would they even consider letting me in, since I am disabled? I would really appreciate a reply, as due to our current situation, we cannot afford a consultation with an immigration lawyer. I am sorry if I am not doing this correctly; I am new to Wikipedia. Thank you. THopkins 08:49, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thank you for responding; I will try those avenues suggested for the forums. We had previously contacted the consulate, and received conflicting information each time. Their main answer seems to be "Submit your paperwork and we'll tell you yes or no," which is no help at all, and a lot of money besides. Thanks again. THopkins 22:45, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is technically the correct description for a citizen of the United Kingdom? I cannot get clarification on this point, and both seem to be used interchangeably, although they both cannot be technically correct. And what was the exact status under UK law of the Irish before 6 December 1922? And their status prior to the Act of Union coming into place in 1801? Thanks a million. 89.100.159.69 17:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1. The correct term is "British citizen" since 1 January 1983- see the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Nationality_Act_1981_99be.html" title="British Nationality Act 1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a> 2. The Irish before 6 Dec 1922 were British subjects like everywhere else in the Commonwealth. They ketp that status until 1949. But when "UK and Colonies" citizenship was created in 1949, the UK was defined based on its borders at that date. So the Irish were not in general entitled to automatic UK citizenship. See <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law_and_the_Republic_of_Ireland_22d4.html" title="British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland">British nationality law and the Republic of Ireland</a> 3. There was no Irish statute on nationality prior to 1801. Irish persons under common law were subjects of the King of Ireland. <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 02:48, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the above-named section of the article, it says: "Before 1983, birth in the UK was sufficient in itself to confer British nationality ..." If I understand correctly, such nationals would now be British citizens. That is, possession of a birth certificate showing birth in the UK before 1983 is sufficient proof of British citizenship (unless it was subsequently renounced), regardless of parental details. This point would be useful to state explicitly, as a large number of people fall into this category and may wonder how to prove it (e.g. without a passport). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.15.4.77_fd64.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.15.4.77">74.15.4.77</a> (talk) 19:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>A United Kingdom, Channel Islands, or Isle of Man birth certificate (for someone born before 1983) is normally sufficient proof of British citizenship. The exceptions would be any indication of diplomatic status of father, or in the case of those born in the Channel Islands between 1940-45, evidence that father was German or from another Axis nation. The other exception concerns persons naturalised in non-Commonwealth countries (especially the U.S.) before 1949. However, in order to obtain a British passport, sufficient evidence of identity must also be provided and a birth certificate is not enough for that. <a href="../../../j/a/j/User%7EJAJ_273e.html" title="User:JAJ">JAJ</a> 10:29, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What was the nationality status by birth for those who were born in occupied British territories during World War II, such as Hong Kong and Singapore under Japanese occupation? Immediately prior and after the occupation, citizens of those territories would normally have British subject status by birth. If these people could not have British subject status by birth during the occupation, they would certainly be British subject by descent. The question is whether British nationality or "enemy" nationality law applied. What about those born to enemy alien? If British nationality law was recognised, would jus soli apply to them? It only says they are excluded from jus soli in Nationality Act 1948 (enacted in 1949) which was well after the war. This is one of the topics to be expanded in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law_and_Hong_Kong_e797.html" title="British nationality law and Hong Kong">British nationality law and Hong Kong</a>, any reference and pointers would be appreciated.

<dd>Occupation had no effect on the nationality laws. There was an equivalent exclusion for children of "enemy aliens" in the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914.
