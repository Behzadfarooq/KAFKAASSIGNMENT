<dd>Not so, Slim, i have no problem with 'liberated'.

<dd>Actually, I haven't found any evidence that Britches was set free from confinement. From the available evidence it seems that possesion of the animal was transferred from the University of California to the Animal Liberation Front.<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinick88_910f.html" title="User:Winick88">Winick88</a> 11:43, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, it would be highly unlikely that Britches would be able to return to the wild. The more likely course of action would be that he would have ended up in a sanctuary where he can be treated for any illnesses that he may get and could live out as normal a life as he can. Due to the way he was experimented on I would say that he would not be able to survive in the wild. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 12:03, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point is that the Animal Liberation Front must maintain possession of Britches.

<p>The term Liberated, which works best I think aplies here not in the physical sense as in he was liberated from a cage into the wild, but liberated in the political sense from suffering.</p>
<p>Stolen would be fine to use in the sense he is propety, because under US law at the time animals weree propety, HOWEVER the great apes project now gives certian semians rights, so this may no longer be the case. Also to ignore the fact the ALF considered they were Liberating him would be very unneutural <a href="../../../x/a/n/User_talk%7EXanax_33c5.html" title="User talk:Xanax">(talk)</a></p>

<p>I notice this article says the monkey was removed at 3 weeks old, yet over at the <a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_1be5.html" title="ALF">ALF</a> there is a caption claiming the same animals was photographed at 5 weeks with his eyes sutured shut.

<dd>From memory, the three/five week confusion is because the monkey was identified at three weeks as an animal they wanted to remove/liberate/steal, and the raid took place two weeks later, which caused confusion when the sources reported the ALF statement.

<dd>It seems that animals are called he/she in English. I remember my old english teacher saying that animals are not humans so one must use "it" instead of he/she.

<dd>Yes, she was confused. It is <i>acceptable</i> to refer to an animal whose gender you do not know as "it", but if you're talking about a pet then people generally prefer that you ask and use the correct gender pronoun: obviously if there's no way to tell, then you're stuck with "it". The main difference is that it is almost <b>never</b> acceptable to refer to a human being as "it": this is when you start stumbling into arguments like "<a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular_they.html" title="Singular they">singular they</a>".

<dd>Some researchers use "it" because they believe using gendered pronouns overly anthropomorphizes the subjects, and I believe some journals used to enforced this rule through their editorial standards. However, now most researchers are quite concerned with the well-being of their subjects and some signal this by referring to them with gendered pronouns, and most journals seem to accept this. This does not mean that researchers who still use "it" necessarily violate animal welfare codes, but it does sometimes signal a particular POV. --<a href="../../../j/a/i/User%7EJaibe_6dd3.html" title="User:Jaibe">Jaibe</a> 16:18, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anonymous editor has stated that the dictionary definition of 'stolen' is correct and using 'removed' is wrong. We have discussed this over at <a href="../../../a/n/i/Talk%7EAnimal_Liberation_Front_54a0.html" title="Talk:Animal Liberation Front">Talk:Animal Liberation Front</a> and the consensus appeared to be in favour of 'removed' as it is a less weighted word.

<dl>
<dd>My view on the matter is that 'stolen' even though correct to a degree, is a weighted word. Removed provides a neutral standing point that does not need a reference. To say stolen would require references to prove this - something such as a court outcome in this case as the scientific community (even the university it was removed from) denounced the tests that were done (see the prior discussion on the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Liberation_Front_22fb.html" title="Animal Liberation Front">Animal Liberation Front</a> page for a reference to this). So unless a reference to the outcome of such a case is provided I do not think 'stolen' should be used. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:16, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I do not support 'abducted' as it is also weighted and has the implications mentioned above. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 19:25, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I think that "stolen" correctly describes what happened, it presumes that the monkey is property, which I would guess runs counter to the ALF point of view. "removed" is a fine NPOV word but says nothing about the illegality of the their actions. The ALF was breaking the law by taking the monkey and that was most likely their intent. I would vote for either "abducted" or "illegally removed". –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 19:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

(In this country it would be referred to as preventing a greater crime and would be dismissed as having been a crime by the judge...) In this case there is a lot of evidence leading to the tests being illegal (see the old discussion for this as there were some references to a court case being long and complicated or something similar) also the general condemnation by the scientific community + the university itself seems to indicate something was wrong. To answer the relation to money, if the money was removed in order to stop it being used to commit a greater offence then it would not be a crime in itself (and indeed, money is removed from suspected terrorist organisations/individuals all the time for this very reason).-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 21:06, 6 February 2006(UTC)

<dd>All you did was put the two citations together, but those two books clearly say two different things. Best says 17 of 18 and Newkirk says 8 of 17. Could you give me page numbers so that I can double check (maybe there's a section I'm not seeing)? Also, this may be a silly question, but does it bother you that this entire article is based on only two books, one by the president of PETA and the other by an ALF press officer? I still think "according to Newkirk" should be referenced at the top of the page. I mean, the whole thing is sourced by Newkirk except for one statement of fact attributed to Best, which supposedly corroborates the Newkirk source but, again, they conflict. And why did you remove the link to the <a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_1be5.html" title="ALF">ALF</a>? I mean, I know there's still a link to "Animal Liberation Front," but deleting the ALF link is kind of weird, yeah? <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinick88_910f.html" title="User:Winick88">Winick88</a> 08:29, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_1be5.html" title="ALF">ALF</a> redirects to Animal Liberation Front, so we don't wikify both. Page numbers: Best p. 22 and Newkirk p. 294. It isn't surprising that we have two books written by the movement as references, because the pro-testing community is unlikely to highlight a case like this, though if you can find any other suitable sources, by all means add them. And the first paragraph is already sourced to Newkirk as a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_reference.html" title="Harvard reference">Harvard reference</a>: we don't introduce articles with "according to," but with the title of the page, wherever possible. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:35, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But those two sources say two different things-- Best says 17 of 18 and Newkirk says 8 of 17. I can't stress this enough. Do you actually have the book? Not only that, but this very same fact is mirrored on the <a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_1be5.html" title="ALF">ALF</a> page in the brief Britches section. I agree with you that the <b>pro-testing</b> community wouldn't highlight the incident, but there aren't any <b>neutral</b> sources that speak directly to, say, the contention that Britches was flown to an unnamed(?) sanctuary in Mexico either. And <i>even if</i> it were taken totally from anti-testing sources, there's basically only 1 source here. As it stands, this article would work much better (if significantly expanded) as a summary of Newkirk's book. Otherwise its just a bad summary, yeah? <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinick88_910f.html" title="User:Winick88">Winick88</a> 09:17, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, we are aware of dictionary definitions. However, as the above discussion makes aware - it is still a weighted word. In the context it will be used in this article we must have a reference to a court case to prove that it was 'stolen' and we have not got that at present. If you can provide such a reference, by all means do so and then I for one would accept the use of 'stolen'.</dd>
<dd>But if we are to use your definitions above then I will. First, number 1. This one states 'without right or permission' - the people who removed Britches believed they had the right to do so in order to prevent an extreme level of cruelty. In the eyes of the law this is a defence. If the animal was actually in a situation where extreme cruelty was occurring (as it appears it was, look at the statements of the industry, university and other scientists denouncing the experiment) then a judge could rule that the people who removed the monkey were in fact legally right to do so - so would not have stolen it. This would mean 'liberated' would be a better word...</dd>
<dd>I do not believe any of the other definitions are relevent to this situation. -<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 10:53, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although this article is improving, it still reads largely as something promoting animal rights extremism. The "government" references which actually go to animal-rights literature, and the debate about the term "stolen" both bother me.

<dd>First, the references to the 'government' are discussed in the books of well known authors who are published. We should not be discussing whether they are an appropriate source, as they are a source - if you have something to counter it then please add it along with its source.</dd>
<dd>The debate over 'stolen' is quite self explanatory and pointless to bring up again. I think we have adequately covered the reasons why 'removed' is a neutral term and 'stolen' is not. How does it disturb you?</dd>
<dd>The overall feal of the article is that the experiments were denounced as wrong. There are not any claims that the actions of the activists were the right thing to do though.</dd>

<p>References that discuss primary sources should always be to those primary sources, not to relatively difficult to access books that may or may not contain the primary sources. The very act of naming this article after an animal rather than the event of the laboratory assault is a political act. You may well be right that it is the least NPOV animal rights article on Wikipedia, but that does not make it NPOV. Since every time I try to get this article discussed with a tag it gets deleted almost immediately, I am now going to list this article on a dispute page, so that more experienced and knowledgeable wikipedia experts than myself can weigh in.

<dd><b>Primary sources</b> are the original source of information, such as a journal article or a historical newspaper account. Derived sources are sources that report on primary sources, such as text books or Wikipedia.

<dd>Hi Jaibe, thanks, I know what a primary source is, but I was confused about "References that discuss primary sources should always be to those primary sources." In fact, our policies prefer secondary sources to primary ones, but if you want to track down the primary sources in this case, by all means go ahead. The books we cite aren't "popular" books or hard to find, as you argued above, but are histories of the animal rights movement, and in the case of Newkirk, of the ALF. Arguably, the latter is primary source material on the issue of Britches, given Newkirk's involvement in the animal rights movement and, as I recall, her involvement in publicizing the Britches case. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
