<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationalism.html" title="Edit section: British nationalism in UK politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">British nationalism in UK politics</span></h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, there can be two strands of nationalism identified in British politics, since the split in the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Empire_Loyalists_4c92.html" title="League of Empire Loyalists">League of Empire Loyalists</a> in the late 1950s. On the extreme <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_right.html" title="Political right">right</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-fascist.html" title="Neo-fascist">neo-fascist</a> National Front and the far-right British National Party have been strongly anti-immigration. They have encouraged the repatriation of ethnic minorities, and have been associated, until the 1990s at least, with race riots and violent politics. They have never had representation in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, although they have had a number of local councillors in inner-city areas of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_London%2C_England_5437.html" title="East London, England">East London</a> and the mill towns of <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, such as <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnley.html" title="Burnley">Burnley</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keighley.html" title="Keighley">Keighley</a>.</p>
<p>To the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centre-right.html" title="Centre-right">centre-right</a>, a more moderate form of nationalism has existed in the League of Empire Loyalists, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Monday_Club_21bd.html" title="Conservative Monday Club">Conservative Monday Club</a>, - both <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressure_group.html" title="Pressure group">pressure groups</a> within the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Tory party</a> - and more lately in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_Independence_Party_2bbf.html" title="United Kingdom Independence Party">United Kingdom Independence Party</a> (UKIP) and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veritas_%28party%29.html" title="Veritas (party)">Veritas</a>, which both campaign against <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> membership and have also been strongly against uncontrolled immigration. There has been a long history of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurosceptic.html" title="Eurosceptic">Euroscepticism</a> in these groups, which became focused in the parties such as UKIP after the <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maastricht_Treaty_bacc.html" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> was passed. At one time, the Conservative Monday Club included a number of <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> (MPs), though this group has now been disowned by the Conservative Party. Other nationalist parties on the right have never had an MP, but UKIP has a number of <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_the_European_Parliament_99f0.html" title="Member of the European Parliament">MEPs</a> and Councillors.</p>

<p>The British Nationalist movement rose out of the dying embers of the British <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> movement. Although leader <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswald_Moseley_242d.html" title="Oswald Moseley">Oswald Moseley</a> actually went on to form a pro-<a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> party, a number of members of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Union_of_Fascists_7578.html" title="British Union of Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>, which was banned during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, became members of parties attempting to defend the British Empire.</p>
<p>The Empire had begun to break down as nationalist movements rose in the early 20th century, though this had largely been resisted in the UK. After 1945, pressure from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and the financial damages that had resulted from the war lead to a general acceptance that the empire was both immoral and economically unsustainable, and needed to be disbanded. This occurred over a thirty year period, with the larger territories and Dominions being first to gain independence in the late 1940s - <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> in 1947 as an example.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Empire_Loyalists_4c92.html" title="League of Empire Loyalists">League of Empire Loyalists</a> was the main group to develop in this era. Founded by <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._K._Chesterton_3d96.html" title="A. K. Chesterton">A. K. Chesterton</a> in 1954, they were actually a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pressure_group.html" title="Pressure group">pressure group</a>, rather than a political party, and refused to contest elections. The majority of their members were part of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>, and they were known for their politically-embarrassing stunts at party conferences. <a href="../../../j/2E/r/J.R.R._Tolkien_b884.html" title="J.R.R. Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a> was a known supporter <a href="http://www.barnesreview.org/Tolkien/tolkien.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barnesreview.org/Tolkien/tolkien.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and the group promoted a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shire_e82e.html" title="The Shire">Shire</a>-esque view of an idealized UK. It has been argued that the majority of this group were more '<a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_Blimp_f463.html" title="Colonel Blimp">Colonel Blimpish</a>' traditionalists, rather than fascists. However, its more extreme elements wanted to make the group more political.</p>
<p>This led to a number of splinter groups forming, including the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Defence_League_12a8.html" title="White Defence League">White Defence League</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Labour_Party_%28UK_1950s%29_78e5.html" title="National Labour Party (UK 1950s)">National Labour Party</a>. These both stood in local elections in 1958, and merged in 1960 to form the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_%281960s%29_c21c.html" title="British National Party (1960s)">British National Party</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationalism.html" title="Edit section: 1960s-1980s - The National Front and anti-immigration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1960s-1980s - The National Front and anti-immigration</span></h3>
<p>With the decline of the British Empire becoming inevitable, Britain's nationalist parties turned their attention to internal matters. The 1950s had seen a lot of immigration to the UK from its colonies, particularly from India, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda.html" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>. Lead by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bean_1600.html" title="John Bean">John Bean</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Fountaine_011f.html" title="Andrew Fountaine">Andrew Fountaine</a>, The British National Party opposed the introduction of these people to the UK. A number of their rallies, such as a 1962 rally in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trafalgar_Square_a2c0.html" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, ended in race riots. After a few early successes, the party went into difficulty and was destroyed by internal arguments. In 1967, it joined forces with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tyndall_%28politician%29_8d7b.html" title="John Tyndall (politician)">John Tyndall</a> and the remnants of Chesterton's League of Empire Loyalists to form the National Front at another violent rally.</p>
<p>The NF quickly grew to be the biggest nationalist party in the UK. It polled 44% in a local election in <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deptford%2C_London_1dbe.html" title="Deptford, London">Deptford, London</a> and finished third in three <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-elections</a>. The party supported extremist <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionism_%28Ireland%29_2456.html" title="Unionism (Ireland)">unionism</a> in Northern Ireland and attracted Conservative members who had become disillusioned after <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> had recognized the right to independence of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">African</a> colonies, and had criticized the <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v003/3.4myers.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v003/3.4myers.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> government. During the 1970s, their violent rallies became a feature of British politics. Election results remained strong in working class urban areas, with a number of council seats won. It was during this period that British nationalism and patriotism became linked with violence in the public conscience.</p>
<p>Other political groups also developed to support British Nationalism. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Monday_Club_21bd.html" title="Conservative Monday Club">Conservative Monday Club</a> was a division of the Conservative Party whose aim was 'to safeguard the liberty of the subject and integrity of the family in accordance with the customs, traditions, and character of the British people'. Again, this meant a general opposition to post-colonial states, to immigration and those immigrant communities in the UK, as well as support for the hard-line unionism in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>However, the rise of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> and an economically successful 1980s reduced the support for these two groups. They maintained anti-immigration policies - the Monday Group calling for an end to race relation laws in 1981. There was a move, however, towards a more inclusionist vision of the UK, and to opposition towards the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>. The National Front, for example, began to support non-white radicals such as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farrakhan_10e0.html" title="Louis Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>. This led to the splintering of the various groups, with radical <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_Soldier_69e1.html" title="Political Soldier">political soldiers</a> such as a young <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Griffin_3b7e.html" title="Nick Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> forming the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Way_%28UK%29_e6c1.html" title="Third Way (UK)">Third Way</a> group, and traditionalists creating the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Group_5cbe.html" title="Flag Group">Flag Group</a>. Membership of the Monday Club, meanwhile, fell to under 600 by 1987</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationalism.html" title="Edit section: The 1990s and the anti-Europe movement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1990s and the anti-Europe movement</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_National_Front_ace2.html" title="New National Front">New National Front</a> had been formed by John Tyndall in 1980, and changed its name to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Party_001b.html" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> in 1982. They, alongside the Monday Club, campaigned against the increasing integration of the UK into the EU. They developed a policy of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>, espousing the traditional nationalist methods of extra-parliamentary movements, and concentrated instead on the ballot box.</p>
<p>The National Front continued to decline, whilst the more media-friendly BNP, lead by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Griffin_3b7e.html" title="Nick Griffin">Nick Griffin</a>, grew in popularity. Around the turn of the 21st century, a number of councillors were won. However, policies of anti-immigration continued <a href="http://www.bnp.org.uk/policies/policies.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bnp.org.uk/policies/policies.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and a damaging <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> documentary lead to Griffin being charged with the incitement of racial hatred. The <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_local_elections%2C_2006_ba9d.html" title="UK local elections, 2006">2006 local elections</a> saw the BNP have the most successful campaign of any far right party in British history. They gained thirty three seats, the second highest gain of any party at the elections; in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Barking_and_Dagenham_323b.html" title="London Borough of Barking and Dagenham">Barking and Dagenham</a>, they gained twelve councillors.</p>
<p>A less radical branch of nationalism was also born in the 1990s. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_Independence_Party_2bbf.html" title="United Kingdom Independence Party">United Kingdom Independence Party</a>, formed by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Sked_1d9e.html" title="Alan Sked">Alan Sked</a> in 1993, came out of failed attempts to block the <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maastricht_Treaty_bacc.html" title="Maastricht Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>. It has been an attempt to assert British national independence. Alongside the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Referendum_Party_261e.html" title="Referendum Party">Referendum Party</a>, which took a more single issue approach to British withdrawal from the EU and many of whose members subsequently joined UKIP, it has been the most successful British nationalist party in elections. Despite some internal divisions, which led to MEP <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kilroy-Silk_c1ea.html" title="Robert Kilroy-Silk">Robert Kilroy-Silk</a> forming his own splinter party <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veritas_%28political_party%29.html" title="Veritas (political party)">Veritas</a> it went on to get 10 MEPs in the 2004 Euro-election. There have since been a number of divisions within the party, with many members leaving to join the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Democrats_Party_6f05.html" title="English Democrats Party">English Democrats</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Alliance_%28UK%29_21f4.html" title="Popular Alliance (UK)">Popular Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these have come from the Conservative Party, who 'disowned' the Monday Club in 2001 and who have become less <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurosceptic.html" title="Eurosceptic">Eurosceptic</a>.</p>
<p>Mainstream parties have continued in their attempts to reclaim British national identity from the nationalist groups. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_78e8.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Brown_e90d.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, in 2006 suggested the introduction of a British national holiday <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4611682.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4611682.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, in the way that the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> celebrate <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastille_Day_a5ec.html" title="Bastille Day">Bastille Day</a>.
