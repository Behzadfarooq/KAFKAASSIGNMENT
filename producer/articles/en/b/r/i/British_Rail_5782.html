<p>The <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain_bbef.html" title="Rail transport in Great Britain">rail transport system in Great Britain</a> developed during the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>. After the grouping of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> under the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways_Act_1921_3338.html" title="Railways Act 1921">Railways Act 1921</a> there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR), the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway_367a.html" title="London, Midland and Scottish Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a> (LMS), the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway_7e84.html" title="London and North Eastern Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (LNER) and the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Railway_%28UK%29_ad79.html" title="Southern Railway (UK)">Southern Railway</a> (SR).</p>
<p>Railway profitability suffered during the great depression of the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, capital spending was postponed and maintenance cut back. This meant that state of Britain's railways was already poor on the eve of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. During the war, the railways were taken into state control as a vital part of the wartime economy. They were heavily damaged by enemy action, and a further lack of capital investment and maintenance caused by wartime economic necessity compounded this. In parallel with the rest of Britain's economy, after the war the railways were in a very run-down state.</p>

<p>These regions formed the basis of the BR business structure until the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. The regional boundaries were re-drawn on several occasions in the 1950s to make them more geographically-based rather than being based on pre-nationalisation ownership. The North Eastern Region was merged with Eastern Region in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>; a new Anglia Region was split off from the Eastern Region in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. They retained a level of independence, though there was also some centralisation.</p>

<p>The priority in the immediate aftermath of nationalisation was to repair wartime damage and clear the backlog of maintenance work. Some pre-war capital investment schemes that had been cancelled upon the outbreak of hostilities were restarted (e.g. the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester-Sheffield-Wath_electric_railway_6666.html" title="Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway">Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electrification</a> over the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodhead.html" title="Woodhead">Woodhead</a> route, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Eastern_4737.html" title="Great Eastern">Great Eastern</a> suburban electrification). The new BR regions to a large extent inherited the organisations, structures and ethos of their predecessor Big Four companies and continued to work with a large degree of autonomy, building new steam locomotives and rolling stock to their respective companies' pre-war designs. There were also significant differences in fixed-stock engineering standards and operating standards between the former companies. The BR network was almost exclusively powered by steam locomotives, often of pre-grouping vintage, with rolling stock of a similar vintage and all in a poor state of repair. Only the Southern Region with its large electrified suburban network around south London operated a significant number of non-steam-powered trains.</p>
<p>Rather than pursue other forms of motive power on a large scale, in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> a new range of BR standard steam locomotives was introduced, along with new standard passenger and freight rolling stock. Production of the various pre-nationalisation types ceased in favour of these. At the same time attempts were made to standardise other engineering standards and operating standards across the company wherever possible.</p>

<p>Britain's railways arguably went into the Second World War having technologically fallen behind those of its peers. As the years passed after the War it became apparent that Britain was falling further behind. Countries like <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">U.S.</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> already had made significant investment in new diesels and electrics before the War; this continued after the war. Britain had not, and the run-down network deteriorated even more because of painfully slow rebuilding. Finally, and late, came the modernisation plan for Britain's railways. It cost the government much more than it should have due to bad timing.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> Modernisation Plan, detailed in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Commission_2c69.html" title="British Transport Commission">British Transport Commission</a>'s (BTC) <i>Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways</i>, argued for spending <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_Sterling_0249.html" title="Pound Sterling">£1,240 million</a> over a period of 15 years. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety and line capacity, through a series of measures which would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic that was being lost to the roads. The important areas were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrification of principal main lines, in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Region_of_British_Railways_327d.html" title="Eastern Region of British Railways">Eastern Region of British Railways</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>, Birmingham and Central <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>;</li>
<li>Large-scale <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieselisation.html" title="Dieselisation">dieselisation</a> to replace <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_locomotives_of_British_Railways_70d4.html" title="Steam locomotives of British Railways">steam locomotives</a>;</li>
<li>New passenger and freight rolling stock;</li>
<li>Resignalling and track renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p>A government <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Paper_56e2.html" title="White Paper">White Paper</a> was produced in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, stating that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, some of BR's legal liabilities as a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_carrier.html" title="Common carrier">common carrier</a> were removed, in particular the requirement that general goods handling must be offered at every station. This ended the tradition of having a general goods handling facility with associated rail infrastructure at practically every station, many of which were becoming under-utilised in the face of competition from road transport. This had associated cost savings in staff, infrastructure and caused a significant reduction in the numbers of slow stopping freight trains, thus increasing network capacity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the modernisation plan failed to take into account this and the other effects that mass road transport would have upon the traditional role of the railways, and as a result much money was wasted by heavy investment in things like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshalling_yard.html" title="Marshalling yard">marshalling yards</a> that were soon under-utilised and quickly became obsolete. Much money was also wasted by the rapid introduction of new classes of diesel locomotives into fleet service without an adequate period of prototype testing, which resulted in several classes being scrapped within a very few years of their being built. The failure of the Modernisation Plan led to a distrust of BR's financial planning abilities by the Treasury which was to dog BR for the rest of its existence.</p>
<p>Some routes were closed during the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> to take account of changing transport patterns and to remove obvious route duplication. For instance in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Anglia_16c5.html" title="East Anglia">East Anglia</a> most of the former lines of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midland_and_Great_Northern_Joint_Railway_58f6.html" title="Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway">Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway</a> were shut in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>; long-distance passenger trains on the former <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Central_Railway_afed.html" title="Great Central Railway">Great Central Railway</a> main line ended in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> as a prelude to its later closure. However, the route closures were just a small taste of what was to come.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Act_1962_84d5.html" title="Transport Act 1962">Transport Act 1962</a> converted British Railways from being the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_name.html" title="Trade name">trade name</a> of a BTC activity to an independent <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_corporation.html" title="Public corporation">public corporation</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, BR chairman Dr <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Beeching_043c.html" title="Richard Beeching">Richard Beeching</a> published the <i>Re-Shaping of British Railways</i> calling for major rationalisation of the system. Many rural routes were unprofitable in the face of increasing competition from road hauliers and the private car. The <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beeching_Axe_f2ab.html" title="Beeching Axe">Beeching Axe</a> fell on many branch lines and some main lines - some of these lines have since become <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_heritage_and_private_railways_f7b2.html" title="List of British heritage and private railways">heritage railways</a>.</p>
<p>The late <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> to the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> saw first a reduction, then the final withdrawal of Britain's fleet of steam locomotives. Mass withdrawals of older classes started towards the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, with many of the pre-grouping companies' engines being scrapped. BR built its last steam engine at <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon.html" title="Swindon">Swindon</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. Withdrawals of newer steam engines started in the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, some of which had been built to modern post-war designs and were less than 10 years old. During this period many new designs of diesel locomotives and multiple units were introduced to replace steam-powered trains. The greater availability and reliability of these new trains, coupled with the need for fewer locomotives and less rolling stock caused by the Beeching line closures, meant that the BR fleet reduced significantly. Main-line diesel locomotives were arriving in large numbers by <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, in early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> the Western Region was the first region to declare that it had no further Steam locomotives; other regions quickly followed suit with the last pocket of steam traction being withdrawn from the North-West of England in August 1968. The short narrow-gauge <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vale_of_Rheidol_Railway_15ef.html" title="Vale of Rheidol Railway">Vale of Rheidol Railway</a> at <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberystwyth.html" title="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> was the only exception: it remained steam-operated until its sale by BR in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. Pre-nationalisation rolling stock was withdrawn as BR standard stock became available, the majority had gone by the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Main_Line_0eb5.html" title="West Coast Main Line">West Coast Main Line</a> was electrified in stages on the French system of <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volt.html" title="Volt">25 kV</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hertz.html" title="Hertz">50Hz</a> <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternating_current.html" title="Alternating current">AC</a> <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overhead_lines.html" title="Overhead lines">overhead line electrification</a>, this having been chosen as the standard system for new electrification north of London, despite BR having invested significant amounts in two 1,500V DC overhead systems a decade earlier.

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, the regions of BR were abolished and the system sectorised into five sectors. The passenger sectors were <a href="../../../i/n/t/InterCity_%28British_Rail%29_892d.html" title="InterCity (British Rail)">InterCity</a> (express services), <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_SouthEast_f2bb.html" title="Network SouthEast">Network SouthEast</a> (London commuter services and other interurban services in the South-East) and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_Railways_6ca0.html" title="Regional Railways">Regional Railways</a> (regional services). <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trainload_Freight_2de5.html" title="Trainload Freight">Trainload Freight</a> took trainload freight, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railfreight_Distribution_47b9.html" title="Railfreight Distribution">Railfreight Distribution</a> took non-trainload freight, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freightliner_%28UK%29_b1bb.html" title="Freightliner (UK)">Freightliner</a> took <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intermodal_freight_transport.html" title="Intermodal freight transport">intermodal</a> traffic and <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_Express_Systems_e40a.html" title="Rail Express Systems">Rail Express Systems</a> took parcels traffic. The maintenance and remaining engineering works were split off into a new company, British Rail Maintenance Limited (BRML). The new sectors were further subdivided into divisions. This ended the "<a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_Blue_d65e.html" title="Rail Blue">BR blue</a>" period, as new liveries were adopted gradually. Infrastructure remained the responsibility of the Regions until the "Organisation for Quality" initiative in 1991, when this too was transferred to the sectors.</p>
<p>Running concurrently with the Sectorisation process came the last of BR's major infrastrucuture projects; the East Coast Main Line was electrified in stages between <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>; <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thameslink.html" title="Thameslink">Thameslink</a>, a crossrail scheme which connected the northern and southern halves of London's suburban network opened in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, whilst the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiltern_Main_Line_7e0b.html" title="Chiltern Main Line">Chiltern Main Line</a> was extensively modernised so as to open up an additional link between London and Birmingham. A follow on from the Chiltern project was to be the nationwide roll-out of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_Train_Protection_38f0.html" title="Automatic Train Protection">Automatic Train Protection</a> system which was proven to prevent accidents caused by <a href="../../../s/i/g/Signal_Passed_At_Danger_b291.html" title="Signal Passed At Danger">SPADs</a>.

<p>Several models of privatisation were mooted, in the end the one that was chosen resembled that chosen previously for the privatisation of the electricity and gas industries. The ownership of track, trains and infrastructure was separated into different companies based upon the existing BR business structure, with government economic regulation of certain parts of the industry remaining after privatisation where sufficient competition was deemed not to exist. Passenger services in each sector were <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franchising.html" title="Franchising">franchised</a> out to private companies, often bus operators. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Train_Operating_Companies_ff56.html" title="Association of Train Operating Companies">Association of Train Operating Companies</a> (ATOC) was created to organise ticketing and market the rail services using the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rail_49a3.html" title="National Rail">National Rail</a> brand.

<p>Privatisation has had mixed results. Passenger growth has been stimulated, but this has been at extra cost to passengers, who have seen steady fare increases since 1997, and to the public purse which, by 2006, was paying a subsidy more than three times as large as British Rail had received. Freight has also increased; however, there is debate as to whether these increases in passengers and freight have been due to privatisation, or simply to increasing congestion on the roads and an improved economy, which usually results in more travel. Some analysts have pointed out that a similar rise in passenger numbers occurred in the late 1980s when the economy was buoyant, only to fall in the recession of the early 1990s; however, recent passenger-journey numbers have climbed back to the level last seen in the 1950s.</p>
