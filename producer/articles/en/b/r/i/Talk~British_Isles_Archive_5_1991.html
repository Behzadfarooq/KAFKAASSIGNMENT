<dd>Well done, Eric. Most informative and useful. I think the problem before was that neither side actually fully comprehended what the other's analysis was. Some British editors thought it was just a few extremist Nationalist cranks stirring up trouble, whereas some Irish editors thought some British editors were engaging in imperialist agenda-pushing. We weren't so much talking at each other as <i>past</i> each other. All sides now appear to grasp the genuineness of each other's analysis and for both sides, British and Irish alike, the editing experience here has been very much a learning experience.</dd>

<dd>At times it looked as though this was looking like Wikipedia at its worst. Instead it now looks at Wikipedia at its best, a genuine experience of cultures learning together about facts. There are times where Wikipedia leaves me wanting to pull out my (remaining) hair. On other times, Wikipedia strikes me as one of the greatest innovations I have ever had the pleasure of associating with. Seeing (as has happened on numerous other pages in my 4 years here) how Wikipedia has been the means for all of us to learn about each other and our perspectives on the issue <i>British Isles</i>, this is one of those many times where I am proud to say "I am a Wikipedian." <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:39, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anglo-Celtic Isles</span></h2>
<p>I have commented out the bits referring to the Anglo-Celtic isles. The reason for this is that the website seems to talk almost exclusively about Anglo-Celtic culture in England (and how that should replace the term "Anglo-Saxon" culture, and there are no verifiable sources for its use on this page or on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_Isles_0d4f.html" title="Anglo-Celtic Isles">Anglo-Celtic Isles</a>.

<p>I've taken out the bit at the beginning, it improves the sentance anyway (it was commented out, but reappeared with the technical problem). I am losing all confidence in the term- it does not appear to be used by anyone. I think it may be a neologism used by very few people, if anyone. (Dreadful, inaccurate, mishmash IMO anyway.) Some form of <i>Britain and Ireland</i> seems to be the only alternative term that really is used widely. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 22:50, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My view, to reiterate it again, is that the introduction is an executive summary and should have the alternative term 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' specified in it. The website discussed above is an inappropriate reference. It is certainly in use, though quite limited use (which will be fairly and properly made clear). It's the only true alternative collective term in use. 'Britain and Ireland' is really a shortening of 'the islands of...'. I'm donging 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' back in there. User: PConlon 19:05, 22 July 2006</p>
<p>I've reverted I am afraid. I am not trying to be confrontational, but at present there is no verifiable reference that it is a term used by anyone, and it is probably best to keep the verifiability, otherwise the article will be swamped by everyone's crackpot opinion, not least my own. Even if there are references, as it appears to be used very little, it is probably best kept in the main body of the article rather than the summary. I agree with you about <i>Britain and Ireland</i>, but despite the inaccuracy, it does appear to be the most common alternative (in book titles, for example).</p>

Here is one reference<a href="http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/cork.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/cork.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>- a southern unionist song!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Welcome to the British Isles</span></h2>
<p>Somebody wanted (more?) evidence earlier that the expression "British Isles" is used to mean Britain and her islands and didn't include Ireland at all. Well, result No 2 (No 1 is this article) on a Google search of "British Isles" does just that: <a href="http://www.the-british-isles.com" class="external free" title="http://www.the-british-isles.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-british-isles.com</a>.

<dd>Yes. The problem with that page is that it, as has been mentioned before in this very discussion page, is that it obviously has been created by someone without proper knowledge of the meaning. If people get the meaning wrong we need to educate them as to its use, meaning and the implications, not simply change the terminology to suit. Unfortunately that website seems to be missing a contact email for us to get in touch with them about their errors. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:28, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How come it is only those pages which disagree with your national narrative over in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Britain</a> which have "got it wrong"? What a very curious attitude for supposedly open-minded people to take. And let us never forget that British Isles reflects British political and cultural values. It is a product of your national myths and prejudices. It's easy to agree with yourselves. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 12:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This has absolutely nothing to do with any national narrative of mine. If I were to bring my national and political predujuces (sp?) into this discussion then I wouldn't be maintaining a neutral point of view. And you have no idea what my political or national leanings or thoughts are, and you probably never will as they are irrelevant. I deal in evidence, and the evidence that I have seen, that I have researched and that I have come across shows overwhelmingly that British Isles as including Ireland is the most common usage in the world, and not just in English but in foreign languages as well. Yes there are some that have issues with the name, that has never been disputed. Yes there are some who outright find it offensive, still not disputed. However the fact remains that it is in very common usage and evidence has not as yet been presented to overrule that. There is evidence presented that there is confusion over usage of the term, there is evidence presented that some people plain don't like the term, none of these I have disagreed with and both of which I believe require some discussion and presentation on the article. However Wikipedia is based on verifiability of facts, not people's opinions. Oh and I don't believe I have ever edited or been involved in any way with the page <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. It seems to me that by maintaining this accusatory tone against people that you are bringing your prejudices into this, not me or many of the other editors on this page who are trying to come up with an agreement on this page. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 13:14, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This site also seems to use the term <i>British Isles</i> to mean England, Scotland and Wales, rather than <i>Isles owned by Britain</i>. Anyway <i>Britain</i> obviously <i>owns</i> Islands that are nowhere near and certainly not part of the <i>British and Irish Isles</i>. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:54, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that it is already established in the article using reliable sources that <i>Brtish Isles</i> has multiple meanings according to who is listening to the term, and don't need to resort to dodgily named websites. Declaring that your favourite definition is the only one does not help anyone. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">A scholar's life</a> involves dealing with ambiguity and subtlety, not pushing single "truths". Perhaps you would like to contribute to the article- know anything about birds? At the moment in Wikipedia they (and most other wildlife) only seem to be present in Great Britain. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 08:45, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, I would contend that if somebody created a website about the British Isles that included <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> it would be infinitely more dodgy than one that merely included those islands off Britain which belong to Britain. Second, if I were to write about Irish wildlife I would naturally place it in the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> page, just as most if not all Irish people would do given the choice. That certain people expect an Irish person to place it in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">this</a> article indicates that they themselves are not averse to pushing their own single "truth" (and, scarily, haven't heard a thing that the Irish posters have been saying). Third, if you read the <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">Scholar's Life</a> in question you'd quickly see he was what we would nowadays call a complete dosser.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 12:40, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually you make a good point, the grography/geology/ecology info in this article is probably duplicated elsewhere, and would certainly fit into other articles. In one respect <i>geographical regions</i> are as artificial as political <i>states</i>. One could argue that the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> article is the more correct place for this sort of information as it is a discrete land mass. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 12:53, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opening paragraph wrong (again)</span></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the line the opening paragraph seems to have got screwed up again, probably by a well-meaning edit that made all the mistakes we had all moved away from, again.</p>
<p>Among the clangers were</p>
<ul>
<li>a statement that the that the name <i>British Isles</i> is most commonly used to refer to the archipelago (fact), followed by a falsehood, that some <i>residents</i> consider the name controversial. Firstly calling them <i>residents</i> implies <i>residents of the British Isles</i> and they reject that tag. So the use of the word <i>residents</i> is POV and loaded.</li>
<li>It isn't <i>simply</i> that some people in Ireland consider the term "controversial". It is that they regard it as something that does not apply to them.</li>
<li>Someone decided to shorten the names of the various UKs and in the process, as in the past, screwed them up. Ireland was never part of we mean when we now use the word <i>United Kingdom</i>. It was part of the <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</i>, a different entity with its own page on WP. So you <i>have</i> to give the actual name so the reader knows which of the United Kingdoms is being referred to. When talking about the two states, you <i>have</i> to use the name of the current United Kingdom to distinguish it from the other United Kingdom. Otherwise a reader would be confused and think that Ireland was part of the current United Kingdom, not its parent.</li>
</ul>

Note that the older name continued to be used until 1927. Are you, then, saying that the UK became a new state in 1927? This seems like a ridiculous argument. The UK first lost territory, then changed its name because of said lost territory, but that does not make it a different state. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 11:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is generally treated as a different state by political scientists and historians for complex constitutional, political and social reasons; from a different territory and the most radical change in the membership of parliament in one hundred and twenty years — disappearance of 100 Irish MPs from Westminster leading to greater Great Britishisation of parliament, etc) to a constitutional revolution in terms of the relationship between the UK and the dominions. (The 'new' UK in 1927 coincided with the change from 'dominions are subsets of the UK' concept to 'they are co-equal members of Commonwealth', a revolution in the relationship between the crown, dominion governments and HMG, and other complex changes. The new UK also coincidentially coincided with radical reforms in the party system (replacement of the Libs by Labour) and was not too far before the Wall Street Crash which impacted fundamentally on society. Just as historians see the end of the First World War as in effect the end of the nineteenth century (it reflected 19th century concepts of nationalism, empires, class, attitudes, etc, all of which died in the war and were replaced by 'nation states', 'self-determination', 'rule of the people', decline in the nobility, etc.) so they see the change in the UK's constitutional structures as being profound. And so they treat the 'new' UK and 'old UK' as separate (as they treat pre- and post-the Great Reform Act as different in a political sense) concepts. So it is normal to state which UK one is referring to, the pre-split UK, with its anglo-centric concept of the isles and the dominions, and its classical traditional party system and monarchy, and the post-split UK, with a different membership of parliament, commonwealth replacing empire, new party system, etc.</dd>

<dd>It is pretty elementary stuff. It is the same as how the modern Italian Republic is sometimes called the <i>Second Republic</i> because constitutional and electoral changes, and the collapse of the traditional big parties, amounted to such a massive change in how Italy is governed, its political stability, etc. It is a standard approach. The modern version of French Fifth Republic is sometimes called the <i>6th Republic</i> or the <i>5th Republic Mark 2</i> because of the change in the system <i>cohabitation</i>. Technically the early years of Hitler occurred in the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weimar_Republic_9fad.html" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> but people regard the periods before and during Hitler's period in power as separate. It is a standard approach all over in political science.

<dd>I must say I agree with Jtdirl on this one. As a scholar of the 1920s I can tell you that a lot of changes did take place in the governance of the UK in 1927 with the creation of the Commonwealth, the alteration of the King's title, and massive parliamentary shake-ups and rebalancing. It is generally accepted that while there is continuity of government and governance in this period that the transition was more than just a paper exercise and losing most of the island of Ireland. Fundamental alterations were made to the government and it is accepted in many historical circles that it isn't just a name change but is still less than a change of state. Referring to them fully when describing times before and after is quite commonplace and is the general usage. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 13:34, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. It offers clarity. That is why a page on the UK of GB and I was created separate from the UK of GB and NI page. Maybe I expressed it badly. They weren't separate states as such. But there was more of a discontinuity than a continuity. The changes were so revolutionary in practice, some of them linked to the Irish divorce, others happening independently but it the same timeframe, that most historians and political scientists I know <i>automatically</i> use the full name, and then <i>former United Kingdom</i> and <i>present United Kingdom</i> to describe them subsequently. It was by no means a simple case of a name change. It was in some ways a period of constitutional, institutional and political revolution, so dramatic were some of the changes. (The Irish Free State, which was affected by them, went from having a <i>King in Ireland</i> to a <i>King of Ireland</i>, a fundamental constitutional difference that equated a co-equal realm of the King's, not a subset of the UK.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 13:54, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- sigh - Here we go again.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason that footnote is in there, and staying in there, is because otherwise it looks like there is a factual error, giving that the lazy guys in Westminster took 5 years to update the name of the UK to reflect the reality in 1922. As a result it <i>has</i> to be explained to the reader that there is no error on Wikipedia's behalf in on the one hand in one article saying that Ireland left the UK in 1922, and elsewhere saying that the name of the UK was changed in 1927. Otherwise, as happens all the time all over WP we will have visitors constantly "correcting" the "error". It is standard when these things happen to avoid that in advance to put in a footnote so the facts are explained to them before they start "fixing" non-existent errors. It is not a case of references creeping back into the introduction. It is a footnote to explain an apparently confusing context.</li>
<li>As everyone else on the page now seems to realise and accept, one of the two states in the area being referred to the British Isles insists that it isn't covered by the term. A host of links here, provided by Irish users, English users, Scottish users and Welsh users have shown that academics and others are also unhappy about using that name in the context of the relationships on the archipelago. That was clearly spelt out in a way that avoided suggesting who was right or wrong, just indicating that one of the states mentioned in the paragraph as being in the BI disputes the statement. You, again, deleted that and rewrote the paragraph to state <i>as fact</i> that the British Isles is an archipelago with 2 sovereign states, something as all sides now realise here is disputed and <i>cannot</i> be stated that way. Either the paragraph doesn't mention what is supposed to be on the British Isles, or it does and explains that there are disagreements. Having a paragraph that mispresents reality and states as fact things that are disputed, is not an option.</li>
<li>The statement "And if we refer to one of the post-1922 states as <i>what is now known as the Republic of Ireland</i> then we should also refer to <i>what is now known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i> for it also did not have that name for some time after 1922." is just ridiculous and suggests you are simply looking to offend people. We cannot say <i>Ireland</i> because only part of Ireland, not all of Ireland, left the UK in 1922. The name has changed numerous times. So it is logical to state "what is now known as the Republic of Ireland". That is what is done all over Wikipedia. The UK stuff is simply bullshit. It was covered in the footnote which you tried to delete. It is ridiculous to complain about a footnote and delete it, and then complain separately about a problem which you created by removing the footnote. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 01:12, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You (Jtdirl) can be quite patronising, dictatorial and insulting sometimes. You act as though information you put in the article is your personal property and respond at great length and with unwarranted ferocity at anyone who might dare to change it. You speak on others' behalf and quote your opinions and wishes as if they were gospel — <i>footnote is in there, and staying in there</i> and <i>everyone else on the page now seems to realise and accept</i> being two examples. You accuse me of being ridiculous and looking to offend: this I find insulting and offensive, possibly more so that you may find the term <i>British Isles</i> inaccurate.

You may find, going back through the archive, that I have at least once attempted to bring some calm and thought to the discussion so that the authors of the article can achieve their aims, and that I have tried to do so as neutrally as possible. My only interest in this article is to try and help keep the introduction to a level and length which readers of all ages and abilities can cope with. You will notice that I make few, if any, comments or changes to the detailed discussion. The reference I deleted, documented above rather than deleted with no notice, was to keep the introduction neat and tidy. And it wasn't a deletion — you will have seen that it was only commented out: I assumed (wrongly) that there might be sensible discussion about why it ought to stay in (rather than the tirade above). Other than a wish for verifiable accuracy and fact, I have no PoV interest, although many here do, Jtdirl included. On which:

<p>There are many other islands in the ocean to the north of Britain which can be reached from the northern islands of Britain in a direct voyage of two days and nights with sails filled with a continuously favourable wind. A devout priest told me that in two summer days and the intervening night he sailed in a two-benched boat and landed on one of them. Some of these islands are very small; nearly all are separated from one another by narrow stretches of water. On these islands hermits sailing from our country Scotia have lived for nearly a hundred years. But just as they were always deserted from the beginning of the world, so now because of the northmen pirates they are emptied of anchorites and filled with countless sheep and a great variety of sea-fowls.</p>

<p>I think there is a wrong picture being painted here. If you look at the original meaning of <i>British Isles</i> and <i>British</i>, they refer to the ancient Britons (which, ironically enough excluded the English, the Vikings &amp;tc). Even when first used in English (1621, and in a work of historical geography), there was no such political identity as Great Britain, though the (scottish) king was trying to engineer such an identity. It might be argued that prior to 1621, the term was known only in non-English languages and somehow these have nothing to do with the English use, but I don't think that really holds water: the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century was also a time when English was increasingly used for learned discourse rather than Latin, printing became widely available, and accurate maps possible. At any rate, such an assertion would require positive evidence. There may have been some use of <i>British Isles</i> that implies political ownership of the islands by the British state (no doubt in Northern Ireland), but I think that it would be difficult to argue that such a use became widespread in the UK (either of them), let alone dominant. It is reasonable to argue that subsequent political events have made the term unacceptable to a significant number of people because of its possible modern implications; it is not reasonable to argue that somehow (the southern part of&#160;?) Ireland seceded from the British Isles: there was never a political entity entitled <i>the British Isles</i>. Notwithstanding sloppy usage, <i>British Isles</i> either covers the entire archipelago, or it is not usable at all.</p>
<p>In addition, large numbers of people use <i>British Isles</i> in its original geographical sense (which accounts for much of the sloppy use IMHO). You may not like this (it is possible, of course, that I may not like it), but it is the case, and the job of an encylopaedia is to reflect the world, not prescribe how it should be. The flip side of this is that the terminology discussion is fully justified.</p>
<p>I don't think the Faroe islands can be called part of the archipelago: as EricR pointed out, they are basalt, and so formed by an isolated geological event; the image is fuzzy <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Elevation.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Elevation.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, but I think they are off the part of the continental shelf the rest of the islands occupy; they have a different climate, flora, and fauna; they don't appear on the old maps of the British Isles. Ironically enough, I think there may be many Faroe islanders who would welcome anything that distanced themselves from Denmark. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 22:50, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To confirm: I just checked an atlas and there's a trench of between 500m and 1000m depth between the Faroes and the British Isles (as compared to less than 200m depth of the continental shelf around the British Isles, including the North Sea and English Channel) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinBell_11a3.html" title="User:ColinBell">ColinBell</a> 00:35, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Totally agree with, <i>the job of an encyclopaedia is to reflect the world</i>, and all parts implicitly, which you also cover. Terms and words do evolve in their meanings over the centuries, but the Fareo Island example is not a bad analogy. About the basalt, the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giants_Causeway_0925.html" title="Giants Causeway">Giants Causeway</a> and the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mull_of_Kintyre_653c.html" title="Mull of Kintyre">Mull of Kintyre</a> are formed from basalt too.

<p>The point is that the Faroes were formed by an isolated event and their presence is not directly integrated to the geology of the UK and Ireland- there is not a sheet of basalt connecting the British Isles to the Faroe Islands. Volcanoes happen all over the place. WRT the geology of the British Isles then read the section and look at the map. In overall structual terms, Ireland and Britain share the same geology. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 08:13, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you point out, the insertion of "(one state on the archipelago disputes its inclusion)", apparently to get the issue into the first sentence in case readers go no further, produces ambiguity as well as an ugly sentence. To clarify matters I've changed the sentence to read "which is commonly though not universally known as the <b>British Isles</b>, despite issues arising when the term is used in relation to Ireland." Others may be able to find a better form of words. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 10:03, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The <i>one state on the archipelago disputes its inclusion</i> was simply badly phrased. It meant 'disputes its inclusion in the term <i>British Isles</i>, not 'disputes its inclusion on the archipelago'. As Irish users have explained, Many Irish users dispute the statement that the name of the archipelago is the British Isles. They do not dispute that there is such a thing as the <i>British Isles</i> nor that there is an archipelago, just the equation of some people that they are one and the same. <i>That</i> is the issue. And many people outside Ireland, as has been shown by the various references produced by users on all sides here, now think that the use of the term <i>British Isles</i> rather tactless and dated, being (mis)understood internationally as meaning "the islands run/owned/part of Britain", with Ireland's inclusion then being misinterpreted as part of Britain, a really sore point with Irish people who were told that if they were from Ireland, and Ireland was part of the British Isles, then Ireland must be British. Until the 1970s internationally many people equated <i>England</i> with the <i>UK</i> and used the terms interchangeably, producing such nonsensense as writing that "Scotland is part of England" (a sentence I remember from a civics book I saw in a library which dated from the 1960s.) Today it is unthinkable to use such a term in any accurate context. (But curiously, when I came here first, I and a few others who joined in with me had such a fight to get Wikipedians to stop calling Her Majesty the "Queen of England". It was a battle that took months to get people to use the actual names of each kingdom, whether the Kingdom of England, Kingdom of Great Britain or the two United Kingdoms. Now people look back at the early articles on WP four years ago and cringe, thinking "did we as a serious encyclopaedia really have that shit on here?" <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:01, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But she <i>is</i> queen of England! England is a place that she reigns over. This fact is unaffected by whatever titles she happens to use. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 11:36, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. She is Queen <i>in</i> England. "Queen <i>of</i> England" is a constitutional title which has not existed since the 1707 Act of Union. Similarly she is Queen <i>in</i> Scotland, but not Queen <i>of</i> Scotland, because that title has not existed since 1707. And between 1801 and the 1920s, the monarch was king or queen <i>in</i> Ireland, not <i>of</i> Ireland. The title <i>King of Ireland</i> was only resurrected in constitutional law in 1927 and abolished in 1949. One can only be monarch <i>of</i> a state. England and Scotland, while still nations and countries, ceased to be states when they merged in the Act of Union in 1707. Ireland as the Irish Free State only became a legal state in 1922. However the concept of dominionism at the time saw dominions as in effect subsets of the United Kingdom, hence the primacy of UK law, and the fact that the UK parliament could legislate for its 'dependent children', the dominions. In 1927 dominions via a Commonwealth conference the previous year were given recognised statehood, including a direct relationship with <i>their</i> as opposed to <i>Britain's</i> monarch. As a result, though different dominions asserted their equality via the crown at different speeds, from 1927 the King became king <i>of</i> them, and not merely <i>in</i> them. So your claim that she is "Queen of England" is constitutional bunkum. The last "Queen of England" was Queen <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Anne</a> up to 1707.

<p>Hi, just checked in and I must say that we've come a remarkably long way with this! Good work. I see a need for two changes in Para 2 - neither fundamental I think, but primarily necessary for clarity and conciseness. I firstly replaced 'several different countries: the kingdoms of Scotland, England and Ireland, and the principality of Wales' with 'four distinct regions: England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales' (this is more sensitive too, particularly for the Welsh). I secondly changed 'most' to '26 of the 32 counties'. Any major issues with this - you know where to find me!:) Best regards, User: PConlon 11:24, 22 July 2006</p>

<dd>You have changed/added, <i>"though to some inhabitants this term is considered controversial"</i>. I see that as maybe politicizing the paragraph again. Bit of a nuance here, do people claim to inhabit the British Isles , or claim to inhabit their respective countries? Referring to the inhabitants of the BI is akin to the BI being a sovereign state in itself. Some are saying it's a geological term, and some claiming otherwise. I think it's going to confuse again. Addition of the word <i>most</i> to <i>commonly</i> may distract the reader. -MelForbes 11:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi MelForbes, if you get the nuance that 'to some inhabitants this term is considered controversial' may be politicizing the paragraph again, I would say that it is a rather political issue!:) I know what you mean though - it can I suppose be read as implying that the 'British Isles' is a state of some kind. I don't like this 'issues' word though - sounds a little like 'special' in the American sense, if you know what I mean! I like ColinBell's 'though some consider this term controversial' as it's really all that's needed - I would highlight that some Welsh and Scots also dislike the term (though in rather smaller numbers compared to us Irish). I also accept ColinBell's 'most commonly' point (even though obviously I wish it weren't so!!!). On the 'countries/nations' point I agree with MelForbes - it's fine with the historical qualifier. As I particularly like rugby, I'm going to insert 'nations'! Finally in regard to quibbling, I'm inspired from on high to change 'left the United Kingdom' to 'ceased to be part of...', as I'm getting images of bits of islands floating about! User:PConlon 18:35, 22 July 2006</p>
<p>I should have added above that I'm tremendously relieved that the separate 'British Isles (Terminology)' article has been removed by whomever - it clearly now isn't necessary. That did have a lot of historical text in it which I assume is being incorporated into this article's history page by the person who told us that a reworking is coming...Dave Souza if I remember correctly. This I'm looking forward to and hope it's coming along well. Can we now take away the following line from the top of the article?: 'The term 'British Isles' can be confusing and may be objectionable to some people. See the Terminology section below for details of the controversy.'? I don't think its necessary, as the Introduction now gets the same message across well. Also, can we now remove the 'article merger' discussion things? Oh, another question (they keep coming!), can we keep footnotes out of the introduction section? - I see there's one there and don't think it's necessary. User: PConlon 18:48, 22 July 2006</p>

<dd>I think the top line is necessary. Remember, here as elsewhere for every reader who reads the article, many more will have a 10 second glance and then shoot off somewhere else. That is the nature of encyclopaedias. <i>British Isles</i> is so controversial — a term practically of devotion to some, a term of detestation to others, to the majority either unoffensive (most British people) or annoying and creepy (most Irish people) — that you really do need at the very start to have something that says to people, <i>before</i> go apeshit and suddenly decide to stop at this page and totally change it, "look. we know this is a controversial topic. Before you start angrily ripping the guts out of the article, read the terminology section and give it a chance." <i>That</i> is what that line is. If it isn't there, people will jump in feet first editing at the begining not realising that the stuff they think is missing actually is already covered elsewhere outside the introduction. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 19:41, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, good point Jtdirl, fair enough. We've fought for the controversy to be highlighted already and don't need more of us barrelling in unnecessarily! I'm furious though at the lack of mention of 'Anglo-Celtic Isles'...there's some unfair censorship going on there which has to be corrected. The removal of the 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' page is totally unacceptable - I agree with the 'duplicating articles point' but a separate encyclopedic entry (i.e. article) is entirely appropriate, with link to 'British Isles' article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Very common Gaelic mistake</span></h2>
<p>PConlon, you have stated that, <i>"The majority population of Britain (i.e. most English people, who are by far the largest population group on the island) are of Anglo-Saxon/Norman rather than Celtic origin...very different cultural groups."</i> However, recent research into this very subject apparently suggests that the majority of the English population was, and still is, Celtic in origin. When the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, et al, arrived they did so in relatively small numbers, and did not displace the population - they controlled it.</p>
<p>The Normans arrived later than that still. How much impact did the Romans have? Quite a lot.</p>
<p>What the Celts of several billion years ago(!) have to do with our generic and, in a very real sense, <b>shared</b> modern culture in 2006 anyway though, is anybody's guess! How much impact did the Romans have on the rest of the British Isles, including Ireland? Quite a lot. How much impact does modern American culture have in the British Isles today? Quite a lot.</p>
<p>You go on to say, <i>"This majority population in Britain did unquestionably dominate the island group is every sense for centuries, during which time they (naturally I suppose) started using the English term 'British Isles' to describe the whole area they dominated - IT IS A PRIMARILY POLITICAL TERM."</i></p>
<p>However, it was not an "English term" to begin with. If anything, it was probably Celtic in origin.. certainly it was used by the Greeks and the Romans. The term was a description of the PEOPLE of the islands. It was a corruption (read: translation) of the name the people of these islands apparently used to refer to themselves. At that time there was no Protestantism, no Potato Famine, no Cromwell, no Home Rule Bills, no Bloody Sunday, no Darkley and no Omagh.</p>
<p>Your apples and oranges analogy is flawed. A more correct analogy would be that both apples and oranges are fruits.</p>
<p>The "norther-eastern corner" of Ireland does not need singles quotation marks around it - Northern Ireland is a reality - not a neologism. Nor are the problems in Northern Ireland merely some kind of "forced mixing" of "two very distinct cultures". Perhaps you weren't aware that Presbyterians spoke Gaelic. The problems were really started as a result of a culmination of religious wars throughout Europe, the fact that Ireland hadn't solidified as a single unified country, and the introduction of laws designed to prevent the possibility of further war breaking out in that particular region of Europe.</p>
<p>Now this is where you manage to confuse yourself: <i>"I and most of my fellow Irish contributors are citizens of the Irish Republic and are in reality no more British than the Danes."</i> Citizens of the Repubic of Ireland are Irish given that that is the national description, or nationality. Citizens of the United Kingdom are British given that that is the nationality of that country. You are confusing nationality with ethnicity.</p>
<p>Thank you for your genuine attempt to explain yourself, but you have only served to show that many, many Irish nationals (and nationalists), while not intentionally showing any hostility towards us Irish, totally misunderstand where we've come from, what we are and what we aspire to in the future.</p>
<p><br />
<i>"To my Irish colleagues specifically...we all have been doing and continue to do a tremendous job fighting to have our identity clearly and properly presented here."</i> I don't know what that has to do with presenting facts in an encyclopedia. However, I suppose that there are indeed those - particularly amongst ourselves - who attempt to present point of view as fact. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 10:43, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think all those points have already been rehearsed above. The weekend newspapers were full of this new research that the English are German (post World Cup wave of The Krauts aren't so bad after all) following 15 generations of apartheir policy following the 5thC invasions. But when you read them, the articles say that English genetic make-up is 54% Saxon origin. My understanding is that south of the Thames indigenous genes are dominant, with Saxon genes dominant to the north, as far as the Tweed. Why do we care?

<dd>You are quite right, and remember they are only measuring the male Y chromosome, if the <i>Anglo-Saxons</i> didn't bring many women with them (and so mainly had children with indigenous women), then the 54% figure is effectively cut in half (and the range is 24.4%-72.5% depending on the region of England, for some reason these figures are <i><a href="../../../m/e/d/Median.html" title="Median">median</a></i> figures rather than the arithmetic <a href="../../../m/e/a/Mean.html" title="Mean">mean</a>, the distribution is very heterogeneous for these markers and cannot distinguish between <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> and <i>Danish-Viking</i> Y chromosome markers, so it's likely that the estimate for <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> origin is an over estimate, some people must be descended from <a href="../../../g/u/t/Guthrum_the_Old_0834.html" title="Guthrum the Old">Guthrum's</a> men!!).

A nation is a <i>group of people</i>, it is not a political entity, and it does not necessarily need to have a geographical boundary (it is a bit like an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a>, the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurds</a> are a nation, as are the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_people.html" title="Palestinian people">Palestinians</a>, these people are sometimes refered to as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stateless_nation.html" title="Stateless nation">stateless nations</a>, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_active_autonomist_and_secessionist_movements.html" title="List of active autonomist and secessionist movements">List of active autonomist and secessionist movements</a>). There are four nations in the <i>British and Irish Isles</i>, the English, the Irish, the Scots and the Welsh. There are two states in the archipelago, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The word country is sometimes used to refer to a state, and sometimes used to refer to the <i>geographical territory</i> a <i>nation</i> lives in, so it means different things in different contexts, so the UK and the Republic of Ireland are countries, but so are England, Scotland and Wales. If Wales were to become independent at any point then it would be a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation-state.html" title="Nation-state">nation-state</a>. Northern Ireland is neither a country, nor do it's population identify as a single nation. States are <i>legal</i> entities and are therefore artificial. One could argue that nations are <i>racial</i> or <i>ethnic</i> entities, one could also argue on one level that these are artificial, though they do not feel artificial, people feel a real affinity for members of their own nation due to a shared sense of common identity that they do not feel for people outside of their nation. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Alun is correct. The word "nationality" doesn't help, since that relates to statehood. Lots of HMG documents refer to "the English Regions and the other UK nations". so it is a valid use.

<dd>I'm perfectly aware of the distinctions. But your "four nation" division is certainly not universally agreed. In England currently there's a real tension between thinking of ourselves as English and as British - this is hardly surprising given we've been politically united to the rest of the UK for centuries, and share considerable cultural heritage, history and blood. (Personally, although born and bred in England, my father's family are all Scottish, so I'm reluctant to identify myself as English as it would deny a chunk of my heritage.) In Scotland and Wales, the concensus is different, of course - but this is at least to some extent only a phenomenon of the last 30/50 years. And of course for the NI Unionists, their nation is definitely the UK. Given all this, I would be very wary of making any categorical statement of whether there are two nations or four. (I'm discounting the HMG documents as evidence given "Nation" presumably has a specific technical legal meaning.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinBell_11a3.html" title="User:ColinBell">ColinBell</a> 23:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The UK is not a nation, and can never be a nation, it is a state. Some people may describe themselves as <i>British</i>, which is perfectly acceptable, but people who describe themselves as British are also usually English or Welsh or Scots or Irish <a href="http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20public%20attitudes.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20public%20attitudes.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (this is not always the case for people from ethnic minoroties). At best you might argue that there are five nations (including British), but I think it is more accurate to think of British as more of a supra - ethnic but closely related group rather than a nation. Ethnic identity is not an either/or situation, one can be British <b>and</b> Welsh, British <b>and</b> English etc. I think NI Unionists usually identify as British, English, Irish or <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Scots_626a.html" title="Ulster Scots">Ulster Scots</a> ethnically, but I think (and I may be wrong here) that people living in NI can have British and/or Republic of Ireland citizenship. British citizenship is really UK citizenship and is based on <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="British nationality law">British nationality law</a> and is not the same as ethnic/national identity. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 03:12, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just stumbled upon your post in the Fresh Start (cont) section where you asked to be described as British (and not English or Welsh), and am struggling to reconcile it with what you have just said above, since it seems to me a strong argument that the UK (or Britain) <i>can</i> be treated as a nation. We also need to take into account historical trends: Scottish national feeling was not nearly as strong in (say) the first half of the 20th century as it is today, and through that period, I'd argue that treating the UK as their nation rather than Scotland would make more sense.

<dd>I never <b>asked</b> to be called British, I said that I accept being British, I identify as British, but I am Welsh. One can have more than a single identity. In some ways British people can be considered a nation, I don't think there are any hard and fast rules, but I still contend that most people who identify as British also identify as Welsh or English or Scots or Irish (or even various combinations of these things), it's about how one identifies themselves and people are not always easily pigeonholed. So my argument is that four nations and two states is acceptable because I think it would be hard to argue that British people are not also at least <b>one</b> of the four. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 12:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Four nations is convenient, if only for rugby. There is also a "British nation", a term used today on BBC4, providing an overlapping identity that some are happy to use but which others reject. While many in NI identify themselves as British, the same people will often also consider themselves Irish. And, if memory serves me well, will come under that nation for rugby purposes. The Orcadians can be ambivalent about Scottish nationality, and it would be interesting to know what nation those inhabiting the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> identify with. Legally, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="British nationality law">British nationality law</a> appears to have definitions that seem odd to us mere inhabitants.

<dd>I cannot conceive of any English person who would object to being called British, and the English tend to use the terms "English" and "British" interchangeably - a tendency that has been criticised by the other nations of the UK, but in many contexts is perfectly accurate. For example, I could just as easily say "I am English" or "I am British", and both would be correct. For the English at least, we are clearly not talking about two distinct nationalities or ethnicities - we are not English and <i>also</i> British. Such would be an absurd view. All the British institutions - parliament, monarchy, state, law, culture also happen to be the English ones as well. The conclusion must be that when an English person uses the term, the two words - English and British - mean precisely the same thing. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The two words English and British are not synonyms at all. I am British and also Welsh, I am definitely not English. <i>parliament, monarchy, state, law</i> are not English, the Parliament is of the UK, not of England (there are Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs, or hadn't you noticed?), Law varies regionally, but is generally of the UK (I acknowledge the differences in Scotland, but the UK Parliament makes law there as well), the state is the UK not England (there is no English army, and there are no English Embasies), and the monarchy (though I detest their existence) is still a UK monarchy, why else are we a <i>United Kingdom</i>, if you were correct then the queen would not be queen of Wales or Scotland, which she obviously is. There are English people who do not identify with being British, just as there are Welsh and Scots and Northern Irish people, that is their prerogative, because you <i>cannot conceive of any English person who would object to being called British</i> does not make it true. In 2003 about 17% of the English population described themselves as <i>English not British</i>, nearly one in five.

<p>My point was not so much that the terms English and British <i>are</i> synonymous, because that is clearly not true, but rather that when the terms are used in normal conversation by most English people, they do not necessarily draw a distinction. For example, "my nationality is English" and "my nationality is British" are phrases that do not carry two distinct meanings when said by most English people. As for your other points, about their being no English army, embassies, law, parliament etc., the fact is that all of those institutions are staffed primarily by English people, so your contention is at best arguable and at worst simply false. The capital of England is the capital of the UK. The current UK parliament meets in the same place and is a direct continuation of the English parliament, as are all the great officers of state, plus the monarchy. The British state is a direct continuation of the English state. Whilst it is clear that for the inhabitants of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland the term British refers to an entity that is higher and larger in administrative terms than their own countries, for the English this is not the case. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 10:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

English people comprise the largest ethinic group in the UK, so their representation in state run institutions is obviously larger, how does this make the institution English? By your reasoning the UK <b>is</b> England, because it is mainly made up of English people. By your reasoning I am English, which I obviously am not.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Progress/Lack of Progress/Relevance of Talk</span></h2>
<p>It seems that, yet again, this talk page is being allowed to fall into discussions of the relevance of various names and irrlevant discussion of self-identifying terms (it makes no difference whether an Englishperson calls him/herself European/British/English/<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbrian</a>/<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrow-in-Furness_6391.html" title="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrowvian</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Marshian</a> - its not going to help us decide how to present any of the issues in this page.)</p>
<p>Indeed, if we compare the two areas of controversy - the terminology and the intro sections from a while ago (chosing my version of July 11th, when the unverified tag was removed and the version of end 26th July), there is acutally little difference, other than in syntax and ordering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Isles&amp;diff=66026897&amp;oldid=63310601" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_Isles&amp;diff=66026897&amp;oldid=63310601" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The intro, for example, contains and contained 4 paragraphs (though in the July 11th version one had been briefly commented out, for some reason): one describing the archipalego, one detailing its geography/geology/climate, one on the sovereign states and dependencies in the isles and one on the use of 'British Isles', particulaarly focused on the use of the adjective British.</p>
<p>I would argue, then, that this represents a consensus. If we have been editing and re-editing with so much discussion for so long and baisically changed nothing, then I think that we should be looking to accpet that the intro now deals with the issue pretty much as well as it can. Of course we all have our own opinions, and own preferred syntax/rewording; but these are minor issues which we could debate for ever and never find a 'right answer'. Doing so just allows the few extremists who float around this page occaisionally to insert their own POV and inaccuracies into the article, confusing everything and leaving an aritcle that is regularly messy.</p>
<p>As for the terminology section; this has been more seriously overhauled. However, much of what is said is still the same. I would aruge that the only major additions are those bits which come just before the 'alternative terms' sub-section. If these are accepted by most editors, then I think we can see that a consensus is developing there too.</p>

Maybe there is some confusion over applying the acronym to the council versus applying the name to the archipelago? Or confusing <b>Isles</b> and <b>Islands</b>? Also, if things weren't unclear already, just found another usage of <i>Iona</i> by Charles Haughey: "a federation of the 'Islands of the North Atlantic', comprising the independent republics of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland."<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 21:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Nations"</span></h2>
<p>The introduction now is deliberately unclear to avoid disputes or misunderstanding about the word "nation". This has caused two problems: it's current wording <i>The archipelago contains <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a></i> seems clumsy and is inaccurate — the archipelago doesn't really contain them, more it's politically divided into them, and it misses out IoM; and making an article deliberately "fuzzy" goes against the grain of an encyclopedia. The reference to the four entities is strange anyway as it mentions three <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituent_country.html" title="Constituent country">constituent countries</a> and one island. I'm stuck for a more precise and inclusive alternative, though — any suggestions? --<a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 13:42, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paragraph 3 (old paragraph 2) to:
<dl>
<dd>At present the archipelago includes two <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereignty.html" title="Sovereignty">sovereign</a> states: the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_013e.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), along with the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_dependency.html" title="Crown dependency">crown dependency</a> of the United Kingdom.

As a result, terminology pertaining to the islands and its constituent parts can often be used in ways which are confusing, ambiguous or cause potential offense. (See British Isles (terminology) - possibly other relevant pages (Britain).)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Paragraph 4 to:
<dl>
<dd>In particular, as the adjective "<a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a>" usually means "of the United Kingdom", the term "British Isles" can cause objection, particularly in Ireland, as the term is often interpreted to imply that the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> is part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This I think reflects the key issue (the relationship of Ireland and the UK), while pointing to places where more specific information can be had.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Possible problems:
<dl>
<dd>1. "a complex political history". Perhaps "complex political histories" would be better, but that seems to imply one history per island. I think there's a better wording out there somewhere.</dd>
<dd>2. We are now referring to England, Scotland and Wales in para 2 but not "defining" them until para 3.</dd>

<p>Personally I believe you <i>have to mention</i> the nations. They predate the modern states and have a strong lineage, sense of identity and nationalist pride. Simply referring to the modern-day states would be seen by many people in those states are marginalising them and potentially offensive. Millions of people on the island of Great Britain define themselves as much Welsh, Scottish or English as they do British. Indeed many feel a greater affinity with the nations than the states. The archipelago consists of three types of members: 2 states, 4 nations (plus Northern Ireland which falls between all the stools as it isn't a state, nor a nation, and has two communities who feel attachments or one or other states), and smaller islands which have a cultural existene but not a nationhood or statehood. IMHO it would be as unthinkable to leave England, Scotland and Wales out as it would be to leave Ireland or the United Kingdom out of the opening paragraph. Apart from anything else the four nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland) have existed for far longer on the archipelago (arguably in some senses over a millennium or more) than either of the states, one of which is only two centuries old, and one only eighty years. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 20:41, 27 July 2006 (UTC)\</p>

<dd>My challenege then is how to do this without a. sounding clumsy and b. causing confusion for those who do not know the current situation. The lead should be clear and concise - so try telling people in a quick, one sentence, that there are four nations on the archipalego, plus the IoM, but two states, one of which has the same name but does not cover the same area as one of the nations. This is why there is a terminology page and this is why RoI is the best way to deal with it. I'm not against the mentioning of the four nations <i>per se</i> but disagree that they are anymore legitimate than the states and I'm not convinced that there is a concise and clear way of including them. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, this could possibly be solved by having a 'current political make up' section. This could also describe the policies of various parties and groups on what the political make up ought to be - from those groups who think that Northern Ireland should merge into Ireland to those who think that the two states should be merged together as one. Just a thought, would add a couple of paragrpahs to the article. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:22, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there are two main problems with this sentance. The first is the use of the word <i>nation</i>, which in my dictionary (Concise OED) means <i>A large number of people of mainly common descent, language, history, etc., usu. inhabiting a territory bounded by defined limits and forming a society under one government.</i> You don't have to think very hard or to read many books to see the difficulties in applying these concepts to the British Isles. The second problem is that nationalism is a relatively young idea. The nation state is pretty much a 19th century concept (originally pushed by the British government, ironically enough) that really only became dominant after the First World War and the idea of political nationalism can be argued to have become important in early modern times. As the adjective <i>British</i> dates from the Roman occupation, these are not particularly historic ideas. My opinion is that it would be best to stick to current political realities (i.e. six bits including IoM), as this will not be open to interpretation. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 23:05, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good points there. But really, should we be letting some old Romans scribblings decide as to the modern interpretation of the British Isles. Or should we be deferring to 19th century thinking on the nationalism of the various parts. A nation would not necessarily need self government to be valid. Try telling the Welsh or the Scottish people that their countries are not nations, guess they wouldn't agree. MelForbes 23:34, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Interesting point. Modern terminology is always difficult, particularly as some people insist that Scotland is a nation, others a country, others a region, and each side is likely to delete the other's viewpoint.</p>
<p>I think it is vital to mention Scotland, Wales and England up front. The reason is simple. From 4 years experience I have a reasonably good nose for issues likely to provoke edit wars. Mentioning the UK and the ROI but not Scotland, Wales and England would infuriate nationalists in those countries/nations/regions. Whether tomorrow, next week or next month, a massive edit war is likely to erupt on the issue.</p>
<p>From experience I've found that the way to avoid controversy over modern terms is to use historically agreed terms. Yet it does mean the opening is a bit longer than normal, but then openings of controversial articles by necessity often are longer at the start to allow careful language to diffuse 'dangerous' topics. <i>That</i> is why I deliberately wrote about how the archipelago consists of 2 states, the ROI and the UK, the latter formed though a series of mergers of the Kingdoms of England, Scotland and the Principality of Wales. Yet it was longer that way, but it dodged the issue of what do we call those places <i>now</i>. It is a trick I've learnt in my four years here. The mention of the places (see, I'm avoiding saying what they actually are! lol) gets in, so the Scots, the Welsh and the English see their places mentioned. But it is in a form that there is no dispute over, as they were the formal names and descriptions. Plus doing it that way disarms (if you'll pardon the expression in the circumstances) the Northern Irish. They could claim to be a region. Some even claim to be a nation. But they can hardly demand inclusion in a list of singular kingdoms and principalities. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A cunning plan. I think I preferred your plan A rather than historical nations- <i>nation</i> is an abused word nowadays that is rapidly losing meaning.

<dd>Good point: it's a bit easy to automatically infer such things in a national context where pretending to play the flute is all across the newspapers as "sectarian".

The terms nationalists and unionists to be linked to the appropriate pages.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Meaning of British</span></h2>
<p>It is my belief that the first couple of sentences of the the bit in the intro that disucsses the meaning of British has been incorrectly changed of late. The issue is that British means 'of the United Kingdom', not that it means 'of Great Britain'. Furhtermore, the historical meanings and developmetn of it e.g the anglo-saxon chronicles bit, is irrelevant to the intro. The 'of the United Kingdom' part has been the intro right through this debate, pretty much. I recently noted above that this appeared to be consensus and no users objected. I will not revert this however, if other users think that I'm wrong. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 14:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree, and I've modified it to be more neutral and make more sense of the rest of the sentence. Dunno what the main OED says, but my concise version gives different OE spellings and points to earlier sources. When it applied to Ireland is a bit complex, but my investigations so far indicate that it has been used for that at times. As for meanings of Britishness in Ireland, <a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm" class="external text" title="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm" rel="nofollow">this link</a> is interesting. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 21:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have reverted it again. The point of the terminology debate is that in Great Britain, the term <i>British Isles</i> is geographic and non-political while it Ireland it is political and imperial. The reason for this is because of two of the meanings of <i>British</i>. The first is the name given to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain (at least) from either the Latin and/or the Old Celtic, which was first used <i>in English</i>in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, used in the first maps (in Latin and French), used by Shakespeare, and still used in this way (in <i>The Sunday Times</i> this week, for example). With this meaning, the term <i>British Isles</i> is politically neutral (at least in modern times), which is why it has no charge in the UK. This is definition 1 in the OED.</p>
<p>Meaning 2 of <i>British</i> is "Of belonging to Great Britain, or its inhabitants. In the earlier instances only a geographical term adopted from Latin; from the time of Henry VIII frequently used to include English and Scotch; in general use in this sense from the accession of James I, and in 17th c., often opposed to <i>Irish</i>; legally adopted at the Union in 1707. Now chiefly used in political or imperial connexion [...]; also in scientific and commercial use [...].". This is most definitely not politically neutral, especially in Ireland, whence the controversy.</p>
<p>You are serving no one by not explaining the origins of the dispute. In my opinion, it is quite satisfying all round to find:</p>
<p>(a) the origins are non-political (in modern terms); (b) the objection in Ireland is deep seated (see the bit after James I in the second definition), not a modern sensitivity.</p>
<p>The definitions are from the big-boys' version of the OED. This is about as authoritative as you can get unless there has been recent scholarship adding new information. I would love to know the basis on which you think it is incorrect. Incidentally, the other meanings of <i>British</i> are: of or belonging to Brittany, elliptical plural noun, and in combination with other words. Regular spelling is a relatively modern invention. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 22:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You big rich boys haven't cited meaning 1 in the full OED: the sentence you favour rules out the "at least" and indicates that it originally excludes Ireland, thus making the "however" part of the sentence completely puzzling. The anglo-saxon spellings appear to be a source rather than the same word, and at that time it apparently meant "some of the inhabitants" rather than "the inhabitants". Please clarify. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:45, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't know who you are calling rich- you should try using a library. If you want the full monty on definition 1 (I just thought definition 2 was full of interesting stuff):</p>
<p>1.a. <i>Of or pertaining to the ancient Britons. Now chiefly in ethnological and archaeological use.</i> b. <i>Of or pertaining to the Celtic (Brthyonic) language of the ancient Britons; later, = Welsh, occas. Cornish. Also as noun.</i></p>
<p>It is not clear whether it includes the Irish or not- the relations between the Romans and the inhabitants of Ireland then are generally obscure- but Ptolemy in his geography apparently included both <i>Hibernia</i> (Ireland) and <i>Albion</i> (Great Britain) within <i>Britannia</i>. <a href="http://www.roman-britain.org/ptolemy.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roman-britain.org/ptolemy.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> It does not really matter: meaning 1 (from which the term <i>British Isles</i> seems to originate) does not imply political overlordship (unless you are a believer in Welsh imperialism), but is an ancient ethnological term; meaning 2 does; hence the difficulty.</p>
<p>There is no official start date for the English language. The OED traces words back to its root. In this case the modern <i>British</i> can be traced back directly with the same meaning to the same root. Regular spelling only came in with printing, and even the Victorians could be irregular as amatter of course (arguably we still are). The fact that a word has different spellings is not here or there, it is the root and meaning that is important. Determining this is obviously hard, and it is this that makes the OED such a formidible scholarly achievement. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle used the term ethnographically (e.g <i>Her sind on ɐis iʒlande fif ʒeɐeode. Englisc and Brittisc and Wilsc, and Scyttisc and Pyhtisc and Boc Leden</i>). Some dodgy transliteration of Old English letters there, and I have no idea who the Boc Leden were. This was nearly a 1000 years after the Roman invasion though, when perhaps it was less complicated. It is not clear whether the English word came direct from the Old Celtic and influenced by the Latin, or from the Latin directly. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 23:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for these clarifications for us folks who don't have ready access to a library with the OED. As I hope you'll understand, the simplified paragraph in the introduction could be rather misleading as it misses out nuances in the OED definition. While it seems to me to be rather much detail for the intro, I've tried to clarify the paragraph to bring it into line with the OED. I've not commented on the spellings, but it may be noted that sometimes spellings carry particular sub meanings. Your point about Ptolemy is of particular interest as it contradicts what seems to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in the terminology section: I'll correct that accordingly. The cite you give from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ties in with <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> translation of Bede "the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins.", though it seems to add in the Welsh. Note that these are language "nations" and what presumably is "book latin" is not necessarily ethnographic: both ethnography and its usage of terms like Brythonic and Goidelic appear to date from the early 17th centuty. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 09:43, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still think that having all this stuff about the etymology of British fudges the issue. The important thing in the deabte is that British means 'of the United Kingdom' (e.g. 'I am a British citizen'; 'Belfast is a British city'). When someone here's the term 'British Isles', they would then, quite reasonably, presume that the isles being reffered to are all in the United Kingdom. This is why people in the Republic of Ireland object to being included in the term (I guess a Northern Irish Republican would reject the term's assertions but accept its poilitical reality if reffering to Northern Ireland). At the moment, the intro does not mention this meaning of 'British' at all, whilst referring to how the term was used a thousand years ago; it jsut seems to confuse things. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, sorry to interupt the flow of this, but I didn't want to create yet another sub-heading. I just wanted to note that I have made a change to the beginning of paragraph 4 in the Introduction. A contributor inserted a piece about the BI term first being used in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or something like that. I removed it, not because I was disagreeing with the point, but because I believe it was unnecessary detail for the Introduction and made the paragraph too long. I also inserted 'mistakenly' back into the second sentence, for obvious reasons!!!:) Please continue discussion on '(Great) Britain' below if you like.

<p>Look, it's very simple: <i>British</i> has two different meanings. The first, older one refers to the ancient Britons and is now non-political; the second refers to the modern state (I'm not getting into an argument about the name of the UK at this stage). These are both current usages, as I stated above. There are millions of people for whom the term <i>British Isles</i> is neutral, not because they are insensitive or imperialists, but because the term has its former, non-political meaning (in Britain, the Romans in Britain is a standard school topic); there are also millions of people in the world who are only aware of the second meaning of <i>British</i>, and so for them the term <i>British Isles</i> is very much a political term. If we are to put terminology in the introduction, then we should summarise the point of view of each group to the other. The alternative is to just leave off the final para. Without the initial sentence, then it looks like the only people who use <i>British Isles</i> are making a political point.</p>
<p>Two more small things: I would leave the connection between language and culture and the anthropology generally to the professionals. We are dealing with non-academic usage, which undersatnds the ancient Britons to be the people who were in Britain before the Roman invasion. The second thing is that if you are in the UK, apparently many local authorities subscribe to the OED online, and you can gain access with a library card number. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 18:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC) I've seen that a contributor has added a phrase to para 4 which not only lengthens it unnecessarily, but is only likely to upset people. I refer to the piece that reads: 'The adjective British has been used from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle onwards to refer to the pre-roman inhabitants of the isles'. I think this would just lead to even further lengthening as 'debateably...by some...objectional to others' or the like is inserted. I have removed it to leave: 'As the adjective British has come to mean either "of Great Britain" or "of the United Kingdom", the use and meaning of the phrase "British Isles" is disputed by some.' I have also inserted 'mistakenly' back into 'The term is often mistakenly interpreted to imply that the Republic of Ireland is part of the United Kingdom', for blindingly obvious reasons!!!

<dd>MAG1, if you want the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle bit in the article, please put it in the body of the article.

The first problem with paragraph four is that... it's the fourth paragraph. The intro is too long, and touches upon the "terminological controversy" issue <i>twice</i> (in pars 1 and 4). I think folding the contents or the second pass at the same topic into the body of the article would be preferable, especially if it's going to continue to attempt to grow in "point and counterpoint" fashion. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What errors? What POV? The use of <i>British</i> as pre-Roman people is from the OED and explained at great length above in the talk page. It really isn't a debatable matter. The removal of the material was made without discussion. Good point Alai, I don't think people are interested in a good article. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 20:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"The adjective British has been used from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle onwards to refer to the pre-roman inhabitants of the isles"</i>, unquote. The sentence implies universal usage, not so. Irish were Q-Celtic Gaels, Britons were P-Celtic and not Gaels, ie different cultures. <i>"In Ireland the term is often interpreted to imply mistakenly that the Republic of Ireland is part of the United Kingdom"</i>, unquote. People in Ireland don't often mistakenly interpret the term BI. Probably, of all the peoples on Earth they know exactly what it meaning is. MelForbes 20:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No it does not: to imply universality would need am <i>always</i> or something like that; <i>It has been raining</i> does not imply that it has been raining everywhere all the time. However, there is a continuous record of this usage from before the existance of Britain as a political entity until the present day. The link between culture and language is a topic that has launched a thousand PhD theses, and is almost certainly more complicated than you have described, but this case it does not matter as it is not the term was coined by others, not the celts. The <i>mistakenly</i> is PConlon's edit, and you should take it up with him or her. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 23:12, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there are two debates at once here. I and Pconlon do not profess to know about (or, on my behalf, give a rat's ear about) the origin of the word British and who was P, Q, L, R Celtic, Rangers or Hearts. Our problem with the whole Anglo-Saxon chronicle thing is that it is far too much detail on a tangent for the intro; nothing to do with the validity of the whole thing.

<dd>The current edit (MAG1's of 20:06 on August 1) I think has the content correct in the intro, though that paragraph is a bit messy and I might try a re-wording. For Alai's concerns... we have tried this article with a shorter intro and without the first paragraph caveat. It is not something that I personally oppose but I would note that whenever it has been tried, the intro has regrown to the current sort of length. <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> recommends an intro of 3/4 paragraphs for an article of over 30 000 characters; British Isles is currently at just over 40 000. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:19, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Aside from being (in my own judgement, then, rather than per guideline) too long, however, the "doubling back on itself" structure is especially poor, even were it desirable to say all that's currently said. Notwithstanding the likely regrowth, I'll try pruning in line with my suggestion in due course, unless brighter ideas spring up in the meantime. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Original research is not the same as sourcing. Original research is where one refers to one's own work or produces work specifically for use on Wikipedia.

<dd>You obviously aren't a political scientist. If you were, you'd know that except in states, where nomenclature is formally enacted, nomenclature of entities such as the British Isles <i>evolves</i> over a long period of time. It is not discussed in advance. It is retrospectively analysed by historians to understand how a certain nomenclature appeared. Current usage shows a set of evolving alternative nomenclature for the British Isles. No-one sat down and discussed or debated them. They just developed. It will be decades before historians analyse where they came from and why they appeared. By then, some may well have disappeared, while others will have caught on. IONA was generally seen at the start as a clever wordplay (the island of Iona links Scotland and Ireland through St Columkille) so Sir John Biggs-Davison's proposal was seen as novel. But few of us at the time believed that it would ever catch on. To our surprise it has and has grown in usage and 'developed legs', as they say, being used by academics delivering papers to the Royal Irish Academy, in the Dáil, the Seanad, the House of Commons, and internationally.</dd>

It is like asking for a photograph of a nail growing. If this was a science page, then one could expect formal discussion from day 1 about changes in nomenclature. But political science does not work that way. It will be up to historians, probably in a generation or to, to analyse why from the 1980s on a series of alternative titles for the archipelago developed. And it will be decades before they analyse in detail why some, like IONA and "British Isles and Ireland" took off, while others, like the "Northwest European Archipelago" which are occasionally used in history books, don't seem to have. Even Norman Davies, who has written more than most about what he simply calls "the isles", has said it is far too soon to analyse <i>why</i> some terms came about and from where. The meanings of the vast majority of them are patiently obvious. All right now we can do is say <i>what</i> terms <i>currently</i> exist: what ones seem to be restricted to one or two areas, and what ones, like <i>British Isles and Ireland</i>, seem to be developing a wide usage across a broad list of sources. This article, as is normal, lists what does exist now, and the degree of usage. Most of the terms only turn up in narrow areas. <i>British Isles and Ireland</i> turns up in an incredibly broad range of areas, far broader than I originally realised. Right now, it appears to be <i>the</i> alternative term, whereas IONA seems likely to have a long shelf-life but to be restricted to politics and history. The sort of analysis you are demanding has not been done, and will not be done, for decades. That is how political science and history operates. Get used to it.</dd>

<dd>I am removing the silly template, given that it is seeking information that in political science does not exist yet, and won't for decades. The article simply gives the evidence of usage, which right now is all the information that is available, and will be available for the forseeable future.

<dd>I generally like Jtdril's version of BI and Ireland and agree that we should only use 'meta-pages' where we can; my problem is with the 'is increasingly used' - this is unverified. How do we know that it was used any less, say, 20 years ago?

It is, I think unintentionally, a paragraph of your opinion on the phrase.

<dd>Thanks for the explanation. You're right, in a way. There are no published critiques I can quote on the term 'British Isles and Ireland', simply because it is not a term used by any serious organisation - for good reason. It would be a bit like referring to 'North America and Canada' - if you saw that written down you would do a double-take, and think that the writers were unprofessional. The references given for the term are all very weak - the Gibbon Regional Studbook, published by the East Midlands Zoological Society is a particular pearl. The fact that someone referred to it once in the BBC world music microsite is irrelevant - if the BBC used it regularly in the news, and had it listed as an acceptable term on its style guide, it would be very different. As a phrase it is factually incorrect according to the globally accepted use of the term British Isles - which does, like it or not, include Ireland - and there is no evidence for it being used on anything other than a very occasional basis out of ignorance: which does not merit inclusion in Wikipedia, any more than referring to a 'colonel of truth' would.

The reference was for a book called Touring Map Scotland(Collins British Isles and Ireland Maps). But the book, while it does exist, is called merely Touring Map Scotland, and is published by Collins Publishers. The erroneous title given in the reference refers to its Amazon listing, which is incorrect.

<dd>I have deleted the reference to surftheisles.com, used as an example of 'the isles' being used as a replacement for the term 'British Isles'.

I have also deleted a reference to 'BI &amp; Ireland' being used by nursing charities, as the reference given, to Medicalert Foundation British Isles and Ireland, was to a charity now renamed simply The Medic Alert Foundation (see UK Charity Commission for details), indicating that if anything the term is used less than it was.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 08:06, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I absolutely agree we certainly don't want to get into the area of OR criticisms/objections to this coinage, if no usable source supplies such. But equally, we shouldn't unduly represent this as a well-defined term with systematic arguments for its use. I've made a tweak or two in that direction. OTOH, I notice that the "unsystematic" solutions, such as "Britain and Ireland", "UK and Ireland", "BI&amp;I", which don't make much (geographical) sense as geographical terms) are winning hands down in terms of actual usage over the (allegedly) carefully thought out ones, even if they're for the moment still small potatoes compared to simply "BI". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 18:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He actually spent a decade on talk shows explaining that he was <i>not</i> talking about governments (there is no such thing as a "confederation <i>of governments</i>" BTW. Government can neither be federal nor confederal. States can operate constitutional systems that are federal or confederal). He made it repeatedly clear, as anyone who ever heard him knows, that he was talking about the cultural, political, geographic and other relationships between what is called the British Isles. He told Gay Byrne twice on the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Late_Show_5411.html" title="Late Late Show">Late Late Show</a>, and told university students often (I was at some of the debates) that he recognised the sensitivity in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_relations_66b0.html" title="Anglo-Irish relations">Anglo-Irish relations</a> of a term like "British Isles" and while he would like to see a new relationship established based on constitutional links, even based on current links the current term was problematic and offensive to many. He advocated IONA as a term that could replace British Isles in <i>all</i> its various meanings. IONA, meaning "British Isles" has been used by among others the Ancient Order of Hibernians (a nationalist organisation), Sinn Féin and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who said</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government are, of course, conscious of the emphasis that is laid on the East-West dimension by Unionists, and we are, ourselves, very mindful of the unique relationships that exist within these islands - islands of the North Atlantic or IONA as some have termed them.<a href="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/Press_Releases/19971205/273.htm" class="external text" title="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/Press_Releases/19971205/273.htm" rel="nofollow">Statement by the Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fail, Mr Bertie Ahern, TD on "Northern Ireland:Political Situation and Developments" at the Forty-Second Plenary Session of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, Dublin Castle,Friday, 5 December, 1997</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a major step towards what will be a truly historic day in the story of these islands of the North Atlantic, as they are often called, when we will finally say that violence has been replaced by democratic politics.<a href="http://www.irlgov.ie/debates-01/24oct/sect5.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.irlgov.ie/debates-01/24oct/sect5.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a></p>

<p>Quite simply, while Sir John originally had the idea of IONA as being indicative of links between states, it evolved into an alternative term to British Isles, something he was OK about because he believed an alternative term was needed anyhow. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 00:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately the <i>Late Late Show</i> transcripts only go as far back as around 2000 online—it's not like i simply deleted from the article out of the blue, i've spent a bit of time looking around (and not just google searches). If the term has evolved and Biggs-Davison has discussed this, then we ought to be able to find such in a reliable secondary source. Right now we've got a bunch of references to people using the term, and some references to secondary sources which raise some issues of ambiguity.</dd>
<dd>I used confederation of goverments because that was how i remembered one of the references characterizing the term, but it was actually: "The new confederation of "Islands of the North Atlantic" or IONA for short..."<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 01:01, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me engage in my own bit of original research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biggs-Davison constructed the acronym IONA from either "Isles of the North Atlantic" or "Islands of North Atlantic" (note missing <i>the</i>, confusing but it is directly from our source).</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> IONA (a word in it's own right, similar to radar) was his proposal, and meant to refer to a loose linkage of the isles within a council.</li>
<li>"it represented an intellectual counter-attack against the familiar thesis of Irish nationalism that the demise of the Union was inevitable." (Aughey 2005, p. 91)</li>
<li>As the concept (now <a href="../../../b/r/i/British-Irish_Council_0a05.html" title="British-Irish Council">British-Irish Council</a>) began to be discussed and take shape, various names were proposed: "British Isles Council", "Council of the Isles", and IONA.</li>
<li>Denis Canavan proposed the name IONA in response to the Ulster Unionist proposal of "Council for the British Isles."</li>
<li>Most commentators felt the need to explain this new word by using phrasing such as "IONA--the islands of the north Atlantic"</li>
<li>The phrase <i>islands of the North Atlantic</i> in most contexts is well understood to mean all the isles, including the Faroes and Iceland.</li>
<li>IONA when combined with <i>islands of the North Atlantic</i> most often refers to a council and not the archipelago. (especially those references prior to the formation of the British-Irish council)</li>
<li>Some have indeed used "Islands of the North Atlantic" as a proper name and absent the acronym IONA, and in some instances it is clear from context that they refer to the <i>British Isles</i>, but this usage is very minor to date.</li>
<li>Some have also taken the acronym IONA as being similar to NATO, formed from a proper name for the archipelago. This usage is also very minor and recent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now i do not claim any of the above is <i>The Truth</i>, but do say that this version is at least as supportable as that of the current articles. Should the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islands_of_the_North_Atlantic_9a9d.html" title="Islands of the North Atlantic">Islands of the North Atlantic</a> article be moved to <a href="../../../i/o/n/IONA_348f.html" title="IONA">IONA</a> and discuss the acronym as a proposed name of the council? The introductory sentence of that article states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<b>Islands of the North Atlantic</b>" (<b>IONA</b>) was suggested by Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Biggs-Davison_64e8.html" title="John Biggs-Davison">John Biggs-Davisonas</a> a less contentious alternative to the term "<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>" to refer to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain_and_Ireland_3cad.html" title="Britain and Ireland">Britain and Ireland</a> and the smaller associated islands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this really supported by the references we've found so far? Biggs-Davison coined IONA, and it was later suggested as a less contentious name for the council.</p>
<p>The current version of this article comes closer to what is supported by our references, but in my opinion there are two separate concepts which are incorrectly conflated:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>IONA</i> (<b>I</b>slands/Isles <b>o</b>f the <b>N</b>orth <b>A</b>tlantic): a proposed name for a council</li>
<li><i>Islands of the North Atlantic</i>: a proper name for the archipelago absent the acronym</li>
</ol>
<p>we should make sure that references supporting concept #1 are not used to imply #2. There is some fast-and-loose application of quotes and references within the alternative terms section: take for instance the full quote for De Rossa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acronym IONA is a useful way of addressing the coming together of these two islands. However, the island of Iona is probably a green heaven in that nobody lives on it and therefore it cannot be polluted in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>how can this tongue-in-cheek mention of the "coming together" of two islands support increasing usage equivalent to <i>British Isles</i>?<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 19:25, 30 July 2006 (UTC) <a name="Atlantic_archipelago" id="Atlantic_archipelago"></a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cassiterides</span></h2>
<p>This was a term that <i>may</i> have been applied to the British Isles in ancient times from c. 300 BC, though the Wikipedia article on it - <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassiterides.html" title="Cassiterides">Cassiterides</a> - appears to unduly emphasise that it possibly only referred to the Scilly Isles, or perhaps some mythicial islands off Spain. The term comes from Greek and means "Tin Islands", as the British Isles were the major source of tin in the ancient world. The tin mines, needless to say, are on mainland Cornwall, not the Scillies, which speaks against the identification of Cassiterides with the Scillies alone.</p>
<p>In any case, my point is this. Neologisms such as IONA (even ignoring the absurd exclusion of Iceland, Newfoundland, etc. from that phrase) may indeed be deliberately employed by a tiny minority in order to make a political statement, but what about when we are discussing historical or even prehistoric periods?</p>
<ul>
<li>The British Isles were separated from mainland Europe about 6000 BC.</li>
<li>Stone circles were built across the whole of the British Isles during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anglo-Celtic Isles is clearly wrong for such periods, and IONA is just ridiculous - and smacks very much of the NI peace process.

<dd>Historians use <i>northwest European archipelago</i>, <i>Hiberno-Britannic Isles</i> and <i>Hiberno-British Archipelago</i>. A number of American universities regard using <i>British Isles</i> for the archipelago as being the equivalent of writing <i>Peking</i> for the Chinese capital or <i>Salisbury</i> for the Zimbabwian capital, i.e., an old term whose usage reflects culturally exclusive or supremacist use of language. I don't share that particular interpretation but many academic conferences in the US and in Europe try where possible not to use <i>British Isles</i>, seeing it as outdated and extremely politically incorrect and potentially divisive and offensive to some people. If you think such views are reflective of a tiny minority you are chronically mistaken. IONA has now been used at various levels of the British parliament and government while <i>British Isles and Ireland</i> has developed a widespread usage in the last decade. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:27, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately neither speech is on the internet to link to so I am not adding it in to the article until I have more details. (I have done a lot of work on British royalty pages on WP so have been dealing with the press offices of the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, etc. I've asked some contacts to source the speeches, dates and to whom they were delivered. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 23:36, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>TharkunColl - Your point is illogical. How can you say that Anglo-Celtic Isles is not acceptable when discussing prehistorisc times because Angles and Celts weren't resident in the archipelago but argue that British Isles is? The British weren't there either!! What is your problem with accepting the term is a relic which is rarely used in one of the sovereign states which makes up the archipelago? <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 02:51, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correct. It is rarely used in one of the sovereign states, and seen by many of its residents as offensive and agenda-driven. It is declining in use in academia, broadcasting, publishing, etc. If it wasn't for the fact that that there is no clear agreement on a replacement <i>right now</i> its usage would have collapsed. It is already seen as by many in Scotland, Wales and even England as an anarchonism — Donald Dewar as Scottish First Minister used IONA, not the British Isles, when speaking of the archipelago in Ireland and abroad. Members of the Royal Family have used other terms. In many cases, where it is used at all it is now used as <i>British Isles and Ireland</i>. Tharkuncoll's point is illogical. He believes that the term "British Isles" is universally used and approved of, when it demonstrably is not. If and when some alternative, whether it is IONA, 'British Isles and Ireland', Anglo-Celtic Isles or whatever, comes to be seen as a universally viable alternative, the odds are that "British Isles" will go the away of old language references like <a href="../../../k/y/n/Kyne.html" title="Kyne">Kyne</a>, Negro, etc and be dropped as reflective of a perspective, in its case the old claim (repeated, typically, by <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonto_238a.html" title="User:Jonto">Jonto</a>, earlier on this page) that the archipelago contains a shared culture, identity, history and definitions that everyone on the archipelago could be described as "British".</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../m/a/u/Maud_Gonne_21b6.html" title="Maud Gonne">Maud Gonne</a> famously as a school child got into trouble for refusing to recite a poem that ended with her saying she was a "happy English child". She instead said "happy Irish child", getting herself into serious trouble. The insistence that Irish school children call themselves "English" and "British" in school as late as the first decade of the 20th century in the British-run, British-orientated education system (which also banned the Irish language and insisted that children learn British, not Irish, history), gives some indication as to why Irish people take such offence at being called "British". Ireland had to fight a bloody war of independence to be allowed leave the United Kingdom. At the end of it still being called "British" in an archipelago context infuriates people, and causes endless hassle. In 1952, when Queen Elizabeth II was proclaimed queen in South Africa, the proclamation on the Queen's title called her also <i>Queen of Ireland</i>. The government of the Republic of Ireland, understandably, went ballistic, and pointed out that Her Majesty's father had ceased to be <i>King of Ireland</i> on 1 April 1949. The response in Pretoria was "but you are part of the British Isles. How can you not then have the Queen as your queen?" Initially, even though it was demonstrably wrong, they refused to back down until Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Irish were right and Pretoria 100% wrong. Michael Gorbachev made a similar mistake as late as 1989. He only narrowly avoided for telling the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, to send on the greetings of the Soviet president and people to <i>Her Majesty the Queen of Ireland</i>. He couldn't understand how if we were a republic, and our head of state President Hillery, we still tolerated people saying we live on the "British Isles". In reality we do so at best through gritted teeth. At worst we erupt in anger at the suggestion as far as we are concerned we are not part of the British Isles, that that term no longer covers the Irish part of archipelago.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whatever about the long distant origins of the term, its usage in recent centuries has carried a clear agenda-driven meaning, which while (dubiously) accurate prior to Irish independence when the entire archipelago could be described as possessing, with some variants, a unified cultural and systematic inheritance, was no longer accurate in any sense from the early 20th century. <i>Negro</i> too was in theory a neutral term that simply described people by skin colour. But the word carried with it so many racial stereotypes that it was replaced by a term which translated as the same but without the baggage. The same is true with <i>British Isles</i>. It possesses vast amounts of imperial baggage which make the term irritating at best, offensive at most, to many Irish nationalists, Scottish nationalists <i>across the parties</i>, Welsh nationalists across the parties, and English nationalists. Just as <i>British</i> was dropped from many other international organisations, because of its perceived offensiveness (try telling people in Canada, Australia et al that they live in the <i>British</i> Commonweath rather than the <i>Commonwealth of Nations</i> and see the reaction) and Anglo-centrism, so it will eventually be dropped from the name of these islands, just as soon one of the many terms used to describe the archipelago, whether the <i>British Isles and Ireland</i>, <i>IONA</i>, the <i>Anglo-Celtic Isles</i>, the <i>northwest European Archipelago</i> or the others in use, comes to be the accepted one across the archipelago. As of now, <i>British Isles and Ireland</i> is the most widely used alternative across topics, while IONA is the most widely used of the alternatives in the Isles themselves. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 03:44, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>British Isles has never been acurate. It was first named after a group of people who occupied part of some of the islands and even if you take it to mean British 'owned' Isles not only is it including Ireland (in case anyone has missed that point) it doesn't include the Channel Islands or any of the Overseas Territories. Welcome to world of naming, it is actually rarer to see it done acurately. We have the Irish Sea, Anglo Saxons, Indian Subcontinent, Persian Gulf, Obler's Law, Greenland, and Monkey Puzzles. No amount of arguing on this page or point the problem out in the article is going to change the fact that most people use the term British Isles and others don't like it. Apart from the fact that the article spends almost as much time discussing two words as the 2,000 islands they refer to there are other deficiencies that more urgently need attention. It completely lacks a natural history section, flora and fauna arn't there (those damn animals refuse to accept political boundries so its better suited here than a county article), the geography section doesn't mention any of the major features (mountain ranges, rivers, seas etc), what's the future for the islands (are they drifting towards or away from the continent, are they sinking) and the genetic make up of the British Isles. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshurtree_32f2.html" title="User:Joshurtree">josh</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshurtree_fda5.html" title="User talk:Joshurtree">talk</a>) 05:08, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why should that be in a <i>British</i> Isles article. That term is unacceptable, a substantial amount of the fauna of Ireland i.e. the <i>Homo sapiens</i>, which makes up 50% of the sovereign states, finds the term objectionable. Why not place it in the IONA article? How could we write about the flora &amp; fauna of the <i>British</i> Isles when a part of them doesn't recognise the term? <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 09:23, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the term <i>is</i> used in Ireland, even by government departments.

And if you're going to try and claim Homo sapiens as fauna, then the population of RoI is outnumbered by that of the UK by a massive 15 to 1. So even if every single Irish person objected to the term (which they don't), the vast majority of the human "fauna" of the islands still use it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 10:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting in stuff about flora, fauna etc is pointless as each of the islands and states mentioned has their own article for that stuff. Actually the entire history stuff is pointless too as that too is covered already in detail elsewhere. The reality <i>British Isles</i> is a rather pointless term about an archipelago that more often now discribed via its individual pieces than by any <i>supposed</i> shared culture, heritage, history, etc. Writing a big article covering the archipelago's supposed shared heritage (try getting Irish people and British people to agree on Henry II, on Strongbow, on Cromwell, on the Act of Union, etc etc) is sooooo 1950s. It reminds me of an old encyclopaedia I came across (I think it was called the <i>Empire Encyclopaedia</i> which had pages and pages about the British Isles — meaning England — in mind-numbing detail, down to a picture of "the King" (didn't say of where!) and "the Prime Minister" (of where?), and basically regulated the Scottish to being skirt-wearing big drinkers always <i>och aye</i>ing out of them and bemoaning Bonnie Prince Charlie. The Welsh were characatured as leek-eating singing miners who lived in the countryside and talked in some gobbledigook language to each other (but did of course have the Royal Welch to fight for King, Country and Empire — God save the King!), while the Irish (who got one entire paragraph) were heavy-drinking paddies who build the empire's roads for the Brits "good on yew, peddy"! And on top of the article on the "British Isles" on each of the many (oh so many) pages pictures of the Union Jack and the Crown. The harp was shown precisely twice — once as part of the royal standard, once a <i>crowned harp</i> from the British regime in Ireland pre-1922. When you opened each page they practically played "Rule Britannia". <i>That</i> is how some people seem still to think when the term "British Isles" is mentioned. And then you wonder why some Scots and Welsh people are irritated by it, while the Irish at best find that it gives them the creeps, at worst it offends them.</p>

I fear you may be hand-waving. I can find very little on Irish natural history, and I would like to hear exactly on an overall basis exactly how distinct it would be from British natural history (very little I would guess, apart from the lack of reptiles in Ireland, though I am never sure if that is a myth). I think also you are extrapolating rather- I gave a link somewhere on this page to recent usage in <i>The Guardian</i>. Beacause it was abused by an imperialist book does not mean that therefore all usage of the term is imperialist. Funnily enough my impression that one use that <i>British Isles</i> is not used for extensively is to denote common culture, history &amp;tc The point of Stone and others was actually to try and show that the histories of different bits of the archipelago were interconnected and could not be hacked into bleeding chunks. Your book actually sounds like it was in favour of the bleeding chunks rather than trying to integrate the history, the traditional "English history is the most important thing, and everything else is a sideshow".<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 18:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is an interesting point. The basic problem is a simple one. Certainly in politics and culture, which were the two key contexts British Isles was understood, the perception from the Victorian period on unfortunately tended to be <i>British Isles = British = English</i>. That approach has tended to shape the perspectives of many non-English people to the term, who found that it in many ways wrote off their contribution and was Anglocentric — I remember a 1950s schoolbook that had practically all mention of the British Isles focused on England, with the rest of the archipelago limited to having their own unique features pickpocketed in effect to be included in a glorified article on England. Scotland's only mention was when some of its geographic features were the biggest in the British Isles. Ireland's only mention (not even by name) was that Lough Neagh was the biggest inwater lake in the British Isles. (Typical of this continuing attitude — shown on this page with Jonto's contributions which insisted all Irish people are British! — was edits on Wikipedia where one editor insisted on trying to delete all mentions anywhere that Lough Neagh was on the island of Ireland, mentioning it only in terms of its size vis-a-vis the British Isles.) Wales was mentioned as the biggest coal producer in the British Isles, with its coal powering the <i>"English"</i> economy!</dd>
<dd>One sees the same anglocentrism even today. I mentioned earlier on this page how promotional material for the "British Isles" edition of TIME almost exclusively focused on England, with Ireland relegated to a one-word mention in the bumpf while Scotland, Wales and the rest of the archipelago didn't exist. (As a visual image of a British Isles city they used London. As the representation of a symbol of the British Isles in the magazine they used a picture of the Queen.) In the eyes of whomever drew up that leaflet, British Isles = England and some other unnamed bits tagged on if needed.</dd>
<dd>It is because of this anglocentrist definition of the British Isles (and often of Britishness) that others outside England on the archipelago feel the term "British Isles" irritating at best. Unfortunately for the term nearly two centuries of an Anglocentrist definition of the British Isles has so damaged the usability of the term that it is seen as unacceptable in Ireland and irritating to quite a large number in Scotland and Wales. I mentioned this debate <i>here</i> to a Scottish friend a few days ago. He is a moderate Labour Party supporter. His response was "God I hate that term. I wish they would scrap it." His girlfriend, a Conservative Party member from Edinburgh, said that <i>even she</i> tried to avoid using it these days. The words <i>British Isles</i> to her conjured up images of Last Night of the Proms, Land of Hope and Glory, bulldogs, Union Jacks, men in bowler hats in the City of London, and cricket. To her it didn't remind her of anything to do with Scotland, Wales or Ireland, and didn't bring together images of modern England either. She said the only people she knew who used the term were old style blue-rinse Tories in the South of England. To her it meant nothing other than a slightly old-fashioned England. To her boyfriend it made his flesh crawl. He had heard of, and much preferred IONA. To him <i>that</i> term was baggage-free, whereas <i>British Isles</i> was loaded with negatives. It may once have been an innocent geographic term but now it is too overloaded with negatives to be any modern use. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 22:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's unfair to accuse the Victorians of attempting to equate "British" with "English". Indeed, it was in the Victorian period that people first started to make a distinction between those terms, and ideas about Scottish, Irish, and Welsh nationalism began to emerge. One day, I suspect, the nations of the British Isles will all have their own self-government (as part of the EU). Perhaps then, no one will object to the perfectly innocent and descriptively all-encompassing word "British". <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 23:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The basic problem is, like the blackly humorous answer to a somewhat different question, is that there is no solution. We could move this article to <a href="../../../i/o/n/IONA_348f.html" title="IONA">IONA</a>, WISE Islands, These Isles, Those Isles, England (archipelago) (probably the "common name" if one applies no quality threshold whatsoever on frequency of references, in the way Jtd rather accurately describes), or delete it entirely, except that... well, except for so many reasons, we quite clearly can't, as we're writing what purports to be an "encyclopaedia", with a descriptive mandate, not a "public laughing stock", with one to take a bleeding edge approach on usage. If one wants to agitate for greater public uptake of an alternative term (or the lack of need for one), this isn't the place. If one wants to argue for a different naming policy, then <i>this page</i> still isn't the place. Not having this article, having it under a different name, or having it dominated by topics covered elsewhere (like material particular to components, or to terminology) aren't options, so we should concentrate on having the best article subject to what's reasonably possible, rather than railing against what isn't. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is no doubt that there is, and always will be potential for rephrasing etc etc, but that is to be expected considering the nature of WP.

<dd>Thanks for the friendly welcome to the discussion. Whatever happened to assume good faith? You don't know what my POV is on this issue, and I'm not interested in pushing it. But I do think that Wikipedia articles should aim at being concise without being simplistic, not that its always an easy thing to achieve.

<p>The <b>British Isles</b> is the most common term in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> for the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archipelago.html" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a> off the North-West coast of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> consisting of the large islands of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and numerous much smaller nearby islands. The term "British Isles" is considered inaccurate, inappropriate or offensive by many Irish people and others: see British Isles naming controversy.</p>

<dd>And we're done.

<dd>Thanks for doing that - just what I had in mind. I think this is more useful for the average reader than what is presently on the site, if only becaue they are far more likely to get to the end of it. Elegant, concise and a simple intro to the term which contains links for those who want to delve deeper into the various issues, whether they be the naming controversy or the average rainfall.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 08:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate the idea. However I think such an approach would not have a consensus as to what would go where. But it is thought-provoking.

<dd>Well if you read the archives, such proposals have been discussed before, with very little enthusiasm. Partially, I think this is because the naming controversy isn't, internationally, considered as important or contested as say, the South China Sea or Persian Gulf. That's not to belittle the concerns, just to note that outside of Ireland (and, to a lesser extent, the UK) the term is used without thought and with little knowledge of any debate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, such an article does run the risk of taking the attitude - 'well as it's controversial we'll say nothing about it' - which isn't an accetable long term situation; avoiding soemthing controversial and brushing it under the carpet, whether well meaning or not, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">just results in later conflicts</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, the current article is actually very good, and we shouldn't over look this. Climate and geology of the UK, IoM and Ireland are, in my opinion, unseperable anyway, whatever you call them. I live on the east coast of the Irish Sea - are you trying to tell me that my climate wouldn't be different if there wern't two great big chunks of rock to my west (local syaing - 'if you can see the Isle of Man, it's going to rain. If you can't see the Isle of Man, it's raining)? What about the islands' shared glacial history? If anyhting, the geography/climate section needs expanding here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree we could cut down on the shared history bit; but what about modern day politics? Some parties exist solely because of the relationship between the UK/Ireland and this page is as good an area to disucss that as any. Again, there is room for expansion here, not restriction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I just don't see the validty in reducing all of this to a dispute about a term, or to individual articles, however well meaning this solution is. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:02, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to add my thoughts - I'll respond to your points in turn:</dd>
<dd>1. Whilst you're correct that the controversy over the term is limited to a certain population of the globe, that doesn't mean it isn't notable enough to warrant an article of its own.</dd>
<dd>2. I don't think the proposal ignores the controversy, it provides a wikilink to an article on the specific subject of the controversy. That way, readers wanting to read about the controversy of the name can read about it there; readers wanting to read about the British Isles themselves can find the information they're looking for more easily.</dd>
<dd>3. I agree that climate, geology etc. are geographical attributes and therefore do belong in this article.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I think modern day politics should be covered either within the articles on the political entities (United Kingdom / Republic of Ireland) or within a separate article, Politics of the British Isles. Personally I think the former is more appropriate, as the only real cross-over of political parties is where <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is involved; information on politics of Northern Ireland belongs there. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWaggers_8e5b.html" title="User:Waggers">Waggers</a> 12:20, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your thoughts StonemadGB; I can only agree with you that the body of the article at present is a 'bit of a monster'!:) I understand however that work is already underway (by Dave Souza) to make the history section more concise. Your suggestion of a separate 'Naming Controversy' section is understandable and welcomed for its kind intent. I'm afraid though that I too feel strongly that this BI article needs to be thorough and complete, with all fascets of the term (political, historical, geological, etc...) presented within it. I believe, given what I've seen in recent weeks, that we can do this in a straight-forward manner. The naming controversy isn't a side issue! Sections of the article will need to be made more concise for sure, but up until now attention was rather focussed on getting the crucial Introduction section generally acceptable. The co-operation and sensitivity that has been shown by most parties in achieving this can, over time, allow the rest of the article to be honed to a suitable size. I would just like to say, again, that the existing 'British Isles (terminology)' article is no longer necessary in principle. That it has largely become an additional (even alternative?!) history article is regretable. There is much good work in there, which should be a part of the main article (people, please do tell me if I'm alone in thinking this). The glossary-style explanatory list of related terms would certainly in my view be a welcome, easy-to-access reference for Wikipedia users. I'd personally like to move that across as part of a tidying up of the Terminology section. I haven't done it yet because I haven't had time to concentrate on how best to do it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Great Britain?</span></h2>
<p>Another little (big?) point here. In the opening paragraph it says "<a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>". Should it not say "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>". It appears from the WP article on GB that it is a political term, so maybe the <i>Great</i> should be left out at that opening stage. -MelForbes 14:15, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Great Britain is the island; Britain doesn't really have a strict definition - sometimes it's used as shorthand for Great Britain, but more often as shorthand for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. If the Great Britain article seems overly political, it needs editing to change that; Great Britain, like the British Isles, is a geographical (not political) term. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWaggers_8e5b.html" title="User:Waggers">Waggers</a> 14:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Reading <i>Great Britain</i> i would most often assume the author meant the island, but dictionaries do seem to give two definitions for both <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>. My guess would be the island is most often listed first for <i>Great Britain</i> and the republic first for <i>Ireland</i>. An older version of the article made things clear with "the island of...", but this was changed in order to get the "most commonly know as..." modifier into the first sentence. MelForbes are you reading <i>Ireland</i> as refering to the republic in that sentence?<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 14:51, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well Great Britain can be a political term, to refer to the UK excluding Northern Ireland. I think the best thing to do here would be to put Great in parentheses. People probably use both "Great Britain and Irleand" and "Britain and Ireland". Depending on how someone is using the word 'Ireland', as <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> points out, both could be used; and even then, 'Great Britain' could be being used incorrectly in the phrase but it still sounds correct. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:13, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was reading some very old text (pre 1920) on the BI's, and apparently the BI's were at that time just Ireland and Britain, just the 2 isles. All the other isles were just incidental, with no big deal about them whatsoever. Yea, I was reading the paragraph as just islands, but it seemed contradictory as I read elsewhere on WP that <i>Great Britain</i> was a political term. As by way of example, if a person lived in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_ca39.html" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, would he/she live in <i>Britain</i> or live in <i>Great Britain</i>? -MelForbes 15:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Neither, both, or either one. Choose which and we can find some definitions to suit (i like neither).<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricR_931f.html" title="User:EricR">EricR</a> 17:25, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>LOL, now we are not sure about <i>Britain</i> v <i>Great Britain</i>, I don't suppose that he/she would choose the BI as the first or even second choice, or even the third. Point I'm making is that a lot of these terms are loose terms and are not written in granite! -MelForbes 17:40, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term <i>Great Britain</i> arose to distinguish it from <i>Brittany</i>, which also has a celtic culture, predates the kingdom of Great Britain, and has nothing to do politics. Can we not manufacture artificial controversies. What next? The word <i>history</i> is inherently sexist?<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 18:35, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
