<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brickhouse_Betty_28a5.html" title="Edit section: Betty's Traits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Betty's Traits</span></h2>
<p>Betty is considered as the typical dumb blonde. She is kind and innocent, but is a bit dull and gullible and the men in the episodes use that to persuade her into their sexual joy. In fact, in every episode, she ends up topless, and except for the Easter Blonde episode, completely naked. Another irony is that although there are chances where Betty could hang out with a more handsome figure (for instance, JD in Irish Blonde and Lifesaver Betty episodes), in the end, it is the unattractive men who rape her.</p>
<p>An interview on Boites Jaunes.com reveal that she went to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Copenhagen_0fb2.html" title="University of Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a>, where she did a performance of "Annie Get Your Gun", and had Niels Bohr as a friend. She also knows a little about <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, yet does not seem to be able to do simple math. She calls herself of a "cat person". She says that she is a very good waitress, but she continuously says that she does not like <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprechaun.html" title="Leprechaun">leprechauns</a>. She wants to be a beaver.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brickhouse_Betty_28a5.html" title="Edit section: Other Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other Characters</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Santa: First seen in "Irish Blonde" as a bartender, but in his original form in "The Christmas Blonde 2". A jolly figure, but sometimes gets violent in front of those who rape Betty. He saves Betty on two occasions, on the latter two episodes of the Christmas episodes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Grandpa Slappy: First seen in "Christmas Blonde", but properly introduced in "The Vacation Blonde". His name is revealed in "The Christmas Blonde 2", when his cover is blown. He is a sex-crazy, balding old man with a cane, who raped Betty twice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>JD: First seen in "Jungle Blonde" as a <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>-like man. His proper name is introduced in "Lifeguard Betty". He is a sun-tanned, attractive, hunky Australian, who makes gorilla sounds and tries to get close to Betty. He also cameos in "The Christmas Blonde 2" as a policeman who arrests Grandpa Slappy's plan to get sexual pleasure from Betty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sven: First seen in "Irish Blonde", as a <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprechaun.html" title="Leprechaun">leprechaun</a> who gives three wishes to Betty.

Later, he is shown as a policeman in "The Christmas Blonde 2".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Augus: First shown in "Easter Blonde", he is dressed as an <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Bunny_43a3.html" title="Easter Bunny">Easter Bunny</a> in a shopping mall.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Frank: First shown in "Dick or Treat", Frank is a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>-like monster, who trick-or-treats in front of Betty's door.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brickhouse_Betty_28a5.html" title="Edit section: Episodes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Episodes</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>"'The Christmas Blonde'"</li>
</ul>
<p>Betty is waiting for Santa to come, wearing only a red bra and red panties. Santa appears, comments "sweet Jesus" and pretends to faint. He uses a puppet to tell Betty that the only way to wake up Santa is to give him a blowjob. The episode ends as Betty wondering if she should do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'The Vacation Blonde'"</li>
</ul>
<p>An old man called Grandpa Slappy passes by a window at a hotel. He hears orgasmic noises coming from a room and peeks in. Naked Betty is bouncing up and down on a bed. She appears to be having sex, but turns out to only be trying to close her suitcase.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'The Jungle Blonde'"</li>
</ul>
<p>Betty is swinging through the jungle on a vine in a leopard bikini. A <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>-like man, who is revealed in later episodes to be named JD, follows and eventually grabs her. In the next scene, JD strips her and they have intercourse in several positions and then JD swings away, smoking a cigarette. A chimpanzee then makes a sexual gesture at Betty.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'The Irish Blonde'"</li>
</ul>
<p>Betty is depicted as a waitress during <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Day_ca65.html" title="St. Patrick's Day">St. Patrick's Day</a>. She meets a leprechaun named Sven who offers three wishes. Her first is that all of the men in the tavern are interested only in her, a wish that is granted by stripping her naked. Betty screams, but everybody in the room IS interested only in her. Her second wish is a man "hung like a horse". Sven turns out to be this man, extending his penis to almost as long as he is tall, while forcing Betty into fellatio. Betty's third wish is that she wanted a hunky man, and Sven becomes hunky and naked as well. They fall over and have sex on the floor. Grandpa Slappy then says to the bartender, Santa, "I'll have what he's havin'."</p>
<ul>
<li>"'The Easter Blonde'"</li>
</ul>
<p>An <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>-bunny-costumed man named Angus is working at a shopping centre. Betty appears to think he is the real bunny, and Angus takes it as a sign of stupidity. He tricks her into looking away (saying that there is a leprechaun), then punches out the bottom of the basket and sticks his <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> through. He describes it as an Easter whistle and suggests she blow on it. While Betty tries it, her top falls off. When it proves to not work, he advises her to suck on it. It still doesn't work, and Betty then notes that she can't get it out of the basket. She yanks on it. Angus cums all over her, and Betty realizes what has just happened as Easter-egg patterned semen is sprayed on her <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breasts.html" title="Breasts">breasts</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'Lifeguard Betty'"</li>
</ul>
<p>Betty works as a lifeguard along with JD. JD asks her for a mouth-to-mouth, which she says is only for drowning people. Grandpa Slappy overhears this and pretends to drown. Betty runs down the beach towards him, <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baywatch.html" title="Baywatch">Baywatch</a>-style. Her bikini comes off in the process, leaving her completely naked, and she gives him mouth to mouth among other types of <a href="../../../c/p/r/CPR_4e3f.html" title="CPR">CPR</a>. He gets an erection which bursts through his shorts and into Betty's anus.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'The Christmas Blonde 2"'</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the sequel of "The Christmas Blonde", produced one year after the original. Betty, now topless, gives Santa the blowjob she was supposed to in the previous Christmas Blonde episode, saying that it is for the children of the world. Meanwhile, the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> seems to enjoy it. Then, another Santa Claus comes down the chimney and fights the other. The Santa Claus is revealed to be Grandpa Slappy in disguise. JD and Sven, appearing as policemen, appear and arrest Slappy. The real Santa calls Slappy "a very naughty boy." The real Santa apologizes to Betty. When Betty asks how she can repay him, Santa pulls out the puppet and begins "Well...", probably suggesting a sexual activity much as the Santa impostor did.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'Dick or Treat'"</li>
</ul>
<p>A "Brickhouse Betty Quickie". It is <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> and a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>-like monster named Frank appears at Betty's house and asks for candy. Betty tells him she has no candy, but Frank notices her very large breasts and strips her and himself naked. Betty then notices that she is naked. Lightning flashes and he rapes her in various ways. Grandpa Slappy yells "It's alive!" In the end, Frank urinates an excess amount of semen. This episode is the first time that Betty actually yells that she is being raped.</p>
<ul>
<li>"'The Christmas Blonde 3: The Snatch'"</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the sequel of The Christmas Blonde 3. Betty, wearing very revealing bikinis, is sunbathing with Santa who is relieved from the Grandpa Slappy incident. Betty is kidnapped by The Puppeteer, who is revealed to be an old employee of Santa's. The Puppeteer sends two women who look exactly like Betty but for their skin and hair color, named Holly and Jolly, to distract Santa while the Puppeteer has sex with Betty. Santa resists and rescues Betty.</p>

<p>There is one game at the official Betty website - Flashing Betty. When the mouse cursor is over Betty's breasts or genitals, she will flash them. The only way to flash them both at the same time (along with orgasmic sounds) is to move the mouse cursor over her belly button. Light flash around the side of the screen.</p>
<p>There is now another game that has been censored slightly - Banging Betty. In this game you choose how to have a sexual intercourse with Betty.</p>
