<p>I'll say it again: <b>Name an alternative</b>. The Guardian, for the love of Mike, is a <i>Newspaper</i>. Now, let's name a <i>broadcasting organisation</i>, shall we? If you cannot name even <b>one</b> credible alternative, then you have absolutely no case for reverting. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 14:32, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It isn't the case to propose, yes or no, an alternative. I believe it is more a question of NPOV. So, indeed it would be better to adopt less hyperbolic wording, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tannin.html" title="Tannin">Tannin</a>. I might quit agree with you that BBC is <b>the most respectable</b> but I would prefer a more neutral phrasing.</li>

<p>Thankyou for your comment Vanderesch, but I'd better clear up a small misunderstanding. I do <i>not</i> think the BBC is the most respect-worthy broadcasting organisation in the world. It may well be, but (a) that is not the question, and (b) I have an (understandable) bias towards our own wonderful ABC. Given the choice, I'd take the ABC over the BBC without having to think too hard about it. None of which, of course, is relevant. It doesn't matter what I think, it only matters what people in general think - and it is our job to report that in as NPOV a way as possible.</p>
<p>The situation is quite simple: <b>either</b> the BBC is the most respected broadcasting organisation, <b>or</b> there is some other organisation that has equal or greater respect. There is no third alternative. If the BBC is <i>not</i>, then someone will be able to name the equally or better respected organisation. This silly debate has clogged up recent changes for so long that, if there <i>were</i> another equally or more respected broadcasting organisation, then it would have been mentioned here long since.</p>
<p>So far, the only alternatives proposed are (a) a newspaper (i.e., not even a broadcasting organisation at all), and (b) a press agency (i.e., not even a broadcasting organisation at all). Unless, of course, you believe that there could be a worldwide broadcasting organisation more respected than the BBC and yet so little known that no Wikipedian has ever even heard of it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>NPOV doesn't mean ignoring facts because they sound like opinions. It is not a POV to state that a widely held view is a widely held view if all of the evidence points to the fact that it is a widely held view. It is an opinion to say that "the BBC is the best broadcaster in the world". But this is not what we are having a dispute about. The sentence that is in dispute - is "The BBC is the most widely respected broadcaster in the world". This is not an author's opinion. It is a simple statement much like like "Football is the world's most popular sport". This is the simple question that some people seem to be having trouble understanding. Jiang want's proof. Well there is a simple proof by exhaustian. If the the BBC isn't then what is!? (And answer came there none).</p>
<p>If you equate respect with trust then two items should be drawn to your attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>68% of European viewers trusted BBC World's output during the Gulf War, compared to 66% for CNN and 59% distrusted of Voice of America <a href="http://www.europemedia.net/shownews.asp?ArticleID=16488" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.europemedia.net/shownews.asp?ArticleID=16488" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> in a survey of 10,617 people in Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey and the Ukraine.</li>
<li>Research has ahown that the BBC is the most trusted broadcaster in Arabic<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/26/do2601.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/26/do2601.xml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 16:36, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now we're getting somewhere. Those facts are valid, so put them in the article to illustrate your claim. That definitely makes your claim stronger. See how useful facts and figures are? Now, I would contend that this belongs in another graf, and not sentence #2. But I'd also like to point out that CNN and BBC are very close to each other on "trust" (66% and 68%) it doesn't bode so well for overwhelming proof.</dd>

<p>--- Even though it may currently describe a fact, even after I've read some of your pro- arguments, the phrase "most respected" still strikes me as POV. I wonder why, I can't put my finger on, but I can't dismiss that feeling.</p>
<p>The problem is not probably just a question of factuality, and you obscure the discussion by reducing it to logical arguments.</p>
<p>I feel it dangerous to include such sentences in the encyclopedia because they're tending to imply that BBC is not only respected (a potential fact) but also connotes the BBC as respectable (an opinion; and worse, a pression on the reader's opinion) (That latter effect, is reinforced by the non-appearance of dissenting opinions).</p>
<p>And there's fuzziness about what "respected" means. Respected by whom&#160;? and how&#160;? And what does "most widely respected" mean&#160;? How deep must be someone's respect to be accounted for&#160;? And what does it say about those people who <i>don't</i> "respect" BBC&#160;? Also, this may change with time. Perhaps by 2005 will be that fact(?) no longer a fact. (It's already almost a non-fact, if it's about trust, since BBC's 68% are so close to CNN's 66%. Unless you remove the "most".)</p>
<p>Also, <i>why</i> do you insist on keeping this sentence in the article&#160;? What do you think it brings to it&#160;? <a href="../../../f/v/d/User%7EFvdP_984c.html" title="User:FvdP">--FvdP</a></p>

<dd>It is not a statement of opinion, to state that a widely held view is a widely held view. In comparison with CNN, BBC News is just one of its arms. The BBC has earned respect for its output in Wildlife, Science, Comedy and Drama. The number of awards the BBC receives speaks for itself. Also CNN Broadcast on Televiion in English only (AFAIK), whilst the BBC broadcasts in 43 languages. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 23:27, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the entry: "According to some sources (e.g. <a href="http://www.europemedia.net/shownews.asp?ArticleID=16488" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.europemedia.net/shownews.asp?ArticleID=16488" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/26/do2601.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/26/do2601.xml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)" It's good to have sources, be they in the article itself or on the talk page. However, the weasel words "according to some sources" are highly misleading. When you have a plain and simple fact, state that fact plainly and simply. By all means, it's great to have sources, and I'm certainly not convinced that the current wording is ideal, but perhaps some kind soul will come along and improve it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 23:59, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I stuck the refs back in again, but it still ain't right. The trouble with the current formulation is that it appears to rest on those two sources, but it rests on a very great deal more than that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The real difficulty, I think, is that we should devote a great deal more space to the BBC's unique status on the international stage. Hell, there is room for an entire article on that one topic, and not a short one either. But until someone comes along and writes it (I doubt that I'll have time to research it and do it for many months, given the fact that I'm ridiculously over-commited already), it is imperative that we at least mention it.</dd>

<dd>FvdP writes: <i>the phrase "most respected" still strikes me as POV</i>. Yes, I agree, or almost. I don't like it either. It <i>does</i> "sound like an opinion". It is, however, undeniably true.

<dd>I'm not sure I agree with <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a>. It appears to be the work of one person. I say call a spade a spade. But FWIW, the statement in dispute isn't using peaccock terms anyway! If the statement said <b>the world's best broadcasting organization</b> that would be peracock terms. But it is stating that a widely held view is a widely held view. It is not stating that this view is right or wrong. It is not a point of view. It IS a provable statement, using <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_exhaustion.html" title="Proof by exhaustion">proof by exhaustion</a>. I.e. is there another broadcaster that has more international respect than the BBC? Answer - NO. Ergo QED. If further proof were needed, then on a survey of CEOs asked about the companies they respected most: Out the 100 comapanies listed the BBC came joint 66th, the only other Broadcaster CNN came joint 90th. Ok still not convinced? In a survey during the Iraq war 10,000plus people from 10 countries in Europe were asked which broadcaster they trusted most. The BBC came first. Still not conviced? Ok, in a survey of Arabic listeners to Arab language stations, they were asked which station they most trusted. Guess what?, they put the BBC at the top of the list. I have found many websites (and I am sure there are many more) that say that the BBC is the most respected broadcaster in the world, and not a single website saying any other organization is the most respected broadcaster in the world. On top of this, the BBC has won more awards for it's output, in Drama, Science, Natural History and News than any other broadcaster. (Presumably, awards are a show of respect). The BBC World Service is the most "listened to" radio service in the world (surely a listener is showing his respect, otherwise he's tune into Voice of America, et al).

<p>Most respected newspaper, journalist, lawyer, doctor, scholer, encylopaedia, football team, broadcaster etc.. etc.. these are all possible and debatable. The most respected toilet seat is just plain absurd and deserves no further comment in a sensible discussion.</p>
<p>You STILL for the 1000th time of asking haven't been able to find a credible alternative candidate. You cannot counter the proof by exhaustion, because no other broadcaster is able to make the claim that it is the world's most respected broadcaster.</p>
<p>What do you classify as credible? It seems to me that you disqualify any and all suggestions. The point is all these people whoever they are, are saying that the BBC is the most respected broadcaster in the world, and you can't find anybody who says that some other organization is more respected. Are seriously saying that even if I found a survey that said the BBC was the most respected broadcaster in the world, it wouldn't be valid to this argument, because it wasn't asking every single person in the world? Is that really your argmument? Are you seriously suggesting that all polls are invalid? If I am interpreting you correctly then that is the stupidest suggestion I've heard in a long time. Do you suggest that evolution can only be proven by finding every creature in the tree of life, extinct and extant!? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 23:27, 16 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>You still for the 1000th time insist that just because there is not a more prevalent alternative than BBC that it is therefore "most respected." The alternative does not need to exist. It could very well be that the best alternative is not quite respected as you assume it to be.</p>

<p>Jiang, your current wording in the entry is good.</p>
<p>However, this business of buggerising around with talk pages is utterly ridiculous and unworthy of you (or any other good Wikipedia contributor). Let's follow the sequence, shall we?</p>
<ol>
<li>We have a longish talk page.</li>
<li>Fuzheado did a quasi-archive, which still left the talk page very long, and (Oh! What a surprise!) <i>just happened</i> to remove everything above a long contribution that favoured his POV. It wasn't an archive at all - look how tiny <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Broadcasting_Corporation_Archive1_f3f1.html" title="Talk:British Broadcasting Corporation/Archive1">Talk:British Broadcasting Corporation/Archive1</a> is.</li>
<li>Within a few hours, the talk page was up to 38k! Following standard practice, I archived, but properly this time, taking out about 25 or 30k, and leaving only the most recent part.</li>
<li>Seeing that the archive operation #2 (properly performed this time, not half done as in the first instance) happened to have one of my posts at the top, you then proceeded to fill the talk page up to overflowing again with whichever posts you felt like running a repeat showing of in order to favour your POV! It has not escaped notice that you felt perfectly happy with the 'quasi-archive' operation #1 (which had a Fuzheado post at the top and could thus be left untouched) but immediately jumped in to undo a properly conducted archive operation. If you <i>really</i> felt that "current discussion should not be archived", then where was your revert of the first archive?</li>
</ol>
<p>That sort of behaviour is not in keeping with the ethics of the Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 01:40, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I "unarchived" two times:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first time I tried to restore <b>everything</b> (ie the entire discussion) so each side would be favored as is. (Fuzheado's points were already on this page. I didn't put them here.) I thought it would be more preferable to have a long page rather than an archived page for an ongoing discussion.</li>
<li>The second time, Fuzheado's points had disappeared (neither in archive nor here) so I restored them here since they were written so soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe the common practice is to only archive past discussions, not an ongoing one. At least that's what I see being done so far... --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 03:01, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tomato, tomahto. I didn't characterize your Archiving as sinister, so I'd appreciate the same. The resulting talk page (right after we referred it to Disputed Pages) really only had your and Mintguy's postings, so I tried to keep the whole thread on one page. That's it. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 01:54, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>No problem, Fuzheado. It is often difficult to find a sensible spot to break a talk page at, and in the end it often favours one side or another. I originally looked at your archive, thought <i>hmmm ... a bit short, not very good for "our side", but them's the breaks</i>. Sometimes the cookie crumbles this way, sometimes it crumbles that way. So be it.</p>
<p>Later on, when the talk page hit 38k again, I did an archive. Yup: it favoured "my side", but I didn't worry too much about that because (a) there is often no "right" place to split it, and (b) I figured it was "our turn" anyway.&#160;;)</p>
<p>My beef is with Jiang's silly reverts to the archiving. That <i>is</i> beyond the pale. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>To respond to earlier: My posting of the 21 sources rundown caused the page to exceed the 32k limit, so I took out only what was necessary to let it fit AND make sense of the discussion. The segment was broken at a logical point, which was the horizontal rule starting a new thread. And I did say "for now" meaning I EXPECTED my post to fall off to an archive page very soon. And it did, as it should.</dd>

<p>Regarding earlier post, am I the only one who finds it ironic that <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_by_exhaustion.html" title="Proof by exhaustion">proof by exhaustion</a> is a missing link?&#160;:)</p>
<p>The problem with proof by exhaustion is that it is almost exclusively used in mathematics, not in reasoned logic. A definition: <i>A proof by exhaustion is a proof which is established by working through EVERY possible case and finding no contradictions. Usually such a proof is only possible if the proposition to be proved has some restrictions placed upon it.</i> For example: <a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:XAGTFROmSkcJ:www.csc.tntech.edu/~srini/DM/chapters/examples/ex2.1.3.html+proof+by+exhaustion&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:XAGTFROmSkcJ:www.csc.tntech.edu/~srini/DM/chapters/examples/ex2.1.3.html+proof+by+exhaustion&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>: Suppose a and b are even integers less than 8. Prove that the sum and difference of a and b are divisible by 2.</p>
<p>That's certainly different than trying to prove the assertion -- a fuzzy term "respected" as the parameter and "the world" as the problem set. Proof by exhaustion is usually dismissed <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/6174/proof.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/6174/proof.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> or outright unacceptable <a href="http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~berwin/teach/M101/invalid.proofs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~berwin/teach/M101/invalid.proofs.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I agree a whole graf on the BBC's reputation, fairness, role in the world and wide respect is appropriate and desirable. We agree more than we disagree. The thing in dispute is a) an unqualified claim of "most" (so qualify it with stuff cited above) and b) placement in the lead sentence. Perhaps someone can go ahead and write that graf, put it in, and start the dialogue. Any attempt by folks in the middle of the discussion would be too controversial. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 03:25, 17 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CNN is a component of <b>Time Warner</b>, which is a full service broadcaster. BBC News only does news. It would be misleading to write "BBC News only does news, i.e. they are not a full-service broadcaster at all", yet you did exactly that with respect to <b>Time Warner</b> with your comment.

<dd>To be fair and accurate -- the Gartner survey was specifically "<i>when compared to banks, brokerages, credit card companies, U.S. Postal Service, Amazon.com, large retailers, and Microsoft.</i>" None of that has anything to do with the news or "broadcast organization". I don't consider <strike>AOL</strike> TimeWarner to be the paragon of news virtue, but it certainly isn't the "least trusted."
