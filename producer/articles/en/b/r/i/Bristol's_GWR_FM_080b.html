<p>GWR FM launched on <a href="../../../2/7/t/27th_October_4c06.html" title="27th October">27th October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> under its original name, Radio West, 11 years after <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_Bristol_69e2.html" title="BBC Radio Bristol">BBC Radio Bristol</a>. The station began a full service commercial radio station on 96.3 <a href="../../../m/h/z/MHz_37ee.html" title="MHz">MHz</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_modulation.html" title="Frequency modulation">FM</a> and 1260 <a href="../../../k/h/z/KHz_a999.html" title="KHz">kHz</a> <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amplitude_modulation.html" title="Amplitude modulation">AM</a> (238 metres medium wave) and it was the culmination of a merger between two companies bidding for the Bristol and Bath radio licence (Radio Avonside and Bristol Channel) awarded by the then <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Broadcasting_Authority_eea6.html" title="Independent Broadcasting Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a>. The choice of on-air name proved to be a simple affair as the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> aired a series called <i>Shoestring</i> complete with the fictitious Radio West.</p>
<p>Radio West's cost base was large due to the extravagant studio premises that had been purchased, and the lack of audience made for disastrous advertising revenue and losses of £300,000 by <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. <b>John Bradford</b>, who had helped found the extremely successful <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercia_FM_4c0a.html" title="Mercia FM">Mercia Sound</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, joined the station in 1983. Alongside <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Cash_%28disc_jockey%29_e820.html" title="Dave Cash (disc jockey)">Dave Cash</a> (ex <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Gold_f610.html" title="Capital Gold">Capital Radio</a>), big guns <b><a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnnie_Walker_%28DJ%29_c521.html" title="Johnnie Walker (DJ)">Johnnie Walker</a></b> (ex <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Caroline_56a8.html" title="Radio Caroline">Caroline</a>, <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>) and <b>Roger Day</b> (ex Caroline, <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_103.html" title="Key 103">Piccadilly</a>, and latterly <a href="../../../b/r/m/BRMB_e4b7.html" title="BRMB">BRMB</a>) were wheeled in, but to no avail. The station still slipped and programmes had to be curtailed in October 1983 and the station closed down each day at 7:30 pm, while the remaining resources were concentrated on daytime output. After more fine tuning of the station's output Radio West became more mainstream and by late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> things were looking more promising and programmes were extended to a 1am closedown.</p>
<p>Although the station was broadcasting programmes of a high quality (including award-nominated computer show Datarama), listeners remained loyal to BBC Radio Bristol, already established as the first radio station for the locality.</p>
<p>Financially commercial radio struggled to make any money as the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> economy in Britain was hampered by vast union strikes. Radio West never made a penny since it started and looked set to close when the neighbouring local station Wiltshire Radio, based in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon.html" title="Swindon">Swindon</a> made an official approach to merge the two stations, creating a station covering from <a href="../../../w/e/s/Weston-super-Mare_49d9.html" title="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a> in the west to <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon.html" title="Swindon">Swindon</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungerford.html" title="Hungerford">Hungerford</a> in the east. This merger was approved by the British Government and was completed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>.</p>

<p>Radio West formally closed in September 1985 with a preview of the new radio station to come during test transmissions which followed immediately. In October 1985 GWR Radio was launched as a 24-hour radio station (previously Radio West closed in overnight to re-open in the morning). New disc jockeys were brought in, however the station still sounded like competitor Radio Bristol with its mix of music, news and talk (as per the trend in British commercial radio at the time) and radio listening figures still didn't see an improvement.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol%27s_GWR_FM_080b.html" title="Edit section: Split services">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Split services</span></h2>
<p>GWR Radio began splitting frequencies as required by the British Government - which declared its desire to end <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulcasting.html" title="Simulcasting">simulcasting</a> on both FM and AM. GWR Radio launched <b><a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunel_Classic_Gold_134d.html" title="Brunel Classic Gold">Brunel Radio</a></b> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">15 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, a golden oldies station on 1260 kHz in Bristol, and 936/1161 kHz AM in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiltshire.html" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. In the early 1990s Brunel started networking programming to <a href="../../../2/c/r/2CR_FM_54f3.html" title="2CR FM">2CR Radio</a> in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth.html" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="../../../2/-/t/2-Ten_FM_eac8.html" title="2-Ten FM">Radio 210</a> in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a>. Each station had Classic Gold appended to the end of their names (eg Brunel Classic Gold, 210 Classic Gold). Local news and shows was combined with networked programmes in each of its areas.</p>
<p>After the lifting on sanctions restricting the time spent playing music (so-called 'needle time') in 1988, GWR FM became more and more music-led, playing Top 40 chart music during the daytime, and specialist music (Big Band music, rock, rap etc) was over time eliminated. The local element of the station especially its news coverage had progressively become briefer and reduced in length, then moved onto Brunel Classic Gold, before being dropped altogether. Despite this GWR FM had at last become popular with the rise in listenership figures confirming this.</p>
<p>A Bath ILR licence was awarded by the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Broadcasting_Authority_eea6.html" title="Independent Broadcasting Authority">IBA</a> in 1986. <b>GWR Radio Bath</b> debuted on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">22 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> as a separate station, now know as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%27s_GWR_FM_5f29.html" title="Bath's GWR FM">Bath's GWR FM</a>. Although there was still some programming being shared from GWR Bristol, local programming was installed during peak listening hours. However for official licencing purposes GWR Bath and Bristol are listed as one station and audience figures from <a href="../../../r/a/j/RAJAR_0aae.html" title="RAJAR">RAJAR</a> are combined with GWR Swindon. All programming for GWR Bath comes from studios in Bristol.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol%27s_GWR_FM_080b.html" title="Edit section: The Mix Network">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Mix Network</span></h2>
<p>In 1992 a re-launch of the station saw The New GWR-FM become the hub of what was <b>The Mix Network</b>, a network of radio stations owned by the <a href="../../../g/w/r/GWR_Group_ce75.html" title="GWR Group">GWR Group</a> (now <a href="../../../g/c/a/GCap_Media_9c8b.html" title="GCap Media">GCap Media</a> ) covering southern <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. The radio station's (and the group's) long held philosophy of heavily researching the average person's listening habits and tastes led by Group chairman Ralph Bernard has created a tightly formatted sound where popular Top 40 chart hits ex-Top 40 songs are blended in with older hits. This led to its "Better Music Mix" format which spread to other radio stations within the GWR Group, including <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_FM_b113.html" title="Essex FM">Essex FM</a>, <a href="../../../9/6/_/96_Trent_FM_327b.html" title="96 Trent FM">Trent FM</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beacon_FM_2e3a.html" title="Beacon FM">Beacon Radio</a> creating a mini national network.</p>
<p>The practice for the Mix Network stations were each station played a centrally produced playlist (from GWR FM itself). Songs were broadcast at, or almost at, the same time as neighbouring group stations and each station adopted the "Better Music Mix" tagline, to be said by local disc jockeys in between songs. Fans of the previous guises of some stations bought by the GWR Group, notably <b>Essex FM</b> and <b>Beacon Radio</b> were shocked and unhappy at the sudden re-branding of the stations, accusing the new management of reducing local content such as news reports and cancelling local shows in place of programming from the Mix Network, such as <b>Late Night Love</b> and <b>The Request Fest</b>, which originate from the Bristol studios.</p>
<p>Despite protests from outside Bristol, GWR FM continues to be very popular with current RAJAR listening figures showing an average 18% listening share of all radio broadcast in the area. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Authority_f235.html" title="Radio Authority">Radio Authority</a> renewed GWR FM's licence. It is due to expire in October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2009.html" title="2009">2009</a>, however it is expected to be automatically renewed because it provides a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_audio_broadcasting.html" title="Digital audio broadcasting">DAB</a> simulcast signal. This is the same scenario applies to its sister stations GWR FM Bath and <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunel_Classic_Gold_134d.html" title="Brunel Classic Gold">Classic Gold 1260</a>.</p>

<p>It is well known that the initials GWR has had a long association with the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> especially in the South West of England, and there is a popular misconception with listeners that the station stands for <b>Great Western Radio</b>. Indeed neighbouring GWR Wiltshire was called <b>Wiltshire Radio</b> (WR) before its merger with Radio West. However according to Group management, the letters GWR <b>officially</b> do not stand for anything.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that GWR's oldies service was originally called Brunel Classic Gold, after the GWR's founding father <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel_5402.html" title="Isambard Kingdom Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>.</p>
