<p>The first batch of 33 units were built in 1961, numbered 133-165. This was later changed to <b>Class 308/1</b>, and units were renumbered 308133-165. These units were built to operate commuter services on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Eastern_Main_Line_7079.html" title="Great Eastern Main Line">GEML</a> from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Liverpool_Street_a630.html" title="London Liverpool Street">London Liverpool Street</a> to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shenfield.html" title="Shenfield">Shenfield</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witham.html" title="Witham">Witham</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colchester.html" title="Colchester">Colchester</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walton-on-the-Naze_fe09.html" title="Walton-on-the-Naze">Walton-on-the-Naze</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clacton.html" title="Clacton">Clacton</a>. Each unit was formed of four carriages; two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer, and a motor coach.</p>
<p>From 1981-83, the units were refurbished, which including opening out of compartments, the fitting of gangways between carriages, and moving first class seating from the intermediate trailer to one of the driving trailers. In this modified form, the technical description of the formation was BDTCOL+MBSO+TSOL+DTSO. Individual carriages were numbered as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>75878-75886 and 75896-75919 - BDTCOL</li>
<li>61883-61915 - MBSO</li>

<p>A second batch of nine units, numbered 313-321, were built for boat train services on the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Tilbury_and_Southend_Railway_785d.html" title="London, Tilbury and Southend Railway">London, Tilbury and Southend Line</a> in 1962, from <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilbury.html" title="Tilbury">Tilbury</a> to <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenchurch_Street_station_ef14.html" title="Fenchurch Street station">London Fenchurch Street</a>. These units were later reclassified as <b>Class 308/2</b>. Each unit was formed of four carriages; two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer, and a motor luggage van. The technical description of the formation was BDTS+MLV+TC+DTS. Individual carriages were numbered as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>75920-75928 - BDTS</li>
<li>68011-68019 - MLV</li>

Three units were subsequently rebuilt as <b>Class 308/4</b> parcels units.</p>
<p><a name="Class_308.2F3" id="Class_308.2F3"></a></p>

<p>Finally, a third batch of 3-car unit, were built in 1962 for suburban services from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Liverpool_Street_a630.html" title="London Liverpool Street">London Liverpool Street</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chingford.html" title="Chingford">Chingford</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/f/Enfield.html" title="Enfield">Enfield</a>.

<p>These units were later reclassified as <b>Class 308/3</b>, and renumbered 308453-455. Unlike the first batch, these units contained no first-class seating. Each unit was formed of three carriages; two outer driving trailers, and an intermediate motor coach. The technical description of the unit formation was BDTS+MBS+DTS.

<li>61689-61691 - MBS</li>
<li>75992-75994 - DTS</li>

<p>In 1983, three former Class 308/2 units (nos. 314/319/321) were converted into <b>Class 308/4</b> postal units by the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rail_Express_Systems_e40a.html" title="Rail Express Systems">Parcels sector</a>, with the removal of the intermediate trailer, and renumbered 308991-993. These units were replaced by three converted <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_302_92f9.html" title="British Rail Class 302">Class 302/9</a> parcels units in 1992.</p>

<p>By the early 1990s, only the Class 308/1 units were still in service. These were gradually replaced on GEML services by the new <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_321_a698.html" title="British Rail Class 321">Class 321</a> units. Some of the displaced units were transferred to the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Tilbury_and_Southend_Railway_785d.html" title="London, Tilbury and Southend Railway">LTS Line</a>, whilst others were transferred to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Midlands_%28county%29_3cb5.html" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands</a> to work commuter trains pending the introduction of new <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_323_8635.html" title="British Rail Class 323">Class 323</a> units. The LTS units were later displaced by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_312_67fc.html" title="British Rail Class 312">Class 312</a> units, but two were retained and converted to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_937_cc57.html" title="British Rail Class 937">Class 937</a> sandite units.</p>
<p>In 1994/95, electrification spread North from <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds.html" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradford.html" title="Bradford">Bradford</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skipton.html" title="Skipton">Skipton</a> and <a href="../../../i/l/k/Ilkley.html" title="Ilkley">Ilkley</a>. As no new stock had been ordered, BR decided to overhaul Class 308 units for use on these services. The work was carried out at <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doncaster_railway_works.html" title="Doncaster railway works">Doncaster</a> Works, and involved reducing the unit length to three carriages, with the removal of the intermediate trailers, which were scrapped. The trains were also painted in the attractive <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metro_%28West_Yorkshire%29_7421.html" title="Metro (West Yorkshire)">West Yorkshire Metro</a> maroon and cream livery.</p>
<p>In 1996, with the privatisation of Britain's railway network, the Class 308 fleet passed into the ownership of the Angel Trains and leased to <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_Railways_6ca0.html" title="Regional Railways">Regional Railways North East</a> franchise. This was originally operated as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Spirit_0ceb.html" title="Northern Spirit">Northern Spirit</a>, but the franchise was later taken over by <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arriva.html" title="Arriva">Arriva</a> and operated as <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arriva_Trains_Northern_f978.html" title="Arriva Trains Northern">Arriva Trains Northern</a>.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, it was clear that the elderly Class 308 units needed replacing. Due to their age, they were increasingly unreliable, and expensive to maintain. Replacement came in the form of sixteen new 3-car <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Rail_Class_333_10d9.html" title="British Rail Class 333">Class 333</a> units, which were introduced from 2000. They slowly replaced the Class 308 units, which were withdrawn, and sent for storage at <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig%27s_Bay%2C_Essex_85ef.html" title="Pig's Bay, Essex">Pig's Bay</a> near <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoeburyness.html" title="Shoeburyness">Shoeburyness</a>. The final three units, nos. 308138/157/158, were withdrawn in late 2001, and were sent for scrap at <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immingham.html" title="Immingham">Immingham</a>. Since then, the stored units have slowly been scrapped at various locations, with the final vehicles disposed of in 2004. However, one driving trailer was saved for preservation.</p>

<p>The Carriage has been stripped of asbestos, so will require a full internal rebuild at some point. This work has been on going for 2 years, most of the spares have been obtained, but a compressor, First Class Doors and a Toilet door are still required.</p>
