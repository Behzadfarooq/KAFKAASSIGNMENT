<p>Cost over-runs and differing tastes made Britomart politically controversial, the design often being described as a large hole in the ground, both literally and figuratively. Despite this, it has won numerous design awards and is internationally recognised for its innovative but heritage-sympathetic architecture.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The main source of contention was the relatively great expense of this public transport development in a city that is <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Auckland_445c.html" title="Transport in Auckland">traditionally very focused</a> on the private car.</p>
<p><a name="Earlier_stations" id="Earlier_stations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britomart_Transport_Centre_79cb.html" title="Edit section: Earlier stations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Earlier stations</span></h3>
<p>Britomart is on reclaimed land in the middle of what was once <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commercial_Bay_cf99.html" title="Commercial Bay">Commercial Bay</a>. It is named after Point Britomart, a former headland at Commercial Bay's eastern end. In the 1870s and 1880s the headland was levelled in order to extend the railway line to the bottom of Queen Street, and was used to fill in Commercial Bay.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland_railway_station.html" title="Auckland railway station">Auckland's railway station</a> moved west to the Britomart site in 1885, and remained there after the Post Office was built on the Queen St frontage in 1911. In 1930 it was relocated 1.2 km east to Beach Rd, and for the rest of the 20th century the Britomart site was a bus terminal (from 1937) and carpark (from 1958).</p>
<p>Many proposals have been made to relocate the station back to the CBD, most notably in 1973 and 1987. In 1995, <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auckland_City_Council_6173.html" title="Auckland City Council">Auckland City Council</a> purchased the old Post Office (which had closed in 1988) and proposed to develop the area as a transit centre. Early designs called for both the bus terminal and the railway to be underground, but these plans were scrapped as projected costs soared into the billions.</p>
<p>In 1998 a more cost-effective solution was found that used part of Queen Elizabeth II Square and surrounding streets as a bus terminal, with the existing dilapidated bus terminal redeveloped to incorporate both bus services and a pedestrianised area. When nearby Quay St was realigned in the late 1990s, a tunnel was built (completed in 2000) to provide the underground railway link to Britomart. Bus services using the old bus terminal were diverted to other locations in June 2001.</p>

<p>Construction of Britomart commenced in October 2001. It involved 14 km length of <a href="../../../p/i/l/Piling.html" title="Piling">piling</a>, some of the piles being as long as 40 m and driven as far as 16 m into the underlying bedrock, mainly to provide good earthquake protection, and to futureproof the area for potential later construction of buildings on top of the station. 200,000 cubic metres were excavated for the station, and 40,000 cubic metres of concrete poured.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In its early days Britomart received a lot of criticism due its being built on a scale that was well in excess of the capacity and patronage of the rail network in Auckland at the time. However, in recent years patronage has increased greatly and more frequent services have been introduced to accommodate the increased number of passengers, and this has led to concerns that the station will soon be at maximum capacity. During the peak only 18 suburban trains an hour can enter and exit.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The foresight of council planners in constructing such an iconic investment in Auckland's public transport has already spurred further development. The $600 million Project DART (Developing Auckland's Rail Transport)<sup id="_ref-dart_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dart" title="">[3]</a></sup> is underway, managed by the state-owned enterprise <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Railways_Corporation_058c.html" title="New Zealand Railways Corporation">ONTRACK</a> and funded by <a href="../../../a/r/t/ARTA_2dea.html" title="ARTA">ARTA</a>. This project is concentrated on double-tracking the Western Line and upgrading stations, and will include the construction a new railway line and station to Manukau City from the Southern Line.</p>
<p>There have also been a number of proposals recommending electrification of the Auckland rail network. Most of these coincided with proposals to electrify the whole <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Island_Main_Trunk_5071.html" title="North Island Main Trunk">North Island Main Trunk</a> between Auckland and Wellington during the 1960s.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">12 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> ARTA released a study pointing to a "desperate" need for electric trains to sustain the current boom in rail patronage on Auckland's network, which had reached 566,000 passenger trips per month in August of that year. Government ministers gave qualified support for electrification, estimated to cost $3.6 billion over 25 years, which would increase patronage to 30 million trips per year. The <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_Auckland_1172.html" title="Mayor of Auckland">Mayor of Auckland</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Hubbard_13e8.html" title="Dick Hubbard">Dick Hubbard</a>, also supported the proposals.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> In the interim, ARTA has ordered a batch of diesel-hauled push-pull carriage trains.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britomart_Transport_Centre_79cb.html" title="Edit section: City underground loop">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">City underground loop</span></h3>
<p>Plans exist for an underground loop to be built from Britomart to <a href="../../../m/t/_/Mt_Eden_Train_Station_49cf.html" title="Mt Eden Train Station">Mt Eden</a> via Albert Street, with underground stations at midtown near Wellesley St and uptown servicing the Karangahape Rd area, and a new station at Mt Eden. This loop would allow trains to run through the station, rather than having to reverse, thus increasing capacity. There have been discussions and proposals for such a loop since the 1930s, but Government has been unwilling to provide funding for this project, and it is unlikely to proceed in the near future.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One building on Queen St reportedly features a basement that was designed as the outer shell of a proposed midtown underground station.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> This is no longer possible, since the location of Britomart station makes a Queen St route unfeasible.</p>

<p>Initial plans included an underground pedestrian walkway connecting Britomart to Queen Elizabeth II Square, the nearby downtown ferry terminal and the main shopping street of Queen St. Due to cost over-runs only the short link to the square was built, the remainder replaced with a sizeable but less effective canopy over the footpath outside the station. Given Auckland's variable climate and often torrential rainfall, patrons hope that the remaining links will be built.</p>
