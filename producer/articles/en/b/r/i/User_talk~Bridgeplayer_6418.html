<p>Hi Bridgeplayer!</p>
<p>You have proposed deletion for the bio of photographer Maggie Taylor‎. While I understand that this article may be an imperfect stub, and Maggie Taylor's significance in the photography field may be challenged, I can attest to the fact that this was not a self-promotional entry, and I urge you to reconsider your deletion decision.</p>
<p>In fact, this biographical stub (as well as new stubs on photographers <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katharina_Sieverding_d201.html" title="Katharina Sieverding">Katharina Sieverding‎</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_epstein.html" title="Mitch epstein">Mitch epstein</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Tikhomiroff_8b63.html" title="Nicolas Tikhomiroff">Nicolas Tikhomiroff</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micha_Bar-Am_5b74.html" title="Micha Bar-Am">Micha Bar-Am‎</a>) were written by 16-year-old high school students studying photography, with the hope that their stub may eventually become the germ of a solid biographical article with the help of other Wiki users. (I am their photography teacher, and admittedly a Wikipedia novice myself.) The students were asked to choose a photographer whose career, contributions to the field, and body of work reflect someone worthy of a Wikipedia entry. They did their best; however I am asking them to take your challenge seriously and rewrite the stub to better establish the significance of their subject. I just fear their work will be deleted before they can do so. Thanks for your consideration! Any advice welcome! Cbaer 13:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry for the delay in replying but I have been away for a few days. What is needed in all these case are substantive independent sources attesting to notability. Examples are critical reviews in notable publications, meaningful awards, major exhibitions to which the photographer has been <i>invited</i> to exhibit etc. HTH <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridgeplayer_5ae5.html" title="User:Bridgeplayer">Bridgeplayer</a> 23:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's way out of line for you to be nominating an article for deletion and then deleting references and text based on your subjective interpretations of the WP Guidelines. I have reverted your deletion. You may be right about the quality of the references, but this should be discussed. I'm sure that you are working with the best of intent, but as the nominator I see implied bias toward the article. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 18:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not at all out of line. I cleaned up a terrible article (which you should have done if you want it kept} and deleted trivial references that failed <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridgeplayer_5ae5.html" title="User:Bridgeplayer">Bridgeplayer</a> 22:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It seems that you should withdraw the nomination if you believe that this can become a valid article through your hard efforts. Until then I can't respect your efforts as other than biased in support of your AfD nomination --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:42, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please consider this a warning that removing large blocks of text and references woithout consensus during this AfD will be reported as vandalism. I'm willing to work with you, but unilateral modifications by an AfD nominator are a strange practice, which make me question your intent. Please discuss with me or other interested parties to the discussion. Thanks you. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since we seem to be in very differnt corners of this discussion, I've asked an admin to look at the situation, so that we can avoid any hard feelings. Please accept my appology if I have offended you, and misperceived your motivations.

<p><b>Post AfD editing</b></p>
<p>Re: Your comments at RYC talk and my talk page.</p>
<ul>
<li>A problem with headings is that they can be overly restrictive. For example, you now have information of swimming, berthing etc. under a header sailing. To add another category would make the article choppy.</li>
<li>Chronology is desirable, but in some cases the relationship among the topics might be more important. Some of the history section could be more relevant to the information about the club's sailing program (e.g., national regattas). It's a fine line with no right answer.</li>
<li>To me telling us where the club is located is less important than the reason for notability. So I would prefer reordering the sentences in the introductory paragraph, but this is subjective. Removing the word “notability” is good, but it seems to help during the AfD when editors are doing drive-by voting.</li>
<li>I think that a reader with limited knowledge of sail boats would benefit from a description of why Lasers have dominated. I agree with the prior text as being a bit over the top, but I didn't feel strongly enough to remove another editors contribution. As the Laser is a class in the Olympics, there might be some way to tie that in, but I was reluctant to get too far off point.</li>
<li>You removed the statement about the diverse nature of the past fleets. It's not a huge loss, but it sure wasn't unsupportable. That comment allowed the removal of a large list of craft, without losing the flavor of the diversity.</li>
<li>Knowing of the sensitivity to your past involvement in deleting references and text during an AfD which you proposed, coming here to make large changes without prior discussion seems ill advised. I'll assume good faith that your intentions are for a better WP, but your comments seem to belie a sense of superiority about your POV of how an article should be structured. Guidelines are suggestions; there are many forms of style in use at WP.</li>
<li>If you feel that I have been unfairly harsh in my description of you actions, please feel free to seek the intervention you suggested at my talk page-- perhaps we might both learn something. However, as it stands I perceive your actions throughout this process to be at minimum unconventional. Yes, you can support individual actions out of context with the rest, but taken as a whole there seems to be an agenda here.</li>

I deleted your addition to the 2006 section of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_spread_of_H5N1_9eb7.html" title="Global spread of H5N1">Global spread of H5N1</a> because the event is already in <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_spread_of_H5N1_in_2006_4e7b.html" title="Global spread of H5N1 in 2006">Global spread of H5N1 in 2006</a> which is the main article for that section. If the 2007 section gets too big we'll branch it off also, leaving a summary. Note that the article is about the spread of H5N1. Details not concerned with "spread" or "Asian-lineage HPAI H5N1" don't really go in this article. We have a whole series of articles on H5N1 and more are being created, so any data you see fit to go in Wikipedia will undoubtedly be able to find a home somewhere. Thank you for helping with the H5N1 series of articles. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Heya. Saw your afd nomination for Joe Peacock. I was kinda expecting it, so don't worry, I ain't angry&#160;;-) I think the writer in question is notable, since he is signed a contract with Penguin Books. He is also previously published (albeit with his own publishing company). <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Loafing_6d50.html" title="Creative Loafing">Creative Loafing</a> published an interview with him, which I think really does make him notable. In 2002, when this article was deleted originally, he wasn't quite notable enough for Wikipedia, but since then, his rise in fame definitely warrants a WP article. What dya reckon?

<p>Hi Bridgeplayer. You flagged an article I was starting on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Pastors_Network_2914.html" title="Global Pastors Network">Global Pastors Network</a> for speedy deletion. When you flagged it, it was deletion-worthy, but since then I've improved the article greatly, and while it is not "complete" by any means, I hope you'll be willing to remove your tag or let me know what I should do from here.

<dd>OK, I have shifted the 'speedy' tag. However, if it is to survive an <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> then it needs the addition of reliable, independent sources attesting to the significance of the organisation - see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridgeplayer_5ae5.html" title="User:Bridgeplayer">Bridgeplayer</a> 22:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey, I put in a bit of effort on the article and with your approval it should be stub-worthy. The Time Magazine mention helps support notability and I wikified including an infobox.

<dd>Well done; I agree that it now meets notability criteria. BTW there are some inline references that could do with converting to footer references for consistency. More importantly we need to decide what to do about Notable members and leaders and Notable sponsors. Apart from the CEO the other members are only considered notable in a WP context if they have their own article. On the sponsors, unless there is independent confirmation eg on their website rather than the GPN website, I think that section should come out.

<p>Hi Bridgeplayer,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your constructive criticism on the GPN article. I was wondering if you could help ClaudeReigns and I out on something else if you get the time.

<p>I'm not sure why you nominated this article, the W:PW project has three main things to edit. Wrestler bios, championship pages (the belts and champions) and PPV articles. Any PPV produced by WWF/WWE is notable, I'm not sure how familiar you are with the project but I would suggest looking at the project talk page in future before nominating any more articles.
