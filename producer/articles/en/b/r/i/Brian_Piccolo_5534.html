<p>Piccolo was a star football player in high school, but considered baseball his primary sport. He graduated from the former Central Catholic High School (now <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Thomas_Aquinas_High_School_f863.html" title="Saint Thomas Aquinas High School">Saint Thomas Aquinas High School</a>) in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lauderdale%2C_Florida_a9f5.html" title="Fort Lauderdale, Florida">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. In memory of Piccolo's accomplishments, the school's football stadium is named after him. Also, at the end of every football game, the school's marching band plays <i>The Hands of Time</i>, the theme from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian%27s_Song_53a8.html" title="Brian's Song">Brian's Song</a>.</p>

<p>Piccolo was offered football scholarships from both <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wichita_State_University_0f6b.html" title="Wichita State University">Wichita State</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wake_Forest_University_d590.html" title="Wake Forest University">Wake Forest</a>, but he chose Wake Forest. During his senior season in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_sports.html" title="1964 in sports">1964</a>, Piccolo led the nation in rushing and scoring and was the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_a463.html" title="Atlantic Coast Conference">ACC</a> Player of the Year.

<p>Because he was not selected in the 1965 NFL draft, Piccolo tried out for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> as a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_agent.html" title="Free agent">free agent</a>. He made the team for the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_NFL_season_8c1c.html" title="1965 NFL season">1965</a>, but was a spot on the taxi squad, better known today as the practice squad, meaning he could practice but not suit up for games. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_NFL_season_93ab.html" title="1966 NFL season">1966</a>, Piccolo was on the main roster but played primarily on special teams. By <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, his playing time increased as a back-up to starting tailback <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gale_Sayers_0562.html" title="Gale Sayers">Gale Sayers</a>, and In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_NFL_season_3acc.html" title="1969 NFL season">1969</a>, he was moved up to starting fullback, with Sayers as the tailback. He played in the NFL from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_NFL_season_93ab.html" title="1966 NFL season">1966</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_NFL_season_3acc.html" title="1969 NFL season">1969</a> and scored five touchdowns.</p>

<p>The Bears were in the midst of a 1-13 season in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_NFL_season_3acc.html" title="1969 NFL season">1969</a>, the worst record in the 85-year history of the franchise, when Piccolo was sent for a medical examination and was diagnosed with cancer. In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> of that year, Piccolo had surgery in New York to remove the tumor. He had another surgery in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> to remove his left lung and pectoral muscle. After being bothered by chest pain, Piccolo was re-admitted to the hospital in early <a href="../../../j/u/n/June.html" title="June">June</a>, and doctors determined the cancer had spread to other organs.

<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian%27s_Song_53a8.html" title="Brian's Song">Brian's Song</a> first aired on ABC in 1971 staring <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Caan_b6ca.html" title="James Caan">James Caan</a> as Piccolo and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Dee_Williams_4e99.html" title="Billy Dee Williams">Billy Dee Williams</a> as Gale Sayers. The film tells the story of Piccolo's friendship with Gale Sayers. The made-for-TV movie is loosely based on Sayers' autobiography, and the screenplay was written by veteran screenwriter William Blinn. The true story was such a success on television that it was later shown in theaters. Though an inspirational movie, several scenes never happened, including the final scene, where Sayers comes to the hospital as Piccolo is taking his last breath. According to Sayers' book, he was not even in the same state when Piccolo died. A remake was filmed in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_film.html" title="2001 in film">2001</a> for <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wonderful_World_of_Disney_440b.html" title="The Wonderful World of Disney">The Wonderful World of Disney</a></i> starring <a href="../../../m/e/k/Mekhi_Phifer_4eb1.html" title="Mekhi Phifer">Mekhi Phifer</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Maher_f500.html" title="Sean Maher">Sean Maher</a>.</p>
<p>The musical theme to <i>Brian's Song</i>, "The Hands of Time," was a popular tune during the early 1970s. The music for the film was by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Legrand_e4b1.html" title="Michel Legrand">Michel Legrand</a>, with lyrics to the song by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Bergman_80e8.html" title="Marilyn Bergman">Marilyn</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Bergman_a5da.html" title="Alan Bergman">Alan Bergman</a>.
