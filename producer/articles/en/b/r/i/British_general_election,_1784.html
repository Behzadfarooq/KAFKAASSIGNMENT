<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_general_election%2C_1784.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>In December 1783, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a> engineered the dismissal of the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox-North_Coalition_85eb.html" title="Fox-North Coalition">Fox-North Coalition</a>, which he hated, and appointed <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Pitt_the_Younger_25e2.html" title="William Pitt the Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a> as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>. Pitt had very little personal support in the House of Commons and the supporters of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_James_Fox_c5a4.html" title="Charles James Fox">Charles James Fox</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_North%2C_Lord_North_0c2d.html" title="Frederick North, Lord North">Lord North</a> felt that the constitution of the country had been violated. The doctrine that the government must always have a majority in Parliament was not yet fully established and Fox knew he had to be careful.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1784.html" title="1784">1784</a> Fox carried a motion declaring "That it is the Opinion of this House, That the Continuance of the present Ministers in their Offices is an Obstacle to the Formation of such an Administration as may enjoy the Confidence of this House, and tend to put an End to the unfortunate Divisions and Distractions of the Country" by 223 to 204. Pitt remained in office, and government supporters ensured petitions and resolutions of borough corporations were presented to Parliament to encourage members to back Pitt, and slowly MPs converted.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, Fox's motion which concluded by "beseech[ing] His Majesty, that He would be graciously pleased to lay the Foundation of a strong and stable Government, by the previous Removal of His present Ministers" was carried but only by 201 to 189. A week later, a more strongly worded motion threatening the withholding of supply was also passed â€“ but only by 191 to 190. Fox thereafter declined to push motions, as his base continued to crumble. Pitt meanwhile decided to go to the country and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, Parliament was prorogued and on the following day the Parliament first elected in 1780 was dissolved.</p>
<p><a name="Course_of_the_election" id="Course_of_the_election"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_general_election%2C_1784.html" title="Edit section: Course of the election">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Course of the election</span></h2>
<p>The election was fought very much as a national campaign around the questions of the fall of the Fox-North government and whether or not Pitt should continue in office, rather than a series of local campaigns, which was more common for <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> British elections.</p>
<p>Thanks to a combination of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patronage.html" title="Patronage">patronage</a> and bribes paid by the <a href="../../../h/m/_/HM_Treasury_81f1.html" title="HM Treasury">HM Treasury</a>, many small <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten_borough.html" title="Rotten borough">pocket boroughs</a> returned Pitt-supporting MPs as widely expected. Additionally, in the constituencies decided by large electorates there was massive support for Pitt-supporters. Many of Fox's supporters were forced to either withdraw or make deals with their opponents to avoid election defeat. In the county constituencies only one Fox supporter was elected in a contest, though others returned due to local electoral pacts. Those MPs who had remained in opposition, refusing to go over to support Pitt, and who failed to return to the House of Commons as a consequence became known as "Fox's Martyrs" in reference to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Foxe_34bc.html" title="John Foxe">John Foxe</a>'s <a href="../../../f/o/x/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs_5a46.html" title="Foxe's Book of Martyrs">Book of Martyrs</a> (although the majority were supporters of North).</p>
<p>The first day's polling, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, saw 13 government supporters and four opponents returned. By the conclusion of the fifth day (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">April 3</a>), there were already more than 150 government MPs and a lead of 50 over supporters of the coalition. The government achieved an overall majority on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_general_election%2C_1784.html" title="Edit section: Notable contests">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Notable contests</span></h2>
<p>The contests involving both Pitt and Fox attracted particular attention. Pitt had long wished to be a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_University_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_9540.html" title="Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)">Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge</a> and had failed to be elected when he stood for the seat in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_election%2C_1780.html" title="British election, 1780">1780 general election</a>. Now he was returned at the top of the poll and would hold the seat for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Fox was one of the two sitting members for the constituency of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_3ec3.html" title="Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)">Westminster</a>, which had the largest electorate of any in the country and a great deal of prestige. His position there was central to his claim to be representing the people. He stood against two Pitt supporters for the constituency's two seats; both sides spent heavily, campaigned bitterly, allegedly libelled and slandered their opponents relentlessly and resorted to all kinds of tactics, including <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgiana%2C_Duchess_of_Devonshire_7fd3.html" title="Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire">Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire</a> touring the streets and kissing many voters to induce them to vote for Fox. Even <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_62b2.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George, Prince of Wales</a> campaigned for Fox.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of polling on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, Fox had narrowly succeeded with 6,233 votes to Sir Cecil Wray's 5,998. However Pitt's supporters then demanded a scrutiny of the votes and the Returning Officer therefore did not make the return. A scrutiny in a constituency as large as Westminster was an enormously time-consuming process; Fox, suspecting this may happen, had already arranged for his return for the Northern District of Burghs (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">April 26</a>) so that he would not be out of the House during it. The scrutiny did not show specially large numbers of illegal voters and eventually began to look like a political tactic; on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1785.html" title="1785">1785</a> the House of Commons finally put an end to it by ordering the Returning Officer to declare the result.</p>
