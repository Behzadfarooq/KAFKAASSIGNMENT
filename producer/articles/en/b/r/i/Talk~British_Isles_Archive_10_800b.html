<p>This, is, generally fine after Hugh's latest edit. However, I would suggest that we include a sentence or two to explain <i>why</i> it is considered offensive. As far as I know, no-one has ever suggested that it is considered offensive for any reason other than the insinuation of British control over Ireland. This is a sourceable point and one that is key to understanding why there is a problem with the term. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 10:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've put back a section in the terminology article regarding anecdotes of international dignitaries confusion regarding Ireland and Britain. Maybe its of use here also:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term British Isles has led to several high-profile and embarrassing faux pas. The then United States First Lady Nancy Reagan, on a state visit to Ireland with her husband, the US President Ronald Reagan, inquired of Irish officials how often members of the British Royal Family visited. When told that they didn't, Mrs Reagan expressed surprise, given the fact that Ireland was "in the British Isles". Irish officials informed her that Ireland is not part of the British Isles and had not been since Irish independence in December 1922. During a stop-over visit to the Republic of Ireland in 1989 by the then leader of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev, indicated that he assumed Ireland's head of state was Queen Elizabeth II, given that she was the British Queen and his officials said that Ireland was a part of the British Isles.[10]. Even those who should be familiar with its use are prone to mistakes — such as the BBC in an article on the British weather, which refers to the "country" of the British Isles.[11]</i></dd>

<dd>My own opinion is that the main article should be about the geography, history and so on. There should definitely be reference to the confusion over the term, but the proper place for expanding on it is, as you've done, over on the terminology article itself. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 11:01, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, now that its there, and I can understand a worry about 'creep' of more and more detail in the terminology summary, until it fills the page; but I would argue that the casual reader would look at what we have now and see no explanation for <i>why</i> it could be objectional. There was a couple of sentences in the article which Hugh removed under the basis of there being objections to the term for other reasons; I wasn't aware of any and, my point was, that as long as there aren't - and so we're not opening oureslves up to thousands of explanations being put on this page - then I think they're a valuable two sentences which, for me, would see the coverage of the terminology on this article complete. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:13, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the reason for being annoyed by the term, while I don´t have sourceable material (at least for the moment) another common reason for annoyance I know of from friends is something more akin to what the documents from NI might call "parity of respect" - or something like that. The impression I have is that the issue is often just that they feel Ireland is not a British Island (or Isle) and any collective term for the islands should include mention of Ireland. It´s not necessarily a political point at all. They see calling Ireland a British Isle as disrespectful...not necessarily insulting or anything, primarily disrespectful. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 08:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, parity of esteem sounds right. Horrid term, but as close as I can get.. In any case, because there might be lots of reasons, I would support not getting into why it´s seen as annoying, just that it is. That it is annoying is fact...I´m afraid that a list of the reasons would unavoidably get into speculative territory and become another edit war (probably with some justice). <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 11:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I think that the REASON for objection should definitely be stated, in addition to the simple recognition of its existance, though concisely. As Robdurbar so succintly put it, ‘the insinuation of British control over Ireland’ covers the crux of it well. I also like Hughsheehy’s ‘parity of esteem’ wording; that should be crafted in, with perhaps the example of the ‘British Lions’ to ‘British &amp; Irish Lions’ namechange as illustration of the feelings held. An encyclopedic entry titled ‘British Isles’ must have ALL aspects of the term covered – respectfully and with appropriate weighting in both article introduction and main body. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 19:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>OK, but the parity of esteem argument really isn't a million miles from the 'it might make people think we're british argument'. Given the comments above, I think we should have something, but leave it rather general. How about:
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, some of the terminology may be controversial. <i>Those who object to the term do so because the adjective "British" is most commonly understood as 'of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>' or 'of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. They argue that the term therefore suggests that the UK somehow domiantes Ireland, when the two are in fact <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovereign.html" title="Sovereign">sovereign</a> equals</i>. (with relevant sources inserted, bien sûr)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think this covers both the objections we've had raised - and, more importantly, all those that we've had sourced. Again, if something like that were included, I would see the terminology section as 'complete'. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 08:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are fairly intangiable objections, if you don't mind me saying. Surely the objection is a (geo)political one; indeed the point is, really, that those who obejct see it as a political term (or one that could be understood as such), even if most do not use it politically? To me it just explains the situation in as simple english as is possible. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:44, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know, it's terribly intangible and I don't mind you saying it. I just can't figure anything better at the moment. Again, I can express part of it in non WP terms as something like "irish isn't a subset of british. ireland isn't a subset of britain. they're culturally, historically, etc., different...and that doesn't have to be a political statement, but the term 'the british isles' entirely ignores ireland - which is the second biggest chunk of land". Even if the UK still included the whole of ireland, the objection to the term "the british isles" could still be made on those grounds, even by people perfectly happy to be within a UK like that. that is a key understanding it took me a while to reach, even if i'm not expressing it well. The objection is NOT necessarily (or even predominantly) political. Now, for sure, the history of the two islands makes the issue more edgy, but isn't necessarily the whole issue. Boy, i hope people can understand any of this.. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 16:36, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, let's keep it easy people! While 'British Lions' may not have been an official title (I honestly don't know myself), I remember it commonly being referred to as such in Britain. The change of title was no doubt prompted by this parity of esteem thing. I do understand what you're saying user Hughsheehy! Suitable wording covering your excellent point should be included, but the political aspect can't be overlooked. Perhaps a good tweak to user Robdurbar's wording would replace 'dominates' with 'has a controlling influence over' - this sounds a little less sensational. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 10:38, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the team was officially called, ironically, the 'British Isles'. The Lions name was attached, and in saying British Lions the British changes its meaning from something geographical to something political. I see the word British as having variable meanings, and its the attachment of British to the United Kingdom that was always dodgy. What we really need is new terminology, officially recognised. The Council of the Isles ought to sort that - although it is officially called the British-Irish Council, even though it includes Man and the Channel Islands. Then there's the conflation of 'British Islands' with 'British Isles' - quite correctly Ireland is not a British Island. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevebritgimp_6161.html" title="User:Stevebritgimp">Stevebritgimp</a> 08:36, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bastun, I’m glad that you recognise the significant level of objection – beyond ‘a radical minority’ that some remarkably contend. Given the general avoidance of the term that exists in the Republic of Ireland, it can be fairly said that majority opinion is beyond ‘widespread indifference’. For the sake of accuracy, I am changing ‘The term is used less frequently in the Republic of Ireland than within the United Kingdom’ to ‘The term is not generally used in the Republic of Ireland.’ This is better wording, and more concise than the ‘…not used to any great extent in…’ wording. Incidentally, if any contributor here hasn’t seen the Cannes Film Festival-winning ‘The Wind that Shakes the Barley’, I’d highly recommend it. It presents very well the majority Irish view (still strong today!) of our identity and place in these islands and Europe as a whole. <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 19:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>it can be fairly said that majority opinion is beyond ‘widespread indifference’</i> is a matter of opinion, I think - but one we won't be able to resolve without someone like IMRB poll. In any case, I do think your edit is relatively accurate (we could argue semantics about 'generally', 'widely', etc.) and certainly more succinct - 'tis fine by me. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 01:37, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, a poll (or even a referendum) would be good! I'm glad you agree that the wording is relatively accurate at least - its converse certainly isn't true anyway. As it is, any nationalist venom - from either direction - is happily kept out of it. I really like to keep things as concise as possible, especially in the intro; long-winded and vague wording only invites endless re-editing!!

<p>but was reverted. Any other opinions? I think it is accurate, far easier to understand and gets to the heart of the matter.<a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 10:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that purely geographic is a vast oversimplification. As I noted in my edit summary, menaing is created as much in the understanding of the term as in the use of it. If people understand the term policially - and I think its unquestionable that they do - then it becomes political. In <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, its very arguable that its use (or absence) would be a political discions. And its certainly mis-used politically - there's the good old quote from a BBC online weather article "in a small country like the British Isles". Furthermore, you'll have some people tell you that British means 'of Great Britian' - given that Great Britian refers to an island, that would make 'British' a more geographical term. To summarise: I wish it were that simple.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 10:43, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with Rob: the misunderstandings are often due to vagueness as to what's included rather than political intent, and <i>British</i> is rather ambiguous in political terms, as well as having other connotations. Somewhat to my surprise, the present wording of the opening paragraph seems to cover the complexities very well. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 11:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And again, the <b>physical area</b> and the <b>island group</b> is perhaps a geographical reality, but that does not mean that the term itself is necessarily a non-political term. I come back to my example from long ago...if these were "the rainy isles" or "the green isles", or "the atlantic isles" it might be a purely geographical term, but "British" always had at least an ethnic meaning. It's a tricky subject where clarity is key, and keeping within the limits of what can be said is vital to avoid more edit wars. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 16:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the suggestion user Abtract, but we've raked over this ground before and it really isn't possible to fairly argue the 'purely geographical' position. Users Robdurbar, Dave Souza and Hughsheehy have all made their points well. To contribute a personal anecdote, I travel abroad quite frequently and am sometimes asked if I'm British - as I come from an area often described as the 'British Isles' - a simple, honest mistake, but frustrating nonetheless! <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 10:24, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article implies that those who do not see the term"British Isles" as purely geographical (and the inclusion of Channel Islands and exclusion of Faroe Islands suggests that it is not a purely geographical term) misunderstand the term ("the subject of misunderstanding"). I suggest that such people have a perfectly valid understanding of the expression that differs from that of the author. Perhaps this may be reflected in a less condescending way?</p>

<p>This section only seems to describe problems with the term, or at the very least alternative terms. This makes it seem as if the term is universally recognised as problematic, which it isn't.

<dd>Again I'll point out that the assertion that the vast majority of the people who live in the British Isles use the term is (a) unsupported and (b) potentially irrelevant. As per the example of nigger from the USA - at any time between 1800 and 1960 there was probably a vast majority of the population that used the term and saw no problem with it. By itself, that is not a good criterion to assert that the term is not problematic. Apart from that, I would prefer if that section would focus more on the inconsistency of use and have inserted text to reflect that. I hope it suffices. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 15:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article does not have to be based on my personal preferences. However, my personal preferences are still my personal preferences. I agree with you that the section doesn't have to - and probably shouldn't - focus on the naming dispute aspect, since that is covered in many places. However, if talking about modern usage of the term, then the fact that it is often used in widely varying ways is a highly relevant <b>fact</b>. My preference is that the section should reflect that.

<dd>We can't pretend that present day usage of the term is not controversial to at least some degree (and certainly in Ireland), and the article has to say that. Conversely, TharkunColl is certainly correct to imply that the usage is uncontroversial in Britain (but then so is "Southern Ireland" <i>(sic)</i> ). The section must do no more than summarise the main articles listed at the head of the section: there is a danger of slipping into reproducing them. It seems to me that the section is no bigger or smaller than it ought to be. If we begin to add material like "controversial in Ireland but not in Britain", we run that risk. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 20:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Sources were given here which showed that the term is uncontroversial in Britain: <i>The Guardian</i> article by Ian Mayes cited as proof that there was a controversy made it clear that this was only known of by people with Irish acquaintances, and both the Guardian and BBC style guides require that it should not be used as a political description, but have no difficulty with it as a geographical description. There were also US dictionary definitions from the internet which defined the term as including Ireland without qualification. I'd suggest that TharkunColl puts in a brief statement of its geographical usage in Britain and apparently the US without awareness of there being a problem, with these references. If you can't find them and need help, let me know. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 21:11, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, from my own POV, this section should talk about modern usage....where the fact that it's used in varying ways is the main issue. The naming dispute may need to be mentioned, but the point is the variation in use - not the dispute, which is widely covered elsewhere. Since the term is most used in Britain it is also most varying used in Britain, whether uncontroversially or not. That isn't the main point, from my POV. Again, the point is that the way the BBC and other media use the term is not consistent. British Isles is used to mean the UK, just Britain and Britain's small islands, the whole British Isles, etc.,etc.,etc. I put the section in and I was just trying to keep it brief, so mea culpa if it's going to become focus of an argument. The Guardian article mentioned above is (I believe, but without looking) the one that's now on the naming dispute page under the Perspectives in Britain section...so part of the problem may be (again) the scattering of relevant info across several pages. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 09:31, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made a list of lots of places that the BBC used the term in various different ways and posted it on the discussion page a couple of months ago, either here or on the terminology page. The BBC (and other UK media) use the term to mean all sorts of things, including the definition that this page uses. I have no doubt that the weather forecast often uses the term in that way, but Philip Avery on the weather forecast is just one sample. It´s a fact that the term gets used in a bunch of other ways - including as in "The British Isles and Ireland". (the specific question of whether that then includes NI or not, and thus whether the implied definition of "Isles" is the same as "Islands" is far too scary to get into).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said then, I hesitate to put in an edit any view that says to the BBC or other major media that their usage of a term (in an obviously professionally edited context and not just in quotation) is not "correct". I can say that it is inconsistent and confusing...although I got accused of pushing an "Irish Republican agenda" by saying that. I think that - if you look - you´ll see that use of the term in ways that imply clearly different definitions is not at all uncommon. I hesitate to say that it´s the majority use or even close, but it´s certainly not uncommon. Hughsheehy 22:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Political reasons</span></h2>
<p>I've tidied up the sentences a bit, and added the term "political reasons" for the various objections. Are they otherwise? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 00:08, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As per discussion above, the reasons are many, not just - or even primarily - political. Also, I believe that you (or maybe Arcturus or Mucky) have previously said that there is no such thing as a "British Isle". If that is true then the "British Isles" is a singular noun. It <i>is</i> a group, not they <i>are</i> a group. If they are a group then it would be correct to say that Ireland is a "British Isle", which I believe has been described on the discussion pages as something like "a ridiculous thing to say" (note, not verbatim, but gist). <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 00:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not that there's no such thing as a "British isle", it's just that there's no such standard phrase with a specific meaning. If you say "British isle" you could easily be talking about Bermuda or Pitcairn or loads of other places (though not Ireland, and arguably not Great Britain either since in modern usage, on its own, the term "isle" implies a <i>small</i> island). The term British Isles, on the other hand, has a long-eastablished and specific meaning, which is why the govt. had to invent the term "British Islands" when they wanted to say something else. To say that British Isles, as a phrase, is not in plural form is utterly preposterous. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 09:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I think it was me that originally put "is a group" into the intro, I have checked with my dictionary (Collins) and, much to my surprise, it says it is a plural noun. So I have learned something new today, thank for that TharkunColl ... but you might consider not using words like preposterous&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 09:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Style guides do seem to vary on this. The Economist style guide (online) suggests that the primary thing is to look and see whether the collective noun stands for a single entity. In this case I believe it does, which would mean it is a singular noun, like "The United States". The United States <i>is</i> very rich. Some of the states <i>are</i> poor. Similarly you would say "The British Isles has an area of xx sq.km"</dd>
<dd>Interestingly, the Blackwell Publishing sytle guide mentions the British isles and says "Avoid using the British Isles.", which is interesting.</dd>
<dd>Do we have a grammarian here to help with this, or would further discussion be "utterly preposterous"? There are two different views, both with some validity. A discussion I can immediately find is at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_differences#Singular_and_plural_for_nouns" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_differences#Singular_and_plural_for_nouns" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_differences#Singular_and_plural_for_nouns</a> and suggests that there is no 100% correct answer, but that a document ought to try to be consistent Since this page is absolutely not consistent, let´s find a consensus before starting an edit war and saying that half the contributors to this page have been "utterly preposterous". At least they haven´t necessarily been so sure of themselves, even if they can spell political. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 09:55, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"... for political reasons ..." is also a loaded phrase - it could be used to suggest that the term was being objected to as part of some strategy, or in order to achieve certain goals. It's just lacking clarity. "In a political context" is better, but would suggest that the term itself is politicaly neutral and that objections to it were transitory. I don't think its possible (is it necessary?) to summarise objections to the term in one or two words. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 08:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I have been consistently opposed to getting into the reasons in the introduction. However, if we do, we must cover a reasonable presentation of the reasons and that will make the intro too long and is likely to move the whole dispute back into the first paragraph. This time, instead of disputing the existence/validity of the objection, we'll be disputing the reasons. God help us. However, I'll have a go too, with an alternative presentation of the reasons that I believe is valid.

<dd>Meantime, this was my go at an intro with reasons. Abtract felt it was too much and I can't really disagree with him. "The British Isles are a group of islands off the north west coast of continental Europe comprising Great Britain, Ireland and a number of smaller islands[1]. The term British Isles can be misunderstood and is sometimes considered objectionable, mainly in Ireland, where the term has been viewed not only as an anachronistic geopolitical term rather than a neutral geographical designation but also as a term that does not give appropriate recognition to the second largest island or to the second largest sovereign state in the islands.[2][3][4][5]".

Some younger readers, or those whose first language is not English, may well throw their hand up in horror at "anachronistic geopolitical term rather than a neutral geographical designation".

<dd>It would certainly make a good point to demonstrate that <i>British Isles</i> is redundant as a purely geographical term. I see both the Governments of Jersey<a href="http://www.gov.je/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gov.je/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and Guernsey<a href="http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/public-services/guernsey-water/history/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/public-services/guernsey-water/history/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> describe their respective islands as belonging to the British Isles. Given the multiplicity of definitions, should this not be noted in the introduction to the article? For example, "The term British Isles can be misunderstood ..." should be changed to "No definitive understanding of the term exists ..." It should also be noted that the only common themes between definitions are:
<ol>
<li>their proximate location off the north-western coast of Europe</li>
<li>current and historic political links between islands often included and the British (English?) monarchy</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It should also be noted that since the Channel Islands are often included - as well as (though this is no great justification) the governments of the Channel Islands claiming to be a part of the British Isles and the Irish government claiming not to be - that the term cannot be used seriously in a strictly geographical sense as it always implies some measure of politics in order to define it, not just rocks and seas. This would also make it easier to understand why so many people in Ireland reject the term.

<dd>The term had no connection with the English monarchy, historical or otherwise, when the Greeks and Romans invented it. As for which islands are included, small islands such as the Channel Islands or the Faroes do not affect the definition - Great Britain and Ireland, and surrounding smaller islands. If Ireland is not included, then the term becomes pointless anyway. The only people who interpret the phrase politically are those who don't like it. That's rather like saying that I don't like the name "Europe" because it implies that my country is part of the EU. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:45, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi TharkunColl. I'm not arguing for or against one interpretation or another, just trying to get to the root of this term as it is used today without original research or POVing. On your post above, I have two points:</dd>
<dd>1) On geographic or geopolitical: So are the Channel Islands included or not? If they are then the term makes no sense as a <i>strictly</i> geographical term (though the section in the article as to why it was adapted by map-makers is informative). The governments of the Channel Islands attest that they are. Many dictionary definitions include them also.</dd>
<dd>2) On etymology: Did the Romans and Greeks included the Channel Islands? Does it matter if they did or not? Is not the current, English-language term unrelated to the Latin and Greek terms (except, possibly, through 16th century myth building)? Can an etymology be drawn from the Greek and Latin term to the English-language term? (I think not, though suspect that their similarity is not purely coincidental i.e. that the 16th century coinage of the term in English would have been based on it). The article says the term was generally unused by the middle ages - only once being asserted, in Latin, by Athelstan seeking to politically unite the Great Britian and Viking Dublin (again, geopolitical, but not equivalent to the British Isles of the Romans and Greeks or the one of today since it does not include Ireland, only a small Viking foothold) - and that even writers in Latin used a different term (<i>insularum</i> according to the article). The article also states that the term was never used in any indigenous language of the area and that the English-language term was was coined in the 16th century (by the same person who coined the term <i>British Empire</i> and sought the rename the North Atlantic <i>the British Ocean</i> - hinting again at reasons for it being understood as geopolitical).</dd>
<dd>To restate my post above: no definitive understanding of the term exists, but two themes are present in what islands are often included:
<ol>
<li>their proximate location off the north-western coast of Europe</li>
<li>current and historic political links between islands often included and the British (English?) monarchy</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Finally: "The only people who interpret the phrase politically are those who don't like it." Could this not be turned on its head? What are the motivations for those who don't want interpret the phrase as a geopolitical one? (Incidentally, doing so does not imply imperialism or any other such nature for the term.)</dd>
<dd>Have I made a mistake? --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 18:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know if the Channel Islands should be included or not, and I don't really care. The main substance of the definition includes the two major islands of Ireland and Britain, plus surrounding islands. And are you trying to say that even though the phrase was adopted from a Latin one, it should <i>still</i> be regarded as having nothing to do with it? And as for the Athelstan quote, there may well be others from the middle ages - but what we can't say is that that is the only one. Athelstan received fealty from rulers in both Britain and Ireland, so his use of the phrase is very illuminating. And a final word about John Dee - he was also heavily into the occult, so perhaps next people will be saying that the phrase British Isles should be rejected as part of a Satanic conspiracy! The truth of the matter is that he was a scholar, and interested in geography. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 22:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Channel Islands and Etymology: Geographic or Geopolitical?</span></h2>
<p><i>(Started new header from discussion above.)</i> Whether caring or not, we are editing an encyclopedia - facts are facts, we must accept them without bias. My concern with the etymology is that there is a 1,500 year gap and a jump in languages. From <i>How British is British</i> by Richard Todd on being made dean of British Literature since 1500 at Leiden University (the Netherlands)<a href="https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/3743" class="external autonumber" title="https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/3743" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>When I use “Britannia” shall mean whatever Britain was at a given historical moment. From a purist point of view this means that I can scarcely in practice use the term at all of any period before 1603, when the English and Scottish thrones (but not their legislatures) were joined, and James VI &amp; I introduced the term “Great Britain” in 1604 to describe his new kingdom. Indeed, the word “Britain”, as the online Oxford English Dictionary assures us, was only used historically (and very rarely) before the Reformation.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In essence, in the English language, "British XXX" terms appear suddenly at the close of the 16th century and start of the 17th, at the same time that the modern identity of <i>British</i> was being coined. Thus, the English-language etymology cannot be seperated from politics. With regards to the Channel Islands, their inclusion (or not) is important because it clears whether the term can be understood as solely geographic, or whether it should be understood geopolitically, today. Please reply remembering that we are writing an encyclopedia. Our passions are incidental. If you have evidence to the contrary of what I have written, I would sincerely welcome it. (By the way, Athelstan did not rule Ireland (or the Isle of Man) - as I noted in my previous post - only received fealty from the Viking king of Dublin. His main adversaries in England were Vikings, and this king supported them and lost. The terms are not equivalent.) --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 00:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no satisfactory answer with regards to the Channel Islands - some people include them, and some don't. As for Athelstan, there are also many places in Britain that he didn't rule, and just because his authority did not stretch to all of Ireland does not mean that his use of the term was any more invalid than any king who claimed a wider jurisdiction than he actually had. And his adversaries included not only Vikings, but also the British of Strathclyde and the Scots. The gap between Athelstan and Elizabeth is much less than 1500 years. And if you want examples of the use of the term Britain in the middle ages, then a good example is Geoffrey of Monmouth. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 00:21, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is now in the archive page, but there is a long standing request to provide citation that Athelstan received fealty from any Irish based King or - by implication - that his writ extended to any part of Ireland. Olaf (I think that was the name of the Irish Norse King mentioned) attacked and re-took the territory in the North of England that had been lost to Athelstan in 937 and Athelstan's heirs had to fight to take it again. Meantime, the reference currently in the edit is - as far as I can see - incorrect in date and unsupported in that the list of kings is too long. Similarly, if the Channel Isles is included in the British Isles, then it is NOT a neutral geographical term, and the objecting views in Ireland would thus be validated. Also, it'd be great to see a specific citation from Geoffrey that used the collective term "islands" (with the word British or not) as a way of describing all the British Isles. I looked - albeit not too extensively - and didn't manage to find one, but I was looking in reasonably modern translations. There are lots of references to "islands" which don't refer to the whole British Isles, and even once to Claudius leaving the government of the "British Islands" in the hands of Arviragus (1st century AD, possibly mythical figure), but it is not clear that this included Ireland. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 08:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow. The Mammoth Book is searchable online on Amazon. Great text - but I gotta get to work today! However, it aligns with the original Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that was the source of my original question re Athelstan, i.e. it shows that 927 was the date that Athelstan got fealty from the other British Kings and makes no mention of fealty from Olaf, instead noting that Olaf reinvaded the North of England after the 937 battle. Again, I stand to be corrected, but it looks as if the current edit is not correct in that regard and that Athelstan's use of the term British Isles (or the Britannic Islands, which is another - possibly better - way of translating the Latin) effectively referred to Britain and its surrounding islands (Orkney, Hebrides, etc., ) and <i>not</i> to the whole modern British Isles. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 09:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hughsheehy as adequately summarised what responce I would have made. However, the 1,500 year that I refered to are in regard the time and language differences between Greek/Roman cognate and modern term. How did I mislead you in this matter?</dd>
<dd>With regard to Geoffrey of Monmouth, I share Hughsheehy's concerns. Could you provide a quote and reference? Even if you can, then would this not be, as the OED describes, one of the historical and rare usage of the term during the Middle Ages? --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 09:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Athelstan lived in the 10th century, and Elizabeth in the 16th. This is 600 years, not 1500. The reference in Geoffrey is to the terms British and Britain, which you seemed to imply in your previous post was not invented and/or used until the time of Elizabeth. If you still want a reference, then the title of Geoffrey's work itself should suffice. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 09:10, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see. Appologies. When I said "Greek and Roman", I meant "Greek and Roman" (Strabo, Ptolemy, etc.), not "Greek-language and Latin". The "Britanniae insulae" of Athelstan is not cognate to the modern term - did not include Ireland, Man, nor was he king (<i>rex</i>) of Scotland. Likewise, the the <i>Britain</i> and <i>British</i> of Geoffrey refers to the southern half of modern-day Great Britain and are also not cognate to the modern terms. To again restate the OED: medieval usage is "hisorical" and "rare".</dd>

<dd>Athelstan was the only Anglo-Saxon king who defeated an Irish ruler, and was the only Anglo-Saxon king who used the phrase British Isles. Your assertion that when he used it he did not intend its normal Latin meaning, and was not including Ireland, is unsupported. That he probably never actually exercised authority in Ireland, or even Scotland, is irrelevant. We are looking for written references to the phrase, and are not here to judge whether those references were justified. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, he defeated Olaf (calling him an Irish ruler is ambiguous) in one battle. Olaf apparently did not submit to him and reinvaded a couple of years later, retaking York and the north of England. In any case, it's not clear that Athelstan was the only Anglo-Saxon king to defeat an Irish ruler. Olaf Cuaran (successor to the other Olaf as ruler of York) submitted to Edmund 1 in 943. Edmund 1 was Anglo-Saxon and Olaf Cuaran was probably every bit as Irish as Olaf GOTHFRITHSON, i.e. not very. I also don't know if Athelstan was the only Anglo-Saxon ruler to use the phrase "The British Isles". Can you please give your source for that? It would be highly relevant and potentially important data. Meantime, in the context of someone claiming to be King of The British Isles, it is relevant fact that they had no authority or kingdom in Ireland and that the (Irish) King that you say gave fealty to him did not do so at the time you say he did. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:58, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Geoffrey used British and Britain. No argument from me. For the moment, my interest is in the term "British Isles". Did he use that term, and if so, how? I can't find any other case than the one i mentioned a few moments ago, and there it is "British Islands" that is used, and probably excluding Ireland. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 09:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reference to Athelstan's defeat of Olaf of Dublin is on p.475 of the Mammoth book, and it was in 937. He may well have received fealty from some kings ten years earlier, but it was in 937 that he defeated Olaf. And at no point does it matter whether Athelstan <i>really did</i> hold authority over the whole of the British Isles, he merely claimed it. If you want to claim that he only meant islands other than Ireland, rather than the normal Latin meaning of the phrase, then please provide a reference. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Defeat is not fealty. Your entry (again) says that the named Kings submitted and gave fealty after the battle in 937. That is <b>not</b> substantiated by page 475 or by the Mammoth book or by the AngloSaxon Chronicles. Several British Kings are documented as having given fealty in 926 and 927, including the Welsh Kings. Constantine subsequently broke with Athelstan by allying with Olaf. After the Battle in 937 the Mammoth book (p463) describes Olaf as "only just escaping" and then "rethinking his tactics" before he reinvaded the North of England and took York again in 939, again in alliance with Constantine. (as an aside, the alliance with Olaf is described as increasing Constantine's power).</dd>
<dd>Therefore, none of the sources I have available substantiate your version of events and in fact they clearly contradict your version. Whether or not my recent entry was POV (which I deny and which you don't substantiate) your entry is apparently <b>incorrect</b>.</dd>
<dd>I don't in any way deny that Athelstan took that title, but it not substantiated in any way that he meant to claim authority over the whole of the modern British Isles and if he did not have authority over any of Ireland that is worth mentioning. As for the original meaning of the Latin or Greek phrase, should we assume that he was also claiming authority over Thule, etc.? If you are asserting that he was claiming authority over all that additional territory, I'd like to see a reference for that one. Meantime, your version in the edit is NOT supported by the reference material and is actually <b>contradicted</b> by the reference material, so I am again fixing it. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe it's time for a little calm reflection here ... this section (Origins of the term) is in danger of growing out of all proportion. IMHO it should be a <b>relatively short</b> expose of where "Britain/British" was first used, and its etymology, and a similar <b>Short</b> example or two of early uses of "British Isles". It doesn't need to include details of who was or wasn't king of which particular bit of the islands for what period - such information is not doubt worth having somewhere but not in this article. I will show you what I mean by making a dramatic edit in the next few minutes - if this doesn't meet with general approval then it can of course be reverted, but please consider it as an attempt to improve the article by removing unecessary clutter.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 14:05, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Given the continuous debate on the term, the origins are important. If the edit is dramatic and removes relevant material, I'm likely to revert it. Any importance Athelstan has on this page is in use of the term, potentially closing a 1500 year gap in use of the term. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 14:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Skeptical also TharkunColl, sorry. I see from the Wikipedia article that his minters struck "ÆĐELSTAN REX TO BR" (Athelstan, King of All Britain) on their coins. Google only returns this article (British Isles) and its mirrors to a search for "Athelstan" + "Britanniae insulae". A quick look at scholarly engines returned nothing useful for "Athelstan" + "British Isles" or "Athelstan" + "Britanniae insulae" or "Athelstan" + "King of the British Isles". "Britanniae insulae" is not present in the Mammoth book either. All sources do commonly call him King of England, however.</dd>
<dd>What I fear is what Hughsheehy hints at: that the meaning is different. Different semantic equals different word. If Athelstan did take the title, what did he mean by it? The southern half of modern-day Great Britain? The whole of modern day Great Britain? Or a more extensive mass, taking in more (or the whole) of modern-day British Isles?</dd>
<dd>I see the source text is an Anglo-Saxon dictionary that cites it in an example of the usage of "Breoten-wealda" meaning "The Ruler of Britain", providing little context to interpret "Britanniae insulae" (and other Latin titles) in a wider sense:
<dl>
<dd>Referring to Athelstan the dictionary quotes: Ongol-Saxna cyning and Brytaenwalda ealles dyses iglandes ego ÆtfelstaHus rex et rector totius hujus Britanniae insulae. (My translation: "Anglo-Saxon king and ruler of all of England, known as [in Latin] "Athelstan, king and restorer of all of the British Islands.")</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The second entry is interesting because it is alsmost identical in wording, but with the modifier that this king ruled not all of England but only Anglo-Saxon England (iglandaes Angul-Saxonum). He is not said to have bourne the title "rex et rector totius hujus Britanniae insulae"), but is "ruler of all Britain"):
<dl>
<dd>Of an unknown king: Ongol-Saxna cyning and Brytenwalda ealle dyses iglandaes Angul-Saxonum necnon et totius Brittaniae rex. (My translation: "Anglo-Saxon king and ruler of all of Anglo-Saxon England, also [in Latin] ruler of all Britain."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A third entry I cannot properly translate:
<dl>
<dd>Of another unknown king: He waes se eahtepa cyning se pe Brytenw(e)alda was octavus rex qui rexit Bryttaniam. (My translation: "He was the eight king, the ruler of Britain, was [known as] [in Latin] the eight king that ruled Britain.")</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Given the little context, and only one source among many that mention Athelstan (he was after all the first King of England), can it safely be asserted that the "Britanniae insulae" that Athelstan is quoted as being king of should be interpreted as the modern-day British Isles? Personally, I'm falling on the side of no.

<dd>Surely that's missing the point ... Britanniae insulae (or British isles) is simply a developmental stage, its precise definition is imaterial (unless anyone is trying to insert a POV which of course none of us is!). What is material is that such a term was used at that time ... and then on we go to other examples until we arrive at the present day. That's the point at which it becomes material which islands are included or not. We are not here to validate (or disagree with) the term's usage from a historical perspective but to state how it is currently used, in encyclopedic terms. This is why I have removed all the unecessary clutter from that section, to get to the heart of it. <a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 15:27, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem/issue is that the history probably is the heart of it, and that's why the section is "Origin of the term". If we ignore the classical references and start with Dee in 1577 then the term is easy to present as a piece of politically inspired invention. If we ignore the discrepancies between the different historical uses then we can see a continuity that isn't necessarily there. If we ignore the fact of its current use it's possible to get into debates on whether it should be used at all (which is beside the point). It's key to get the facts and present them. I've said it before on this section and others ....each of us and any reader can form their own POV from reading the facts....but we shouldn't have a POV that edits the facts for us. Also (and sorry for this) I don't like much of the way you edited the section. I'll put comments on your talk page, but you should expect me to put a lot of the text back. If nothing else, this section is the best fun for someone like me that likes a bit of history.

<p>The problem is that the source doesn't state when Athelstan claimed to be "restorer of the British Isles" (and, indeed, it may not be known). In a sense, therefore, a judgement call is unavoidable in how we interpret it. In 927 he took personal control of Northumbria, the first West Saxon king to do so, hence his designation as the first king of a united England, and at the same time received the fealty of various Scottish and Welsh kings. Ten years later, however, he fought the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Brunanburh_3570.html" title="Battle of Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a>, which was long remembered as the greatest victory the Anglo-Saxons ever had. Athelstan reached the height of his power, and is known to have defeated, amongst others, a ruler from Ireland (and Olaf's return two years later was only possible because of Athelstan's death). His assumption of a grandiose title - more wide ranging than any other Anglo-Saxon king that I know of - is surely more likely to have occured at this point, rather than ten years earlier. Why else would he say "British Isles"? Many Anglo-Saxon kings had claimed to be rulers of "Britain", but Athelstan needed something even greater.</p>
<p>With regards to Dee, I'm glad I found that quote. I appear to have beaten the OED by about half a century. But to cut out all the Latin and Greek references to the term would be to give a false impression that it was invented by Dee, when, as a scholar, he surely knew of its existence in Latin. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, to begin with the Greeks and Romans did not use the syntax <i>British</i> + <i>Isles</i>. The Romans used <i>Britannia</i> (having conqured only the Britanic part of the islands) based on <i>Prettanikee</i> (Great Britian) from the Greeks, who did not refer to the islands by a single group name (as far as I know). The people from the OED, also being scholars and (presumably) knowing of the Greeks and Romans, would have traced it to that point did they believe it to be true. They placed it at 1621, without reference to any previous etymology in a different language. I do congratulate you on your earlier find and suggest you submit it to them (as far as I know they welcome open submissions of this kind), but, with regard to the Greeks and Romans, where is the link?</dd>
<dd>As for Athelstan, we don't know what <i>Britanniae insulae</i> means. Although, it is a curiousity. We don't (at this time) know what the source is - it is referenced as example material in a dictionary and is unsubstantiated anywhere else. The coins of the time show a different title. What did it refer to? When was the title given and who by? Was it by the people of the England, other people of the time, by the people he defeated, posthumously, or was it revised? Speculation like this is dangerous stuff - we're writing an encylopedia, people rely upon us for credible information. Its interesting, but we don't know what it means. And the most credible source of etymology puts <i>British Isles</i> 600 years later. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 17:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Athelstan: proof</span></h3>
<p><i>"Æthelstan was styled 'rex Angulsaxonum' ('king of the Anglo-Saxons') until the late 920s, when this style was superseded by 'rex Anglorum' ('king of the English'). In 930s the charters gave the king grander titles, claiming not only kingship of the English but lordship over all of Albion or Britannia: 'rex et primicerius totius Albionis regni', 'rex tocius Britannie'. First among the rulers of the English, Æthelstan used the title REX TOT(ius) BR(itanniae) on his coins."</i> <a href="http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/anglosaxon/01_kingstyle_0871.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/anglosaxon/01_kingstyle_0871.php" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>This states, quite clearly, that it wasn't until the 930s that Athelstan began using any title grander than "King of the English". Therefore the "British Isles" title <i>cannot</i> have been adopted when he received the fealty of those kings in the 920s. And yes, I'm fully aware that the "British Isles" title is not among the examples given above, but it is clear nevertheless that it dates from the 930s, not the 920s. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:56, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, does <i>Britanniae insulae</i> mean (modern-day) Great Britain or British Isles? I notice the quote above equates Albion and Britannia. The Romans used Britannia for the whole of the British Isles and Albion for solely Great Britain. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 17:25, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Britanniae insulae</i> means "British Isles" (other translations into modern English are obviously possible, but "British Isles" is the idiomatic form). As I've said before, this doesn't mean that Athelstan really had authority over the whole of the British Isles, merely that he claimed it. It is not our job (in this article) to evaluate the truthfulness of his claim, it is simply to state that he made it. And yes, Albion was certainly an older name for what we now call "Great Britain". There term Britannia (and variants) was a collective name that included the two large islands of Hibernia and Albion. It was only later that the Romans applied the same name to that part of Britannia <i>over which they ruled.</i> <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 18:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, a note that this "proof" doesn't prove anything about fealty from Olaf, which was one of the main points where the previous edits were unsupported and still - as far as I can see - incorrect. As for the date, it may narrow it down, but the original edit said that the title was adopted after the battle and after receiving fealty from the kings in 937....where it is not supported that this was the sequence or that they gave fealty at the date of the battle. Thus, it's a great reference and a much better edit can now be written but it doesn't prove that the original edit of the section was correct. Also, the reference to British Isles is still from a glossary of language, not an actual history. Finally, and again, if a King claimed to be ruler of the British Isles (or Britannic Islands or Islands of the Britons, or whatever) and had NO territory in Ireland, that is a significant fact in the context of this topic. We cannot be sure what he meant, whether he meant the territory to be only Britain and surrounding islands or whether he was big into self aggrandisement, but the apparent fact that he claimed that title and had no writ in Ireland is relevant fact. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 19:00, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many kings - especially the Anglo-Saxon kings of a newly unified but still rather shaky England - made extremely grandiose claims. His authority in Scotland must be regarded as something that existed only on paper anyway. The current edit makes no mention of fealty. If we know this title <i>must</i> date from the 930s (Athelstan died in 939) then the Battle of Brunanburh is by far the most likely occasion for him to have adopted it. The new edit, however, doesn't even say this. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 19:07, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see a problem with saying that it's most likely he took the title after the battle. I'm not sure how it's relevant unless we can know what he meant. One other question that may be helpful in tracking down more references to his taking that title, since currently it's only mentioned in a glossary of language and not a history. Was the original title he took in Old English (Anglo-Saxon) or Latin? <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 19:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I haven't checked the bibliography references on the page so I'm not sure it's a good reference. 927 was when he received fealty from the kings as mentioned, and was 10 years before the Battle of Brunanburh. The site does not give any reference to any title of Athelsan's more grand than "totius Britanniae". Also, none of the online sources I can find make any reference to any claim to be King of the British Isles. It seems strange that they would neglect to mention such a major claim. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 19:46, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Three points:
<ol>
<li>"It is not our job (in this article) to evaluate the truthfulness of his claim, it is simply to state that he made it." - It is our job to represent facts truthfully. Suggesting (as including it in a section titled "Origin of the term" does) that this is an origin of the term <i>British Isles</i>, when we do not know if it is so, is speculation and grossly misleading. This is where <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_etymology.html" title="False etymology">false etymologies</a> come from. I know you would like it to be so, but we do not know that it is. We need a source saying that this is so.</li>
<li>"As I've said before, this doesn't mean that Athelstan really had authority over the whole of the British Isles, merely that he claimed it." - What evidence is there that Athelstan claimed authority over Ireland and the Isle of Man (therefore, including Albion, the British Isles)? Again, the problem is that we do not know what was meant (and who by, and when) by <i>Britanniae insulae</i> except that it is syntactically similar to what we are searching for.</li>
<li>(Now a bitter pil.) What would, however, be apparent is that the term (if it existed, and whatever it meant) is rare in association to Athelstan. As Hughsheehy points out, would you not expect a title bearing such a remarkable similarity to <i>the British Isles</i> to be more widely reported on? Yet in every other source the title is "rex tocius Britannie" or such-like. There may however be possibly a prosaic reason. The source of the quote in the dictionary is cited as another dictionary, "based on" another collection and "enlarged and completed" in 1874 (not a just secondary source, but a secondary-secondary-secondary source compiled much after the fact, maybe geographically distant):</li>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I suspect a mistranslation or revision somewhere along the line. Is there anywhere else he bears the title King of "Britanniae insulae" (or similar)? The title from this source differs too greatly from other sources and the source itself too untrustworthy to be take it seriously on its own. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 22:09, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made no claim that Athelstan's usage of the term constituted its origin. Perhaps we should retitle that section as "history" of the term. As for disputing the validity of the reference itself, that is surely original research. You ask what evidence have we that when Athelstan said "British Isles" he meant to include Ireland. The term included Ireland in previous usage in Latin, so what evidence do we have that he <i>did not</i> include Ireland? Look at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Brunanburh_3570.html" title="Battle of Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a> page, and you will see that the Irish were intimately involved.</dd>

<dd>TarkunColl, please. "History of ..."/"Origin of ..." are synonymous and equally misleading, and my word was "suggest" not "claim". As for "disputing the validity of the reference", I looked at the source of the reference, something I fear was not done before (its in the first few pages of the book). There are no reference to this being the "origin" or "history" of the term <i>British Isles</i>. The term is not used by any authors or historians on Athelstan or the British Isles. Including it in any such section is unfounded, original research and misleading. The only date we have from a credible scholarly source is 1621. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 08:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I never said that the Athelstan citation was the "origin" of the term - it is simply an example of its use in history. The actual "origin" of the term without doubt predates any written sources. That section of the article contains many such examples of its use in history, and I cannot understand why this Athelstan quote should be so contentious (unless perchance it contradicts some preconceived notion). Your assertion that "the term is not used by any authors or historians on Athelstan or the British Isles" is pretty extraordinary, and I think you need to provide proof that you have consulted every single author and historian who has ever written on Athelstan or the British Isles. The 1621 date you mentioned (with regards to the first use of the term in English) is also incorrect, as John Dee used it in 1577. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 09:11, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meantime, I am now vastly uncomfortable with this Athelstan reference. There has been a sequence of versions with claims that were not supported by the references; assertions that the new version was proven that were then disproven 30 minutes later, and the whole edifice (sorry, trying to make a pun on flats) rests on - as sonyyouth puts it - a secondary secondary secondary source. As for the challenge that someone should have to search all the possible sources to prove that a secondary source is not valid, that seems extreme and I suspect it is neither reasonable or in line with WP policy. If we extended that policy we might have aliens landing in Medieval London before long. I have been looking hard and I have not found <b>any</b> other reference to the current claim, which claim is in a glossary and <b>not</b> in a history. It may be that a glossary uses entirely invented terms just to give translation examples. In any case, it seems very strange that another reference has not/cannot be found. If one is found, great, but Athelstan may have to go for the moment. Meantime, the idea was to try to find references to British Isles (or anything like it) between the Romans and John Dee. We apparently still have a gap of a millenium and more, which is an issue if we look at the characterisation of "British Isles" as a traditional term. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 09:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

What is the common approach is to provide supporting material new claims. Does any other secondary source (or even primary?) refer to this title?</dd>
<dd>What we do know is that we can find only one (dubious) use of the term. Other sources we can find on Athelstan do not refer to this title (genuinely extraordinary if he had been known by it, and so remarkable that they don't if he had).

<p>I agree Althestan has to go but the gap is hardly "an issue" since we are not trying to validate British Isles simply to record its current meaning and usage ... and its origins for academic interest. In fact a gap is hardly surprising since we may well be seeing two separate threads, the latin one where Brit, Britannia etc were used and then the modernish one - there doesn't have to be a join. <a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 10:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The awful spelling of the Latin phrase that mentions Athelstan is quite obviously of Dark Age provenance - a modern "invention" to use as a "linguistic example" would have made a better job. But in any case, why should a glossary of Anglo-Saxon phrases not be a valid citation? Why is it any less believable than any other source? It seems like gross POV to state that it is somehow unreliable. But in any case, Wikipedia is based on secondary sources, it is not based on Original Research. There is <i>no</i> 1500 year gap - the Athelstan quote cuts the gap almost precisely in half. And why should Athelstan's (or, more correectly, his scribes') use of the term be so remarkable? It is only remarkable for those people who have already assumed that there was no such term in the Middle Ages, and so when evidence is presented, they question the evidence rather than their own assumptions. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:04, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P.S. Blocks of flats were called <i>insulae</i> because they were self-contained, i.e. they were like islands. We too use the word "island" in ways that are in origin metaphorical, rather than literal. Traffic islands, for example, have nothing to do with water. And Donne's famous line "no man is an island" would be nonsensical if taken literally, because it is obvious that no man is a bunch of land surrounded by water. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&lt;reduce indent&gt; Whichever meaning was intended (and let's bet on islands), the source is still highly dodgy. The referenced webpage says that it is an interim version that volunteers are correcting on an ongoing basis, so it may not be a correct transcription of the actual glossary at all. If you look at the scan of the page mentioned (either P105, which is referenced or p124 which seems to be the right one) the text quoted is not there and I can't find it on any other page of the document that supposedly provides this reference (and I may be missing it, since old english isn't my forte). <a href="http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/png/oe_bosworthtoller/b0124.png" class="external free" title="http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/png/oe_bosworthtoller/b0124.png" rel="nofollow">http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/png/oe_bosworthtoller/b0124.png</a> or b0105.png.

I can't find the text quoted there either. TharkunColl, instead of accusing us all of POV, please check the reference. Also, you again assert that the claim was made by Athelstan after the battle in 937 which - as we've seen - is not actually supported by any reference and is speculation on your part. Since he'd already apparently claimed to be King of Britain 10 years earlier than this battle, your narrative for this whole thing is apparently entirely yours. I'm removing Athelstan until a proper reference can be found. This has been a sad episode so far. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 12:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been having a look at all of Athelstan's other titles, and those of other Anglo-Saxon kings, and have come to the opinion that when he said <i>Britanniae insulae</i> he probably meant "island of Britain", as most other references are to <i>Britanniae</i>, an apparemtly plural form but translated as "Britain". I am also of the opinion that there will be some who are now willing to accept the source as genuine, since it is apparently no longer important. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 13:04, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure that whether that's your opinion is anything to do with the point. If you have found lists of Athelstan's titles and this one doesn't appear in those lists and the original source you quoted (as far as I can see - and I am happy to be corrected) does not actually contain the title you quoted, then that is the point and is more relevant than your opinion. Besides, if you have lists of the titles of other Athelstan and other Kings from the era, a great question is whether any of them use the term in any way? That would be more interesting than your opinion. The ball is in your court to provide references......solid ones. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The best source for the titles used by the Anglo-Saxon kings between 871 and 1066 is the one I linked to earlier <a href="http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/anglosaxon/01_kingstyle_0871.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/anglosaxon/01_kingstyle_0871.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, but even that does not claim to be exhaustive. The <i>Britanniae insulae</i> title is not among them, but - if genuine - may only appear on a single charter. As I said before, the atrocious Latin is typically Dark Age. The word <i>insulae</i> certainly looks plural, but it may only be in that form to agree with the noun <i>Britanniae</i> which is used a number of times in various titles and is translated as "Britain" (singular). A more literal translation would be "Britains" (plural), but such a form does not exist and is nonsensical in English. When the Roman province of Britannia (singular) was divided into smaller provinces in the third/fourth century, and all the provinces were grouped together as a diocese based in London, the diocese was called Britanniae (plural), so this pluralisation of place-names was clearly unexeptional in Latin, but is unheard of in English. How we should translate such a term into modern English is a matter of opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 13:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Speculation ...) Okay, so when Britannia (singular) was broken up the Romans, they grouped together under the name Britanniae (plural)? Athelstan, being the first king of England, united ('restored") them again? Hence Britanniae (plural)? (More speculation - just 'cos its fun - and still totally uninformed.) "Insulae" as a metaphor for the (previously) separated (now united/"restored") "Britanniae" (plural) - i.e they were "islands", now reunited ("restored")? Or, "insulae", as in house, as in a Royal House?</dd>
<dd>Regardless, this is speculation. Its interesting but it doesn't belong here. See what they say on the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athelstan.html" title="Athelstan">Athelstan</a> about it. Its curious, but, we really don't know what it means.</dd>
<dd>Regarding, the "gap" between Romans and Dee. I don't really see a gap, unless we are trying to link the two (directly) etymologically. Personally, I could do without the Greek and Roman names, but every article gives what the Greeks and Romans called a place (however, does it have to be so long?). More important (in my opinion) are the words used by "locals" - of which <i>British Isles</i> became foremost.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In the phrase <i>ego Æðelstanus rex et rector totius hujus Britanniae insulae</i>, does anyone known what <i>hujus</i> means? It might clear up the plural/singular conundrum. Can we please, however, stop imagining that "house" is even a possible translation of <i>insulae</i>? An apartment block is not a house, and was not used as a metaphor for one (still less is it a "royal house" - which is not, of course, any sort of building). This whole apartment block thing is a red herring, and I really hope that we can all accept that "island/s" is what is intended here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Interestingly, the Old English phrase that the Latin supposedly translates is not an exact equivalent: <i>Ic Æðelstān Ongol-Saxna cyning and Brytænwalda eallæs ðyses īglandæs</i>, which means, word for word, "I Athelstan, Anglo-Saxon king and Britain-ruler [of] all these islands". It also appears to be written in the Mercian dialect, hence the "O/o" in <i>Ongol</i> rather than the West Saxon "E/e" for <i>Engel</i>. Notice here that this is an <i>English</i> sentence that uses the phrase "these islands"...

<dd>One other thing. From a check just now on other titles (e.g. <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300(192801)22%3A1%3C146%3ATSATOH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U)" class="external free" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300(192801)22%3A1%3C146%3ATSATOH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U)" rel="nofollow">http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300(192801)22%3A1%3C146%3ATSATOH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U)</a> it seems that "ruler of" or "king of" takes the genitive case. As far as I can see, IF Athelastan was claiming rule over the "British Isles" then isles would take the plural genitive. Insulae isn't that case. It is (in this context) the singular genitive, so Athelstan was claiming to be ruler of the island of britain. If it was plural genitive it would be insularum.

<p>Is there any other talk here about stuff not related to the term that is after all the name of the page. I'm assuming such a term exists. It has different meanings. We can include them all. My point is that I see Oppenheimer in the references - I read a digest of his book, and again, maybe my perceptions based on that digest are skewed, but he seemed to feel the Celts came from Spain, and originated in the Med (somehow re-invading Italy and Turkey!). While this tallies nicely with the Book of Invasions, I suspect it deeply. Also Oppenheimer asserts the reason the English were so successful in taking over was that they already existed in the pre-Roman population. Oppenheimer is a geneticist making cultural and linguistic arguments without a background in them. Interesting, but suspect. He seems oddly to fall into that Victorian trap of combining genetics, culture and language into that single entity called race. So we were all Basques (brown haired, long nosed) and then we were visited by dark people, somehow speaking an Indo-European language, but who were famously described as blond by eye-witnesses. For once I'm on the side of traditional histories and analyses using all disciplines. I suppose it's a published book and all that, oh well. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevebritgimp_6161.html" title="User:Stevebritgimp">Stevebritgimp</a> 09:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding Oppenheimer the Basque connection isn't so surprising. The Irish myth of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milesians_%28Irish%29_e444.html" title="Milesians (Irish)">Milesians</a> tells of where the final inhabitants of Ireland (who named the Island after the goddess Ériu) came from were "nine brothers of Íth set out from their territory (said to have been around modern Bayonne in the Basque Country) and invaded Ireland." For a long time, Irish archeology was confused at the lack of evidence for a celtic invasion. Opinion now is that there never was one. Rather the celticisation of Ireland was cultural, not military. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 21:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Isle/island</span></h2>
<p>"Isle" and "island" are interchangeable: one is of French origin, the other is from Anglo-Saxon. Interestingly enough, the silent "s" in "island" is false and has only come about by imitation of the pronunciation of "isle". As a side note, before printing there were not that many books, nor a widespread interest in antiquities, nor many works of geography. Saying something like a term was only rarely used does not have much meaning as an absolute, only if it is relative to other terms expressing the same thing. of course, such an assertion needs a reference to someone who knows what they are talking about. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 14:36, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>IMHO they are not quite interchangeable.

<dd>Agree with Abtract. OED says Isle is a "noun, poetic" and apart from the normal implication of smaller size it's thus not equivalent in normal use.

<dd>At a guess it says, "England, Scotland and Ireland, or Britannia: descritpion of the islands." Do we also have a date for this? I notice its very finely printed, so long, long after the rediscovery of Ptolomy (hence <i>Britannia</i>). From looking at it, it appears to me to be even after the circa.1600 date for <i>British Isles</i>. It would be more interesting to find uses of <i>Britannia</i> in the post-Roman era before 1300 (rediscover of Ptolomy). And more details on where <i>British Isles</i> came from. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 15:25, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doh! Just seen that this is covered in the article: "Similarly Ortelius, in his atlas derived from Mercator´s original maps, uses the title "Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio". This translates as "England, Scotland and Ireland, that I describe [to be] the British islands".[24]" --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 16:37, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but I don't think it is right — where is <i>sive</i> translated? — and it is not the same translation as given at <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> (<i>"a description of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the British Isles"</i>). We can't just guess, which is what I suspect has been done to date. The nearest I can get is <i>I describe</i> [lit. "I see", according to ND] <i>the islands of England, Scotland and Ireland, or of the Britons.</i>. I don't see any basis for translating it as British, because <i>Britanicarum</i> is <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genitive.html" title="Genitive">genitive</a> plural. Unless of course "of the Britons" and "British" are synonomous.

<dd>I would be cautious about translating <i>Britannia</i> as <i>the British Isles</i> as this would put a modern idiom on a much older word. Certainly, the <i>Britannia</i> of Ptolomy covers an area equivalent to the modern-day <i>British isles</i>, but in the same sense that <i>America</i> is equivalent to the <i>the New World</i>, or other such examples. A lot is lost in moving between idiom and word. As for <i>Britons</i>, I don't know ... can one talk of a <i>Britannia</i> being a <i>Briton</i>?</dd>

<dd>Its unfortunate that we don't have a genitive case in English. The nearest equivalent is <i>of</i> or <i>′s</i>. By way of example, in Irish, <i>Bhreatain Mhór</i> is <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Éire</i> is <i>Ireland</i>. Their genitive case is used in <i>Ríocht Aontaithe na <b>Breataine Móire</b> agus Thuaisceart <b>Éireann</b></i>, the <i>United Kingdom <b>of Great Britain</b> and Northern (lit. North) <b>[of] Ireland</b></i>.</dd>

<dd>Genitive would be "the culture of the island." As a rule of thumb, since this could also be written as "the island's culture"', <i>island</i> is 'genitive.' This rule of thumb can produce some strange sounding results, however. In the example above, its possible to imagine the "United Kingdom" referred to as being Great Britain's and Northern Ireland's United Kingdom. Both <i>Great Britain</i> and <i>Northern Ireland</i> are 'genitive.' If you said "Great Britain and Northern Ireland's United Kingdom" (only one 's) then <i>Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i> would be a lexical unit (implying a semantic unit also). In the same way, you don't say, "Johnson's and Johnson's shampoo", rather you say, "Johnson and Johnson's shampoo", since <i>Johnson and Johnson</i> is (not <i>are</i>) a lexical (and so, semantic) unit.</dd>

<dd>Regarding genitive plural. This is just a matter of a noun that is in the genitive case being plural at the time. So for example, in "The culture of the islands is bewildering", <i>islands</i> is 'genitive plural.' This causes problems in English because now what do we say if we want to use 's? "The islands' culture is bewildering", which sounds exactly the same as the singular form when spoken (singular: "The island's culture is bewildering.")</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blanking sourced edits, commonly-known facts and corrections</span></h2>
<p>First, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">blanking text</a> is regarded as <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. With regard to historical writing, deliberately omitting relevant information regarding a subject or source is regarded as a sure sign of bias - in Wikipedia terms <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a>.</p>
<p>I will now list the changes which were blanked and explain their inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change in meaning of Britannica from equivalent geographic area to modern-day <i>British Isles</i> to mean modern-day Great Britain and especially the area the southern, Roman-controlled areas before the end of the Roman Empire.</b> This is just such common knowledge that I did not include sources. See the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a> article, where it is included also without citing source. If an editor disputes this, and is unwilling to verify it for themselves, then simply state how many sources (and of what kind) would be necessary to satisfy them and I will source it for them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Regarding Bede and "insularum"</b> - "insularum" does not appear anywhere in the text, nor does it make any sense as a signifier. It is in the genitive case (see discussion above) and so roughly equivalent to the possessive case in English i.e. island's with an 's. So requiring a possessed noun, as in "the isand's [noun]." What is the possessed noun? "Oceani insula" does appear in the text and is described in my edit as it appears.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The sudden rediscovery of Ptolemy's maps and the influence of it.</b> Widely sourceable and (I had assumed) well known. I'll dig up references. It explains the sudden resurgence of <i>Britannica</i> as a name for the <i>British Isles</i> following a gap of over a millennium.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Transition of <i>Britannia</i> from an archaic name for Great Britain into a British nationalist symbol.</b> - This section was taken verbatim from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a> article, where it appears without need for sourcing, again due to its common acceptance - source will follow if it is contentious here. This is necessary to explain how Britannia, a cognate mutation of Britannica, became "British" as in the <i>British Isles</i> and to introduce the national cultural environment of Dee and Helwyn, who are cited as being sources of the term. This is especially pertinent as we are tracing the transition from Britannica to the British Isles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Scholarly opinion of Dee's and Heylwyn's geography as being influence by (proto-)nationalism.</b> - As with all historical research, it is necessary to include pertinent information regarding subjects and sources - otherwise, bias (or at least sloppiness) can be inferred. Current scholarly opinion is that both were influenced in their writings by a degree of (proto-)nationalism. This is why it is necessary in the preceding paragraph to explain the nature of the 'nationalism' they were exposed to. Hiding or disguising this fact is untruthful and a certain a mark of POV.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>That Dee is also attributed as coining <i>British Empire</i> and <i>British Ocean</i></b> - These two terms are syntactically and semantically related to <i>British Isles</i>. Ignoring, disguising or omitting that they were coined by one of the sources we attribute <i>British Isles</i> to is, quite simply, unbelievable. We want to trance the origin or the term <i>British Isles</i> and we ignore two other syntactically and semantically related terms coined in a similar period by a sourced we have identified as an originator of the term we are researching?? Unbelievable!!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Map of BI in BE.</b> - The term <i>British Isles</i> emerges at the same time as the term <i>British Empire</i>. Their growth in acceptance as new terms followed each other. To understand the society/culture/politics of the British Isles during the period in question (i.e. before <i>Modern Usage</i> etc.) necessitates understanding that it was as the centre of an Empire (its like talking about Ancient Rome and not mentioning that it was at the centre of the Roman Empire). Not wanting to include it can only, again, be explained by bias-inspired neglect. It is also necessary to show a period map naming the islands as <i>the British Isles.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the edits which were put back in:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bede and "insularum"</b> - Discussed above - factually incorrect and linguistically nonsensical.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Regarding Heylwyn and "He used this term for both Great Britain and Ireland (as well as the other islands) because "ancient writers call this Iland a Brttiʃh Iland"</b> - This is misleading. The sentence refers to Great Britain and Ireland [two objects], then says that "ancient writers call this island [singular] a British Island [singular]" Which island is being referred to? Necessitates clarification, which I included.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>"The description "The British Isles", or its equivalent in Latin, also started to be used by mapmakers from the late 16th century onward."</b> - Unsupported especially regarding <b>the British Isles</b> in English and, to a lesser extend, regard the "equivalent in Latin." Although, I do accept that I did too hurriedly delete it. Apologies, I put it back in (with a better translation of the Latin).</li>
</ul>
<p>If I have made an error, please correct me, but blanking (supported and sourced) text is no way to approach disagreement.</p>

<p>"Commonly known facts" are not what WP is all about ... I reverted the edits in question because they had no citations and because they removed statements that had citations. Also there was a huge amount of change in a very short period without any discussion on this talk page, IMHO this was to much in one go. It may well be that some of this is good stuff but perhaps you could take it a bit at a time and make sure you source each part as you go ...

<dl>
<dd>Sure. That sounds like common sense - especially in this circumstance. However, you have (accidentally?) reverted everything. The unsourced elements were:
<ul>
<li>Change in meaning of Britannica from equivalent geographic area to modern-day British Isles to mean modern-day Great Britain, esp. the southern, Roman-controlled areas before the end of the Roman Empire.</li>
<li>The sudden rediscovery of Ptolemy's maps and the influence of it on late-medeaval map-makers</li>
<li>Transition of Britannia from an archaic name for Great Britain into a British nationalist symbol, and the national culture that Dee and Heylwyn were writing in</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>With regard to the first two of these, I had believed they were of the sort of "common knowledge" that would uncontroversial (admittedly, silly in this context) and so do not require sources. The third, for sure, I knew would eventually require citation. Anyway, they should present no trouble to source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I think you are to some degree mistaken. The only sourced elements that I "removed" were:
<ol>
<li>With regard to Bede and "incularum"</li>
<li>With regard to Heylwyn and "ancient writers call this Iland a Brttiʃh Iland"</li>
<li>The paragraphs referring to maps from 16th century onwards re: English-language and Latin versions of <i>British Isles</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>On the first of these, I corrected it because it was simply incorrect. (In fact, my correction even cites the same source.) The second, because it required clarification - which island is being referred to? As for the third of these, I agree that I acted too hastily and have put it back in but. Although, I think it should be marked with as "citation needed."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have once again blanked all of the edit - not only the three unsourced elements, but also the correction and clarification as well as the pertinent and reliably sourced materials. If there any parts which you doubt, please mark these relevant with {{specify}}, {{fact}} and {{verify source}} as per guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Removing unsourced or poorly sourced material is only suggested to be done if you find it "very doubtful and very harmful." If you find it only "doubtful and (quite) highly harmful" you should first bring it to the talk page. Again, the only material I removed was relating to usage English-language and Latin versions of <i>British isles</i> on maps from the 16th century. This I put back and suggest it be marked with {{fact}}.

<p>I reverted all the edit because it was difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff. Believe me I have only one desire in this ... to improve the article. However, <b>unsourced edits</b> that put quite a new slant on the section and which themselves <b>remove three previously referenced items</b> seems unduly fast. There has been considerable discussion on many much smaller edits yet this covered a lot in one go. I suggest one sourced (and I stress <b>sourced</b>) edit at a time is enough for us to cope with.

<dd>No problem. I enjoy you around and please stay. I've put refs in where you had marked for citation. Not the most authoritative regarding Ptolemy and the piece re: Britannia and proto-nationalism is just a book, but they will do until I can get onto scholarly databases. The worst thing was trying to find anything like a definition of <i>Britannia</i> in Roman Britain because it is just accepted that a reader understands (so lots of 'obvious-what-they-mean-when-you're-reading-it', but nothing substantive to quote). --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 23:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A wonderful update. Excellent. Well done SonyYouth. It'll take me a while to dig through all the references, but in the meantime I'll only comment that I did actually find the term "insularum" in Bede but used in a context that is not 100% clear what is being described. I put a question on the Bede reference last year... (see question in italics)
<dl>
<dd><i>"First, as far as I can see, it is not at all clear that the reference to Bede is referring to the British Isles. The section quoted, where the text now indicates that the reference to "islands" means the British Isles reads "In his time the Arian heresy broke out, and although it was detected and condemned in the Council of Nice, yet it nevertheless infected not only all the churches of the continent, but even those of the islands, with its pestilent and fatal doctrines."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I think it was late Dec. That construct would be correct with the genitive. In any case, it's not inconsistent with use of Oceanus Insulae. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 11:06, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ooh, saucy! What I've done is reinstate information that some bright spark has moved out of sequence, then remove the moved portions that form a duplicate. I've removed the word "solely" which claims on the basis of a 1911 encyclopedia that Pytheas didn't refer to the British Isles as a whole, and reinstated the references showing that he did. If you don't have the books to hand, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/019280202X/ref=sib_dp_pt/203-5240695-7468744#reader-page" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/019280202X/ref=sib_dp_pt/203-5240695-7468744#reader-page" rel="nofollow">this link</a> allows you to click through to page 1 where Donnchadh O Corrain, Professor of Irish History at University College Cork, states "Pytheas, writing in the late fourth century BC, refers to the British Isles as the 'Pretanic Islands' – and this term is certainly Celtic (it comes from <i>Priteni</i>, and gives Welsh <i>Prydain</i> 'Britain'). The name is likely to have reached Pytheas from the Gauls." I've changed "The term itself most likely referred to..." to "It has been claimed that the term itself referred to the way in which the people first encountered in the south of Great Britain used <a href="../../../w/o/a/Woad.html" title="Woad">woad</a> to decorate their bodies. According to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Heylin_c04d.html" title="Peter Heylin">Peter Heylyn</a>, <i>Britt</i> meant <i>paint</i>..." – in my opinion that's less weasely and from memory Heylyn's assertion is rather doubted nowadays.

<dd>Dave, have a look at your user page for some questions about those references you reinserted. I'm not 100% sure they're good references. I've been wrong before (and will be again), but I cannot find the text mentioned in the Snyder text and the O Corrain text is odd for another reason.

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; As I've noted on my talk page, it's a good point that any reference to Pytheas must relate to fragments of the writing from later texts, just as the non extant Massaliote Periplus is known from an even later writer. While O Corrain doesn't make that explicit, I'd still think him a pretty good source for the term being used in that way at least from the time of the earliest surviving fragment. No doubt scholars have debated whether these fragments accurately reflect Pytheas, or if he was the original source. The Snyder book was from the library and that's certainly where the Greek text came from – I'll have to check that out and read the context of the relevant pages. The Amazon search does show the words "Again, this is a geographic rather than a cultural or political designation, for at Bpettavtai, `the Brittanic Isles,' included Ireland." Snyder was the source I used for variations on the term subsequently replacing Albion as the name for Britain itself: I'll try to get it out of the library and clarify these points as far as the book goes. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By the way, looking at the linked 1911 Britannica it says that Pytheas used Albion and Ierne, but says nothing about him not using other terms for the islands collectively.

<dd>On Snyder, the whole relevant text is visible online, so there's no need to get the book from the library. Nowhere - as far as I can see - does it say it was Pytheas who used that term. It says "Greek writers".....which could have been anyone.</dd>
<dd>On O Corrain (sorry, too lazy for the fadas), we need to say it is him saying that Pytheas says it, not just assert in our edit that Pytheas says it, at least until we can establish the source. Otherwise we're turning a secondary source into a tertiary reference. I have no reason to doubt him either, but it's not a good reference as currently written in the edit. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 00:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

"<i>Scholars agree that the name Pretani, which is thus implied as a general name for their inhabitants from at least the fourth century onwards, can hardly be identical with the name Britanni...It is a very probable conjecture that Caesar, finding himself at the outset of his expedition on the borders of a Belgic tribe called Britanni and knowing that the country he was about to invade had been lately colonized from Belgic Gaul, believed himself able to correct a widespread error by substituting the forms Britanni, Britannia, for Pretani and its Latinized correlative Pretania.

<dl>
<dd>Being fairly bold, I've tried to address these points by 1) adding a disclaimer at the start making it clear that both of these early texts come from later fragments or translations, 2) moved Pytheas references together to a new paragraph, and as suggested have made it clearer which statement each citation supports as well as trying to make it clear that it's O Corrain's statement, and 3) since the Ierne / Albion bit refers to modern usage, added a similar bit about Priteni. The Caesar point's interesting, and should be added: since he was after the earliest fragments of Pytheas, it seems to confirm Pretani as the normal name which he modified to Britannia etc, perhaps in error. One point: we don't seem to have a reference for the Ierne / Albion bit: the Snyder reference used at <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html#Origins_of_terms" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)#Origins of terms</a> puts things a bit differently. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 11:38, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting point there about it meaning “to shape” or “create.” after their deity (“the Creator”) – can we put that in as an alternative to "painted"? Presumably the O'Rahilly book would be the source for that, if someone can check. As for the spelling, it would be good to find more sources. The Snyder spelling shows in the Amazon search, and that's how I transcribed it from the book. Unfortunately someone's got it out from the library, so will just have to be patient as far as checking it beyond what shows up on Amazon. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 20:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interpretation Act 1889</span></h2>
<p>Has anyone got access to the text of the Interpretation Act 1889 from the UK Parliament? I don't, but I've seen a reference saying that the term the British Isles was legally defined within that document as being the United Kingdom (at the time including all of Ireland), the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This act was superseded in Ireland by the Interpretation Act 1923, and in the UK by a number of acts, up to and including the Interpretation Act of '78 that introduced the definition of British Islands. However, unless someone has access to the text, the question is moot. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 10:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Keeping intro succinct, but complete</span></h2>
<p>Good evening, it's good to see healthy academic debate above! Just a note to highlight that into the introduction's first parargraph I've reinserted the following: 'The term is not generally used in the Republic of Ireland'. I feel that this is too important a point to pass without reference in the article's introduction - as important information for anyone visiting Ireland (given the associated sensitivities). I see from the discussion above that some of my Irish colleagues earlier suggested inserting an explicit reference to the political reasons behind this. I think that the 'considered objectionable' link allows anyone who wishes easy access to a full explanation of the reasons for objection/avoidance - inserting wording in the introductory paragraph around the 'political reasons' inflames passions unnecessarily in my view.

<dd>Thanks Hughsheehy. I can well see his point, but putting 'political reasons' in without an explanation immediately following it has in my view an incomplete feeling about it - and, as we well know, a balanced explanation usually ends up being far too long for an introductory paragraph! I'm content for the objection that many of us have to be clearly referenced and the point concisely made about its usage (or lack of it) in Eire - with an easily accessible link provided for those who desire a further explanation.

This article has benefited greatly from recent contributions, but the <i>ould shpin</i> is still having its way.

<dd>I agree, its very knotted up and weasely. From the <a href="http://www.celticgrounds.com/chapters/encyclopedia/p.html" class="external text" title="http://www.celticgrounds.com/chapters/encyclopedia/p.html" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia of the Celts</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"As late as the time of Julius Caesar, and probably much later, the main native population of Britain and Ireland was known to the Celts of Gaul by the name Pretani. From the Gallic Celts, Greek writers learned to call Britain and Ireland the Pretanic Islands. The name Pretani is represented in the earliest Irish documents by Cruithin, which is translated by the Latin Picti, and is the specific designation of the ethnic group now called the Picts."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(Should we also include that the Gauls saw us as an inferior civilization that practiced <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyandry.html" title="Polyandry">polyandry</a>?)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this was the Gaullish understanding of the time, the Romans had a different one. In the same entry, a further definition of Pretani is given:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The name Picti is of Latin origin, based on the reported custom of dyeing the skin. In Latin writings of the time of Roman Britain, Picti has no specific ethnic application, but is said indiscriminately of all the inhabitants of Britain to the north of the Roman <i>frontier."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>South of that border were the Roman Britons. Under the entry for Picts the following is given:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"As to the racial identity of the Picts, they were possibly Celtic and called Pretani in their own language, hence the name of Britain. The Irish called them Cruthin and applied this name also to people of the same race in Ireland. Picti (painted folk), was the name given them by the Romans."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mixing an explanation of Pritani with a modern and post-Roman definitions of Britain and British is thus very misleading and, as Shtove writes above, begs the question by preempting the latter-day <i>British</i> Isles. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 14:14, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; If you read <a href="#Blanking_sourced_edits.2C_commonly-known_facts_and_corrections" title="">#Blanking sourced edits, commonly-known facts and corrections</a> above you'll see that the reference to Prydain comes from Donnchadh O Corrain, who would no doubt be surprised to find that he's "colonising the Celtic fringe". He uses it to establish Priteni as a "<a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_language.html" title="Celtic language">Celtic language</a>" term, which also relates to other sources relating it to Cruithne. Your points of view are noted, but we have multiple sources indicating various terms related to Priteni being used for the inhabitants and as an early term for both islands. I'd like to see improved sources giving more detail, and several aspects need to be sorted out. The statement that "While, Britannia had remained the Latin name for Great Britain, after the fall of the Roman Empire it had lost most symbolic meaning until the rise of British influence" also appears in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannia.html" title="Britannia">Britannia</a> article at present, but seems odd in the light of the 9th century <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Britonum_e45b.html" title="Historia Britonum">Historia Britonum</a></i> which the <i><a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebor_Gab%C3%A1la_%C3%89renn_13ae.html" title="Lebor Gabála Érenn">Lebor Gabála Érenn</a></i> article says is the earliest extant account of early Irish history (or pseudohistory). The term also appears in the 12th century <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Regum_Britanniae_a2ae.html" title="Historia Regum Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a></i> which "became tremendously popular during the High Middle Ages, revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period" despite being largely fictional. These are all sources of later national myths, but while the terms gained new meanings and spellings, they had early origins. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 19:10, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I meant was that the point is not clearly made - apologies, the way I said it was unclear and incendiary. My POV is that at this time we were all British (or Priteni, or whatever) but that between that time and the 17th century what was signified by <i>British</i> had changed enormously - affected dramatically by the Roman conquest of Britain. Both <i>Historia Britonum</i> and <i>Historia Regum Britanniae</i> describe Britain (transliteration) as being equivalent in area to the Roman province: Historia Britonum is on "the history of Brythonnic inhabitants of Great Britain from earliest times, and this text has been used to write a history of both England and Wales" (from that article); Historia Regum Britanniae on the "ancestors of the Welsh, the Cornish and the Bretons" (from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_legendary_kings_of_Britain_efbf.html" title="List of legendary kings of Britain">List of legendary kings of Britain</a> article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By my post above, I did not mean that the point should be removed, certainly it should not, just clarified. As it is, it seems to say that "British" people were present all over the British Isles at this time. The "problem" is that they were, but not as we understand <i>British</i> today. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 00:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Another key point is that someone outside the islands may have called all the inhabitants of the islands Priteni, or whatever, but I haven't seen (or don't remember) seeing anything that says the inhabitants of the islands called themselves that and in any case, Preteni≠British. It may be a part of the origin of British, but it is NOT the same word or the same meaning. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 10:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Tudor Britons</span></h3>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, thanks for a considerable improvement. Couple of points: "During the classical era, the terms Brythons, or ancient Britons, are referred to as the people who lived in the southern half of modern-day Great Britain" seems problematic to me: people from the Roman provinces were using terms such as Britto to refer to themselves, Brythons is a later term from a Welsh origin. I'll look for sources to clarify this as well as the earlier terms. The point of Tudor political use is significant: they apparently played up their Welsh ancestry and genealogies developed from <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Regum_Britanniae_a2ae.html" title="Historia Regum Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a></i> gave them claim to "Britain" – the John Dee info is fascinating, but a bit out of sequence as he's talking of a British Empire before Britain was in any way politically unified. That seems to relate to the Tudor claims, rather than the eventual personal union of the crowns under James VI and I. It's notable that James proclaimed himself as 'King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland', a point I'll add now for clarification. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 22:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand how the Dee info is out of sequence. That's when he was doing it; using those terms and making those claims. If I remember, at the time it was being claimed that Arthur had ruled all the area (Britain, Ireland, the seas around), so imperial claims were being made on that - and other - bases. I also found (somewhere) a reference to how Scotland fitted into their/his thinking before James inherited the lot of it. I'll try to dig it up again. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 17:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The sequence problem comes from describing the death of Elizabeth and accession of James before hopping back to John Dee in 1577: unless you check the dates it gets a bit confusing. If that paragraph's moved into sequence it makes more sense. It would be more logical to start the section with the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Britonum_e45b.html" title="Historia Britonum">Historia Britonum</a> introducing <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutus_of_Troy_aa08.html" title="Brutus of Troy">Brutus of Troy</a> who is developed in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Regum_Britanniae_a2ae.html" title="Historia Regum Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a> into part of the English political narrative along with Arthur. Snyder reports that in 1485 <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Tudor_4021.html" title="Henry Tudor">Henry Tudor</a> became king and commissioned research into his ancestry, and a year later was given a history of his descent from Arthur and Brutus, a theme developed by later Tudors. So effectively the prestige of "British" ancestry developed through the middle ages, and became a political tool of the Tudors. Thus Dee's idea of a British empire follows on from the English claims to rule Scotland and the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rough_wooing.html" title="Rough wooing">rough wooing</a> of Henry VIII, and helps to create the English empire before the union. Oddly enough, from memory the claims of James VI and I to be king of Great Brittaine seem to have been pretty much ignored in England and Scotland where it was business as usual until the revolution and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_England_2192.html" title="Commonwealth of England">Commonwealth of England</a>, then the idea of Britishness is revived in the Hanoverian eighteenth century.. .<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 20:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of it's described in WP, although I haven't used any of that as source and I didn't keep my refs properly because I didn't write it in. Again, from memory, James wanted to call all of Great Britain <i>Britain</i>, but there was resistance in England - if I remember rightly. I also saw some reference (which I can't find right now and may not have been a reliable source anyway) that the term "British" included Wales and Ireland before it included Scotland - at least (or only) in the Tudor "propaganda" of the mid-late 16th century, which is also in line with the timeline of the Tudor expansion.</dd>

<dd>Another thing....really interesting to see that there was also a lot of thought given to a Tudor (I think it was the Tudors) takeover of Iceland, which was forestalled by a Danish move. <a href="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9931967_ITM" class="external free" title="http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9931967_ITM" rel="nofollow">http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9931967_ITM</a>. The basis for this was perhaps largely the same as for the rest; prior fabled Arthurian conquest (or the other Welsh guy whose name I can't remember right now), rights over the whole British Ocean, etc. Again, it's potentially consistent with inclusion of Thule (probably Iceland) in the original classical Britannias, although that is speculative. Also, there was certainly an Irish presence in Iceland before the Viking arrival so once you claim Ireland as British it's not that much of a leap to claim Iceland too, whatever the classical authors meant by Thule. Iceland might have become a "British Isle" in the modern sense if not for Danish annexation of the island. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 21:35, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Channel Islands</span></h2>
<p>One other question...which is based on a non-researched impression. Is it the case that British definitions of "the British Isles" always or almost always include the Channel Islands, whereas American/other definitions just say something like "other smaller neighbouring islands"? This is my impression. It speaks to whether the definition is geographical or geopolitical or more political. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 21:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am sceptical of the concept of British definitions of the term. There is no British or American Academy to define what terms mean. Useage dictates meaning. When a BBC weatherman says 'a cold front will be passing over the British Isles' there is no way for the viewer to tell whether or not he is including the Channel Islands. Almost certainly the weatherman will not have given the matter any thought. Why? Because it doesn't matter. In today's useage this is not a term that denotes any status. It is just a convenient label, with grey edges. Whether or not the Channel Islands, or Rockall, or the Goodwin Sands are in the British Isles is similar to the question of exactly where the north Atlantic turns into the Arctic Ocean: a matter of pedantry.--86.31.226.83 18:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, from what I can see there are British definitions (OED, BBC, Times, etc) that all specifically include the Channel Islands, making that definition of the British Isles a geopolitical definition and NOT a geographical definition. All the American definitions seem to say " and adjacent islands" (to Great Britain and Ireland), which can only include the Channel Islands if you have a flexible imagination, given that they're a stone's throw from France. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:04, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May be a case of simply not knowing they exist. Or as you say, that British definitions lean more towards being geopolitical. Certainly they don't fit into any definition of adjacent. It may be useful to note when saying that sometimes CI are included, sometimes not i.e. American definitions do not include them. One possibly exception is the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Oxford_American_Dictionary_edd4.html" title="New Oxford American Dictionary">New Oxford American Dictionary</a> (by the American editors of the OED) which explicitly includes them: "a group of islands lying off the coast of northwestern Europe, from which they are seperated by the North Sea and the English Channel. They include Britain, Ireland, the isle of Man, the Isle of Wright, the Hebredes, the Orkney Islands, the Shetland Island, the Scilly Isles, and the Channel Islands."</dd>

Europe, for example, has essentially arbitrary eastern borders, it is essentially defined as the area white people came from, and the southern border of Scandinavia is the German-Danish frontier. Does this mean that neither is a geographical term? Use of Channel Islands in this term is understandable, given the general confusion about the nomenclature for the archipelago, and the need sometimes to express the geographical area (which doesn't naturally include the Channel Islands), and sometimes the historical-cultural-linguistic region</dd>

<dd>Lol, no I'm afraid its nothing that exciting. The repeatedly cited BBC weather article has recently been changed from "a small country such as the British Isles" to "a small area such as the British Isles". Of course, I am being a little presumptive - it could just be run-of-the-mill copydediting, but this is a page that had been left unchanged for a couple of years... --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 22:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe we could ask the BBC why these pages were changed after being static for a long time and then suddenly, once ref'd on WP, being changed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Other maps and atlases</span></h2>
<p>The references supplied to "other maps and atlases use the term 'Great Britain and Ireland instead" in Modern Usage are all road and rail maps. These would naturally use this since British Isles is a geographic term and hence not altogether appropriate. This need to be made clear because the current wording makes it look as though these maps are deliberately avoiding the use. In my previous edit I said that such maps "generally" use the political term because I can't demonstrate that they always do. I would be quite surprised to find one that does not. <a href="../../../n/a/o/User%7ENaomhain_92c2.html" title="User:Naomhain">Naomhain</a> 10:59, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may well be correct in your feeling. It's just that unless there is substantiation it's not really valid to assert it in the edit. However, if there is even one that does not, would that invalidate "generally"? I haven't looked for one, but I suspect you could easily find one. Also, I'm not sure why on earth road maps are not "geographic". A road is not political, at least not "generally". Besides, at least a few of the publishers just call the books "Atlas" and they include far more than just roads. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 19:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fascinating topic actually. I know that the discussion of atlases etc., only started recently when someone (I think Mucky Duck) asserted that not only dictionaries defined the British Isles as they are normally defined, thus kicking off a bit of a ref war. I was looking at Amazon.co.uk last night and noticed that older atlases (e.g. AA, Reader's Digest, etc., typically before 2000 or so) refer to the British Isles, whereas they seem to refer to Great Britain and Ireland or Britain and Ireland in the more recent editions. I wondered if anyone else had noticed the same thing in any other context. It's possibly in line with the discussion above on Google trending, but <i><b>may</b></i> indicate a tendency for the British Isles to fall out of use. Very speculative for now. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 11:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Entertaining speculation, though all this listing is pushing towards original research. For what it's worth, the road atlases in my house refer to Great Britain and don't have maps of Ireland, so it's also possible that the Ireland section was seen as an addition to the GB road maps. On an earlier point, my small Philips <i>Essential Atlas</i> of the world doesn't include the Channel Islands on the British Isles pages, though it has Orkney and Shetland in inset boxes and could have done the same with the CI. .... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 11:47, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, for now it's pure speculation on my part...maybe not even mature enough to rank as speculation, more an open ended question - and one that I have no idea whether it's true. As for the listings, the "I've got more on my side than you have on yours" is tedious but historically this article has been host to lots of denial of the facts. References seem to be a way of "trumping" denial. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 14:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, and noone seems to be denying that. However, the issue of atlases NOT using the term had previously been restricted to poor Folens.
