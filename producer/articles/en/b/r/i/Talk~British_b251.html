<dd>I disagree - I just cannot stand to see the UK and Britain conflated. It's probably true that the majority of links to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> refer to a UK citizen - that's probably because someone who is British is necessarily a UK citizen. There's nothing wrong with that - they're British too. But what happens when somebody says that <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_I_of_Great_Britain_5447.html" title="George I of Great Britain">George I</a> was a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> king, and clicking on <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> takes us to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, which didn't exist at that time? I mean, why should somebody who makes a link to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> want it to go to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>? Honestly, this change seems very bizarre to me. I'm changing it back so the redirect goes to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> - if people are making links incorrectly, it's the links that need to be changed, not this redirect. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>The article on Great Britain describes the island of Great Britain. The article that describes the state that was Great Britain resides at United Kingdom, for goodness sake look at the links to this page.

<dd>I also disagree that this should be a redirect to the United Kingdom. Although I agree that the majority use of 'British' is 'of the United Kingdom', its use is confused enough to warrent something more. To be honest, I think that it needs some sort of new classification to describe what the article should be - a sort of 'extended disambiguation'.</dd>

<dd>I <i>have</i> looked at the links page, but I don't see why that means we should pretend that "British" means "of the United Kingdom", which is very clearly does not. I repeat from above: if people are making links incorrectly, it's the links that need to be changed, not this redirect. And I paraphrase myself from below: what's wrong with saying somebody is British and having the link go to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>? --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>I've just realised I've taken both positions up there. My, that makes me look flighty! Given that many, many writers (from all over the word, including the Brits) will misues this word, maybe we should have this page as a disambiguation, that briefly explains what "British" SHOULD actually be used for. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a> 13:35 Dec 28, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Maybe, though I don't begrudge the person who'll have to fix all the links pointing here! And really, is it such a big problem? Saying that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Caine_6eb4.html" title="Michael Caine">Michael Caine</a>, for example, is British, and linking it to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> (which is the sort of thing links pointing here do) isn't a misuse of "British" or a bad link, after all (I mean, he <i>is</i> from Great Britain). Saying somebody from Ireland is British would be bad, of course, but nobody seems to be doing that. So I guess I don't really see the problem with things as they now are. Maybe <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> could be mentioned and linked a bit more prominently in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> article though (like in the first paragraph) - that might be an improvement. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>This is an interminable discussion: one round finishes and the redirection is set up in such a way, then a few months later someone will reopen the issue by changing it to how they think it should be. Personally I think British should redirect to Britain, since the two words are related. See <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritain_18f9.html" title="Talk:Britain">Talk:Britain</a>. See also <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="America (disambiguation)">America</a> for how the issue is handled there.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> redirects to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, so the current set up is how you suggest. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>The situation is now ludicrous. British redirects to Great Britain which is about the island and is completely wrong for the majority of the links. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>

<dd>Why is it "completely wrong for the majority of the links"? As far as I can see, the majority (indeed, all) of the links are referring to something of the island (they're referring to something of the country as well, of course, but that doesn't make a link to the island wrong, does it?). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>Ok here's an example... Duke of Wellington? British? Yes of Course. Only he was born in Ireland. One more what about History of Guernsey - "The islands were the only British soil occupied by German troops in World War II" - Only Guernsy isn't Great Britain or even the British Isles as such. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I've already said twice - if people are making links incorrectly, it's the links that need to be changed, not this redirect. And here's a counter example - people prior to 1801 might be described as "British" quite accurately - but making a link from them to "United Kingdom" wouldn't make much sense, because the UK didn't exist at that time. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>Well you would want to link such articles to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> perhaps? <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If the article was relevant to that time frame (which my example was not - I said prior to 1801, while that state was in existence between 1801 and the 1920s), then maybe. I don't want to get involved with that, though - my main point is simply that "British" means "of Britain" and so should redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>Mintguy - I too am troubled by people who make no distinction between Britain and the UK - that's why it troubles me so much that you seem to be advocating that very lack of distinction. "Britain", as the above cited dictionaries say, means "of Great Britain". It doesn't mean "of the UK" (and I just checked a couple of British dictionaries which say the same thing, if that convinces you any further). In my view, the redirect should reflect this. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>Yes, I can see your point there - I think the best way to deal with it, though, it to make the link to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> page more prominent - that way, people who want the UK are still only a click away, and they (and everybody else) also gets some useful information without any extra clicks. I wouldn't object to a disambig page at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, it just seems to me that this is a more graceful way of acheiving the same thing. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>Well I just looked at <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> and they disambiguate, so maybe the disambiguation for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> should be there after all. I don't agree bu the precendent for disambiguation seems to already exist. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>French and German are also languages in addition to nationalities (two fairly different things). British is an adjective or noun that refers to a geographic location.

<dd>The precedent exists because French and German might mean the language as well as something of the countries. This isn't such an issue with "British" because the language is called "<a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>" (which is indeed a disambiguation page). It's true that there's a distinction to be made twixt "<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a>" and "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a>", but I think that's such an unusual use of the word "British" that it doesn't need disambiguating against - people will be careful enough to link it to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> directly, I should think. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>I have reverted the page to Martin's disambiguation page of 25 Dec 2002. This is because the term <i>is</i> ambiguous. Is any other reason required to make a disambiguation page? When applied to living people, the term almost always refers to their nationality. My nationality is "British"; this means "of the United Kingdom", not "of Britain". However, in a historical context, especially when talking about times before there even <i>was</i> a United Kingdom, it often just means the island of Great Britain. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 02:31 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>This isn't "historical times" - this is the present. Also, as a description of the people of all of the British Isles, the term applied not only to those from the island of Britain (as we know it today), but also from its sister island, Ireland, and the surrounding isles. The first ever written record of the name of the islands was in the Bible: the <i>Isles of Elishas</i>. The next recorded references were, for a very long time, the <i>Pretanic Isles</i>. This has since been corrupted to the current <i>British Isles</i>.</b> --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 18:42, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, I see... <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> is now a page which explains the differences in usage. Hmm, I'm not sure about this, though.

<p>I don't get it. Surely it <i>does</i> just mean "of Britain", but implies different things, e.g. the land of Britain, the nation of Britian, the language of Britain? Not that it's a problem.</p>

<dd>Okay, the word "adjective" was a bit pointless there, so removing it is fine. And sorry for getting the wrong Act of Union! I must have got a bit confused there. As for the nationality thing, "British" means "of the nation of Britain" only if you call the United Kingdom "the nation of Britain". Which I don't think many people do! It does, after all, include Northern Ireland, which is not part of "Britain" by <i>most</i> people's definition, as far as I am aware. Maybe we should find some people from Northern Ireland and ask them whether they consider themselves (a) to be British, and (b) to come from Britain. If anyone answers "yes" to one but "no" to the other, that would prove that we can't just say that they are the same thing. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 11:59 8 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Britain" is used so variously that the word often does include NI (e.g. "Britain may join the Euro" is a commonplace phrase, even if arguably incorrect).

If an article uses "Britain" where "UK" or "GB" are clearly meant, it should really be fixed regardless of what we do on this page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_G_ad96.html" title="User:Andy G">Andy G</a> 17:12 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<li>United Kingdom - but that's wrong because it's only existed recently whereas Britishness has existed for a long time.</li>
<li>Great Britain - but that excludes Ireland, and possibly other territories not on the mainland.</li>
<li>Britain - which should be OK because it explains the usage of the word and points to all the other entities. In particular it points the the various United Kingdms that have existed, so a reference to British in the context of the Royal Navy would be cover the whole era.</li>

<p>I am British. More specifically, I am English as well. During my 28 years of living in the UK, I have always understood the term "British" to mean "of the UK". The prominence of British meaning "of Great Britain" is, in my opinion, marked with too much prominence in this article and also the article on "British Isles" and what all of the terms mean that seem to get everyone so confused.</p>
<p>I am suggesting that both articles are slightly amended so that it is clear that the main contemporary understanding of British means "of the UK", and to relegate to a slightly lesser prominence the fact (I assume it's a fact, in reality I have no idea) that in formal English "British" actually refers to Great Britain only.</p>
<p>As an after note to the above comments, I also wonder if "Britain", in a formal geographical and historical sense, does in fact mean strictly "of Great Britain"...if strictness of definitions were to apply, then surely British would mean "of Britain", which in a strict sense means "of Great Britain and of Little Britain". And in a formal and strict sense, Little Britain is Brittany in France ( and not the TV series ). So therefore the strict sense doesn't make sense. Therefore, ny original point applies. If there is not too much random voicings against my views, then I will amend the articles in this respect sometime soon.</p>

<p>Wallie, I was a fervent Scot when I was young the worst type and blamed England for all the troubles in Scotland at the time. When I got to about 20, I saw a film on TV about the British Raj. It was about army of soldiers, made up of Scots, Irish, Welsh and English. They were camped in a round castle, dancing and having a laugh, which was hosted by this Indian Raj. Unknown to them, he had placed machine guns around the edge, and started killing the soldiers. What I watched was the English soldiers picking up the wounded Scots and I had an ephiphany and realised I was British.

<p>The page has been re-redirected to Britain. To be honest, I think the offense caused by the difference in uses, and indeed the changing historical uses of 'British' means it warrents a page of it own. Of note, the Britain page says:</p>
<p>"The word British generally means belonging to or associated with Britain in one of the first two senses above (i.e. the United Kingdom or the island of Great Britain). However, the term has a range of related usages (see British)."</p>
<p>There is little explanation of the use concernign the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>; for example, it does not explain that British would not be appropriate to something from the British Isles, a fact that many people who do not come from the islands would probably not appreciate.</p>

<dd>I agree that the various terms are inconsistently and incorrectly used around the world (and even within the UK) to an extent greater than other terms. However, I think that confusion about 'British' ambiguity is an inherent consequence of the confusion about UK, GB etc. I agree with you that the British Isles article should clarify that it doesn't define the area of British people. But I would recommend improvements to primary articles rather than creating a secondary one. I consider that the various articles are almost as confusing and duplicating as the primary problem they are trying to solve.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would support further attempts to improve the primary problem, but I am reluctant to support an additional article for 'British' because I think it adds more permutations to the confusion.

<dd>Well I agree with you that this British page could redirect into Britain if the info in the two articles were merged; at the moment, however, I think the Britain article is substandard.

</dl>
<p>As for the UK/GB aricles; I don't agree, to be honest. Though they are often used as synonyms, there are fundamental differences, namely that Great Britain is both a political entity and a geographical feature - an island - and that the United Kingdom is only political entity. In particular, you would get unionist members of Northern Ireland irate by doing that redirect.</p>
<p>A long term solution to these various articles would be to limit the descriptions of how each term is used in each article, instead putting links into the British Isles (terminolgy) page. Similarly, a greater degree of standardization between the use of terminology on the following pages would be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great Britain</li>
<li>Britain</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>British Isles</li>
<li>England/Scotland/Northern Ireland/Wales</li>
<li>Republic of Ireland</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>Any other possibly relevant pages such as Irish Sea/Rockall/Isle of Man/Channel Islands etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>I would base the standardization around that on the terminology page too. If this was done, I think it would end the tendancy for people to find a need for pages such as Britain, and it would srengthen arguments against people wanting to place POV interpretations of the words in Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 17:11, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am aware of the political and geographical distinctions between GB and UK. I also know that unionists in NI are in favour of political union with GB.

Was there something in particular that makes you say that they would be irate about such a redirect?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is not just unionists that care, other people care too. That is my point. The geographical and political arrangement is not really very complicated. Nor is the correct terminology under dispute. It is just that there are several error permutations to link to and explain. The explanation of GB v UK error permutations could be simply contained within one article, but we currently spread it across multiple repetitious articles. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 18:12, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word British does not imply a geographical location. It is the national description of the people of a country.

<dd>I think that this page is less helpful than directing to Britain. The article on Britain is not about an island, it is about the country the UK, for which Britain is also a synonym. The article on Britain contains all the inforamtion that was on the 'British' page; the legal page is more unhelpful than helpful I think - when somewhat clicks on British, they want to know what that means, not the details of British nationality law <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 00:18, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand your reasoning to an extent. But note what I had said at the start of this section: <i>"Directing the word British to an article about an island, <b>however inclusive the article is</b> in respect of including the nationality of the people of the United Kingdom, is not accurate."</i> If I had entered the word 'French' into a search engine or looked it up in an encylopedia, I would expect to find information on both the language and the nationality. In such an article, I would expect to find a detail of what constitutes a French citizen - but not a discussion on geographical nominclature. If I wanted to explore that more thoroughly, I would have search for 'France' instead. One is a description of a groups of peoples, and the other is a description of geographical terms. That is what the words mean, and this encyclopedia should reflect that. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 01:34, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have suggested that people who want to look up information on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a> would use the keyword 'British'. Those who would wish to look up information on the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a> (ie: <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> or even the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>) would type in those particular words. Again I suggest that those who wish to look up information regarding the nationality 'British' would be best served by getting to an article which describes the implications and definitions of that nationality. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="British nationality law">British nationality law</a> does just that.</p>
<p>I also note that there is no consistancy amongst the articles you have listed.

<dd>What we're talking about is links. People are, as you contend, generally not looking up <i>British</i> - they are clicking on wikilinks in articles where <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> has been linked. As you point out, the examples I cited are not consistent - I never claimed they were, but chose them as representative examples of the solutions employed. <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian.html" title="Italian">Italian</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish.html" title="Irish">Irish</a> are frequently linked in the linguistic sense; therefore a disambig is a solution to enable people to proceed to either the language or the country or some other meaning. The others were chosen as examples of <i>gentilés</i> not generally used as names of languages - these redirect to the country concerned. Which category does <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> best fit in? <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMan_vyi_dbe0.html" title="User:Man vyi">Man vyi</a> 07:43, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed there is inconsistancy. It was with this in mind that I changed the link to better reflect the usage of the word in the first place. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> fits best into any article describing the nationality of a people. The island of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> is not the be-all and end-all of the term 'British'.

<li>Secondly, British does not just refer to people of British nationality. 'Sebastian Coe broke the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> record]; 'Oliver Cromwell sent troops to Irleand, at the time owned by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> crown'. The previous two setnences show cases where a redirect to this page is totally useless and misleading even.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</dd>

<p>In your first example, Seb Coe is a British person - a person of British nationality. The British records which he broke were records held by other British people - not those set by an island! From what I recall, Britain is slipping away from continental Europe at the rate of a couple of centimetres per year. Seb Coe can *still* run much faster than that!</p>
<p>In the second example, Ireland was indeed governed by the British Crown - that being the Monarchy of the British people.. the British people being those who were, at the time, British subjects.</p>
<p>For both examples, had the reader wondered what was British about <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastian_Coe_dc9c.html" title="Sebastian Coe">Sebastian Coe</a>, then all would be revealed by reading the relevant article and understanding what the term British actually means. The article has links to the (various) articles on the United Kingdom, if the reader wishes to read further. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 11:47, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Create a British disambiguation page. However, I think that this has been the case before and the content of the 'Britain' page was largely replicated</li>
<li>Redirect Britain to the nationality law page or the UK page and edit them to explain the whole British use; but this would invovle editing these pages beyond their current scope</li>

<p>Are you trying to say that it is beyond the scope of an article about British nationality law to describe the nationality of the British people..?

<dd>But <i>British nationality law</i> does not currently explain the concepts of British nationality and identity. It describes how British citizenship is defined by law. In any case, I've added a dablink to send people wending on their merry way to where they probably wanted to go in the first place. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMan_vyi_dbe0.html" title="User:Man vyi">Man vyi</a> 11:52, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering the definition of British nationality is created in British law, by British people, then it most certainly explains the concept of British nationality. Perhaps you are thinking more along the lines of British culture, and the history of the British peoples.</p>
<p>You cannot suggest that anywhere is "where they probably wanted to go in the first place". I am only after explaining to you that I, for one, would expect to find information regarding nationality when I search for a particular nationality in an encyclopedia. Is it realy that hard to follow logic? In saying that, the dablink at the beginning of the article was what I had suggested earlier, and seems quite all-encompassing. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 13:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article about an island is Great Britain. Britain is an acceptable - if slighlty misleading - synonym for the UK. The reason that British does not redirect straight to the UK article is because it could be referring to historical versions of the UK, to the British Isles or to someone from the island of Great Britain. (by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a>)</p>
<p>An acceptable name for the United Kingdom already exists: The United Kingdom. the reason that British does not redirect straight to Britain is because British is the description of a nationality of people. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 13:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Baisically, I'm heading towards a British disambiguation page as a more suitable solution - it would be far better than this one.

<p>Thanks <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a>. Either seems acceptable to me (dablink or disambiguation). The previous state of affairs was definately not, considering it did not offer the reader a choice of looking up the nationality British versus the culture of the geographical locations.</p>
<p>My own preference would be to simplify all of the articles and merge together as many as possible, and then to explain concepts such as the misuse of the terms Britain, Great Britain, English, etc etc in one article, with links in the other to it. At the minute there seems to be no logic and definitive structure for the articles, and consistancy is lacking.</p>
<p>In my own opinion, I think there should be one article called 'British', which deals with the nationality, points to the law page and deals with the abundance of incorrect terminology; Britain and Great Britain should really be no more than stubs (I'm not sure if that is the correct concept... short articles is what I mean anyway); British Isles should be a short article simply explaining the geographical concept, with appropriate links; United Kingdom should be the main entry; England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales should of course remain as they are. That's my immediate thoughts on the matter anyway.</p>
<p>-:I think <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> aims to do this <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:58, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have often found that foreigners do not understand the wealth of concepts easily. As residents, most of us grow up with it and understand it better. An encyclopedia should deal, first and foremost, with the correct terms, and then go on to explain the hows and whys of other, inaccurate and incorrect terms. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 13:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed - why should Belgian/Belgium, Australian/Australia or French/France be different. Yet they are. That's part of my point - there is no consistancy. I redirected to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="British nationality law">British nationality law</a> because it seemed the most appropriate article to read about British nationality, as I disussed above. As for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> never being a short and concise article - that's what users/editors are for.

Also, I am tempted to remove the countries that start with the word "British" at the end of the article.

<dd>This is not a DAb page (i.e. a page that links to other pages which may share word usage).

<dd>A dab page is a page that resolves confusion. It is a dab page just like "German", "Italian", "Frech", etc. "British" has even more ambiguity than those pages, and that is why this page dis-ambiguates the term. It's a page that should never be linked to, and many have worked to link away from this page. The dab template should be restored, in my opinion. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 15:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see absolutly no reasons whatsoever apart from bureaucracy to turn this into a standard DAB page. The Britishness of this that and the other is a highly contentious issue and deserves discussion.

<dd>The term "British" certainly has a lot more confusion attached to it than "German" or any other like term, and I think discussion about that confusion is warranted. But, it appears that discussion is the topic of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a>.

<dd>I think an article about the word "British" is warranted, then. I don't think this is the place to do it tho. As <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraicone_e5d6.html" title="User:Draicone">Draicone</a> mentioned, there are thousands of links to this page, most of which should point to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> or the appropriate historic entity. I think it is important to classify <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> as a disambig page (so that we can get people to the right pages quickly) and offer an alternate page on the use of the word "British" for those that are interested in that. Therefore, I propose that <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> be a dab page and that you (or someone) should create a new page (maybe British (term) or something similar). Keeping the page as a dab page will help maintain the rest of WP as well.

<dd>Hmmm, I'm not sure what to do here. I think that what this page ought to be is an 'extended disambiuation' page; but Wikipedia does not have sort a thing (unless we could create the first one ad hoc here??). Though 'British' is certainly used to mean 'of the United Kingdom' most of the time, there are the historical United Kingdoms etc. Some of the links on here are fairly tenuous e.g. the British Armed forces. No-one would ever use the word 'British' to mean just the army, would they? They'd link to British Navy or RAF etc.</dd>

<dd>In all honesty, if we were to follow the Manual of Style to the letter, then this would either redirect to the United Kingdom with a note at the top, or be a 'normal' disambiguation page. I don't see the problem with keeping the article as it is (though maybe losing a couple of links) and tagging it as a disambiguation (even if it isn't one - does that actually matter if its role is as a disambiguation page?) Remeber that <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISAMBIG_0cde.html" title="WP:DISAMBIG">the guideline on disambiguation pages</a> is just that - a guideline which can be broken if circumstances, such as this, make it common sense to do so. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 19:12, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jooler, we both agree that "British" is a confusing and ambiguous term. There are over 3000 pages that link to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a>, and almost all of those articles do not mean to link to a discussion of the history of the term "British." An article discussing the subtleties is useful, but the massive confusion of this term merits a page to disambiguate its uses. I would enjoy reading more about the use of the term, but I don't think <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> is the place for that discourse. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 21:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are articles that point to this page that should point to this page (at least arguably). But, because it is marked as a disambiguation page, people come through and "repair" the links to some particular article, even if it is one of the articles that should be left pointing here. In many cases, it is better to link to here and give the reader an appreciation of the various usages of the term, from which the reader can explore further.

<p>British refers to all 4 ethnicities, the English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh.</p>
<p>The Irish are genetically, linguistically, culturally and architecturally in exactly the same boat as the others.</p>
<p>Linguistically they're closer to the English than are the Welsh.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the latest DNA results, but genetically they were at one stage considered closer to the English than were the Welsh. (Travel to Ireland by ship was or may have been easier than travel to Wales by land).</p>
<p>It must be pretty obvious that "the British Isles" refers to both islands (or all 800 islands, depending on how you count them). And the word "British" covers exactly the same land-mass.</p>

<dd>Using the term British to refer to all four nations (in fact five including Manx, six including Cornish, and seven including Channel Islanders) is relatively new - circa. 17th century onwards, first including the Scottish, then expanding outwards - remember, at one time all citizens of the British Empire could call themselves British.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Linguistically Irish is a <a href="../../../g/o/i/Goidelic_languages.html" title="Goidelic languages">Goidelic language</a> like Scottish Gaelic and Manx (Scottish Gaelic is pretty much understandable to an Irish speaker). Welsh, Briton and Cornish are <a href="../../../b/r/y/Brythonic_languages.html" title="Brythonic languages">Brythonic languages</a> and incomprehensible to and Irish speaker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding culture, for sure, again, we share much in common - proximity alone, not even counting a shared political history for the best part of 800 years and a common insular European experience, would ensure that - but this cannot be so easily be classified as a <i>British</i> culture, due first to problems in nomenclature then think for example of the popularity of Gaelic games in Ireland and cricket in England and Wales.</dd>

<dd>As a side note to the linguistic bit, the Irish for English (the language) is <i>Béarla</i>. This is the shortened form of <i>Sacs-Béarla</i>, literally meaning "Saxon gobbledygook".
