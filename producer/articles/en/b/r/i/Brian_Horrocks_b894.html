<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Horrocks_b894.html" title="Edit section: Early life &amp; First World War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life &amp; First World War</span></h2>
<p>Horrocks was the son of Sir William Horrocks, a doctor in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps_7dd3.html" title="Royal Army Medical Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a>. Like many sons of officers, he received his education in a boarding school in England and later, in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, he entered the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_College%2C_Sandhurst_42df.html" title="Royal Military College, Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>, second-bottom of the entry class. He was an unpromising student and may not have received a commission had the circumstances not changed abruptly.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> he joined the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesex_Regiment_7e26.html" title="Middlesex Regiment">Middlesex Regiment</a>, where he joined the retreat of the army following the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mons_617b.html" title="Battle of Mons">Battle of Mons</a>. Horrocks was shot through the stomach when his unit was surrounded at the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_to_the_Sea_ba5d.html" title="Race to the Sea">Battle of Armentières</a> and was captured. He was taken to a hospital where he was interrogated by his <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> captors, who believed that the British Army were using <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dum-dum.html" title="Dum-dum">dum-dum</a> bullets, and was refused a change of clothes or sheets. As a result his wounds became infected. He had a better experience when eventually discharged from the hospital and he made friends with the soldier who escorted him to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war_camp.html" title="Prisoner of war camp">prisoner of war camp</a>. Horrocks made a number of escape attempts whilst a prisoner, during one he came within 500 m of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> border before being caught. At one point he was placed in a compound consisting solely of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> officers as an attempt to prevent his escape attempts. He learnt <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> from them. Years later, when working in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, he surprised <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikita_Khrushchev_00bc.html" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Bulganin_a73b.html" title="Nikolai Bulganin">Nikolai Bulganin</a> by greeting them in Russian.</p>
<p>On his return to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> Horrocks had trouble adapting to peace-time conditions. He spent four years of back-pay in six weeks, indulging himself in hedonistic trips to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. However, he soon found an opportunity to return to active service.</p>

<p>After the war Horrocks was posted to Russia as part of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_Intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War_a6b2.html" title="Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War">British mission</a> during the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Civil_War_dc1c.html" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>. After landing in <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladivostock.html" title="Vladivostock">Vladivostock</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">April 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> he was taken to the British headquarters and briefed on the situation. The <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_movement.html" title="White movement">White Army</a> under Admiral <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksandr_Kolchak_4561.html" title="Aleksandr Kolchak">Kolchak</a>, with the assistance of released <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovak_Legions_5016.html" title="Czechoslovak Legions">Czechoslovak Legion</a> prisoners, had driven the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> out of <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberia.html" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. The Czech troops were planning to return home and replacement Russian troops were urgently required. The British contingent was there to assist in training and arming these replacements. To carry out this task they had only a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a> of <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular.html" title="Regular">regular</a> British soldiers and two small administrative missions, one tasked with arming and training the Russian troops and one to assist in administering the lines of communication for the White Army.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platoon.html" title="Platoon">platoon</a> of British soldiers with fourteen officers, including Horrocks, were given the task of guarding a train full of shells for delivery to the White Army in <a href="../../../o/m/s/Omsk.html" title="Omsk">Omsk</a>, three thousand miles away on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Siberian_Railway_2bd7.html" title="Trans-Siberian Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a>. Afterwards they were to report to the British mission to begin training troops. The journey took over a month to complete, with numerous administrative difficulties which Horrocks, as the only Russian speaker, had to overcome.</p>
<p>Horrocks' next destination was <a href="../../../y/e/k/Yekaterinburg.html" title="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> where he was appointed second in command of a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-commissioned_officer.html" title="Non-commissioned officer">NCO</a> training school attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade.</p>
<p>He was again captured by the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> and spent the next ten months as a prisoner, narrowly surviving a severe case of <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhus.html" title="Typhus">typhus</a>.</p>
<p>With the end of active service, Horrocks looked for something else to occupy his time and decided to take up the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_pentathlon.html" title="Modern pentathlon">modern pentathlon</a>. He competed in army tournaments and, eventually, the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_Summer_Olympics_b77c.html" title="1924 Summer Olympics">1924 Paris Olympics</a>. Horrocks spent the remainder of the inter-war years in a variety of postings, including as an instructor at the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_College%2C_Camberley_42ed.html" title="Staff College, Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>, and as <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjutant.html" title="Adjutant">adjutant</a> for the 9th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Army_c362.html" title="Territorial Army">Territorial Army</a>. This provided experience of dealing with citizen soldiers which would be invaluable during the war. Horrocks later said they were among his happiest experiences.</p>

<p>When the Second World War broke out Horrocks was again sent to France and commanded the 2nd Battalion, Middlesex Regiment during the retreat to Dunkirk as part of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_3rd_Infantry_Division_a5e4.html" title="British 3rd Infantry Division">3rd Division</a> under General <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery_2915.html" title="Bernard Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>.</p>
<p>In 1942 Horrocks was given command of a new formation, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_9th_Armoured_Division_cbd8.html" title="British 9th Armoured Division">9th Armoured Division</a>. Horrocks had never been in command of <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a> before and this experience proved useful for his next appointment. Having never commanded a division in battle, he was sent to <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to command <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_XIII_Corps_51f8.html" title="British XIII Corps">XIII Corps</a> in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Eighth_Army_8206.html" title="British Eighth Army">Eighth Army</a> under its new commander, Montgomery.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Horrocks_b894.html" title="Edit section: North Africa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">North Africa</span></h3>
<p>Upon arriving in North Africa, Horrocks was put to work implementing the defence of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Alam_Halfa_ed8b.html" title="Battle of Alam Halfa">Alam Halfa</a> ridge from the expected attack by the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrika_Korps_44b2.html" title="Afrika Korps">Afrika Korps</a>. Montgomery, mindful of the need to prevent casualties prior to the planned <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Alamein_4d26.html" title="Second Battle of Alamein">Second Battle of Alamein</a>, instructed Horrocks that he repel <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Rommel_b47d.html" title="Erwin Rommel">Rommel</a> "without getting unduly mauled in the process". On this basis Horrocks prepared a plan for a purely defensive battle, with his armour dug in around the ridge. When the Germans came to attack they were unable to coax the British armour out towards their <a href="../../../8/8/m/88mm_gun.html" title="88mm gun">88mm guns</a> and found themselves battered by the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert_Air_Force_eb90.html" title="Desert Air Force">Desert Air Force</a>. The battle ended with the Germans having captured the Himeihat hill, at a high cost, and the Allied forces unwilling to attempt to recover it.</p>
<p>Horrocks was next offered the command of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_X_Corps_756e.html" title="British X Corps">X Corps</a>, an armoured corps, in the planned Alamein battle. He refused this command, believing that Major General <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Lumsden_d913.html" title="Herbert Lumsden">Herbert Lumsden</a>, a cavalry officer, would be more successful in this role. Horrocks therefore retained the command of XIII Corps. His corps were given the task of attacking to the south, while the main thrust was made by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_XXX_Corps_e9b9.html" title="British XXX Corps">XXX Corps</a> and X Corps. Horrocks was instructed by Montgomery that he was not to incur tank losses, and so XIII Corps' offensive operations were limited to small-scale raids.</p>
<p>After this operation, Horrocks' command was reduced in size while the other corps pursued Rommel. At one point the only formation under Horrocks' command was a salvage unit clearing the wreckage of the battlefield.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">Axis</a> forces next attempted a stand at the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mareth_Line_7bf3.html" title="Mareth Line">Mareth Line</a>, and it was here that Horrocks carried out one of his most successful attacks of the war. His X Corps, including the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_1st_Armoured_Division_a507.html" title="British 1st Armoured Division">1st Armoured Division</a>, carried out a flanking manoeuvre through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable. This rendered the Mareth position untenable for the Germans and they were again forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Horrocks was seriously injured during an air raid in North Africa and spent the next 14 months recovering. This injury caused him pain for the rest of his life and cut short his career with the army.</p>

<p>On his return to service Montgomery requested him to take command of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_XXX_Corps_e9b9.html" title="British XXX Corps">XXX Corps</a> during the battle around the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falaise_gap.html" title="Falaise gap">Falaise gap</a>, where the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allies</a> succeeded in defeating the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Seventh_Army_9ddd.html" title="German Seventh Army">German Seventh Army</a>. Horrocks retained control of the corps during the push through <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, capturing <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> and, at one point covering 250 miles in only six days. Eventually Horrocks diverted to capture <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, in order to secure the port, a decision he regretted after the war as it allowed German forces vital time to recover. Antwerp was vital to the Allies, as all major deep water ports in France remained in German hands until May 1945 and supply lines were stretched perilously thin, reaching back to the beaches at Normandy. In September 1944 XXX Corps were unknowingly opposed by only a single German division but, by the time they were allowed to attack north, the German First Paratroop Army, under <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Student_ed81.html" title="Kurt Student">General Student</a>, had been brought into the line opposite them. By mid-September, XXX Corps had been diverted to the east, while the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Canadian_Army_c124.html" title="First Canadian Army">First Canadian Army</a> would be tasked with clearing the strengthened German defensivive line stretching from Antwerp down both banks of the Schelde River to the North Sea in the month-long, costly <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Scheldt_b9eb.html" title="Battle of the Scheldt">Battle of the Scheldt</a>.</p>
<p>General Montgomery, however, made <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Market_Garden_d364.html" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> in September 1944 the priority for operations of 21st Army Group, diverting the main effort away from Antwerp and the Scheldt, and XXX Corps under Horrocks would be the lead player in the ground phase. Operation Garden failed in its objective to reach Arnhem to relieve the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_1st_Airborne_Division_67b1.html" title="British 1st Airborne Division">British 1st Airborne Division</a>, who had been told to expect a linkup with Horrock's forces in two days. In the event they were forced by circumstances to hold out for nine and eventually 80% of the division was destroyed or captured due to XXX Corps' failure. Postwar analysis of the battle is torn between perceived deliberateness of method on the part of the British, and the fact that German defences in the area had been severely underestimated by <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Allied_Airborne_Army_084c.html" title="First Allied Airborne Army">First Allied Airborne Army</a>, who had done the intelligence work. Especially important was the failure to identify an entire corps of SS armour in Arnhem itself. As the battle developed, a series of counterattacks by Army Group B under Field Marshal Model kept Horrocks' units on the defensive. The terrain over which Horrocks' men had to attack was also not suited to their mission, often restricting the entire division to a single raised highway over flat or flooded terrain. Horrocks was not personally blamed for the failure of his Corps; in fact, during this period the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._82nd_Airborne_Division_2dd0.html" title="U.S. 82nd Airborne Division">U.S. 82nd Airborne Division</a> of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_M._Gavin_bd36.html" title="James M. Gavin">James M. Gavin</a> came under Horrocks' command and Gavin described Horrocks after VE Day as "the finest general officer I met during the war, and the finest corps commander".</p>
<p>In the film <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Bridge_Too_Far_%281977_film%29_02fb.html" title="A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)">A Bridge Too Far</a> based on the events of Operation Market Garden, Horrocks was portrayed by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Fox_%28actor%29_42b4.html" title="Edward Fox (actor)">Edward Fox</a>.</p>
<p>XXX Corps were ordered to advance as part of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Veritable_0825.html" title="Operation Veritable">Operation Veritable</a>, during which the <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">German Army</a> was forced back over the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>. They broke through into <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> and eventually captured <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bremen_%28city%29.html" title="Bremen (city)">Bremen</a>, exposing the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_subcamps_of_Neuengamme_3e4a.html" title="List of subcamps of Neuengamme">Sandbostel</a> concentration camp, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalag_X-B_9a66.html" title="Stalag X-B">Stalag X-B</a>.</p>

<p>After the war Horrocks continued to serve in the Army, including a short spell in command of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_of_the_Rhine_ecc0.html" title="British Army of the Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>, until 1949, when he was invalided out due to continuing ill-health as a result of the wounds he sustained in North Africa.

He also had a successful career as a television presenter on a number of series covering military history.
