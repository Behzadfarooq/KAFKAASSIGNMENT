<p>Hey Brian, I am a new user of Wikipedia. While I am new here I have worked with wiki's previously (making wiki book) and I know the regulations here. I noticed you deleted several photo links which I provided for some pages just because they are at the personal website. But I think some of them are the best photo pages related to those categories (For example my photo link for Tobermory &amp; Elora Gorge) which I believe they can help the readers a lot. If I were you, I would not delete SIX links in different pages just because of my personal judgment. I might delete one or two links but for the rests I would wait to see others ideas. As you surely know, Wiki works based on the group thought and judgment. If you believe that these photo links are not the best or they are not proper/related enough, some people may believe they are absolutely appropriate. I will be thankful if you wait to see other users ideas and then track me to delete my added links. However I believe you should revert your changes for Tobermory, Toronto Zoo and Elora Gorge pages while I am not sure about Kingston, Ottawa and CN tower. Hope you consider my request.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hey Brian,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your comprehensive &amp; quick answer. While I agree with you in some of the mentioned points I disagree on the others. I think for some of the articles, more than one or two photos are required and having one or two photo gallery links can be really useful. For example for Kingston or Ottawa you need at least 10-15 photos to show their main attractions. I agree with you that it should not be several photo websites links at the article page but always the approx. best ones can be found. If you replaced my photos links with other photo links (better ones) or if you remove a link because there is a better/more useful link there, it would be totally fine with me but when there is no other photo link there why we should not put a useful photo link. I am not trying to convince you but I just want to clarify my view point. Anyway thanks again for your consideration. I should be mention in end that I am kind of amazed by the number of contribution you have had just in a few months and how active you are in the Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Thanks for cleaning up and adding info. although I know very little about some of the abandoned airfields, I find it sad that important pieces of recent history are fading into oblivion.</p>
<p>I even visited the Western Development museum in the hope of finding out more, very interesting displays but very little documented info.</p>

<dd>Whoa, wait a minute, I'm just trying to help your articles. The tags don't say your articles lacked sufficient information in the title; the tags mean the articles lack information that would give them context. Articles, including lists, should have a lead-in, or explanation about what the article/list is about (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html#Lead_section" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST#Lead section</a> or <a href="../../../l/s/_/WP%7ELS_3126.html" title="WP:LS">WP:LS</a>) and how it fits in with the "big picture". The lead-ins give the articles context. The titles do have somewhat of an explanation but for someone who has no idea what SAC is or what a wing is, or what the wings do, the article may be meaningless no matter how much information is in the article. Your articles should be able to stand alone to a degree, but with links that people could take that would give them more information if they were interested. There is a fairly good one-sentence lead-in in the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_USAF_reconnaissance_wings_assigned_to_Strategic_Air_Command_e78f.html" title="List of USAF reconnaissance wings assigned to Strategic Air Command">List of USAF reconnaissance wings assigned to Strategic Air Command</a>, which is often all that is needed. You may wish to link somewhere to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_%28air_force_unit%29.html" title="Wing (air force unit)">Wing (air force unit)</a>. Maybe there should be a separate article on Wings associated with the USAF (not a list, but an explanation about how wings came about and what they do) that could be linked to, if one doesn't exist already (I don't think one does). BTW, since I have an interest in military history, I think that your articles are interesting and have lots of good info. All the best. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Crawford_dfea.html" title="User:Brian Crawford">BC</a> 19:59, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There has been some confusion over the rank of Andrew CHarles Mynarski on the night of 12/13 June 1944. According to the curator and records of the Andrew Mynarski Memorial Hall at 1 Canadian Air Division, Andrew Charles Mynarski was a Warrant Officer 2nd class at the time of the action on 12 June 1944. He was promoted postumously in September 1944 to the rank of Pilot Officer. I will provide some further references when I have time but Larry Milberry in his landmark works on 6 Bomber Group refers to some of the debate surrounding his Victoria Award nomination (mainly regarding the fact that the award was based on a sole witness to the action) and historian Hugh Halliday in his research even notes that there was concern over a non-comissioned rank receiving the VC. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 22:41 2 February 2007 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Thanks Bill for the interesting information; I wasn't aware of the ongoing historical debate. I am really curious about this. Even if we changed it back to your original wording on ranks (that he was W/O), the external web pages the article links to have conflicting information. Since there is this debate, I wonder if we should just not mention any ranks for anyone in the article for now. Dumore and Carter in their book <i>Reap the Whirlwind</i> about No. 6 Group mentions no ranks perhaps for this very reason. I should check with my uncle who was a bomb aimer with 419 squadron. He may have some first-hand information. By the way, since you have Larry Milberry's book about 6 Group, could you check my article I wrote about <a href="../../../n/o/2E/No._6_Group_RCAF_22b8.html" title="No. 6 Group RCAF">No. 6 Group</a>? There may be more information to add, or even, heaven forbid, corrections needed. -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Crawford_dfea.html" title="User:Brian Crawford">BC</a> 22:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. There really is no controversy over the ranks, it is merely an error that has been propagated by authors quoting the Victoria Cross citation which clearly identifies Mynarski as a Pilot Officer. I am an author myself and have a book on Mynarski on the way so I know that his rank was postumously bestowed but that would constitute "original research" and that is why I did not refer to my own knowledge. If you read my edit, I have deleted the first mention of his rank and only referred to him as a Pilot Officer after his postumous promotion. It is true that all "non-coms" were elevated to officer ranks but it was not as sweeping or immediate as the original website infers. Some Sergeant Pilots were loath to give up the friendships and comraderie of the non-commissioned ranks for that of the officer class. In Douglas Harvey's (<i>Laughter-Silvered Wings</i>) accounts of his time in Bomber Command, he recounts that he refused the rank of Pilot Officer and felt coerced to eventually accept the promotion. Irregardless, no harm done, the correction is made and until I find a citation, I will leave at that. <b>:}</b> <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 22:59 2 February 2007 (UTC). BTW, I will check the 6 Group when I have time.</p>

<dd>I understand, thanks. You've cleared up a lot. BTW, I made a another change in the intro of the page which refers to him as a pilot officer. It's interesting that because of VC citation, suddenly every book or article about him gives him the rank of P/O. ... <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Crawford_dfea.html" title="User:Brian Crawford">BC</a> 23:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
