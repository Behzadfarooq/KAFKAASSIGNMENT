<dd>Well, his age of 38 is reported in the New York Times article. I don't think that the conclusion that he was therefore born in 1966 or 1967 qualifies as original research. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:46, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is linked from outside, for example from one of the biggest German news magazines (Der Spiegel) in articles about the controversy. If Mr. Chase does not merit an article himself (and there are people with more interesting bios), it should at least be merged with the main page about the controversy and fitted with a redirect. However, as we all want to read about Mr. Chase's fate (is he getting back to work?) later, which will not be really a part of the controversy itself, the page should be kept. <a href="../../../g/b/r/User%7EGbrandt_c34d.html" title="User:Gbrandt">gbrandt</a> 07:32, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does not matter if the pages are linked - we can make it into a redirect to the controversy article. So people coming thru those links will go to that page. And I feel everything related to Mr.Chase is realted to the controversy as well because that is the reason he has become so famous&#160;:-). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJam2k_d176.html" title="User:Jam2k">Jam2k</a> 07:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia doesn't exist to record its own history, so the question is whether Brian Chase matters to enough people that an encyclopedia should have an article about him.

<dd>Perhaps it should. Wikipedia is too big and important now for it to be able to not consider itself part of the informational milieu in 2005.

<p>The article currently claims that "The source of the hoax was uncovered by Daniel Brandt, who used an IP Locator to track down Mr. Chase". However, the article on Brandt suggests that he found Chase due to his company's website being at the IP address he edited Wikipedia from.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this page should absolutely not be deleted. For one, once all the news surrounding this has died down, it is still valuable information. Oftentimes, events and details will be forgotten with the passage of time. By keeping this article, keeping it up-to-date, and retaining the information, we will end up with an article that has more detail. This man deserves to have a wikipedia entry. In fact, I can think of quite a few articles that should end up on the chopping block before this one. It's historical, it's pertinant to any future talk about Wikipedia, and just because it's about some controversy occuring now doesn't mean it shouldn't exist. Ten years from now, do you think people will care about this? I think so. The actions of this man may have far reaching implications in the future. Keeping track of this is important. 160.36.121.50 21:02, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

7. News reports. Wikipedia should not offer first-hand news reports on breaking stories (however, our sister project 
Wikinews does exactly that). Wikipedia does have many encyclopedia articles on topics of historical significance that 
are currently in the news, and can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate 
new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples.

<p>News articles should posted on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a> not on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. Current events qualify as news even if they involve the Wikipedia. This controversy was majorly overblown as the publisher in question could have simply edited the article removing the vandalism and the matter would have been instantly resolved. Instead he used it as a tool to generate publicity for himself and to attempt to discredit the Wikipedia..</p>

<dd>While I don't side completely with Seighetler, your (i.e. SusanLarson) post above suggests you have completely failed to follow the controversy. There are well publisised reasons why he did not edit the article himself. If you aren't aware of them, a little reading of wikipedia would help you to better understand the situation. Also your opinion that the issue was overblown is irrelevant. Whether or not the issue was overblown does not significantly effect it's notability. Personally, although Seighetler was not a good spokesperson, he raised a very relevant issue which many of use Wikipedians have been aware of for a long time and it's disapponting to me that so many wikipedians have apparently failed to understand the issue or why it matters <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 04:36, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to MSNBC, this guy thought that Wikipedia was not a serious reference tool? I just have to say that all of the intelligent people I know use this religiously. It really burns me up that this incident could scar the reputation of Wikipedia. This really is a great tool, a resource of knowledgeable individuals sharing what they know with others.</p>

<p>Is this not proof enough that the new restrictive policy adopted by Wikipedia, which forces contributors to register with wikipedia before they can create a new article, is wrong. Once you are registered there is no way that someone like Daniel Brandt can find out who wrote the article. Making a user name just creates a level of anonymity that does not exist for a non-registered user whose IP address is visible to everyone. I for example would not like to sign this because it is easer for someone to click on my IP address and leave a message on my IP page and that message is visible to everyone who is on the same IP address. But I'll sign it anyway. --08:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC) errr.. I did sign it!!! --156.34.85.70 08:44, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will go over a list of reasons why I believe that this page should not exist. As follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brian Chase is a manager at some kind of delivery service. Distinctly non-notable and doesn't come close to meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></li>
<li>Whilst we could argue that he is notable for being the person who edited Seigenthaler's page and hence has had media attention, there is a great problem with meeting <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> with this article, since we are solely documenting negative aspects of him. Is it possible to write this article as anything other than an attack page? We should not be writing any article anywhere solely as an attack page.</li>
<li>Brian Chase is not a libeller. What he wrote was not libellous, according to my legal opinion, and according to the legal opinion of experts in defamation law, who have commented about this case. At worst, his offence is in stating that Seigenthaler was born in the Soviet Union, but suggesting that that is somehow harmful is rather ridiculous. As for him stating that Seigenthaler shot JFK - this is not true. He didn't write that. What he wrote was that Seigenthaler was once briefly thought to have done it. This is TRUE. Someone, somewhere, with certainty would have thought briefly that he had done it. Considering the amount of conspiracy theories about JFK's murder, and his association with JFK, someone would have done it. Besides which, Seigenthaler did not sue him. In order for us to accurately call him a libeller, he must have been found guilty in a court of law of libel.</li>
<li>Brian Chase is not a hoaxer. What he wrote stayed up for 4 months. A hoax is something that you write and then laugh about and remove immediately. What he wrote is vandalism. It is not <a href="../../../b/j/a/Wikipedia%7EBJAODN_bac2.html" title="Wikipedia:BJAODN">Wikipedia:BJAODN</a> level vandalism and hence not a hoax.</li>
<li>There are some question marks about whether he really did it. Whilst he did confess, there is the chance that we got the wrong IP address, and he just chose to take the fall to end the drama.</li>
<li>It is an invasion of privacy to list such an article about someone like this.</li>
<li>What is written here could be cause for a libel suit filed by Brian Chase against Wikipedia. With the media following this story, this is a very real risk, and it is ridiculously risky for Wikipedia to allow this article under these circumstances.</li>
<li>What he did is nowhere near the worst act of vandalism on Wikipedia. The GNAA regularly runs scripts to produce minor little edits everywhere on Wikipedia. There are people like Willy on Wheels and the communist vandal that have done masses of vandalism to Wikipedia. Yet do they have their own pages? Oh yes, on the admin block logs where they belong. Not in the public area like this.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am extremely concerned about this article remaining. In my opinion, we should not even be stating his name when referring to him. It is legally extremely dangerous for Wikipedia to write something like this. And with a case like this, it wouldn't just be one person being sued for libel, it'd be Wikipedia in total. Its just too risky. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 09:32, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the whole you raised <i>some</i> good points; however Wikipedia is as libel as an ISP; which essentially means they are not libel.

<p>I think it shows incredible arrogance that after more than 150 people have either edited or commented on this topic, a new person comes in and unilaterally effectively deletes it by redirecting it to another subject and when that is undone then somebody else redirects and renames the subject. Neither of these two people had previously been involved in the discussion and they probably did not even bother to read what others had already written about these questions.

<p>Under the rules it is not supposed to be moved or redirected until the AFD is resolved. Therefore, the two people who moved it broke the rules. Therefore, it should be moved back to where it was.</p>
<p>I tried to move it back. The result was that Brian Chase (hoaxer) pointed to Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer) and, at the same time, Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer) pointed to Brian Chase (hoaxer). The result was a stalemate and nothing moved.</p>

<li>This isn't exactly true. A page can be moved during an AFD, provided that the AFD link is updated accordingly, so as not to disrupt the discussion. The article should not be blanked, redirected (because this blanks it), or the AFD notice removed. Other actions are permissible. However, I don't wish to move the page without some agreement as to where it should be moved. And unfortunately, I don't currently have any suggestions. I simply feel that labelling a person as a "hoaxer" for creating a false article on wikipedia under a flawed presumption is, well, somewhat slanderous and PoV.

<p>(Yes, this is somewhat reduntant with the Afd, but I'm assuming we're headed straight toward "no consensus" there.) Since the only content in this article is about his involvement in the John Seigenthaler thing, how about merging this there? Sorry for redirecting previously without discussion; it seemed like the obviously right thing to do to me. To me, the question is, does this guy have "notability" (or verifiability, if you prefer) outside the Seigenthaler affair? It looks like the answer is no, so he should be mentioned in that article, as he already is, and he does not need his own article. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:48, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article should be separate because what Chase did makes him nottable,. His actions, judging by the papers, is far the biggest thing that has happened to wikipedia, and this makes him nottable.

<dd>Thanks. So, the best argument we have so far is based on his potential to become a public figure. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, so why don't we merge for now, and if/when he becomes a public figure and we have verifiable facts NOT related to the Seigenthaler thing, he gets split off into his own article again? This is the way things are normally done, and it generally works just fine. Keep in mind, this is Wikipedia, not Wikinews, and people who are players in a newsworthy event don't automatically need their own articles independant of that event. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:54, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not much has changed. The merge is still IMO the completely obviously right thing to do. However, I'm glad to have, for the first time, an argument for not merging that is NOT related to the Afd. This argument runs contrary to WP:NOT, though. But at least it's not the same invalid "the Afd permanently prevents normal article editing" argument. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:56, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At best, that is a gross oversimplification of my argument*S* (plural). Moreover, the paragraph of unique content that I added to the Brian Chase article was deleted by <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> who dismissed it as "nothing but editorial comment," reminding me of why I limit my contributions to Wikipedia, prefering to publish my content on other venues where I have more editorial control and a vested interest in quality control.

<p>Whilst this guy obviously released his name voluntarily to the press, and hence reprinted it is valid, I question whether we really should be releasing his private details in this article. I made a "bold" removal there on that basis, as it is not necessary in establishing the facts of the article, and only serves to invade his privacy and potentially set him up for further personal distress (and also potentially to legal problems for Wikipedia for doing that - if breaking the law is relevant to people here). If you really strongly disagree, then put it back in, but please provide reasons. Note that this guy didn't defame Seigenthaler. He allegedly defamed him. We cannot say that he did (or libelled, or slandered) until it is proven in a court of law. Also, we should note that there is no absolute proof that he did it. Okay, he confessed, but there is a very real chance that this is a false confession. So just be careful there. Even if you think that this article is sufficiently notable for its own entry, and you personally believe that it will still be notable next week (who knows, it might be!) the legal concerns for having this article in existence is very strong.

<p>What Chase did is vandalism. this is the common usage word for that kind of behaviour so it is important that that is how it is described in the article. Hence my changes, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 00:20, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. At this point, we are not allowed to read what Brian Chase actually wrote. Also, it seems that Seigenthaler really did know Robert Kennedy and probably John F. Kennedy personally. Thus, it is possible that Brian Chase had some basis for believing whatever it was that he wrote. Until we are allowed to see what he actually wrote, suggestions that this was a hoax, a prank or even vandalism are just speculations. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Sloan_b1e5.html" title="User:Sam Sloan">Sam Sloan</a> 04:50, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So I'm going to redirect this (again). There was no "consensus to keep", there was merely no consensus to delete, and I'm not deleting anything. A merge is a form of keep. Having an article that just restates the contents of another article is stupid and counterproductive. Find me a single fact that's in this article that's not at the Seigenthaler controversy page (and if you can then add it to that article, don't revert this one). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:56, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The consensus was to keep." Bullshit. I urge you to look up what a consensus is. Less than half the votes were to keep (many of them invalid, by the way). If 50% is a consensus then we're going to start seeing a lot more AFDs closed with consensus to delete. To quote the closer: "this does not provide an overwhelming keep vs. merge consensus." In any case, it doesn't take an AFD to merge an article. They can be done at any time, and <i>should</i> be done with any article that is 100% redundant. The people who voted to keep got their way.

<p>Holy crap, that must be the longest AFD in history. Anyway my two cents is that there is no clear consensus either way. I'd be inclined to keep by default for now, and maybe revisit this in a couple of months when things have died down and we gain some perspective with another AFD.

<p>A redirect is the right thing to do here in my opinion. It's not going against consensus to make an edit to an article after it's been Afd'd. No one has given a reason why not to merge it in the couple days that the suggestion has been on the talk page.

Why are people talking about the Afd instead of <i>talking about the article</i>?!?!? The Afd was pointless, and it've over now. Can we get back to making an encyclopedia? No one has addressed the points about why this shouldn't have its own article. He's a player in a larger controversy, and that's all we know about him.

<p>The Afd was not pointless. That is your interpretation. The consensus was to keep, which means people want the article.

<dd>Yes, "pointless" is just my opinion, sorry. The Afd was closed as a "keep", although it was most accurately a "no consensus".

<dd>The one redirect I made during the Afd was a bad idea; I've admitted that. It was promptly reverted, and I didn't do it again. I already said sorry for doing it in the first place; I should have known it wouldn't fly while the Afd was happening. The second redirect I did was after the Afd was over, so I see nothing wrong with it. There's nothing about an Afd that is meant to prevent people from making edits to the article after it's over; that would be bizarre and unworkable. I don't think doing a redirect again a few days later should be described as "repeatedly redirecting", particularly when I made an argument in favor of a merge on the talk page a couple days before. Nobody gave a reason why the merge shouldn't be done. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:44, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You are wrong, as usual. Many users have given good reasons why the two articles should not be merged or redirected. Have you even bothered to read the lengthy discussions about this? Here is one especially good example from a user in Germany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This page is linked from outside, for example from one of the biggest German news magazines (Der Spiegel) in articles about the controversy. If Mr. Chase does not merit an article himself (and there are people with more interesting bios), it should at least be merged with the main page about the controversy and fitted with a redirect. However, as we all want to read about Mr. Chase's fate (is he getting back to work?) later, which will not be really a part of the controversy itself, the page should be kept. gbrandt 07:32, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not the best reasoning, really. It even says "it should at least be merged with the main page about the controversy and fitted with a redirect", which is exactly what happened. I'm sure whether he does get his job back is of interest to no one except himself, his family and friends, and some wikipedians, who are the only ones interested in this guy, and a note as to whether he does get his job back would be fine to include in the controversy article. What would it take, 4 additional words? "He was later rehired" or "he was not rehired". Hardly worth a separate article. In fact, 170 votes basically say that this should not be a separate article (187 if you count the "keep and merges", and I haven't checked to see if the many "keep or merges" that were listed under "keep" for whatever reason wre counted as such). There is not really any good reason for this not to be redirected.

<p>Brian Chase is the subject of a front page article in the New York Times, plus articles in Der Spiegel, BBC News and many other major media around the world. Thus, he has become a public figure, a media personality.

<dd>I don't know how you can say that a redirect to a better, more complete article is an attempt to "bury" anything. I'm not trying to "bury" anything. I certainly think everyone who considers themself a serious contributor to wikiepdia should read about this and see what happens when wikipedia bites off more than it can chew. And please point to a news story, <i>any</i> news story, that is about Chase and not about the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a>. The controversy is what is notable, and, had I been around for its AFD, I would have voted to keep it. Now, has Chase made any public appearances? Or even any public statements beyond his confession/apology? Has he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor or anything? When he does, we might <i>start</i> to make a case for a separate article, but even then, everything will still be in reference to the greater controversy. When he writes a book about his experience (or anything else) and it becomes a bestseller, then we will have a good reason for a separate article. But still no one has given <i>any</i> good reason why an article that 100% repeats the content of another article is even slightly beneficial. Can you explain why it is? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:33, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well wait a week and put another Afd on it, expressing your reasons. I don't think this article should be repeated at Siegenthal, and when it is unlocked I will edit that article to make sure there is no duplication. It seems to me the real problem at the moment is that that article is locked, and hopefully will be unlocked soon. A lot of people have argued to keep the article, more than argued for any other position on the Afd, and we need to respect that, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:41, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>And in principle I agree with you, but it seems to me that this is a case where a separate article is justified because I do believe he is nottable enough, and that the community consensus backs this. It is certainly possible to Afd an article asking for it to be redirected. i did this to an article the other day, not because I couldn't have done the rediurect myself but because I thought the input of other editors would be valuable in deciding whether or not the article should be an article of its own in the mainspace or not, so I would say you could do an Afd asking for it top be made into a redirect, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:52, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well that's not what AFD is for. It's called Articles for <b>deletion</b>, after all, and such nominations usually get a "what did you bring this here for?" at some point. Redirects are best addressed through discussion pages, as well as merge templates, and, if need be, RFCs. In any case, I have no desire to reopen that can of worms by even mentioning this article at AFD again. I'm still waiting for a reason why a redundant article is necessary. I'll add a merge template to this article and see what that does. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:59, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well that has never been my experience of Afd, indeed in my exoperience Afding for a redirect is entirely legitimate. A merge request is fine. My argument is that he is nottable enough to have an article given the enormous impact his actions have had on wikipedia. certainly in the UK they have given wikipedia a publicity impetus which wikipedia has never had before, and it is a genuine story. There is the issue of whether he is going to lose his job, as I heard he resigned in embarrassment, and I am sure we can improve the article rather than redirecting it, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 18:06, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to weigh in here as well.

Actually, it's already all but duplicated there anyway. The subject of this article isn't inherently notable; vandalizing a wikipedia article does not make a person notable. I do grant may be worthwhile to leave the article for now and make a decision in a few weeks, after the press dies down a bit. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 21:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is part of what Brian Chase wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a> Robert Kennedy in the early 1960's. For a brief time, he was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John, and his brother, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kennedy_cde1.html" title="Robert Kennedy">Bobby</a>. Nothing was ever proven."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is a fact that John Seigenthaler Sr. was the Assistant Attorney General under President John F. Kennedy. It is also a fact that just about everybody of significance in the entire world has been at one time or another accused of involvement in the Kennedy Assassination. Therefore, it might be true that somebody, somewhere said that John Seigenthaler Sr. was involved. Brian Chase covers himself by stating "For a brief time, he was thought to have been directly involved". I suspect that he can provide some source, however unreliable, for this assertion.</p>
<p>Next, John Seigenthaler Sr. says that although this had been posted for four months, he did not know about it. I doubt that this is true. Pop the name John Seigenthaler Sr. into any search engine, and the Wikipedia biography will come out on top. So, he probably did know about it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, rather than simply delete the false statements in the article, as he easily could have done, he wrote to the founder of Wikipedia demanding that the entire article be deleted. Since John Seigenthaler Sr. clearly is a public figure, this demand was refused for a time, and properly so.</p>
<p>Finally, John Seigenthaler Sr. chose to write an article about it in USA today. So, it is clear that he chose to publicize the incident rather than quitely remove it. I know that I had never heard of John Seigenthaler Sr. prior to this incident and I doubt that many other readers had. He has become famous or at least more famous, because of this controversy.</p>

<dd>I, too, question Seigenthaler's choice to publicize the vandalism of his Wikipedia article rather than simply quietly see to its removal through the powers that be. Clearly, he had something to prove about how wicked-da-pedia is. However, that issue has nothing whatsoever to do with the article about Brian Chase, who -- incidentally, would properly be described by an article entitled "Brian Chase (Wikipedia prankster)." Should not the discussion about Seigenthaler's self-aggrandizing publicity be moved to the Talk page of one of the Seigenthaler articles? // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 19:43, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can say with certainty that it is true that *SOMEONE* once thought that he was involved. As you say, everyone involved with JFK was at one point suspected. There were hundreds if not thousands of people who were suspected.</p>
<p>The only libellous thing was saying that Seigenthaler was born in the Soviet Union. That is untrue. However, suggesting that that could hurt his reputation at all is silly. Its factually inaccurate, but it doesn't hurt him.</p>
<p>If I put in to someone's article "He was once briefly thought to be gay" then its not libellous. Its the same kind of thing. Practically everyone at some point has been accused of being gay. It is probably non-notable and not appropriate for the article, but its not libellous. There's a difference.

<dd>I, for one, certainly oppose just "vandal". That's very misleading, and far from neutral. If I saw that I'd expect the article to be about a guy who trashed cars or something, not wrote a joke article which some users (for some reason) have actually defended as being mostly true. Self-reference is not a problem in this occurance; anyone who says it is is misinterpreting the guidelines. Wikipedia can be mentioned in wikipedia. If not Jimbo's article would be a very strange read, as it tried to dance around what he's famous for, without mentioning it. I imagine if there was another famous Jimmy Wales with an article his would be called "Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia founder)" without any problem. It's not like the article says "Why don't you check out a few other articles we have here at the Wikipedia?" which <i>is</i> the sort of self-reference we want to avoid. We needn't start mentioning "The-online-encyclopedia-who-must-not-be-named". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:55, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, what he put really wasn't a "hoax", so to call him a hoaxer is wrong. Second, Wikipedia is not self-referential, so having "Wikipedia" in the title is probably not good either. I don't think vandal is POV, I think it is factual. Someone who vandalises is a vandal. There is no POV in stating facts. What about Brian Chase (guy who puts misinformation on Internet sites)?

<p>Since AFD is <i>not</i> for settling merge issues, bringing the issue there is stupid. As the vote on deletion resulted in no consensus, the article was obviously not deleted. The merge issue is unsettled, despite claims by a few editors (some with a couple weeks worth of contributions) that there was some sort of consensus that the article not be merged. So let's just have a vote here. Majority rules. This is <i><b>NOT</b></i> about deletion, so people, <i>please</i> leave all spurious arguments about deletion, AFD, etc at home.

<p>(please keep this about <i>content</i> not about AFD)</p>
<p><b>Arguments for merging</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article is completely redundant, all the information is already included at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy</a></li>
<li>Having multiple articles that repeat the exact same material is detrimental to the project. Done on a large scale is greatly increases the number of articles that need to be monitored for vandalism, without adding anything to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>The event was started by Seigenthaler himself. If not for his involvement, this would have been run-of-the-mill hoaxing that happens every single day and we'd never know who did it. (This is really a response to the "don't merge" argument #5, rather than a reason to merge.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Arguments for a having separate article</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure is notable enough to warrant an article.</li>
<li>Consensus of the AFD discussion was to keep the article, not merge. I question the statement that Afd's are not for redirecting as it is anopther form of deletion.

<dd>R. fiend: Perhaps it's a case of the pot calling the kettle black, but other Wikipedians have rebuked you for your rather contentious personal style on your User Talk Page, so I think it's safe to say that said other Wikipedians would object to your snide parenthetical comment to Squeakbox that "Perhaps it's just your 'opinion' that Brian Chase exists at all." As set forth in my comment below, which you pre-empted with your comment, I agree with Squeakbox. To wit, the data Friday used to reach his/her opinion was heavily filtered and is now stale. Moreover, assuming, <i>arguendo</i>, that said heavily filtered and stale data was wholly correct, it would be Friday's opinion (and apparently yours as well) that the portent of that data was a plurality in favor of a merge. The only way to know for sure is to get a new vote with the same participants stating their current preferences, but (as I set forth below) said participants probably consider the issue resolved. To that end, it is incumbent on those (such as yourself) who wish to disturb the <i>status quo</i> by appealing to a questionable interpretration of stale data to hunt down said participants and have them set forth their current preferences rather than putting words in their mouth. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 20:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So the only way to know what the result of the first vote was is to have a second vote on that vote? I didn't put words in anyone's mouth. If they voted <b>merge</b>, as many did, that's their words, not mine. No one said "most wikipedians want this merged"; Friday and I both merely said that, at the last vote, more legit users voted to merge than any other choice. That is a fact (you could argue about what a legit voter is, but it certainly never includes anons and people who create accounts for the sole purpose of voting on an AfD; do your own count if you you question this one). Nor does one need a vote or a consensus to merge, any more than one needs a vote or a consensus <i>not</i> to merge. The "status quo" is superfluous. The status quo was disturbed by the creation of the article in the first place. I honestly am not overly concerned with the AfD vote; I just find it odd that those who said "well more people voted to keep than to merge so we <i>have</i> to keep as a separate article" suddenly are backpedalling when it is revealed that more people voted to merge than keep. Suddenly it's "oh, that old vote? That doesn't matter." You're right, exactly how people voted at AfD is not the issue; it's the people who want a separate article who made it one. In any case, we are having a second vote here; there is no need to try to get everyone who voted the first time involved, nor should we try to. I said we'd have a vote, majority would decide, and no one objected; those that voted gave their tacit approval, implying they would honor the result. Squeakbox said it should go for a week. At the end of a week (yesterday) the vote was tied. Rather than do sudden death and claim victory for the mergers (who are now ahead by one), I think we should extend this another week. The fact that a very partisan summary of the situation was posted for a week at RfC could be made an issue of, but I'm not going to make a stink about it. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:50, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As set forth above, the best that the pro-mergers could claim in re the AfD would be the need for a runoff vote, and the best that they might be able claim now is a simple majority that was achieved after most people who were involved in the initial vote considered the issue resolved.

<dd>Oddly enough, I went back to review the comments accompanying the AfD, and I noticed that my original vote was "Strongly Undecided." As I am no longer "undecided, " I guess that means that the purported plurality alluded to by Friday and R. fiend can now be changed to 83 for merge and 80 for keep.

<p>Reason #1 for not merging sure looks wrong to me, based on the content of this article being exclusively about the Seigenthaler affair. #2 is based on a misunderstanding of Afd.

<dd>And if I may comments about reason 3, obviously we can't remove all the redundant information from the article, he's part of the controversy and has to be mentioned in it.

<p>Well, FWIW, the "future significance" argument WAS given by someone else on this very talk page. Maybe it should be reworded more neutrally instead of removed altogether?

<p>My comments on the "arguments for merging". #1 is a strawman. The redundancy exists only because those who argue for a merge have created it. This issue could easily be resolved by removing the redundant information from the Seigenthaler article. Argument #2 is redundant to #1. #3 is factually incorrect. Seigenthaler may have started to controversy, but Chase was the one who committed the act that led to the controversy. Ergo, that is actually an argument in favor of a separate argument, not against it. The only question of any relevance is whether or not Chase is sufficiently notable to warrant an article and there is no question about that. The fact that he's mentioned in the Seigenthaler article is evidence that he's notable. Oh, and the most important issue of all is that this <b>has already been decided</b>. This latest to-do is just a bunch of people who didn't like the way the last vote came out looking for another bite at the apple. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 01:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and to the person(s) who keep claiming that there was no consensus against the merge... I direct you to the above section entitled "AFD is closed". The final vote tally was Keep: 146, Delete: 46, Merge: 124. That seems, to me at least, to indicate a clear consensus that the article is to be kept and not deleted or merged. --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 01:48, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then I advise you to look at the wikipedia guidlines for what constitutes a consensus. &lt;50% is <i>never</i> sufficient. In addition, yes, one could remove the redundant information, but it would serve no purpose. It would weaken both articles. One could turn any article into 4 or 5 by turning every proper noun mentioned therein into a separate article. All that does is aid wikipedia in the race to one million "articles".

<dd>Come on, Friday! I think I have explained my reasoning on many occasions. The Afd voted to keep, and within that Afd were many reasons for keeping. Personally I think what Chase did combined with what Seigenthaler did has made a difference. Look at the way the amount raised goes so much faster than last time. Wikipedia has become so much more mainstream because of this event, and certainly in a country like the UK I reckon several times as many people now know no of wikipedia than did before because of its mainstream media coverage for the first time ever. The fact that Chase did it by hoaxing (which IMO is a misnomer as the common word is vandalism) itself has enormous implications. What Chase did is, IMO, pretty crap but lots of people who have articles are notable for having done bad things which have had a profound effect on society or bits of it and I would certainly categorise Chase as such a person, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:28, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The <i>only</i> information we have on him relates to the controversy and is <i>already covered in that article</i>. His info is only relevant in the context of the controversy. If he records a hit record next year, he'll need his own article then, but let's wait and see if that actually happens, alright? Also, nobody is talking about "overruling a vote".

<dd>Um, Friday, I think I understand that this is an issue of organization. Some people want to take the information in this Chase's article and put it in the article about the controversy as a whole (redirecting this one to the main article). Other people want to keep Chase's information in a separate article under his own name and create a link to it in the "controversy" article. Is that correct? Now, the way I see it, a vote was taken and the people who want to keep the article separate outnumbered the people who want to merge it. This brings me to the part of this that I admit I don't really understand: <b>Why are some people still trying to argue that this issue hasn't been settled?</b> How can this continued debate by the "merge faction" be seen as anything other than sour grapes?

<p>Though I supported having the "Brian Chase" article merged with the Seigenthaler controversy article, the fact that it isn't is no problem to me. However, I think I know how all these prolonged discussions could have been avoided. When the AFD was held, it should have had 2 questions, 1)Delete the article or, 2)Save the article. If the majority was Save the article then a second Vote should have been taken on weither or not to merge, 1) merge article with Seigenthaler controversy article or, 2)leave article stand alone. The questions in each Vote should have been clear cut YES or NO, (Black or White, no grey areas).

I checked the edit history of nearly everyone who voted, and read what they actually said, not just the section under which their votes were placed. I discounted all anons, users with fewer to 50 edits anywhere in wikipedia, and any user who had no edit history before Dec 11 (the date the article was created and nominated), which removed many votes on all sides (and keep in mind this is still pretty inclusionary; many admins require months of contributions, and a more substantial history). I got the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep: 79</li>
<li>Delete: 31</li>
<li>Merge: 83</li>
<li>Keep or merge: 20</li>
<li>Delete or merge: 8</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a plurality for merging, a sizeable majority if the "keep or merges" and "delete or merges" are included as merges. 36% voted that there should be an article at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_%28Wikipedia_hoaxer%29_8987.html" title="Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)">Brian Chase (Wikipedia hoaxer)</a>, and there should be no redirect. Far from a majority, even further from a consensus. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:40, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. It sure looks like merging had considerable support. It's also got support here on the talk page, of course. I'd be inclined to apply the redirect right now if I hadn't already been reverted a few times on that. As soon as folks are willing to say they won't revert it, I think the redirect should be put back in place. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:21, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, 1) its my fault if the number count was "improper" (why I tend to avoid closing AFDs) 2) with an AFD this contested, I feel we should basically lock this article... and put up an RFC on the subject of merging. We should should probably also limit that RFC to users with more than 50 edits. I think this should be relisted come <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, 2006.

<dd>The AfD is not contested. You quite properly closed it with no consensus to delete. No sane person would have done otherwise. The controversy as it exists at Articles for <b>Deletion</b> is settled. It was not deleted. That is not the issue. If anyone wants to do an RfC, that's fine with me, I just didn't want to go through the bother; a vote here should be sufficient. I really <i>don't</i> want to rehash a similar debacle that we saw at the AfD, with anons and socks descending on the issue like vultures. Here, so far, we have not had that problem. The problem is we have some admins who insist that keep and merge votes are identical, while some users seem to believe that a merge is equivalent to a delete. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact that some editors in this debate are admins and others aren't clearly has zero importance to this debate as the admin functions have nothing to do with one's ability or judgement, and nor do the functions enhance the judgement or editorial capacity of the editors here who happen to be admins, but who are disbarred from using those extra admin functions in this article by having contributed as editors. I suggest we give the debate here a week and if there is no clear consensus (as right now) we take it to Rfc, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>These votes are not decided by majority rule. If every page were kept or deleted by majority rule, then there would be almost no pages left on Wikipedia. Right now, by your count, 79 people voted to keep this page. That is an exceptional number by any computation.

<dd>No! You haven't! Stating the same few words over and over again is not an argument at all, much less a satisfactory one. <i>How</i> is it deletion if no information is removed, and no articles are deleted? What exactly, specifically, is being deleted? If it is deletion, then something must be deleted. <i>What is deleted when a redirect is made?</i> I don't know how I can ask this question in any more simple terms. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:40, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right now if I (as an uninterested party) want info on Brian Chase and type it into wikipedia I get this article. Nice, clean, straightforward. If it was a redirect I would get a Seigenthaler article which |I wopuld have to wade through to then find the info on Chase. In that sense I think there are too many redirects, and really should start changing any inappropriate ones I find (what links to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html" title="Internet slang">Internet slang</a> would be a good place to start. Besides he is notable enought o have a separate article distinct from Seigenthaler. Ultimately that is my editorial judgement based on my thoughts about wikipedia, and I clearly have editors who agree with me, and editors who don't. I think to claim I and others who argue for a separate article have not givenm arguments as sound as those given by the redirect camp is simply not true so don't expect any more arguments unless some new people turn up who might have something new to say. i have said wehat I have said and that is my argument. I am waiting to see how many more people agree with me and how many don't.

<p>As for the RFC idea, it wouldn't hurt to get more opinions, but I'm not sure it's neccessary either. There's growing consensus for the merge already. I'm beginning to think there would never have been opposition to the merge if it hadn't been for the Afd. Afd's are bad enough in and of themselves. When they start preventing normal editing after they're over, something is seriously wrong. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:52, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the "growing consensus" is more aptly described as shrinking patience on the part of those Wikipedians who have already expressed their opinions on the matter clearly and succinctly. To wit, there was and is a distinct and insular group of noteworthy Wikipedians who favor keeping the Brian Chase article as a separate article rather than redirecting it to another article where the content about Brian Chase will be lost in a sea of information. By virtue of his involvement in the Wikipedia edit read round the world, Chase became a fifteen minute newsmaker and subsequent events have made him a <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_public_figure.html" title="Limited public figure">limited public figure</a> as noteworthy as <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norma_McCorvey_478c.html" title="Norma McCorvey">Norma McCorvey</a> (better known by her <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Roe_6797.html" title="Jane Roe">Jane Roe</a>). As evidenced by this very discussion, Chase has had a profound impact on Wikipedia and become the center of an ongoing controversy involving the issue of what qualifies private persons as <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_figure.html" title="Public figure">public figures</a>. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 16:51, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>For expecting rational discourse from you, perhaps I am. Nonetheless, as insane as it may seem, I will direct your attention to the well-established Wikipedia policies that prohibit hyperbolic exhortations such as yours. To wit, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_attacks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">No personal attacks</a>, you will find clear instructions on how to comment on content rather than a contributor. Ironically enough, I (personally) consider this policy to be very misguided, as I am well known on several other venues for having a poison pen, and this policy prohibits me from responding to your personal attack the way that I might otherwise be able to do.</dd>

<dd>Given the tenor of the present exchange, I will respectfully decline to throw pearls before swine. Suffice it to say that any fool who is following the ongoing media and blog/blawg coverage of Wikipedia -- certainly a contentious Wikipedian who dismisses opposing views with questions about the sanity of other contributors -- should be able to find extensive discussion about Brian Chase in the media and in the blogosphere/blawgosphere. On this note, I am presently compiling a commentary on said stories for publication on another venue where I have a vested interested in quality control and editorial content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia's coverage of legal topics is particularly scant, and its coverage of defamation law is no exception. To wit, the only coverage that Wikipedia currently has regarding what qualifies a private person as a <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_public_figure.html" title="Limited public figure">limited public figure</a> is the larger article regarding <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_figure.html" title="Public figure">public figures</a>, which directs people to the article about <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Rakolta_782f.html" title="Terry Rakolta">Terry Rakolta</a> as its only example. Given that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, et al. consider themselves private persons who have had their privacy violated by Wikipedia, coverage of limited public figures who are at the center of Wikipedia controversies should be expanded rather than hidden in articles about public figures such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._a659.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr.">John Seigenthaler Sr.</a> // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 20:46, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh get off the high horse. Anyone who thinks Chase is as notable as Rosa Parks is either insane or downright stupid. I decided to give you the benefit of the doubt. If that's a problem maybe next time I won't. I'm sure if Chase dies at the age of 92 he'll lie at the Capitol rotunda before burial. All he did was post a hoax, just as thousands of people do every day, only his became notable, and is thus covered under the controversy. If his identity were never discovered his influence would have been exactly the same. Would we then have an article for IP address 65.81.97.208? According to some arguments, I guess we would. And your response to my inquiry about this discussion about what constitutes a public figure addressed nothing at all. First you say some blogs are talking about Chase (I'm sure they are. Fantastic. Though I bet not one is talking about him outside of his role in the controversy), then you say Wikipedia doesn't have adequate coverage on the subject of limited public figures. All I see there is a non-sequitor. I'm not going to go on a google hunt trying to find some guys posting in a message board arguing about whether Chase is a "public figure", a "limited public figure", or a "private person". If there's some great debate thats noteworthy outside of a chatroom, point it out. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 21:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. I believe that Rosa Parks is an excellent example. Rosa Parks did absolutely nothing to become famous. All she did was not move to the back of the bus. Many Blacks, before and since, have done the same thing. None of them became famous. Nobody has ever heard of them today. It was just a fantastic historical accident that Rosa Parks became famous for not moving.</dd>
<dd>Brian Chase at least did something. He posted a hoax on Wikipedia and then he admitted it and apologized. It may not have been much, but at least it was something. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Sloan_b1e5.html" title="User:Sam Sloan">Sam Sloan</a> 01:19, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>So Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat, leading to a bus boycott that was one of the most substantial elements of the Civil Rights movement, changing, if not the world, then at least the US, is on par with a guy who wrote something as a joke, and, as a result, made Wikipedia a little more willing to make people take 3 seconds to register before beginnig a new article? And those two things are supposed to be equivalent? Nevermind that Rosa Parks is a recognizable name to the vast majority of semi-eduacted Americans (I bet, taking a random sample of 100 Americans, not one would identify this Brian Chase), this comparison is ludicrous. Maybe I should write an article on Mike Richard, because his trolling led to major changes at www.stiffs.com.

<dd>Strangely enough, I was riding a bus in Austin, Texas on the 50th Anniversary of Rosa Parks Day (December 1st, 2005) when a woman of color riding on that same bus saw an announcement of that fact and asked, "Who's Rosa Parks?" Other than me, only the bus driver seemed to have any real knowledge of Rosa Parks' claim to fame, much less the facts of her life beyond that particular claim to fame. And yet, virtually every educated person I know (i.e., ranging from "some college" to advanced college degrees) has clipped newspaper articles about Brian Chase and shared them with me during the last month. All of these educated people have asked me for more information about Brian Chase, and I have directed them to this Wikipedia article, only to find that this article has yet to be fleshed out and that a handful of pompous Johnny-come-lately Wikipedians who just achieved administrator status about three months ago are waging a misguided campaign to see this article eliminated as a separate entry in Wikipedia. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 03:52, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I suppose if I was a Texan or if I was talking exclusively about Texans when I referred to educated people, them 'ed be fighting words. However, I am a native of Los Angeles, both of my parents are Yankees, and my anecdote about Rosa Parks Day was only a passing reference to Texas, where I happened to be passing through on December 1st, 2005. To wit, Austin, Texas, a liberal college town which is the capital of Texas with a population made up largely of carpetbaggers who come there to get educated at the University of Texas at Austin (with an overall U.S. News and World Report ranking of 52 out of 120 for national universities). In fact, I was in Austin on the eve of the 2004 election, and I could not find one person who had ever voted for President Bush. Go figure.</dd>
<dd>Simply put, as an Internet consultant who works primarily with attorneys, my work takes me to major metropolitan areas all over the United States and Canada -- Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, Salt Lake City, Denver, Austin, Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, New York, Toronto, . . . etc. -- and most of my friends and clients are published authors who hold advanced degrees from a wide variety of universities -- Harvard, Columbia, Berkeley, Stanford, Chicago, . . . etc. Among said friends and clients, the jury is still out on Wikipedia because they perceive it to be a bastion of anonymous alias-wielding trolls who need not bring any bona fides to the table, although most of my friends and clients do see the potential of the extremely open wiki publishing format. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 16:44, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although there was no question mark punctuating that sentence, I will assume it to be a question, and it is a question that I have already answered more than once on this very Talk page.

Even so, the issue of Brian Chase's emerging role as a limited public figure is one that I am researching for my own purposes, and this particular Talk page discussion is one where I have decided to delurk temporarily in the hopes that the publication of my carefully considered words will prevent louder, shriller voices from prevailing. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 16:44, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey, thanks for reminding me (once again) why I limit my contributions to and involvement with Wikipedia. To wit, without the introductory material, the quote make the article look very disjointed, and yet it clearly points out that there is content out there regarding Brian Chase that makes him worthy of his own Wikipedia article. To this end, those who are who so eager to merge and redirect might want to consider the benefit of additional research in re a separate and distinct Brian Chase article in lieu of perpetuating the trench warfare that is this particular discussion. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 19:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, I don't remember asking your opinion regarding quotes in Wikipedia articles, nor do I appreciate your characterization of my content contribution as being an "argument." Rather, it was a fair synopsis of a noteworthy point of view in re a controversial topic that can and should be set forth along with all other noteworthy points of view in re that topic -- i.e., NPOV treatment. The problem that you seem to have with presenting that noteworthy point of view in the article is that it renders any argument contrary to that point of view totally moot. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 19:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wholeheartedly disagree. You were unfairly characterizing my argument with logical fallacies of ambiguity and particularity, ignoring the larger issues of Chase's impact on Wikipedia and what qualifies a private person as a public figure and seizing upon one word (i.e., "emerging") to create a strawman argument that you could more easily dismiss. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 19:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If there's disagreement, I see no harm in leaving the merge tag up for a bit. I doubt there'll be consensus, but you never know. Picking a time when the no-mergers happen to outnumber the pro-mergers and saying, "Look, we've arrived at a decision!" is just plain silly. There were plenty of times when the pro-mergers outnumbered the no-mergers, so saying that the merge has been voted down is a bit of a stretch. At best, I'd say there's no consensus. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 17:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(ec) Well, I'm not personally inclined to make it a redirect again without some kind of agreement on the talk page; it would just be reverted. My best guess is, what will hapen is something like this: The article won't change much, and 6 months from now, fresh eyes will come by, look at it, and decide that merging is obviously the best solution, and perform the redirect. By then, it'll be obvious to everyone that this guy has no lasting significance outside what's already covered in the other article, and nobody will argue about the redirect.
