<p>Hi, I've just added to the introduction paragraph, I hope it's okay but not sure if it fits the style (should I use the two singles as example of their sound?). Also, how should I go about adding citations? I would like to use the reviews from <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15807/British_Sea_Power_Open_Season/" class="external text" title="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15807/British_Sea_Power_Open_Season/" rel="nofollow">Pitchfork Media</a> but am not sure exactly how to do it as I'm fairly new to this. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDokijic_77a3.html" title="User:Dokijic">Dokijic</a> 11:30, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think it is important, or fair, to include this interview link. If you are going to include an interview link then many, many others should be included. It's not fair to just include one. Best to just leave fansite links on, as there are plently of articles and interviews on those. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyWater_d609.html" title="User:SaltyWater">SaltyWater</a> 12:01, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, because he's a sad person with nothing better to do and has collated a fairly definitive source on the band? And what's so special about that terrible interview?

<dd>In what way is the site possibly at all in any case a rival to mine, or any, British Sea Power fansite? Its just an interview - it serves no purpose in this article.

<dd>Personally I'm not fussed either way. What is it about this interview that makes it worth/not worth including?

<p><i>While the most important part of consensus-building is to thoroughly discuss and consider all issues, it is often difficult for all members in a discussion to come to a single conclusion.....While it is still the preferred method, some contributors have also come to use a supermajority as one of the determinations.</i></p>

<p>OK I see your link but there simply is no other way to resolve this.

<dd>That's for galleries not discographies. Makes it hard to people to use. And what I say goes. But thanks for your time. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyWater_d609.html" title="User:SaltyWater">SaltyWater</a> 17:50, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe include a gallery for the full length albums and EPs, but they have too many singles. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteelyDave_55f8.html" title="User:SteelyDave">SteelyDave</a> 17:52, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well I just keyed in a couple of bands with a few releases and they all use the gallery thing: <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morrissey.html" title="Morrissey">Morrissey</a>, <a href="../../../o/a/s/Oasis_%28band%29.html" title="Oasis (band)">Oasis</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Libertines_ffda.html" title="The Libertines">The Libertines</a>.

<p>I've added <a href="../../../b/r/i/Template%7EBritish_Sea_Power_f812.html" title="Template:British Sea Power">Template:British Sea Power</a> to the member pages. What do you think?

<p>I think I've seen this sentence in every single issue of NME. RSieradzki 01:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
