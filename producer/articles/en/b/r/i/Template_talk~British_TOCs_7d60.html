<p>Is there any reason that the franchises are arranged as they are? There seems to be some bias in terms of the <i>London and South Eastern</i> section - it could be seen to imply that thats the only places where these operators are - should South West trains be here?</p>
<p>Also is this being undermined by the move to multi service level franchises? Should the new Great Western franchise be listed as an InterCity operator given the scale of local services it will have inherited? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan3055_111b.html" title="User:Ian3055">Ian3055</a> 23:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Would London Commuter be a better title - and for Greater Western, when First Group make up their mind about the sector names we might not have a problem - I know the original idea was 'First Great Western Express' for the current FGW, 'Great Western Link' remaining as is, and 'Great Western Local' for Wessex. Still leaves the problem of where to put 'one' <a href="../../../e/n/o/User%7EEnotayokel_530e.html" title="User:Enotayokel">Enotayokel</a> 12:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Without knowing the franchise map like the back of my hand, the particular one which causes me problems is Chiltern, it strikes me that their business is going to be pretty well spread across their route London-Birmingham-Kidderminster/Malvern. I dont know what the answer is just the the current is a bit misleading. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan3055_111b.html" title="User:Ian3055">Ian3055</a> 20:04, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why is 'one' in that list three times? And why is Virgin, which is <i>two franchises</i>, only represented once?

<p>There's been some reverting back and forth over the inclusion of railtour operators, so we'd better reach some sort of conclusion over them. Should they be listed in this template? If so, someone better write some decent articles on them. <a href="../../../b/z/2/User%7EBz2_c22b.html" title="User:Bz2">bz2</a> 21:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I must say I can’t really see any great justification for them to be included, since they aren’t <i>really</i> part of the serious railway system or committed to long-term operations. This template seems to have gone a bit critical in the past few days; I think it’s really a bit excessive to mark open-access operators on the <i>template</i>, since it doesn’t affect their service from a passenger’s point of view and is explained in the articles. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 22:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This template is getting rather unwieldy, and will only become more so with the coming reorganisation of the railway franchises, since First Great Western will be operating in three separate categories (four if you count Heathrow Connect as an airport service). I also think that the details on which are, for example, open-access and government-owned railways do not belong on the template; indicating the sorts of services that companies provide seems useful, but beyond that, the template’s function is to <i>list</i> the companies, while their respective articles give the more involved information.</p>
<p>I also wonder whether Grand Central should in fact be listed, since at present they only have provisional approval, which remains subject to discussions between their managers, the Office of Rail Regulation, and other train operating companies using the East Coast Main Line. What are other people’s views?</p>

<dd>I would say its more difficult to read too. Part of the solution to this maybe to only include operators which are actually running services at any given time, all these forthcoming operators are just getting in the way. The other major problem we have to get over is the division of franchises, First Great Western provides an immediate problem, but with the forthcoming changes to the map its going to get ever more difficult.</dd>

<dd>London and South Eastern has to go in my view, really it is just a subset of Regional, but with an incredible London POV, IMHO. Can we really put Chiltern and Silverlink in that section when they take up parts of the Central franchise? There must be some sensible way to organise these - thinking cap time. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan3055_111b.html" title="User:Ian3055">Ian3055</a> 00:14, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By the time Central gets axed, the only London suburban operators will be pretty much Southern and c2c. All the others will have significant long-distance offerings. What about just splitting out the airport and intercity operators (Virgin, FGW, GNER, TPX, Hull and MML), lumping the rest (including FGW local) into a 'regional' or 'local' group? Oh, and Grand Central and the railtour operators can go.

<dd>One thing that has always struck me is if First TransPennine should really be classed as an intercity operator as much as they market it as one. I've always viewed it as an inter-regional service and not actually more high profile than say Scotrail or Central's express routes, after all the rolling stock used is no more impressive, and Scotrail's sleeper service is often classed as <i>intercity</i>. Plenty of other examples of the problem with classifying into the current structure exist, such as SWT services to Exeter or Southern's express trains to Brighton which would surely be called <i>intercity</i> if were not in the south-east. And since Greater Western is going to include both <i>intercity</i> and local services in the same way that ONE/Anglia already does maybe we should just have a simple list of all TOCs plus international and airport links like <b><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_British_TOC_test_0b90.html" title="User:Achmelvic/British TOC test">this</a></b>? --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 14:32, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looks good. We might as well restore the split between government-run and open access... there's tonnes of space for footnotes. Also, "London airport links" (single capital) looks better, IMO. <a href="../../../b/z/2/User%7EBz2_c22b.html" title="User:Bz2">bz2</a> 14:50, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That looks nice, except that I would remove the 'not franchised' note - I don't think it really contributes enough to the template to justify the extra space it uses. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 17:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That version as it is looks great, there is no need to separate them any further, the numbers of franchises are falling anyway. All I'd say is re the airport links section, should we illiminate the word "London" so as to make provision for any other services? And do we want to include parts of franchised operators separately in the airport section (eg one Stansted or Gatwick Express if its merged into Southern)? But yes, this is a vast improvement. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan3055_111b.html" title="User:Ian3055">Ian3055</a> 17:51, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would list the airport links separately only if they are <i>at least</i> branded separately, if not actually separate companies/franchises; even one’s Stansted Express seems a bit borderline to me. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 19:58, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'd definatly agree that something needs to be done to make the template both simpler and also less open to change, ie so we don't get the situation that have had in the last fortnight or so of it changing almost every few hours, esp as it now appears to have railtour operators included! As it seems that there are enough ppl to keep it up-to-date anyway I'd agree should only include companies actually running trains at that moment, so for dates like 1st April when which franchises change (which don't happen very often anyhow) it can be changed then. Whilst London and South-East does carry much more passenger traffic than rest of the UK, as has been mentioned, the divisions that are used will increasingly become useless for classifying companies. Afterall they are a hangover from the time of the BR sectors which were used for privatisation. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 00:44, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And in case anyone doesn't know, not only are they regulated separately, they are of different gauges and there are a multitude of other differences. It therefore makes more sense to talk of the British system and an Irish system.

<p>I’m inclined to agree to the separation — though in terms of national boundaries Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, as far as the railways go, the systems are British and Irish, and it only confuses things if Wikipedia treats them as a combined unit. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 21:01, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a compromise, I have seperated the GB and NI services on the template. That way, all views are maintained equally - NIR and Enterprise remain on the template (which I think they should), while staying seperate from the GB companies. However, it should be noted that there are a handful of individual branded services listed (Eurostar, Enterprise, Stansted Express) which are owned by other companies and, as such, the two Sleeper services (Caledonian Sleeper, Night Riviera) should also be included. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 23.25 BST, 29 March 2006</p>

<dd>The problem with putting this template in NIR and Enterprise articles is that it assigns <a href="../../../p/o/s/Category%7EPost-privatisation_British_railway_companies_109b.html" title="Category:Post-privatisation British railway companies">Category:Post-privatisation British railway companies</a> to every article that it is placed in and this category is irrelevent (for reasons explained under Northern Ireland above) to those two articles. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 22:35, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, I have added <a href="../../../p/o/s/Category%7EPost-privatisation_British_railway_companies_109b.html" title="Category:Post-privatisation British railway companies">Category:Post-privatisation British railway companies</a> individually to the relevant articles and removed it from the template, which therefore means that the template can now be added to the NIR and Enterprise pages without adding them to the category. However, I have also noted that someone has added <a href="../../../i/a/r/Iarnr%C3%B3d_%C3%89ireann_c8b3.html" title="Iarnród Éireann">Iarnród Éireann</a> to the template. This is incorrect, as IE's only operation in the UK is Enterprise, in conjunction with NIR. Enterprise should be treated the same as Eurostar - that is a train service operated by three companies (LCR, SNCF and SNCB). If Iarnród Éireann is to be on the template, perhaps SNCF and SNCB should be too? Of course they shouldn't, because they aren't British, and neither should IE, because it isn't a British company. Therefore, IE should be removed and just Enterprise listed. Also, someone has rearranged the Stansted Express as one (Stansted Express). If this is acceptable, then why not under the sleeper category <b>First ScotRail (Caledonian Sleeper)</b> and <b>First Great Western (Night Riviera)</b>? <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 09.35 BST, 30/03/06</dd>

<dd>That looks ok, but I at least think that the intercity services (GNER, Virgin, First Great Western etc) should be split from the regional services and that Grand Central Trains should also be included (as it has been definatively announced, unlike the new franchises due for 2007). I also think it would look better if it wasn't centred. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 15.45 BST, 30/03/06
<dl>
<dd>The problem with splitting companies into types is that some belong in more than one, e.g. First Great Western (after 1st April) will be an intercity <b>and</b> regional <b>and</b> London &amp; SouthEast operator, as <i>one</i> already is, so should be in all three groups, hence it'd be better to just have one group for all regular operators IMO. Also there is the arguement that First TransPennine Express doesn't run proper <i>intercity</i> services like, say, GNER but simply a more marketed version of the type of express services run by First Scotrail or Central, basically unlike at the time of privatisation where do you could draw the line between <i>intercity</i> and <i>regional</i> now the former BR sector operations are being broken down and re-merged. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 15:07, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't forget though, FGW, although all part of one company, will still have three seperate brands, which can easily be considered seperate operators. As for 'one', although all services except Stansted Express are branded simply as 'one', it would be possible to categorise their services as one (Anglia) under InterCity, one (West Anglia) under London and one (Great Eastern) under regional. I agree that First TransPennine Express is a borderline case for being classed as an InterCity service (possibly for the main reason that it doesn't use sleek fronted high speed trains&#160;:-P), but you could compare it perhaps more to Virgin Cross Country than either Central or First ScotRail, as it doesn't seem to operate any local services. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 16.40 BST, 30/03/06

<dd>However from the announcement on their website <a href="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/franchise/en/AdynamicNewBrand.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/franchise/en/AdynamicNewBrand.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> they aren't now going to go with the original idea of having three brands, from tomorrow it'll all just be <i>First Great Western</i>. There will be only one article for FGW so we'd have three links in different categories going to the same place, simply adding more clutter to a template that looks over burdened as it is. <i>One</i> only have one <i>One</i> website and there's only one <i>One</i> article on Wiki so should only have one <i>One</i> entry here&#160;;-). And it'll only get worse, for example when the DfT let the proposed West Coast franchise that combines commuter services from Silverlink we'll have the same situation. I'd repeat that the idea of different categories is a leftover from the BR sector days which isn't appropriate to the system we've got today, afterall at privatisation instead of giving it more thought they simply sold off companies in the structure that was in place in at the time. If we start dividing up franchises into sub-groups it's going to become a very cumbersome template. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 08:03, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about then thinking outside the box - rather than the traditional categories we've been assigning (which stem from the old sectors of British Rail), why not come up with some new categories? For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>International: Enterprise, Eurostar</li>
<li>Mainline: Chiltern, GNER, Grand Central, Hull Trains, Midland Mainline, Virgin West Coast</li>
<li>Integrated: First Great Western, one</li>
<li>Cross-Country: First TransPennine Express, Virgin Cross Country</li>
<li>Regional: Arriva Trains Wales, Central Trains, First ScotRail, Island Line, Merseyrail, Northern Ireland Railways, Northern Rail</li>
<li>London Suburban: c2c, First Capital Connect, Heathrow Connect, Silverlink, South Eastern, South West Trains, Southern</li>
<li>Airport Express: Gatwick Express, Heathrow Express, Stansted Express</li>
<li>Sleeper: Caledonian Sleeper, Night Riviera<br />
Then, as more integrated franchises are created, they can be added to the <i>integrated</i> category. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 11.00 BST, 31/03/06</li>
</ul>
<p>Fair enough with adding the template to NIR/Enterprise, I have no problem with this as long as no inappropriate/misleading categories or terminology is used. One thing I would say is that a separate Northern Ireland section maybe unnecessary and just clutter. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 17:42, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, both NIR and Enterprise should be reinstated to the main template, but shown in such a way as to make it clear they are not part of the National Rail network; the same should go for those operators on the National Rail network that are open-access and not franchises, beyond simply putting an asterix by them. <b><a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_British_TOC_test_86f7.html" title="User:Hammersfan/British TOC test">This</a></b> is what I had in mind. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 16.45 BST, 31/03/06

<dd>Whilst I'd still prefer a simpler non-divided template if we were to go with your idea I've slightly adapted your proposal <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_British_TOC_test_3_2a8b.html" title="User:Achmelvic/British TOC test 3">here</a> to make the layout a bit simpler and use less page space, what do people think? I wouldn't bother with the Cross Country section meself, esp as it's a repeat of entries above under Mainline, plus not sure what order the categories should be in? I think the title should make it clear that is only for scheduled service so doesn't include Railtours and in theory heritage lines etc. One problem is that people will keep editing it to what they see as the right structure, have noticed someone has already changed the 'live' version for tomorrow. Ultimatly it needs to come under the remit of the Wikiproject I proposed in the Rail operators article discussion to look into all the UK rail articles and their structure as IMHO they need to be majorily overhauled, all brought up to date and given a more logical setup but that's a much longer term concern. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 19:11, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In that case, perhaps the anonymous editor, who ever he or she is, should think about things a bit more before simply reverting. The template does not feature train operating companies, because the majority are owned by a handful of companies, or are integrated franchises covering more than one sector. What in fact are listed are <b>brands</b> - Virgin Trains is a brand, First Great Western is a brand, one Railway is a brand, GNER is a brand. The "individual train services" that our anonymous reverter seems to have a beef about are also seperate brands - operated by TOCs yes, but branded seperately, and, as such, provided that there is an explanation that they are operated by FGW, one Railway or whoever, should be individually included on the template. That way, we prevent single articles being listed in multiple categories, as we have with FGW (four times) and one Railway (three times). Surely that's better? <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 20.15 BST, 02/04/06

<dl>
<dd>Exactly, we have to stick to brands to a big extent and not start listing owners/operators. After all Virgin Trains is partly made up of Virgin Cross Country which is officially Cross-Country Trains which is owned by Virgin Group and Stagecoach Group, but passengers (oh sorry customers) just know it as VT. Where would we stop? The template as it is now seems the best compromise that we'll get. I'm starting to think we should add a big line at the top asking people not to edit it without discussing reasons here first otherwise we'll just be going round in circle every few hours! --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 19:50, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Precisely. Actually, I'm glad you brought up Virgin Trains, as I had a thought about that - seeing as Virgin operates two franchises under a single brand name, wouldn't it be more logical to include it in the "integrated" category?

<p>This is getting us nowhere; nobody is ever going to agree to anything regarding this template, because people are not willing to compromise, discuss, agree, with the cosequence that we end up with the farce of having three foreign rail companies listed with the UK (not, I hasten to add for the benefit of certain people who won't take no for an answer, British) operators.

<p>The rationale behind this version goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon the privatisation of British Rail, there were clearly three types of franchise: InterCity, London &amp; South East (i.e. the old <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_SouthEast_f2bb.html" title="Network SouthEast">Network SouthEast</a>) and Regional. Nowadays, it is much less clear cut, especially with the creation of 'one' and the new First Great Western franchise (which was formed from one of each of the three types!). It's only going to get worse, with the creation of the new West Midlands franchise etc. I have therefore grouped all of them together as "Domestic" operators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Grand Central Trains doesn't need to be there, as (as far as I know) it's still not 100% clear that they will be operating services at all. If (and when) they do, they can be added into the table.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stansted Express doesn't exist as (and is not branded as) a separate operator, it's part of the 'one' franchise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While it is true that Eurostar has three shareholders (Eurostar UK, SNCF and SNCB), the three don't need to be mentioned individually on the template, as its ownership is explained clearly in the <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurostar.html" title="Eurostar">Eurostar</a> article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The same can be said about the joint IE/NIR Enterprise service.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Complications over which operators are franchised and which are not can be better described in the articles themselves, not on the template. After all, people who are not experts in the precise workings of the railway industry won't know what this means anyway (and we need to remember that such people may be <i>reading</i> these articles!).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I've added a bit of colour. Also, if someone could explain what's wrong with the line spacing in the first box, that would be good.</p>
<p>On some other pages, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_companies_operating_trains_in_the_United_Kingdom_6650.html" title="Talk:List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom">here</a> and <a href="../../../u/k/_/Template_talk%7EUK_Major_Railway_Stations_9d39.html" title="Template talk:UK Major Railway Stations">here</a>, there's a mention of a possible UK Railways <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a>.

<dd>Aye I've been avoiding this template for a week or so since it was just getting silly and very annoying that was constantly changing. Whilst I'd still prefer not to have a division between GB and NI I quite like your proposal, tis kinda like my one <a href="../../../h/e/r/Here.html" title="Here">here</a>. One change that I'd make it to have the title making it clear that this simply for current (ie not Grand Central) scheduled (ie not railtours) operating companies (not owners or seperate services), so I'd try like this (I've removed the spaces before and after the breaks that seems to have fixed the strange line gaps):</dd>

<dd>The only problem is that if that last month or so is anything to go by if you change it to this template certain people will just change it back again and reinclude all the pointless information, call me a cynic.</dd>

<dd>If one of the above proposals were adopted, then it would probably be better to name it as something like "UK TOCs" rather than "British TOCs" - that way, people would not be able to complain about NIR and Enterprise being included with all of the operators on the British mainland. Two other points: I think Grand Central should be included, with a note to say when they start running, as they have been given the official go-ahead from the ORR to start operating. <a href="http://www.grandcentralrail.co.uk/news.html?id=news026" class="external text" title="http://www.grandcentralrail.co.uk/news.html?id=news026" rel="nofollow">This</a> shows that they have begun the final preparation work to begin running services from January. A final point is that I still maintain that all seperately branded services should be included; this includes Stansted Express, Caledonian Sleeper and Night Riviera. I realise that these are not train operators in their own right, and yet people seem to be forgetting that most of the operators on the list are owned by a handful of companies - First Group, GoVia, National Express, Stagecoach and Virgin own the bulk of train operators, operating under different brand names. Why not then these individual services, which are, IMHO, pretty unique in the UK and deserve to be mentioned. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 11/04/06, 13.25 BST</dd>

I still think it would be better to separate out Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as the two have completely distinct railway systems. I'm not convinced about the inclusion of the sleepers either: as is made obvious by how they've been named in the above, they're clearly operated by First Great Western and First ScotRail!

<dd>You're probably right about BAA having influence as regards the seperate branding of Stansted Express, and how it links to both Gatwick and Heathrow Express. I've travelled on the Stansted Express several times, and it does have its own dedicated platforms and ticket areas at Liverpool Street, just as the other two do at Victoria and Paddington. I've put the names of the operators with the sleepers because I think it does need to be made clear that they are services, not operators, the same with Stansted Express. But, just like there should be a seperate section for the dedicated airport express links, there should also be a seperate section for the dedicated sleeper services. As for Grand Central, I will say that this template did, for a long time, and before this whole conflagration started, that the new operators which started on April 1st (First Capital Connect and Southeastern) were included alongside the operators they replaced, with notes to say so. As a consequence, I think it should remain on the template, simply because <b>it is</b> a train operator. It just hasn't started running yet. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 11/04/06, 20.00 BST</dd>

<dd>I don't see the problem with having an operator that doesn't run any services yet. As you say, it is an operator. But by the same reasoning, I think the sleepers should be removed - they aren't operators. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 00:20, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes with Grand Central Trains its just a thing conncerning the titeling. Sleepers and airpot trains shold not be listed since they are clearly not operator and are in contradiction to the title. Otherwise there could be a dozen other onse that are added. This would just make the template messy. And Anyway its not about trains, its about operators.</dd>

<dd>If we are only listing operators and not services and not splitting into service type then there is no reason why Heathrow Express and Gatwick Express should be separated out - and where does Heathrow Connect fit?

<dd>OK, I accept that Grand Central can be included. But as Thryduulf says, if the template is listing operators, not services, we don't need to separately label the airport operators, or include the sleepers. But I don't think that we should label franchised/open-access operators in the template: that's too much information, and it can be better explained in the articles, not in the template. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 09:54, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re: sleepers (I know I keep coming back to it) - if the rationale is going to be operators and not services, then both Eurostar and Enterprise should also be removed, as they are both services run by train operators (NIR and IE for Enterprise, Eurostar UK, SNCF and SNCB for Eurostar). I think, given the special nature of these services, they have a right to be included seperately, as do the three airport express services, given the nature of where they go and what they do. I wouldn't include Heathrow Connect in the airport links because it is a stopping service - the express trains go straight through from their termini to their airports.<a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 12/04/06, 12.35 BST

<dd>By what argument is Eurostar a ‘service’ comparable to the sleepers which ScotRail and Great Western operate? Certainly it is owned by LCR, SNCF, and SNCB, but since none of those companies operate trains in Britain under their own names, I would think Eurostar counts as a jointly-owned operator in its own right - if we were listing corporate parents rather than the companies that people actually see, then the template would list <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Group_1af8.html" title="First Group">First Group</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Express_Group_968f.html" title="National Express Group">National Express Group</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach_Group_dc5f.html" title="Stagecoach Group">Stagecoach Group</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/o/Keolis.html" title="Keolis">Keolis</a>, and the like. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidArthur_daeb.html" title="User:DavidArthur">David Arthur</a> 18:30, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then why not list them like that then? I disagree about Eurostar being classed as a "jointly-owned operator in its own right" - Eurostar is owned by three train operating companies, whether they operate other services in the UK or not. As an operation, Eurostar should be classed in the same way as Enterprise. Do you believe that Enterprise should be classed as a "jointly-owned operator"? In spite of all the arguments, I believe everyone is in agreement that Enterprise is a service - its rolling stock is jointly owned by both IE and NIR, with each owning half. The same is true of Eurostar, with all three companies owning a portion of the rolling stock. And what about Stansted Express? If your rationale is that the sleepers are owned by single TOCs, then do you believe Stansted Express should also be removed? The two sleeper services are unique in the UK, there are no others, and I maintain they should be included. Yes, make the point that they are owned by FGW and First ScotRail, but they are so unlike any other of the services provided by these two operators that I believe they deserve to be listed seperately. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 12/04/06, 21.05 BST

<dd>All I'm trying to do is find some kind of compromise - some people don't believe that the sleepers should be included.

<dd>That's not clear, but including them doesn't do any harm. Re Northern Ireland, to indicate the difference between the Northern Ireland system and the rest of the UK, we could include them in a separate part of the template (as in my original proposal), but that isn't really necessary.

What's been said is exactly right, this a template for operators of scheduled passenger trains in the United Kingdom, nevermind which <i>system</i> they are running upon and ultimatly it's a guide for users to find the articles that will tell the full details of their ownership etc, if the articles don't then we need to update and correct them, not this template which should be a minor thing. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 01:00, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the template scholdn't have any individual services an strictly stick to train operators. Otherwise others not so familiar with the system might think they are operators themselves .</dd>

<p>Having read all the discussion I think the key question that it all boils down to is - what is the scope of this template?</p>
<p>I think most people would agree with the following</p>
<ul>
<li>If the template is for the whole of the UK then NIR and Enterprise should be included.</li>
<li>If the template is for Great Britain then the NIR and Enterprise should not be included.</li>
<li>The present name of the template ("<a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a>") is ambiguous - i.e. it could refer to either:
<ul>
<li>"Of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"</li>
<li>"Of Great Britain"</li>
<li>"Of the British Isles" (see the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> article).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary argument for UK:</p>
<ul>
<li>The United Kingdom is a sovereign political entity and this template should include all parts of it. (Political geography)</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary argument for GB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rail transport developed separately on the Island of Ireland to GB, such that the two systems use different gauges and have never had a common operator. (Physical geography).</li>
</ul>
<p>So we need to decide on what the scope of this template is - i.e. Great Britain or UK. To start off I suggest a straw poll - note that this is to establish consensus on what the scope <i>will be</i>, not what the scope <i>currently is</i>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 12:25, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As an argument for the position I advocate, I'd draw people's attention to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_companies_operating_trains_in_the_United_Kingdom_d505.html" title="List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom">List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom</a> article. Although there is a "split" suggestion there, it has been there for a month, and no one seems now to be advocating that this be separated into seperate articles for Britain and Ireland. Indeed, it seems that, given NIR and Enterprise have not been removed from there, people are happy for them to be included. Given that this template is essentially the template for that article, what's different? <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 26/04/06, 13.15 BST</p>

<dd>I thought we'd come to an agreement on this issue. I did suggest some time ago that, as it is valid to have the NIR services listed on the template, then it should be moved to "UK TOCs". All this template is supposed to do is direct users to articles about those companies that operate passenger trains in the United Kingdom. Or are we suggesting that users of Wikipedia are so ignorant that they won't be able to tell the difference between the services on the island of Great Britain and the island of Ireland simply by reading the articles themselves? <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 20/04/06, 09:35 BST.

<dd>Yes, but the latest thing is seemingly all down to a single individual - those of us who participated in the discussion, to my mind at least, seemed to have reached a consensus that it was valid to have the NI services on the template. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 20/04/06, 11.55 BST -- Also, I've just seen that a certain user who refuses to take part in the discussion has taken it upon themself to create a seperate Irish template in order to - and I quote - "removed stupid irrelevant template".

<dd>Some of us were not around here a year ago, let alone two years ago. It would have been helpful if somebody had informed us earlier that the discussion in 2004 had ever taken place. Also, I don't like the implication that I don't have any common sense: my suggestion above was an attempt to be reasonable. It was trying to account for the facts that (i) Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and (ii) its railway network is distinct from that within the rest of UK (i.e. in Great Britain). As for being part of the "vocal minority", as the straw poll is currently 7/4 in favour of the "Great Britain" basis, it looks like that's what will be used anyway. But I wouldn't say that that basis is at all "obvious", given the reams of discussion on this page (and elsewhere). If it was obvious, there would be nothing to discuss. --<a href="../../../r/f/b/User%7ERFBailey_ef11.html" title="User:RFBailey">RFBailey</a> 15:55, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a majority is in favour of one or other proposal (keep Irish or remove Irish), then all well and good. But arbitrary and unilateral alteration is, in my view and in this instance, unacceptable behaviour, given the amount of debate and effort that has been put in by so many people. And, for the absolute last time, no one here has ever put forward the suggestion that the railways in Great Britain and the railways in Northern Ireland are part of the same network. If you look at the relavent articles, you'll see that note is made many many times of this fact, of the fact that there are seperate gauges, and of the fact that the railways in Northern Ireland are still owned by the state. What is being stated on this template is a list of companies that operate passenger trains in the political entity that some of us call the United Kingdom. Given that many other countries have rail systems of different gauges (admittedly usually owned by the same state corporation), I think that it isn't unreasonable to include the British and Northern Ireland companies on the same template. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 20/04/06, 17.15 BST

<dd>I don't consider 7/4 consensus and was going to wait a couple of days to see if anyone else wants to express an opinion (I've left non-partisan messages on the talk pages of everyone who has commented on this page but not contributed to this discussion informing them about it). If by Sunday it is still 7/4 or even less clear then I suggest we do something else to get more attention - listing at current surveys perhaps. As for the {{<a href="../../../i/r/i/Template%7EIrish_train_operators_daf8.html" title="Template:Irish train operators">Irish train operators</a>}} template, I think creating that before the discussion is over is bordering on <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. If there is consensus for it then its a good name (or at least better than my suggestion) and so we might as well use it.

<dd>Actually I think it does make a good navigation template - there are three clearly linked separate articles that this provides a clean and succinct navigation between.

<dd>The point is though that we all seem to be agreed that, even if it is warranted, it is too soon to be putting it on article pages, since no consensus has been reached about the status of the Irish operators on this template.

<dd>Ermm unless my eyes are deceiving me the current result in the strawpoll above is 9-4! I realise that you seem to be unwilling or unable to add any constructive contributions to this discussion but surely claiming more that 50% extra votes to one side is just beyond 'common sense'. If it is the discussion that was had a few years ago about dividing the structure of articles in Railways in Ireland and Railways in Great Britain that you are talking about a result from then that is not of relevance here. As has been stated NUMEROUS times above we are talking here about THIS template NOT changing the whole structure of railway articles about the UK and Republic of Ireland, a move that no one AFAIK is advocating. --<a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchmelvic_e606.html" title="User:Achmelvic">Achmelvic</a> 20:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are a number of points related to this.

<li>The only person who appears to be on a crusade is you - everybody else is discussing things rationally.</li>
<li>I don't regard 9-4 as consensus. Its a majority but not a consensus.</li>
<li>The previous poll was a completely separate poll over two years ago with a different purpose. Conflating the two is misleading at best.</li>

<dd>While the article makes it clear that the two <b>networks</b> are seperate, it includes both NIR and Enterprise in a single list of train operating companies in the United Kingdom, which is, after all, the basis of the article and the basis of the template. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHammersfan_a9b0.html" title="User:Hammersfan">Hammersfan</a> 26/04/06, 17.05 BST</dd>

<p>This version is a deliberate attempt <i>at a compromise</i>. It has every operator <i>in the United Kingdom</i>, but makes it clear which operate in Great Britain and which operate in Northern Ireland. If, however, the consensus decides that this template should deal only with Great Britain, then the current version (modified 26th April) is fine.

<dd>I'm rapidly getting pissed off with this template as well. However I would be willing to support this compromise version as it shows everything and makes it clear that the two systems are separate. I have added a note that Enterprise is operated by NIR and IE. If there was some logical way to include Iarnród Éireann then there would be no need for the Irish Railways template, which is all-but redundant with this version of thsi template and so there would be no point in having two of them on the Enterprise and NIR articles. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 09:58, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(after edit conflict) This template belongs on the articles of all the operators it includes. That currently includes Northern Ireland. The version I protected is the last version for which there was consensus. Despite the fact there is not yet consensus for whether there should be one or two templates, the discussion is not about a design of template.

<dd>As YET ANOTHER compromise, I have added notes to state that both NIR and Enterprise operate on the Irish network, and that the title is "Operators in Great Britain and Northern Ireland".

<dd>Well, fancy seeing you here laughing boy. What a surprise that you've yet again imposed your own will on things. Why are you so obtuse? Please tell me, no, actually show me, where any one of us on here with the exception of YOU has brought up that the two islands that make up our country have a single railway network? I'm fairly sure that it'll say "we're aware that Great Britain and Ireland have seperate railway networks; that isn't the argument we're putting forward". And, just in case this doesn't penetrate the fog, <b>THIS MEANS WE KNOW GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND DON'T HAVE A SINGLE RAILWAY NETWORK!!!!</b> For absolutely the last, final time, the template is to show the railway companies who operate the passenger services in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. That's the United Kingdom of <b>Great Britain and Northern Ireland</b> in case you're feeling a little slow. And as for consensus, well, one Duncharris doesn't really make a consensus. In fact, until you started throwing your weight around over the last couple of days, we'd had a nice period of stability. It had been peaceful not to have to keep checking back to ensure that this template hadn't been vandalised. As for my "crusade", I'm fairly sure you started all of this off, so the crusade is on your head.

See the first sentence of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Great_Western_5266.html" title="First Great Western">First Great Western</a> article - "First Great Western is the operating name of First Greater Western Ltd". i.e. the company running the trains now is legally a different company to that running the trains previously, but the name on the side of the trains is the same, so we have one article.</dd>
<dd>FGW's original plan was to have three brands "First Great Western" (or "First Great Western Express"), "First Great Western Local" and "First Great Western Link".

<p>Due to issues with Keolis, parent company in the TransPennine Express franchise with FirstGroup, the company will be known as "TransPennine Express" again from the start of the Winter franchise. Issues at Keolis have arisen with the brand "First TransPennine Express", namely that the company is not a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstGroup plc. To avoid any further issues, the appendage First will not appear on any literature from the start of the timetable, and all information screens will be altered as soon as possible, and announcements changed to reflect the alteration, along with the website at <a href="http://www.tpexpress.co.uk" class="external free" title="http://www.tpexpress.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.tpexpress.co.uk</a></p>

<p>The title of this template is Current scheduled passenger train operators, yet Wrexham and Shropshire had not yet been granted approval by the Office of Rail Regulation, as stated on their home page, therefore they are not a scheduled operator and should yet be included in the template. --<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorvik_a61f.html" title="User:Jorvik">Jorvik</a> 22:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Grand Central are more than just proposed, so that just leaves Grand Union and WSMR. Another possibility is to add a see-also line to former TOCs and proposed TOCs templates/articles/sections. Make a mockup for these two here, and any other options you think might work, so we can agree on what we like without edit waring over the main template as has happened in the past. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 11:03, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, how about something along these lines - given the template is simply called "British TOCs", why not put a small seperate addition with these proposed new operators underneath the main template? Thus...</p>

<dd>Also the length of the line between links and notes should all be standardised to either – (a short dash) or - (a hyphen). Unfortunately it is all-but impossible to differenciate the two in the edit window (when they are next to each other, the dash is slightly higher than the hyphen: –-), the difference between them is noticeable when rendered. At least this is the case on my system (Firefox 2.0 on Linux).</dd>
<dd>Perhaps the hyphen would be better as the mix we currently have is presumably from people assuming thats what they all are. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 00:52, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What status makes Island Line a rural line? <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 14:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never found a criteria for why lines are categorised like this. If you read any of the Network Rail stuff they classify lines as "Primary", "Secondary", "London &amp; SE commuter", "Rural" and "Freight". Our (Wikipedia) classification doesn't always seam to correlate (main line, commuter, rural and freight). However looking at the 2006 business plan for the South Western Main Line by Network Rail <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/3102_Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/3102_Route%203%20South%20West%20Main%20Line.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> - the Island Line is also classified as Rural. Perhaps we need to establish some criteria for classification of rail lines at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_railway_lines_in_Great_Britain_7504.html" title="List of railway lines in Great Britain">List of railway lines in Great Britain</a>. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickle_UK_324c.html" title="User:Pickle UK">Pickle</a> 12:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
