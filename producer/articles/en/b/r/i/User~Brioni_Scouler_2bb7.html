	    <p>== <b>Job hunting in Australia for migrants: the basics</b></p>
<p>Landing a job in Australia is a lot easier for new migrants if they understand the particular challenges involved. The first things to know are that more than 80% of job vacancies are not advertised, and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up almost three-quarters of the Australian economy. This means many vacancies are beyond the reach of migrants (and others) who have not yet built up social and professional networks. It also means competition is stiff for the jobs that get advertised. Many migrants find a job through direct marketing―approaching employers directly or through networking―which makes researching the state of your industry and occupation very important. Australians network extensively in both their social and professional lives. From our experience of living and working in seven different countries, it is apparent that networking is more significant in Australian culture than in the comparable economies of the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States. Networking involves talking to friends, neighbours, casual acquaintances and any relatives you might have in Australia. New migrants naturally tend to start with people from their own country, and this may include community and business organisations for their specific nationality. But you should make every effort to extend your sphere of contacts to the wider community and get to know as many people as possible. Migrants from Asian countries will find there is a range of professional associations to join, and they should know who their community leaders are. Australian society is very multicultural, with powerful people from all nationalities and walks of life. If you are from India, China, Malaysia or the Philippines, you may be surprised by how many people from your country are well established and successful. Joining professional associations, trade bodies and representative organisations as quickly as possible is another way to tap into the hidden job market. Some companies even offer incentives to staff who refer candidates for job interviews. International experience is not highly regarded, but networking can help potential employers overcome their doubts about hiring an “outsider”. We have found that migrants are much more successful when they have the opportunity to meet a potential employer face to face. Migrants with international experience at a senior level can become frustrated when their job applications fail because they lack local experience and local referees. Note that Australians who return home after working overseas for long periods commonly face the same problem. One inspiring figure from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) is that 29% of all small businesses in Australia are owned or managed by people who were born in another country. One in five Australian jobs is directly export-related, and 12 of the top 15 export markets are non-English-speaking countries. The scope for marketing yourself to companies with international operations is considerable.</p>
<p><i>Other top tips</i></p>
<p>• Know where to look for jobs outside the mainstream. An excellent place to start is our Web Guide, with industry-specific information for migrants and many websites you may not be aware of. • Write an Australian-style résumé and cover letter. This is essential. Australian employers generally expect three or four pages with a clear, detailed history of your professional experience. • Most government and public organisations expect job applicants to complete “selection criteria”. Even for native English speakers, this is not an easy task and we recommend you find someone to help you regardless of where you are from. • Adopt Australian-style interview techniques and approaches. A delicate aspect of this is the need to promote yourself without overselling. Australians don’t take kindly to over-confident or boastful people―but you don’t want to undersell yourself either. • Understand the relevant employment conditions, law and documentation so you know your rights in the context of what employers offer. More than a quarter of Australian employees work on a casual basis, and casual workers can be especially vulnerable if they don’t know their rights. • Gain local experience through volunteering. A comparatively large proportion of Australians do volunteer work to contribute to the community, meet people, learn skills and improve their career opportunities. Volunteering may not be a normal part of your own culture, but it has more benefits than you probably realise. • It won’t take you long to notice that taking an interest in sport is a fast lane to the centre of Australian culture. Knowing your “footie” and cricket is good for networking; it’s a much more potent ice-breaker than the weather, for example. And joining a sports club has many benefits, not least the inexpensive facilities and activities they provide. • We highly recommend finding a local mentor who can give advice and help you stay positive and motivated. They can also act as a referee (likely to carry more weight than a referee from your home country). • Manage your expectations. It typically takes 6-12 months to find a job, and an estimated 50% of skilled migrants accept positions that don’t make use of their highest qualifications. Having the right information about the job market is the surest way to reduce your job-hunting time, and the associated stress and frustration.</p>
