<p><b>British Bulldogs</b> (often used in the singular - <b>British Bulldog</b> - or simply <b><a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulldog.html" title="Bulldog">Bulldog</a>[s]</b>) is a <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tag_%28game%29.html" title="Tag (game)">tag-based</a> <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a> somewhat similar to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Rover_3e01.html" title="Red Rover">Red Rover</a>, played mainly in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and other <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries by children at <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">school</a>. The game is characterised by its high level of violence and physicality, leading it to be banned from many schools.</p>
<p>The play area is usually a large hall or large area of a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_field.html" title="Playing field">playing field</a>. There are no limits to the size of the pitch nor the number of players as long as there is enough space for the players to manoeuvre and enough players to have fun.</p>
<p>One or two players are selected as the Bulldogs, and they stand in the middle of the play area. All remaining players stand at one end of the area (home). The aim of the game is to run from one end of the field of play to the other, without being caught by the bulldogs. When a player is caught, they become a bulldog themselves. The winner is the last player to become a bulldog.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Bulldogs_%28game%29_14c9.html" title="Edit section: Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules</span></h2>
<p>The playing area consists of a main playing area, with two 'home' areas on opposing sides (similar to the touchdown areas used in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">Rugby</a>). The home areas are the width of the playing area and are usually marked by a line or some other marker.</p>
<p>Each game of bulldog consist of a sequence of rounds, and it is usual to play a number of games back-to-back with different bulldogs each time. The game is initiated with a single player (or sometimes two players) selected in some manner to be the first bulldog[s]. The objective for the non-bulldog players is to run from one home area to the other whilst avoiding the bulldogs in the middle. The round is usually initiated by the bulldogs calling "British Bulldogs 1, 2, 3". Usually, one of the bulldogs names a player to be the first to attempt the run from one end to another. The bulldogs then attempt to 'catch' the player (the specific rules on what constitues a catch vary, ranging from a tag to a physical tackle). If the player successfully enters the opposing home area without being caught, they are considered 'safe' and may not be caught by the bulldogs. Players are also safe while they remain in their original home area, although there are sometimes rules for how long they may remain there, and they may not re-enter it once they have left. If they are caught, they become a bulldog themselves. Once the player has reached home or been caught, all the other non-bulldog players must immediately attempt to cross the playing area themselves, with the same rules applying (this period of the game sometimes being called a 'rush' or 'bullrush'). The bulldogs may catch any number of players in a single rush, all of whom become bulldogs. The round is then repeated in the opposite direction until all players have become bulldogs.</p>
<p>The aim of the game for the bulldogs is to catch all the players as quickly as possible, whilst the aim for the other players is to stay uncaught for as long as possible. The last player to be caught is usually considered the winner.</p>
<p>As is usual with children's games, the particular rules applied vary from location to location. In general, the most recent loser chooses which player must cross the field on their own. In other variations, there is no choosing of players and all players must attempt to cross simultaneously. The choosing of the first bulldog[s] is also subject to variation. Usually, either the first or the last players caught become the bulldogs for the next game. In some versions, only the first player caught in each round becomes a bulldog. Catching other players is simply for fun and has no strategic advantage.</p>
<p>The method by which a runner is caught varies according to local custom, but can involve physically <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tackle_%28football_move%29.html" title="Tackle (football move)">tackling</a> the runner to the ground, or lifting the runner off the ground. Due to the violent nature of such tackles, games with adult supervision usually use simple tagging (touching) to catch players. The physicality of the game caused it to gain some notoriety and to be banned in a number of school playgrounds.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Bulldogs_%28game%29_14c9.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>The game is normally played by children and offers an interesting means of letting off energy and involves rugged physical contact. It appeals to competitive spirits but at the same time produces ad-hoc team activity with all the "losers" endeavouring to bring the "non-losers" to the ground. Mothers tend to deplore the game since it results in muddied and even torn clothes, bruises and sometimes tears but both boys and girls participate in it.</p>
<p>As a game of physical contact that results in a <a href="../../../m/%C3%AA/l/M%C3%AAl%C3%A9e.html" title="Mêlée">mêlée</a> of people attempting to drag others down to the ground, Bullrush bears some similarity to a <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby</a> <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrum_%28rugby%29.html" title="Scrum (rugby)">scrum</a> which may explain the presence of the game amongst children in a nation beloved of the sport of rugby.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Bulldogs_%28game%29_14c9.html" title="Edit section: Variations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Variations</span></h2>
<p>A variation of the standard Bullrush game is <b>Tag Bullrush</b>, sometimes known as "French Bulldog". This plays the same as the regular version, but you only need to be tagged by someone to lose, as opposed to tackled. This is a much safer version and is less likely to result in injury.</p>
<p><b>Sharks and Minnows</b> is a common name for a version played in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_pool.html" title="Swimming pool">swimming pools</a> and other bodies of water.</p>
<p><b>Octopus</b> is a common name for the tag variation where all but the original "non-loser" must chose a pivot foot which cannot be moved for the remainder of the game. They may pivot around their chosen foot so as to attempt to tag others attempting to pass by. This variant is generally ineffective in wide, open areas and so is more commonly played in <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gym.html" title="Gym">gyms</a>.</p>
<p><b>Pirates</b> Varient 'field' is indoors , usually a gym, but includes ropes, bars, benches etc, has no 'safe' area. Usually starts with one or two person(s) dedicated as a pirate(s). Those caught sit out of game until all are tagged.</p>
<p><b>Dragout</b> is another variation, in which the bulldog must drag players out of the playing area for them to be considered caught.</p>
<p><b>Irsh</b> In this game the non-bulldogs are not only taken down but then picked up and thrown. This is probably the most dangerous and should not be attempted by small children.</p>
