<p>Brian, just to let you know as your screen shot of the Virtual Magic Kingdom is a fair use image it should not be used on your userpage.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia Fair Use Policy</a> policy #9 "Fair use images should be used only in the article namespace. Used outside article space, they are often enough not covered under the fair use doctrine. They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes) or on user pages. They should be linked, not inlined, from talk pages when they are the topic of discussion. This is because it is the policy of the Wikimedia Foundation to allow an unfree image only if no free alternative exists and only if it significantly improves the article it is included on. All other uses, even if legal under the fair use clauses of copyright law, should be avoided to keep the use of unfree images to a minimum. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis if there is a broad consensus that doing so is necessary to the goal of creating a free encyclopedia (like the templates used as part of the Main Page).</p>

<p>Happy to help out. BTW, you seem to know something about both Anime and musicals. I did a little research and added to the Japanese musicals category some Anime based musicals, based on what I could find online, but I don't really know much about it. If you look at the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_theatre.html" title="Musical theatre">musical theatre</a> article, Anime is mentioned. Could you review what it says about Anime and the Japanese musicals scene (under the "international" section near the end) and see if what we have is accurate?

<p>Hi, you moved "Disney Speak" to "Disney theme park terminology" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disney_theme_park_terminology&amp;diff=82887450&amp;oldid=79610372" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disney_theme_park_terminology&amp;diff=82887450&amp;oldid=79610372" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Some terms, like the one about "plussing" are meant in a general sense (disney movies, disney memorabilia, theme parks etc.), and by your move these terms are now misplaced. Would you agree moving the article to a more general title, like "Disney jargon"? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 21:22, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, "plussing" does. Here's an idea: Plussing once was an article of its own. I'll make it an article again and the problem is solved. Hope this works fine with you? <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 22:55, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A general image without advertising specific players is more appropriate. Using qruthie's profile unacceptable to me and others. It will encourage an edit war where people will begin to post pics of their rooms and their profiles in an effort to become "popular." Perhaps a cropped version of the just the profile, the username blurred out or a random Guest profile (a mule we could use).

<dd>It *is* a problem, so what do we do now? I think using a staff profile is more appropriate. In other games, they typically mask out the usernames to avoid free publicity. It varies though, there is no set Wikipedia rule. I will search for one and take a screen for the article.

<dd>Hi Brian, I updated the image to reflect the Christmas theme. And I changed the profile pic to Hula. She was the only staff I could find since I don't have any on my list and I went to her game.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am writing because I noticed that an admin has removed a superior GDFL photo on the Jimmy Fallon page and replaced it with a terrible one. I am writing you because there is sort of a history between me and this admin. I wrote about the photo he replaced it with on the talk page but he just reverted it and made no comment on the talk page.</p>
<p>The problem is that this new photo is really bad and I suggested if he could find another good quality freeuse photo to replace it but he has this thing about this actor Borgman who appears in the picture he has even wrongly accused me of being Borgman because I have edited and added information about a bunch of indie film actors. I think that he has a tendency to be somewhat irrational but since he is now an admin I think he should act like one. Anyway, if you could just look at the photographs and make a judgment for yourself it would be helpful because I believe that the quality of the article has been lowered with this change. Better have no photo at all. Thank you for your time. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 17:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you Brian for your help. I didn't want to get into a revert war with him especailly since we have a history of minor conflicts. I'll keep an eye out for a freeuse image of just Fallon at the commons. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 18:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sir, while I respect your works here, from a purely logistical standpoint, there is no way you can go up against Stephen Colbert and win; he's got legions of fans who will alter any wikipedia page purely based on his whims on his TV show.

<p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>Years ago there was an article created by someone on an independent film that I found interesting because it was done like an old silent movie called The Deserter. Ultimately, it was deleted 2005 because at the time it was only being shown at limited engagments on film. It was voted for deletion because it was not released or available to a wide audience mainly.</p>
<p>Last year the film was released on DVD and a new article was created entitled The Deserter (2006 film). The film has gotten some global attention and I think it is notable because there are not many people making silent comedy features these days.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was removed by an admin, JzG, today, saying that it was just the reposting of formerly deleted material. Because this wasn't really the case and because the same thing happened with the film Democrazy (film) which was voted to be deleted and then after it was released on DVD and was distributed through Amazon and other places and an article was again written concerning this film, I made a new article with some cited references and explained on the talk page why I thought JzG was incorrect.</p>
<p>My question to you is did I do something wrong? I have added info to many articles over years, but I haven't been keeping up with all the procedure of how one is to do things. I am not an admin so was my bold step of reposting an article that was removed by an admin going to cause a big ruckus? I still think I'm correct and believe this new article on the same film should be posted for deletion on its own since I believe the film now meets the criteria for inclusion as stated by the people who voted to delete it. Sorry of this is long and rambling. I hope it makes sense. Anyway, I once asked for your opinion and advice on something else and thought maybe you could give some good incite on this. <a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwain_ef57.html" title="User:Dwain">Dwain</a> 22:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
