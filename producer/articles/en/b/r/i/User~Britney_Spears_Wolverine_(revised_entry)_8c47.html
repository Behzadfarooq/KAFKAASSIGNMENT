<p><b>Wolverine</b> (a.k.a. Logan) is a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a>, a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a>, and member of the <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>. The character first appeared on the last page of <i><a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulk_%28comics%29.html" title="Hulk (comics)">Incredible Hulk</a> #180</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>), with a full introduction in the following issue, Hulk #181. In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, he rose from relative obscurity to become a household name; he may be Marvel Comics' second most-popular character, after <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant_%28fictional%29.html" title="Mutant (fictional)">mutant</a>, Wolverine heals quickly, possesses animal-like senses and reflexes, and has three foot-long claws on each hand that retract into his forearms. The claws -- and his entire skeleton -- are laced with the unbreakable metal <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloy</a> <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a>.</p>
<p>Wolverine's fierce nature helped forge the mold for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-heroes</a>. His willingness to use deadly force, his efforts to come to terms with his questionable past and his <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angst.html" title="Angst">angst</a>-filled inner conflicts have become standard for anti-heroes. The character is an unparalleled master of combat who will not hesitate to meet lethal force in kind.</p>
<p>Wolverine was created by <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Wein_4159.html" title="Len Wein">Len Wein</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Romita_Sr._a675.html" title="John Romita Sr.">John Romita Sr.</a>, with some additional influence by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Trimpe_f479.html" title="Herb Trimpe">Herb Trimpe</a>. The character was further developed by the celebrated creative duo of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Claremont_0899.html" title="Chris Claremont">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Byrne_35d2.html" title="John Byrne">John Byrne</a>, popularly remembered for their work on the X-Men. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Miller_%28comics%29_863f.html" title="Frank Miller (comics)">Frank Miller</a>, usually remembered for his revitalization of Daredevil and redefinition of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, deserves credit for establishing important nuances in the Wolverine limited series he co-wrote with Claremont, such as the memorable catch phrase, "I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice."</p>
<p>Wolverine joined the X-Men roster in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> and has been featured in his own solo series since <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. He has been a central part of X-Men <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_series.html" title="Animated series">animated series</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films.html" title="Films">films</a>.</p>

His full introduction was in the next issue, #181 (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. He appeared in a costume designed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Romita%2C_Sr_4bb0.html" title="John Romita, Sr">John Romita, Sr</a>: yellow-and-blue spandex which didn't particularly resemble a true <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine.html" title="Wolverine">wolverine</a>, sporting foot-long metal <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claw.html" title="Claw">claws</a>. His introduction left an ambiguous impression, revealing little more than that he was an agent of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> government with <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman.html" title="Superhuman">superhuman</a> powers. The basic facts about the character had not been established.</p>
<p>Wolverine next appeared in <i>Giant-Sized X-Men</i> #1 (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>), in which he joined the X-Men. Written by Wein and drawn by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Cockrum_c911.html" title="Dave Cockrum">Dave Cockrum</a> (who altered Wolverine's mask), the issue was successful enough to revive the title, starting with #94 (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>), drawn by Cockrum but written by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Claremont_0899.html" title="Chris Claremont">Chris Claremont</a>. Wolverine was initially overshadowed by the other characters, and Claremont even considered dropping the character later.</p>

<p>Cockrum's replacement by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Byrne_35d2.html" title="John Byrne">John Byrne</a> resulted in Wolverine's character being brought into focus. Himself a Canadian, Byrne did not appreciate the suggestion of dropping a Canadian character. One of his ideas involved creating <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Flight_4159.html" title="Alpha Flight">Alpha Flight</a>, a group of Canadian superheroes, who tried to recapture Wolverine due to the expense the Canadian government incurred in training him. Wolverine's murky past was gradually established, as was his unstable nature, which he tried to keep in check. Wolverine had a brief crush on <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> (later revisited), the team leader Cyclops' girlfriend, and the two men often clashed over Cyclops' more cautious approach. Byrne designed a new, brown-and-tan costume for Wolverine, keeping the distinctive Cockrum-designed cowl. The new look succeeded and the readers' interest began to climb.</p>
<p>Following Byrne's departure, Wolverine remained with the X-Men, written by Claremont. By this point he was becoming popular with regular comic book readers, and appeared in his own <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini-series.html" title="Mini-series">mini-series</a> <i>Wolverine</i> (#1-4 by Claremont and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Miller_%28comics%29_863f.html" title="Frank Miller (comics)">Frank Miller</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September.html" title="September">September</a> - <a href="../../../d/e/c/December.html" title="December">December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>) and in <i><a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Pryde_and_Wolverine_e738.html" title="Kitty Pryde and Wolverine">Kitty Pryde and Wolverine</a></i> (#1-6 by Claremont and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Milgrom_dd43.html" title="Al Milgrom">Al Milgrom</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> - <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>).</p>
<p>Wolverine graduated to his own ongoing series with <i>Wolverine</i> #1 (by Claremont and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Buscema_3942.html" title="John Buscema">John Buscema</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>).

The first issue of the 1980s <i>Wolverine</i> mini-series</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wolverine first appeared as a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> superhero and government agent fighting <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incredible_Hulk_3526.html" title="The Incredible Hulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> and the <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendigo.html" title="Wendigo">Wendigo</a>, in order to halt the destruction in the wake of their battle. His speed and manoeuvrability proved to be a match for the two plodding powerhouses of vast superhuman strength, and he was able to fight both creatures to a standstill.</p>
<p>Soon <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_X_9919.html" title="Professor X">Professor X</a> recruited him to join a new team of <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>, and he resigned from his position in Canada over his superiors' objections. Over the following year, Wolverine was revealed to be a <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutant_%28fictional%29.html" title="Mutant (fictional)">mutant</a> whose <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeleton.html" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a> had been laced with the unbreakable metal <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">adamantium</a>. Initially misanthropic and a loner, Wolverine often clashed with the X-Men's leader <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclops_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyclops (comics)">Cyclops</a>. Given to berserker rages in combat, he slowly learned how to control his feral instincts. However, Wolverine is the X-Man most likely to <i>permanently</i> deal with adversaries who dispense lethal force. Despite his quick temperament, he has been described as a warrior poet with an iron will.</p>
<p>It was revealed that he had forgotten much of his past: He had been transformed by a project called <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a>, which had added the adamantium to his body. He had then been adopted by James and <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vindicator.html" title="Vindicator">Heather Hudson</a> into their project which eventually became <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Flight_4159.html" title="Alpha Flight">Alpha Flight</a>. Intended to eventually lead that team, when he departed to join the X-Men he precipitated James Hudson's adoption of the identity of Weapon Alpha (later Vindicator and then <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardian_%28Marvel_Comics%29_6607.html" title="Guardian (Marvel Comics)">Guardian</a>), and a lengthy and often hostile effort, wherein Alpha Flight tried to bring Wolverine back to Canada, while Wolverine attempted to retain his freedom. Wolverine would eventually make peace with Hudson and Alpha Flight, while remaining a member of the X-Men.</p>
<p>Complexity to their character was subtly implied over time: He could read and speak <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>, he had a strong sense of personal <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honour.html" title="Honour">honour</a>, and became close friends with his teammate <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightcrawler_%28comics%29.html" title="Nightcrawler (comics)">Nightcrawler</a>, despite their many differences. He went by the name "Logan", without a surname, but it was unclear whether this was his real name.</p>
<p>Wolverine briefly became interested in Cyclops' true love, <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a>, but the interest was never truly reciprocated. He later met and became engaged to Lady <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariko_Yashida_de79.html" title="Mariko Yashida">Mariko Yashida</a> of a <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> crime family. He was forced to kill her father in a duel and single-handedly destroyed his crime cartel. Mariko and Logan became estranged due to the strange honour customs of her family, and the manipulations of the villain <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastermind_%28comics%29.html" title="Mastermind (comics)">Mastermind</a>. Once they were finally reunited she was poisoned by Reiko, an assassin for the <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakuza.html" title="Yakuza">Yakuza</a>. She requested Wolverine end her life quickly rather than let her die a slow and painful death from the toxin, and he obeyed. This changed Wolverine's character significantly, making him more disciplined and emotionally distant.</p>
<p>In <i>X-Men</i> #25 (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>), at the culmination of the "Fatal Attractions" <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_crossover.html" title="Fictional crossover">crossover</a>, the adamantium in Wolverine's skeleton was forcibly removed by the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervillain.html" title="Supervillain">supervillain</a> <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28comics%29.html" title="Magneto (comics)">Magneto</a> in a desperate battle. Some time later, in <i>Wolverine</i> #100, another maniac, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_%28comics%29.html" title="Genesis (comics)">Genesis</a>, kidnapped Wolverine and attempted to re-bond the metal to his skeleton. This was unsuccessful and caused Wolverine's mutation to accelerate out of control. He was temporarily changed into a semi-sentient beast-like form in which he knew greater physical power than ever before, at the price of part of his humanity. Genesis did not survive the battle following his failed experiment. Finally, the villain <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_%28comics%29.html" title="Apocalypse (comics)">Apocalypse</a> kidnapped Wolverine, brainwashed him, and had the adamantium rebonded to his skeleton successfully. Wolverine overcame Apocalypse's programming and returned to the X-Men.</p>
<p>Recently, Wolverine was recaptured by the Weapon-X program, which is under new leadership. It was then revealed that the mental implants installed by the original Weapon-X program were still functional, because the new director had used Wolverine as a sleeper agent to track down and elimenate the old members of the Weapon-X program. However, we are told that during his assasination of Senator Drexel Walsh (the previous director of the Weapon-X program), the mental implants were destroyed under the stress. It was in this incident that we were introdued to the Shiver Man and Mauvais. Hints in this series point towards the opinion that Wolverine:Origin is in fact the true story of Wolverine's past.</p>
<p>Today, Wolverine remains an integral part of the X-Men, He is also an officer of the mutant law enforcement agency the <a href="../../../x/-/t/X-Treme_Sanctions_Executive_bd2e.html" title="X-Treme Sanctions Executive">X-Treme Sanctions Executive</a> (XSE), and he recently joined the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">The New Avengers</a> alongside other famous Marvel Comics heroes such as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Man_58f4.html" title="Iron Man">Iron Man</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>.</p>

<p>Wolverine's early life has been revealed gradually over time. Wolverine's time as a captive and subject of the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a> project has been revealed as a period when he was entirely at the mercy of feral instincts due to severe physical and psychological trauma inflicted upon him by the program. He was their agent, their ultimate weapon, along with his future archnemesis <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabretooth_%28comics%29.html" title="Sabretooth (comics)">Sabretooth</a>. Next, Wolverine lived on a Native American reservation with his former girlfriend Silver Fox, whom he thought had been killed by his enemy.</p>
<p>Finally, the story of his childhood was told in the miniseries <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_%28comics%29.html" title="Origin (comics)">Wolverine: Origin</a>. He was born James Howlett, the son of wealthy Canadians John and Elizabeth Howlett. In <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>, the frail boy was raised by the red-haired Rose, his companion and tutor which bore more than a passing resemblance to Jean Grey, since his mother was distant and remote. Elizabeth's first son had an untimely death and she took solace by having an affair with the Howletts' groundskeeper <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Logan_df28.html" title="Thomas Logan">Thomas Logan</a>. Logan, who resembled the adult Wolverine, had a son named <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Logan_705b.html" title="Dog Logan">Dog Logan</a>. The boy would grow to attack Rose and Thomas Logan was then fired. However, John Howlett later found Logan with his wife. Thomas had returned to get his lover. In a twist of fate, Logan killed John. Wolverine's mutant powers -particularly his claws - xhose this traumatic moment to emerge. With his new powers, James Howlett killed Logan and scarred Dog. Elizabeth lost both husband and lover. She chose to commit <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>.</p>
<p>Due to his alleged killing of his parents, James was exiled by his grandfather and became a <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">nomad</a>. He was brought to a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> mining colony, where he grew into a strong and ferocious lad. Three years later , Dog tracked him down. Wolverine won the resulting battle but failed to kill Dog. Rose attempted to prevent the killing and was impaled by the claws of her mutant charge. Wracked with grief over the death of his true love, Wolverine spend more time in the woods with <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf.html" title="Wolf">wolves</a>, where he feels more at home. Whether or not the miniseries <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origin_%28comics%29.html" title="Origin (comics)">Wolverine: Origin</a> should be part of official Marvel canon is apparently disputed by some Marvel editors.</p>
<p>Much of Wolverine's origin still remains a mystery. It is unclear how much Wolverine recalls about his past, as his memories have been extensively tampered with, both by the Weapon X program and his healing powers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritney_Spears_Wolverine_%28revised_entry%29_8c47.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Skrullverine&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Skrullverine"</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="../../../s/k/r/Skrull.html" title="Skrull">Skrull</a> working for Apocalypse briefly replaced the real Wolverine to allow the real one to be kidnapped and brainwashed. Due to mental programming to allow him to take the place of the real Wolverine without alerting the X-Men's telepaths, he believed himself to actually be Wolverine.</p>
<p>The Skrull imposter of Wolverine was initially created as part of a program initiated by the Skrulls to impersonate Earth's heroes en masse, at the cost of the shapeshifting abilities of those used - instead they would be physically locked into the forms they were imitating, in addition to mental programming designed to make them believe they were the hero in question. Due to the limitations of the process and their technology, however, they could not duplicate most of the respective abilities (e.g., the fake "Nightcrawler" could only pretend to teleport by becoming invisible). After the Skrull homeworld was destroyed by <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactus.html" title="Galactus">Galactus</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_%28comics%29.html" title="Apocalypse (comics)">Apocalypse</a> found some skrulls and put them to use, including using this process on one of them to cover while they kidnapped the real Wolverine. The limitations meant, however, that "Skrullverine" had no "healing factor" or enhanced senses.</p>
<p>The imposter took on Wolverine's heroic qualities and saved several members of the X-Men and the Mannites (super powered children) from being eliminated by Apocalypse's acolyte of Death. The Skrull impostor was killed by the acolyte of Death (who turned out to be the real Wolverine who had been brainwashed). His death was noble and heroic.</p>

<p>Wolverine is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial enhancements to his physiology. He regenerates and heals hundreds of times faster than a normal human. Thanks to this superhumanly regenerative "healing factor," he has been able to completely recover from injuries which would prove fatal to most humans, even those with superhuman abilities. He can regenerate organs such as eyes or large portions of flesh, but he cannot regenerate completely severed limbs, such as feet and arms.</p>
<p>Other benefits of the healing factor include an immunity to <i>most</i> toxins (except in massive doses) or diseases and greatly improved stamina (he can exert himself at peak levels for days before feeling fatigue). His healing factor retards his aging process to an unknown degree. It has been revealed that he is well over 100 years old and yet his appearance and physique are unchanged since the peak years of his life (apparently over a century ago). However, writers have suggested that the healing factor is also the cause of his amnesia.</p>
<p>Wolverine possesses <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman.html" title="Superhuman">superhumanly</a> acute <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senses.html" title="Senses">senses</a> that are comparable to those of certain animals, enabling him to <a href="../../../s/e/e/See.html" title="See">see</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hear.html" title="Hear">hear</a> distant objects more clearly than a normal human, and identify and track someone purely by <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scent.html" title="Scent">scent</a>. These heightened senses are only slightly less developed than those of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil_%28comics%29.html" title="Daredevil (comics)">Daredevil</a>, and are actually a result of his <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellular_regeneration.html" title="Cellular regeneration">cellular regeneration</a>, as are Wolverine's hieghtened agility and reflexes.</p>
<p>Wolverine's physical appearance also displays number of animal-like mutations, most notably, two canine teeth among his others (his normal teeth are significantly sharper than average human), and six retractable bone claws housed within his forearms, which he can release from behind his knuckles (causing bleeding that is rapidly healed by his healing factor).</p>

<p>Wolverine's skeleton has been molecularly laced with nigh-indestructable metal <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamantium_%28comics%29.html" title="Adamantium (comics)">Adamantium</a>, including the claws housed in his forearms. Due to the adamantium coating (which also maintains the cutting edge), the limiting factor on what he can cut through is based upon his own strength, rather than the resiliency of the claws. The enhanced tensile strength and additional wieght of his skeleton combined with his constant cellular regeneration grants him great physical strength, exceding that of any olympic athlete. His blows are weighted (similar to using brass knuckles) due to the presence of this metal.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Marvel_6b67.html" title="Ultimate Marvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe, Wolverine entered the story of <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_a58d.html" title="Ultimate X-Men">Ultimate X-Men</a> as a villain and an assassin who worked for Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. Unlike the original Wolverine, he made very quick, very seductive, advances toward Jean Grey, and originally was under orders to kill Charles Xavier. He had an affair with Jean and fell in love with her, but she left him upon discovering how he was hired to assassinate Xavier. Wolverine then tried to change and honestly worked with the X-Men. He still possessed a sinister side, however, and let Jean's boyfriend Scott (<a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclops_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyclops (comics)">Cyclops</a>) fall to his death so he could have Jean. Scott managed to survive, and when Jean learned what Wolverine did she rejected him once more. Wolverine is currently is on the lam with <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storm_%28comics%29.html" title="Storm (comics)">Storm</a>, and they seem to be building a relationship.</p>
<p>Just like the original Wolverine, he possessed keen senses and rapid, almost instant, cellular regeneration. But it seems that numerous criminals had in mind to obtain his adamantium for their own purposes, since that is virtually the only protection from Wolverine's claws, unlike the otherwise rare and expensive formula developed by the government.</p>
<p>The Ultimate Marvel version of Wolverine's archnemesis, Sabretooth, was identical, except that in addition to his sharp nails and teeth, he possessed eight adamantium claws, four that retracted from the back of each hand, just like Wolverine. Sabretooth also was openly proud of his psychotic tendencies, and was Weapon X's only apparent voluntary mutant military officer. Wolverine also ended the terror of Sabretooth quite quickly, by decapitating him in Magneto's arctic headquarters, not relatively long after their initial encounter.</p>
<p>Wolverine also appeared to have an alternate origin as well. According to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_America_1fa3.html" title="Captain America">Captain America</a>'s account, he was James Howlett, an officer and a commando for the Canadian military during World War II. Sabretooth claimed that Wolverine had a wife and child, and proudly claimed responsibility for killing them. Whether or not he was telling the truth remains to be seen, but a wedding ring that belonged to Wolverine was recently discovered.</p>
