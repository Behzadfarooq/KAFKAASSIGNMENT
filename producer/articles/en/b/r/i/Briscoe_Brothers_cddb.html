<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Briscoe_Brothers_cddb.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The Briscoe Brothers are well known for their work in <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_of_Honor_71eb.html" title="Ring of Honor">Ring of Honor</a>, but before that, they wrestled for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combat_Zone_Wrestling_4dc5.html" title="Combat Zone Wrestling">Combat Zone Wrestling</a>. Having already made a name for themselves in CZW, the Briscoes joined ROH and appeared on its first show, <i>The Era of Honor Begins</i>. Due to state laws in Pennsylvania (which is where the majority of ROH's early shows took place), Mark, who was only 17 years old at the time, could not wrestle. He did however accompany his older brother Jay to the ring for his matches. Jay's first match was against <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazing_Red_9389.html" title="Amazing Red">Amazing Red</a>, which he lost. Jay began to build a number of loses, and backstage criticism from Mark led to a feud between the two. This war of words from Mark even saw the Briscoes' parents try to calm things down between them. At <i>Honor Invades Boston</i>, age laws no longer applied since they were out of Philadelphia, and a match took place between the brothers, which Mark won. Having been embarrassed by losing to his younger brother, Jay vowed not to lose any more matches. He redeemed himself at the next show by beating Amazing Red in a rematch, and at <i>Glory By Honor</i>, Jay scored a pinfall victory over <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_World_Championship_bb9c.html" title="ROH World Championship">ROH Champion</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jirus_bad2.html" title="John Jirus">Xavier</a> in a non-title match. Because of this victory, Jay got a title match, but could not beat the champion again. At ROH's <i>One Year Anniversary Show</i>, Jay and Mark wrestled each other one final time, and this time, Jay was the winner. After this match, the feud ended and they began teaming together.</p>
<p>The Briscoes immediately challenged for the <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_World_Tag_Team_Championship_e62f.html" title="ROH World Tag Team Championship">ROH Tag Team Championship</a> against Amazing Red and <a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Styles_c25a.html" title="A.J. Styles">A.J. Styles</a>, but did not win. At <i>Glory By Honor 2</i>, they were part of a Gauntlet Match for the vacant titles, but were eliminated by <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_K_%28professional_wrestling%29_8937.html" title="Special K (professional wrestling)">Special K</a>. During this time, Jay and Mark also challenged <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samoa_Joe_5d67.html" title="Samoa Joe">Samoa Joe</a> for the World Title, but neither beat him. After many attempts at the tag titles, the Briscoes defeated Special K to become the new champions. Though they couldn't defeat Joe in singles competition, they did successfully defend the tag titles against him three times, with Joe having a different partner each time.</p>
<p>At <i>Reborn: Stage One</i>, the Briscoes defeated the debuting <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana_Pitbulls_edc0.html" title="Havana Pitbulls">Havana Pitbulls</a> in a non-title match. The next night, they lost the titles to <a href="../../../c/m/_/CM_Punk_9dee.html" title="CM Punk">CM Punk</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colt_Cabana_1499.html" title="Colt Cabana">Colt Cabana</a>. At the next show, <i>Round Robin Challenge III</i>, the tag team titles were defended in the Round Robin Challenge, and in each of the three matches, the titles changed hands. The Briscoes defeated <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Maff_ff7a.html" title="Dan Maff">Dan Maff</a> and <a href="../../../b/j/_/BJ_Whitmer_a2fc.html" title="BJ Whitmer">BJ Whitmer</a> to become two-time champions, but later that night, they lost them back to Punk and Cabana.</p>
<p>Both Mark and Jay competed in <i>Survival of the Fittest '04</i>. Jay lost his qualifying match against <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Erazo_945f.html" title="Nelson Erazo">Homicide</a>, and Mark beat <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Shelley_0181.html" title="Alex Shelley">Alex Shelley</a> to advance to the six man match, but was eliminated. After this, the Briscoes began a feud with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rottweilers_8c67.html" title="The Rottweilers">The Rottweilers</a>. At <i>Reborn: Completion</i>, they teamed with former enemy Samoa Joe to face Homicide and the Havana Pitbulls. At <i>Death Before Dishonor II Part 2</i>, Jay lost another singles match to Homicide and Mark lost to <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Ki_a28b.html" title="Low Ki">Low Ki</a>. Both matches were hard hitting, but the Rottweilers' cheating ways were too much for the Briscoes to handle. The Briscoes got retribution at <i>Testing The Limit</i> when they defeated Homicide and Low Ki in a tag team match. This match would be their last match in ROH for nearly two years as they took a break from ROH and wrestling in general.</p>
<p>In late 2005, the Briscoe Brothers returned to wrestling in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey_All_Pro_Wrestling_a0c2.html" title="Jersey All Pro Wrestling">Jersey All Pro Wrestling</a> and Pro Wrestling Unplugged, where they won the tag team titles. In early 2006, it was announced that they would be returning to ROH. They came back with a new attitude and made an immediate impact in their return match by defeating <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Mamaluke_7a04.html" title="Tony Mamaluke">Tony Mamaluke</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sal_Rinauro_878b.html" title="Sal Rinauro">Sal Rinauro</a> and Jason Blade and Kid Makaze. The Briscoes set their sights on <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Next_2df2.html" title="Generation Next">Generation Next</a>, the stable which included the World Tag Team Champions <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_Strong_0009.html" title="Roderick Strong">Roderick Strong</a>. At <i>Best in the World</i>, Roderick Strong and stablemate <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Evans_46f6.html" title="Jack Evans">Jack Evans</a> defeated the Briscoes. This loss did not discourage them, and at <i>The 100th Show</i>, they beat Generation Next member <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Sydal_d1d6.html" title="Matt Sydal">Matt Sydal</a> and his partner AJ Styles. The Briscoes then got a title shot against Aries and Strong. The night before this match, Jay and Mark beat Aries and Strong in singles matches. Despite the momentum gained from these victories, they were not able to beat the champions for the titles. Because it was a very close match, the Briscoes received another title shot. They lost again, but still received a third shot with the stipulation that it would be their last shot. The Briscoes lost for the third time, and they could no longer challenge for the tag titles as long as Aries and Strong held them (this is no longer in effect, because of their loss of the title). On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, The Briscoes won the FIP Tag Team Championship over the Heartbreak Express.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">January 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, in their first <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Wrestling_NOAH_a640.html" title="Pro Wrestling NOAH">Pro Wrestling NOAH</a> match, The Briscoes defeated <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yoshinobu_Kanemaru_2e9f.html" title="Yoshinobu Kanemaru">Yoshinobu Kanemaru</a> &amp; <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takashi_Sugiura_c0e3.html" title="Takashi Sugiura">Takashi Sugiura</a> to win the <a href="../../../g/h/c/GHC_8edc.html" title="GHC">GHC</a> Jr.Heavyweight Tag Team titles. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_21.html" title="January 21">January 21</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, The Briscoes lost the GHC Jr. Heavyweight Tag Team Titles to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Marvin_001e.html" title="Ricky Marvin">Ricky Marvin</a> &amp; <a href="../../../k/o/t/Kotaro_Suzuki_6a92.html" title="Kotaro Suzuki">Kotaro Suzuki</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, Jay and Mark Briscoe defeated the team of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Daniels_5934.html" title="Christopher Daniels">Christopher Daniels</a> and Matt Sydal to become three-time ROH World Tag Team Champions. Their reign would be short-lived, as they lost the titles in their first defence a week later, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, against <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shingo_Takagi_9621.html" title="Shingo Takagi">Shingo Takagi</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruki_Doi_dcb6.html" title="Naruki Doi">Naruki Doi</a> in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. The next night <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a> they fought each over to a double knockout in a one off match.</p>
