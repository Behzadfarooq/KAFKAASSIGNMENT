<p>The recently added climate chart is difficult to read. The resolution is poor - even when it is viewed as a large image - and is almost impossible to read when it appears as a small image. I think the information contained within it is useful, but perhaps it could be represented as a series of graphs. Perhaps on or two could appear on this page and the rest could be included in a separate article about the climate of Brisbane. The information within the graphs would be better presented if sumarised in words and in the table already on the page. How do people feel about removing the graphic? -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_3456.html" title="User talk:Adz">talk</a> 00:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The chart duplicates some info contained in the table, and therefore is not adding anything new to the article. I think the current climate table is sufficient enough. Looking at other Australian capital city articles, Brisbane's climate table is as comprehensive as <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>'s and certainly more detailed than the tables in the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> articles. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrightLights_99ee.html" title="User:BrightLights">BrightLights</a> 05:44, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I support the chart removal - it doesn't add any more information and clutters up the page <a href="../../../%24/e/t/User%7E%24eti.html" title="User:$eti">$eti</a> 04:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Take it out. It doesn't add much, and it screws up page layout. I'll come back in about a week; if no one has objected, I'm taking it out. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoodstein52_00f0.html" title="User:Woodstein52">Woodstein52</a> 00.11, 22 Sept 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The size of Brisbane is approximately 3 km². It has 4 parks covering nearly 8% of the total area. There are 10 schools and 3 childcare centres located in Brisbane. The population of Brisbane in 1996 was 3,890 people. By 2001 the population was 5,829 showing a population growth of 50% in the area during that time. The predominant age group in Brisbane is 20 - 29 years.</i></p>
<p><i>Households in Brisbane are primarily couples without children and are likely to be repaying over $2000.00 per month on mortgage repayments. In general, people in Brisbane work in a professional occupation. In 1996, 29% of the homes in Brisbane were owner-occupied compared with 29% in 2001.</i></p>
<p><i>Currently the median sale price of houses in the area is $506,000.</i></p>

<dd>I think we just need a proper plan of how the specific sections are addressed and how they need to be changed. Once a section is completed, it shouldn't be drastically edited/removed/changed unless voted by the editing community. Bit by bit the page could be completed properly and may actually (finally) end up being featured&#160;:) --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Pinnell_22cc.html" title="User:James Pinnell">James Pinnell</a> 08:47, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about we start by summarising the various transport sections, and retaining the information by creating a new <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Brisbane_abd8.html" title="Transport in Brisbane">Transport in Brisbane</a> article? The we can do the same with the Media, Communications and internet sections. Does that sound reasonable? Annual events can probably be rolled into 'Life in Brisbane' and renamed culture.

<dd>With regard to your suggested new <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Brisbane_abd8.html" title="Transport in Brisbane">Transport in Brisbane</a> article, there is already a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Transport_1a4c.html" title="Brisbane Transport">Brisbane Transport</a> article. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 23:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Transport_1a4c.html" title="Brisbane Transport">Brisbane Transport</a> deals with the division of the Brisbane City Council that administers public transport in the city. I was thinking of an article more along the lines of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Melbourne_6672.html" title="Transport in Melbourne">Transport in Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_London_7b1f.html" title="Transport in London">Transport in London</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation_in_New_York_City_82ba.html" title="Transportation in New York City">Transportation in New York City</a>. These articles deal with public transport, road infrastructure, (major freeways etc), bridges, airports and seaports, etc. The transport section in the Brisbane article would only have to briefly mention that some of these things exist, and the detail would be contained in the main article. (see the transport sections in the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> articles for example.

<dd>As you can see, I've started on re-working the Transport section and have transferred all the content to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_in_Brisbane_abd8.html" title="Transport in Brisbane">Transport in Brisbane</a>. I think both the T'port section in the main article, as well as the new article could do with a lot of work. I haven't lived in Brisbane for several years so would appreciate it if somebody went over it and checked that it is factually correct. In particular, we need to find references if either article is ever to be featured. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a>|<a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_3456.html" title="User talk:Adz">talk</a> 14:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now might be a good time to start to transform it into an <i>Infrastructure</i> section. It's excellent to see the transport section looking more ordered, although it's still far from concise.

<dd>I've created the Infrastructure section, and added "Health" and "Utilities". Also - is there any point to listing all of our tv stations and radio stations?

<p>May I suggested that the contributions that were inexplicably gutted out of the article during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brisbane&amp;diff=56931359&amp;oldid=56894394" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brisbane&amp;diff=56931359&amp;oldid=56894394" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> be restored to the current article.</p>
<p>Interpreting the meaning of symbols can be subjective and controversial at the best of times, but unless you people can provide a good reason for hiding the historical context in which Brisbane's nicknames were invented, I'd say my interpretation should be put back into the article. I don't think anyone would disagree with the accuracy of the interpretation, it's just that one person thought it wasn't important enough despite the unlimited space we have available for obscure details such as this. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.63.48.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.63.48.69_3602.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.63.48.69">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>It's not very kind to comment on other users' pictures as "ugly and outdated", especially when you have not yet contributed any copyright-free photos yourself to Wikipedia. At least the users whose photos you are denigrating have tried to help by contributing their own photos to Wikipedia, for the benefit of other people (including yourself). And, why do you comment that the photos are "outdated"? If you feel so strongly about the matter, then why don't you use your own camera and take some photos yourself. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 13:09, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And, with respect the Queens Plaza sculptures, the photo is already featured on the Queens Plaza page. Finally, with regard to River<i>fire</i>, maybe nobody is able to contribute a photo to Wikipedia.

<p>The article states that Brisbane is one of the most multicultural cities in Australia. This is a factoid. The statistics just don't add up to this. Look at the stats: <b>Comparative percentages of those born overseas in Australian major cities</b> (as at 2001):</p>
<ul>
<li>Melbourne: 43.5%</li>
<li>Perth: 31.6%</li>
<li>Sydney: 31.2%</li>
<li>Adelaide: 24.6%</li>
<li>Darwin: 22.0%</li>
<li>Canberra: 22.0%</li>
<li><b>Brisbane</b>: 21.0%</li>
<li>Hobart: 14.0%</li>
</ul>
<p>The ABS shows that Brisbane has a relatively low overseas migration rate compared to Sydney and Melbourne, and while Melbourne and Sydney's is growing, Brisbanes has either stayed the same or actually decreased. The reason for this is most likely that migrants are attracted to cities that offer high employment in areas of unskilled labour, in manufacturing and industry, whereas the majority of Brisbane's growth is actually in white collar industries. Even with interstate migration over the last few years, Brisbane still has the second lowest multicultural rate of the capital cities, and there are several provincial cities like Geelong and Newcastle that have higher multicultural proportions. For example, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dandenong%2C_Victoria_965c.html" title="Dandenong, Victoria">Dandenong, Victoria</a> has a rate of 54% overseas born. --<a href="../../../b/i/a/User%7EBiatch_2130.html" title="User:Biatch">Biatch</a> 01:48, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While the statement in the article certainly needs to be sourced, I'm not sure your statistics disprove it. I don't think it is correct to assume that multiculturalism is determined by proportion of overseas-born population; there are cultural differences amongst native Australians, no?--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">talk</a> 08:35, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps you disagree with the definition of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiculturalism.html" title="Multiculturalism">Multiculturalism</a> on Wikipedia and believe it needs changing.

<dd>The statistics quoted do not indicate the % of 'immigrant groups' (as quoted from the multiculturalism article), they indicate the % of population born overseas. Although this may seem to be the same thing, it is not. It does not take into account 'immigrant groups' that have been established here for more than one generation, and hence are not born overseas. Your statistics just show the recent immigration, not overall 'immigrant group' size. but I do think the comment should be reworded, brisbane is a multicultural city, but comparison to other cities is not required. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmeraj_5b0a.html" title="User:Rimmeraj">Rimmeraj</a> 02:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are talking about the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visible_minority.html" title="Visible minority">visible minority</a>, which is not a true indication or measure of a multicultural community. Second generation immigrants rarely retain their culture of their descendants. Until recently, Brisbane's population was dominated by the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Australia_Policy_da7a.html" title="White Australia Policy">White Australia Policy</a>, hence most immigrants are from Europe and English speaking backgrounds and have been quick adopters of Australian culture. Cities like Melbourne, however, have had multicultural populations for example from China since the Gold Rush 150 years ago which has influenced the diversity much more since. Ultimately everyone in Australia is an immigrant at some point - even indigenous Australians. Most cities in the developed world are to a certain extent. This is not, however, notable. To say so would not be doing justice to truly multicultural cities like Toronto, Melbourne, New York, London and Perth.--<a href="../../../b/i/a/User%7EBiatch_2130.html" title="User:Biatch">Biatch</a> 05:20, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Biatch, that part of the articel should be removed. Brisbane population is 85% <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo.html" title="Anglo">Anglo</a>. Even Perth has a highter non-Anglo population and Perth is Australia's 4th biggest city. I'm glad I now live in melbourne now, honestly brisbane is abit to "Red neck" for my taste. The Italian Australian population seems to be dying in Brisbane, which is sad cus the only migrants that have arrived in Brisbane over the past few years are Africans (not that there's anything wrong with that, But it wasn't until then brisbane ppl actully knew what black was, if ur an ethnic who's live/lived in Brisbane will know what i mean), But multiculturalism in brisbane is not very strong compered to Sydney, Melbourne and just about every other captital city in Australia, Brisbane despratly needs a new wave of migrants. <i>Unknown User</i> 20:32, 19 October 2006</p>

<p>I just read the introduction for this article, and found it to be confusing and to contain information that was not relevant for an introduction. I suggest the following: - remove text about the 'world fair' and 'commonwealth games', they are events that occurred but are not important for an introduction. - the wording 'of the Australian State of Queensland' in the first sentence is badly worded and does not conform to the other city pages (example Sydney). I would reword it as 'of Queensland'. If the reader wants to know more about Qeensland they can use the link to determine that it is an Australian state. - the introduction seems to be too history focused. It does tell you where Brisbane is, how populated, and then the rest is about the history. I would suggest that the world war II text is not essential and that we need a focus on what brisbane is today. A sentence about climate, sporting (and other recreation), government (council or state government), major landmarks would all be valid pieces of information. - I am not suggesting we make the introduction a huge section, just that the current information does not provide a good introduction to Brisbane.</p>
<p>I would like to perform some of the changes, but think I need agreement before I do any changes. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmeraj_5b0a.html" title="User:Rimmeraj">Rimmeraj</a> 23:47, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are special pages which have been created specifically for this purpose (one page being for popular entertainment such as pop, rock, punk and night clubs etc. — and another page for classical culture, such as opera, ballet, sculpture, actors, authors, artists and theatre venues etc.). While people seem to be very eager to list rock and punk music bands and artists on the main page, they are virtually ignoring classical culture. If there <b>is</b> to be mention on the main Brisbane page, <b>again</b>, of various groups and artists etc., then this will make the main Brisbane page more cumbersome, and a bias will once again be heavily loaded in favour of popular entertainment. Also, which examples out of the many would you choose for special favour and consideration by being specially chosen to be given a more prominent position by being mentioned on the main page? There should be no discrimation in mentioning bands and artists etc. (in either popular or classical culture), but this would be the case if certain bands and artists were singled out for this special privilege. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 02:57, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can see, Brisbane = Brisbane + Pine Rivers + Redcliffe + Caboolture + Redlands + Logan + urban Ipswich + Beenleigh bit of Gold Coast (the only bit actually within "Part A" - even Coomera is in a different stat div). Not sure about "no one" - I agree about the Gold Coast (apart from Beenleigh) and Caboolture, but Newsradio traffic reports for Brisbane seem to almost dwell on Goodna, for example, which is almost at Ipswich. Brisbane is in a *unique* situation in the country where a large part of its metro area is in one LGA due to past amalgamation, but if we used this definition in other cities, Perth would have just 8,905 people, Adelaide 13,724, Melbourne 60,745, Sydney 122,211 and Hobart 48,794 (according to their respective pages). Somehow I don't see Perth or Adelaide people agreeing that Hobart is 4-6 times their size. All Australian cities are poorly defined and noone quite knows where they start or end (arguably Adelaide and Brisbane are the best defined due to geographical lock-in) - I've had fun recently with the Melb articles re what is in and what is not. I'm prepared to agree with the ABS on this one. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 06:33, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we do use the statistic that includes the oher locations such as Ipswich, then I think this needs to be very clear to the reader.
