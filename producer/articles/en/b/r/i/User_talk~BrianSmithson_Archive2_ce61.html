<h2><span class="mw-headline">Empire maps?</span></h2>
<p>Hey Brian, I just saw your discussion with Mark regarding maps for ethnic group distribution. I don't know if this would also be an area of interest for you, but <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghana_Empire_280b.html" title="Ghana Empire">Ghana Empire</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mali_Empire_c48d.html" title="Mali Empire">Mali Empire</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Songhai_Empire_652c.html" title="Songhai Empire">Songhai Empire</a>, and <a href="../../../t/u/k/Tukulor_Empire_6913.html" title="Tukulor Empire">Tukulor Empire</a> have been in need of similar maps to show the extent of their West African holdings; a Google image search turns up a number of maps of their areas, but sadly nothing uncopyrighted. This is probably true of other African empires and kingdoms, but I haven't looked into it yet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I lack the software and know-how to fix this myself. If you're interested and have a chance, take a look... your efforts would be much appreciated! Best, <a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 16:41, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea. Mark and I are still trying to sort out technical issues (he uses Corel products, I use Adobe), but if and when we figure it out, these maps shouldn't be too difficult to put together. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 16:44, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brian, I wanted to let you know that I've withdrawn my vote for the FF6 FAC for the reason you cited (article stability). But I was also curious to hear what, if any, complaints you had besides the stability and the tense issue. Assuming this vote doesn't go through, I'd like to ensure that as many of the objections cited as possible are addressed before it comes up for another vote in a month or two. Thanks! ‚Äì <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeancdaug_9c50.html" title="User:Seancdaug">Seancdaug</a> 16:38, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for not responding sooner, Sean (see discussion below for why). I think the article is looking better. It's not "beautiful prose" necessarily, but it's a serviceable piece, and will hopefully be a good template for other articles on video games. I'm kind of liking the idea of making the "Characters" section prose, but I don't think it's a necessity. So, I guess the answer to your question of what complaints I have is "not many". Once the article stabilizes, and we give it one last polish for tense and spelling, I hope to change my vote and see this thing pass through to Featured. It's a shame all this discussion didn't take place during Peer Review, though. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 02:32, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was wondering how you were doing, but I saw that you were still editing so I figured you must have pulled through. Where are you anyway? I'm here in Lafayette--a long day at the Cajundome yesterday but looks like volunteers have been pouring in today, so I came home to read and play with my new kittens (refugees themselves). Good luck with the cold, and good luck wherever you may be! --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 20:27, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad to hear you're okay. I'm in Shreveport, so far enough north to have only gotten a few huffs out of Katrina. We've got a half dozen shelters all around town, and I may have picked up my nice little cold from the one at LSUS last night! But, yeah -- everything's going well, aside from people panicking that gas will run out, thousands of South Louisianans in town, and a decentralized relief effort (they keep saying they need French speakers to help with the refugees, but no one seems ot know where these Francophones are needed. Qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire?). <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 21:57, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Much the same situation here; lots of refugees, still no central authority. FEMA's totally absent from the scene, which raises questions like, why bother to have a federal emergency agency at all?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Music of Nigeria</span></h2>
<p>Hi Brian‚ÄîI noticed your comments on the peer review of this article. I've copy edited it, but it's in desperate need of images. Do you have any idea how the author can find some that have no copyright implications? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 09:16, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, Tony. It sounds like the author has contacted a number of website owners with no success. My next suggestion would be to try Nigeria-related discussion groups to request some images. It appears there are several active ones at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com" class="external text" title="http://groups.yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">Yahoo Groups</a>: Nigeria-Planet, net-nigeria, Nigeria-volunteers, and Nigeria_opportunities (and I only checked the first 75 "Nigeria" search results). A search for "Nigeria music" yields a few others: SaharaSouth, naijaonline, Musicologicalcolleagues, Ndi-Igbo, Omo-Oduduwa, and LCGChoir.</li>
<li>Another thought is to contact Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) from Nigeria. One of Peace Corps's three goals is to increase knowledge of the host culture in the rest of the world, something Wikipedia does quite well. You might try <a href="http://www.pcnaf.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.pcnaf.org/" rel="nofollow">The Peace Corps Nigeria Alumni Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.friendsofnigeria.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.friendsofnigeria.org/" rel="nofollow">The Friends of Nigeria</a>, or <a href="http://www.afropop.org/about.php" class="external text" title="http://www.afropop.org/about.php" rel="nofollow">Afropop Worldwide</a> (the latter seems to have Peace Corps sympathies).</li>
<li>In addition, I could provide another fair-use album cover (of Danfo Drivers, a reggae group), or a fair-use screenshot of the Danfo Drivers VCD. The rest of my collection is Cameroonian, though. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 17:52, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's some good ideas. I've sent off a couple e-mails and posted to a few Yahoo groups, so we'll see what comes of it. I've also uploaded some music samples (all popular music, though) -- if worst comes to worst, it might be able to sqeak through <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> with sounds even if the images are all fair use. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 23:09, September 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Brian, thanks hugely for that information‚Äîwhat a valuable source you are! Tuf-kat, maybe it will qualify, maybe it won't. If not, it's worth working on and resubmitting. I'd be inclined to trim it, particularly since there are several daughter articles. One of the problems is that much of it is like one long, adorned list. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 23:51, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What TV show compares to Charlie the disco Dog?</span></h2>
<p>Despite this show is not found on every TV network, do you know what? I think I don't understand that I was being to told to shut up about Charlie and others last week right here in my room.

<p>Why did you remove the picture of Charlie? His cartoons have already been banned on television, not only him, but Bugs Bunny as well had too been banned for the alleged uses of disco music and an Great-Dane, Scooby (not Charlie) now has lost interest to TV networks. The Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons is fine, but it has so much violence.</p>

<dd>Re the civil war bands, I think that'd be great, assuming copyright isn't a concern (even if they're traditional songs, the performers would still hold a copyright on the actual performance, I think) -- it's not like we're going to get a real recording of a civil war band.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">typically/generally</span></h2>
<p>Hi Brian</p>
<p>That's an interesting question, which sent me scuttling to the dictionary. The encarta dictionary on my computer says:</p>
<p><b>typ¬∑i¬∑cal¬∑ly</b> adv 1. with all or many of the usual or expected characteristics 2. in most cases or on most occasions 3. as is to be expected</p>
<p><b>gen¬∑er¬∑al¬∑ly</b> adv 1. in most cases or circumstances 2. as a whole or without exception 3. without being specific, detailed, or clearly defined 4. so as to be widespread</p>
<p>My gut feeling is to avoid 'generally' because it's ... general, that is, vague, unfocused (Meaning 3 comes perilously close to this). I've also been (unconsciously) influenced by the overuse and misuse of 'generally' (like 'basically'). The problem I now see with 'typically' is that it can have the meaning of 'expected of a particular thing or person', which is <i>not</i> generally what I intend when I use the word (that's typical of her).</p>
<p>You're right, either would do, strictly speaking (Meaning 2 for 'typically', and Meaning 1 for 'generally').</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the removal of the brackets in the OCM article.</p>
<p>Can you please explain the grammatical reasons behind you using [ ]s?</p>
<p>Thanks, Aaron Jethro 03:00, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, Aaron; no problem. The brackets are there to show that I changed a word in the quotation. For example, JFK said, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." If I wanted to fit that quote into a third-person sentence, I might write it like this: JFK asked Americans to "ask not what [their] country could do for [them]; ask what [they] could do for [their] country." The meaning is still there, but all the bracketed words show where I've changed the original quotation. It's similar when you have to fill in details so the readers can understand the quotation. For example, if the original quoation looked like, "Nirvana was the biggest band since the Fab Four", you might add a bracketed explanation if you didn't think your readers would know who "the Fab Four" were: "Nirvana was the beggest band since the Fab Four [The Beatles]". <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 11:40, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ah yes, now I remember all about squared brackets. Actually, now I feel stupid for asking. Personally I've always made, for example, the whole paragraph fit around a quote, rather than the other way 'round. So I've only ever used [ ]s to insert missing text, you know, like: <i>"where else [are] we gonna go?", the boy complained</i>.</dd>

<p>Hi Brian</p>
<p>I thought I'd alert you to the fact that User Redwolf kindly nominated me for adminship last week, which I accepted. Regrettably, this has coincided with a stouch with several huge egos whose FAC I helped on, and then critiqued after they'd trashed my entire contribution. I normally shun conflict, but here, I'm emersed in it, and I feel utterly destroyed. One of the protagonists appears to be drumming up support for his cause on other people's talk pages.</p>
<p>If the nomination fails Monday night, which appears likely now since the voting balance is borderline, I'll be trashing my personal page and not returning: it's just too embarrassing and unpleasant to go on.</p>
<p>So, if you have the inclination, the war zone is at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Tony1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Tony1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>I saw you wrote the article on snake charmers. I remember watching snake charmers on the streets of calcutta in the 80s when i grew up, not realizing the cruelty to the snakes, or the poverty of the charmers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snake.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snake.jpg" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a photo of streetside snake charming in Calcutta in the 1940s, taken by American GIs on casual leave. Public domain, thanks to UPenn libraries. By the way, there is a sizable literature, theatre, and movie section on snake charmers and snake charming - at least in Bengali, I dont know about Hindi. Also, do you know if similar articles exist about monkey and sloth bear dances&#160;?

<dd>Not yet. Wanted to finish tying up the loose ends on fair-use rationale and all that. Did they have these ads in Mali? They were all over Cameroon, except I never saw any of the TV spots (not enough TVs where I was). We volunteers had no idea this guy wasn't a real person; rumor was he was an ex-footballer who'd been swiped up to promote Guinness. One volunteer gathered quite a collection of <i>Engagement Critique</i> merchandise.

<dd>No, I can't remember seeing him--even around Bamako only the "toubab" (white guy) bars had Guinness, so Mali may not have had the imported beer market yet to support it. We mostly drank Castel and Flag, which were pretty foul. I did read about <i>Engagement Critique</i> in the BBC when it came out, though--I remember thinking, oh, how great, an African action hero, and then getting very depressed when I discovered it was Guinness-sponsored. Not that I don't love Guinness, but it would have much more inspiring to see it homegrown. Speaking of which, didn't the West African Guinness always strike you as only about half as good as the US? Did it come out of a different bottling plant, or was I just grumpy the whole time I was there? =) --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 20:04, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, we had Castel, too. I drank that almost exclusively. That and "33" Export were the "common" beers. Big Men drank Tuborg or Guinness. Cameroonian Guinness is brewed in Douala, and yes, it tastes completely different from American and Irish varieties. Rumor was that when the brewery tried to get the license, Guinness Ireland had them send a sample, which was rejected. When the brewery tried again, they simply filled one of their bottles with Guinness they had bought from Ireland and sent <i>that</i>. They got the license and went back to brewing the same old swill, now with a world-renowned brand name on it. Probably apocryphal, but who knows?&#160;:) ‚Äî<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 20:21, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
