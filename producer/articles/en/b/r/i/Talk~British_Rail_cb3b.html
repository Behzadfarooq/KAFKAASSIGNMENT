<dd>Yes, the NER was merged into the ER.

<p>The text refers to Pacers being "one of BR's less successful designs". I would consider replacing life expired DMU's whilst keeping tens of branchlines around Great Britain open anything but a failure. I dislike Pacers as much as the next person, but I believe credit should be given where due. Could the text be changed to something less pejorative? Slipdigby 20:19, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry but I think that's total bollocks mate. What do Pacers do that the Sprinter units can't? Especially in terms of cost.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sprinters have kept many of the countries rural lines reasonably secure for the last 15 years, I'm thinking of the Cambrian, North Wales, West Highland, Highland, and Far North lines in particular.</dd>

<dd>The Pacer concept has been nothing if not a complete embarassement to BREL and the railways in general. Neil</dd>

<dd>Do you have any cost comparisons, Pacer vs. Sprinter? Or are you just guessing?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It seems logical that Pacers should have been quite cheap, given the bus bodies, bus fittings, and rigidly-mounted axles vs. bogies. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 00:28, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to the honourable "Neil", the comparitive costs outlined in "British Rail 1974-97" (Gourvish, T, Oxford University press: 2002, Oxford, Pp:220), the complete authorised cost for the 328 pacer vehicles ordered between 1982 and 1985 came to £57m. The cost for the 568 Sprinter vehicles ordered between 1984 and 1985 was £151m. This means that the average Pacer vehicle cost £0.174m, whilst the average Sprinter vehicle cost £0.266m. Even assuming the effects of inflation on the figures, it is still obvious that there is a significant difference in price between the two types of vehicle.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In regards to how Sprinters have kept the Cambrian, West Highland and so forth open, what of the Esk Valley, Cumbrian Coast, East Lancs, Penistone and Bishop Auckland lines, not to mention the commuter networks of South Wales, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West and South Yorkshire, and Tyne and Wear. All of the former rely on the Pacer fleet for a large percentage of their network. Guesswork suggests that the people of Millom, Milnrow, Marton and Merthyr would prefer a cheap and nasty Pacer to no railway at all.</dd>

<p>As it stands, te history section is about 2,300 words long, only a shade shoter than the supposed "main article" (<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_rail_transport_in_Great_Britain_1948_-_1994_1fea.html" title="History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948 - 1994">History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948 - 1994</a>), which is 2,400 words long... and that had only 1,500 words until twelve hours ago! Clearly this is a slightly strange situation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article is about a particular historical organisation so any "weeding" ought to be addressed to removal of matters more appropriate to a general history of British railway transport and the deletion/removal of the "off-topic" (as it refers to current matters related to the post-BR period) "Present Locomotives and Rolling Stock" section.--<a href="../../../m/b/r/User%7EMBRZ48_08de.html" title="User:MBRZ48">MBRZ48</a> 03:46, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose merging any non-overlapping content from the history section into the 1948 - 1994 article, and then replacing the history section with something similar (or identical) the overview of the BR era at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_rail_transport_in_Great_Britain_867a.html#1948_.E2.80.93_1994_:_British_Rail" title="History of rail transport in Great Britain">History of rail transport in Great Britain</a>.
