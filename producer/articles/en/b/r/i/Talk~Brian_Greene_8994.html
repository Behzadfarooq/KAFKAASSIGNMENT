<p>Why should an encyclopedia not be entertaining to a certain degree, as was e.g. the Encyclopedia Britannica in its former and first years&#160;? I welcome all these contributions very much as they show that not all people fall for the self-promotion of some string guy who had results only on a mathematical field. The rest is science fiction. BG9123</p>
<p><br />
The Uneducated drivel that emanates from much of this talk page is rather amusing. Why are you arguing about completely subjective things? I have been in Dr. Greene's class at Columbia, the complexities of it do not even begin to rival the idiotically complex arguments under debate on this page.</p>
<hr />

I choose to place my comment right here, in your face. There is no way that he could rise to the academic level he has without being brilliant; however, the claim that at the age of 5 he could "quickly multiply 30 digit numbers" together in his mind is false. I never heard of the guy before tonight (I am watching his show on Nova), but the best child prodigies have ever done is multiplying 5 digit numbers together rapidly. Do you have any concept of what 30x30 digit multiplication involves? It is easy enough with a primitive computer, say an 8088, given quite a bit of time. No human could ever even multiply arbitrary 10 digit numbers in their head in minutes. Not now, not ever. Who is the jackass who put in that stuff? Actually I won't wait for evidence.

<p>I attended a public lecture by Dr. Greene where he stated he avoids using any animal products, such as leather, wool, eggs, or milk, whatsoever. He also expressed "concern" about using animals for medical research or testing. Would this attitude not make him a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegan.html" title="Vegan">vegan</a>, not merely a vegetarian? <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_26a7.html" title="User:Corvus">Corvus</a> 01:23, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have attended many of his lectures and he is utterly a genius. His work on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calabi-Yau_cabd.html" title="Calabi-Yau">Calabi-Yau</a> manifolds is impressive.</p>
<p>'<i><b>As brilliant as Einstein.'</b></i> I second the notion. Professor Greene is genius. The light of both blazing knowledge and innate enlightenment as well as compassion, surrounds his marvelous and wondrous presence and mind. He maintains a great balance keeping his heart in this world, though his vision looks to the greater science and universe. The latter is very difficult to do for most of us even when we dont have a clue about our ignorance. My personal preference is vegetarian which is why I started writing, but now I might just have to give up wools and silks. Sacrifice makes the world and universes go 'round. I attended Dr. greene's lecture and certainly would give anything to attend his classes. Wouldnt everyone?</p>
<dl>
<dd>How does writing two books qualify one as a genius? Sure, Greene did some good work on manifolds and strings, but none of it was earth shattering. He does not come close to Einstein in terms of his ability to decipher the inner workings of the universe. A smart guy, but let's not use the word "genius" too liberally here.

<p>Is Brian Greene really "one of the world's foremost string theorists?" Shouldn't that title be reserved for people like Leonard Susskind and Ed Witten? Writing a few popular science books and being interviewed for Nova do not make you a "foremost string theorist." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarahjane10784_0e82.html" title="User:Sarahjane10784">Sarahjane10784</a> 04:02, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Says, who. I have no objection, i have reservations though about missing quotes and citation sources making many wikipedian articles sub standart (not that it would matter in this specific case.Slicky 20:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whether Greene is a genius or not cannot be easily decided. However, his role within the theoretical physics community can actually be measured through the ranking in citations his papers receive. If you look up the last (5-year) <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/play/authors/2004/top_5_rank.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/play/authors/2004/top_5_rank.shtml" rel="nofollow">ranking</a> of top-cited theory authors at the Stanford University SPIRES database, you'll find that he ranks no. 622. That is a far cry from being foremost, and also tells you he is not be described as one of the "fathers of mirror symmetry" as done in Wikipedia, for that would have placed him much higher in this list. He is certainly foremost in publicizing string theory, but that's it! I therefore advocate to change foremost to "one of the best-known" or something. N.Nahber 07:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've made this change. To further back up my argument, I mention that unlike Witten, M. Green, Susskind and others B. Greene is not among the other SPIRES list that ranks <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/play/authors/2004/top_all_rank.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/play/authors/2004/top_all_rank.shtml" rel="nofollow">all-time topcited theory authors</a>.N.Nahber 08:13, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry. You're all stroking Mr. Green like he is God's gift to physics. Have you seen 'The Elegant Universe'? I've seen it once and watched part of it a second time (with my girlfriend: I thought she hadn't seen it so I thought I'd watch it again, but then she realized she had seen it and remembered she hated it. We quickly turned it off). I like how Green can take up so much time talking about the "promises" of string theory, and never actually say what it does now. If string theory this, if string theory that. Get to the point! And where does NOVA get off having the guy host the show and being interviewed on the show??? Come on, that's just bad TV. I think Green's arrogance has eleven dimensions.</p>
<p>I think that it would be wise if you shut up, because Brian Greene is much smarter than you will ever be. (Also the equations in String Theory have no anomalies.)</p>

<p>I have to laugh at all this interest in what he eats, whom he fathers, how he looks.

<dd>I'm more concerned with those who would attack a brilliant scientist solely for being good at communicating effectively with non-scientists.

<dd>If what you really mean is that you disagree with Greene's conclusions, well, there are far better venues in which to do so than a Wikipedia talk page. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicrotonal_a29e.html" title="User:Microtonal">Microtonal</a> 00:00, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This being an encyclopedia, it is possible that some people might be interested in those new explanations of the universe and its workings. Microtonal, I suppose that it is acceptable to have an article that mentions that he is a vegan, has a Bacon number, appeared on Comedy Central and also in a film entitled "Frequency." But, it is not acceptable to declare that he uses uninformative metaphors such as "the texture of reality." <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 02:27, 19 February 2006 (UTC)Lestrade

<dd>I don't have my copy of <i>The Fabric of the Cosmos</i> handy, so I can't tell whether "the texture of reality" is Greene's metaphor or a paraphrase by whomever inserted that sentence into the article.</dd>

<dd>But to be quite honest, I have no idea what your problem is. Are you dissatisfied with this article as it is currently constituted, or are you actually attacking Greene himself? What exactly do you find "uninformative" about his metaphors, and why is it "unacceptable" to represent Greene's work accurately, if that is indeed the case? Please explain yourself more clearly. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicrotonal_a29e.html" title="User:Microtonal">Microtonal</a> 08:56, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The adulation expressed on the Discussion page is puerile. On the Article page, the mention of his dietary habits and his celebrity are trivial. Is Brian Greene working on the solution to some of the most important human problems? Can he tell us what progress is being made? When I am told that there are numerous dimensions coiled into the fabric of the cosmos, I feel as though I am listening to a charlatan or carnival barker. To say that space and time are like a piece of material out of which the universe is tailored seems almost to willfully mislead readers. It is an assertive, declarative reduction of the unknown to that which is commonly known. Readers of an encyclopedia deserve to be warned that all such explanations are not literal. The explanations are absolutely figurative and totally fictional. This issue has more importance than his diet, his Bacon number, and his childhood math skills. But, since it is not discussed, readers may blithely accept the metaphors for the actuality. That is almost purposeful deception. There may be readers of Wikipedia who want to really know the importance of Brian Greene's work. They may not want childish explanations that dogmatically equate very large or small scale objects and events to those of common experience. Is it condescending to explain nature as though it was made of strings and curved sheets of cloth? Should a reader who is puzzled about gravitation contentedly accept Green's explanation of balls rolling on rubber sheets and thereby be excused from any further thought on the subject? I would think that such a Wikipedia article would dangerously affect the thinking of young readers by perpetuating these fictional accounts of the physical world's operations.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 15:11, 19 February 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>

<dd>Your claims amount to a blatant <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_personal_incredulity.html" title="Argument from personal incredulity">argument from personal incredulity</a>. You're attacking the entire conceptual basis of modern theoretical physics simply because you don't "get" the metaphors used in the field. Describing the unknown metaphorically in terms of the known is not only common, but absolutely <i>crucial</i> for useful communication with non-specialists. It is in absolutely no way whatsoever "condescending" to explain things to non-specialists in terms that they can actually understand, rather than in obscure, opaque jargon that only a small number people use effectively, or even worse, in raw mathematics. Greene's metaphors are backed up by more than 200 years of real-world research and experimentation, and are endorsed by every practicing physicist in the world. The fact that you personally feel "deceived" by such metaphors is not Greene's fault, and it has no place in this article. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicrotonal_a29e.html" title="User:Microtonal">Microtonal</a> 23:18, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't want my opinions included in the article. I want the article to honestly express whatever progress has been made by Brian Greene and his fellow physicists. I also want to see the article without metaphor that can be taken literally. Whether I understand the metaphor or not is immaterial. The article should openly express the fact that mere metaphors are being used. Gravitation cannot actually be a curved sheet of rubber. The basic components or the world cannot be strings. The universe cannot have coiled dimensions in a fabric. The probability that these false images correctly depict the actual natural world is infinitely small. To bring closure to the public's curiosity by employing such figurative language is a willful deception. How many people today will contentedly claim that the universe is made of strings and that gravitation is a warped fabric of space and time? This is the result of the use of metaphor and analogy such as is found in the article and in Brian Greene's books and television productions.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 01:55, 20 February 2006 (UTC)Lestrade
