<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mami Wata &amp; Vodou</span></h2>
<p>Hello brain:</p>
<p>We have listed some academic references on the Vodou page as requested. However, we are having our edits deleted on the Mami Wata page. We have tried to review the "Edit Summary" page, so that we can leave one, with each edit, but it appears blank. Please state why again, the Mami Wata article is being reverted without any explanation. There needs to be the contribution of Mami Wata initiates and those who are actually personally involved in its ceremonies. If not, another generation will be mis-informed with the same anthropological mythical information about the ancient religion.</p>
<p>Thanks, Anagossii</p>

<p>Brian, I will respond on my talk page later your question posed there. I am at work now and can't address adequately. This may be tonight, it may be this weekend. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Changed my mind, I'll reply here, since someone else has chimed in here as well. I'm not yet ready to sign on to an RFC has having tried to contact the user and resolve the problem. I'm going to be editing the article occasionally, until I get a response. Somewhat of the "bold, revert, discuss" cycle - I don't have the confidence in my own diplomacy to brashly assert that that will work. But it will give an opportunity for discussion of the issues that I see arising. Either the problem will be ameliorated, or I'll end up in the position to join an RFC. I will probably also invite one or two solid editors from other religious backgrounds to come along. On this article, I'm outside my zone of confidence in my ability to maintain a NPOV, as you can see from the POV risk declarations on my userpage. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:32, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, thanks for any help along the way. Like I said, I plan to prepare a second version of the article in my userspace (probably at <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_Draft_9a8a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson/Draft">User:BrianSmithson/Draft</a>. At this point, the article is a mouthpiece for Mama Zogb√© (who has her own <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mama_Zogb%C3%A9_e51a.html" title="Mama Zogb√©">article</a> now, I might add) rather than a scholarly look at the subject. ‚Äî <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 02:59, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mami Wata troubles</span></h2>
<p>I recently stumbled across you Mami Wata troubles and I have to agree with you--this article has turned into an <i>absolute mess</i>. In its present form, the article seems to be more propoganda than information. It is</p>
<ul>
<li>riddled with citation problems (it uses at least two different reference systems);</li>
<li>relies on questionable sources (UFOs?!?);</li>
<li>unsourced claims (from the second image's caption: 1540 B.C.E. faience image of <i>Mami</i>, "snake goddess" found in the Palace of Knossos in ancient Crete. I have never seen this deity referred to by any name except <i>Snake Goddess</i>--no one know who she really was since the Minoan civilization mysteriously disappeared, leaving few records behind.);</li>
<li>original research;</li>
<li>reference section is a mess.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a very good article on a very interesting subject when you first began, but it now appears to to have been hijacked.</p>
<p>I went on JSTOR and found some more <i>scholarly</i> sources for you to use (if you want) if you decide to rewrite:</p>

<dd>Thanks for the help. I have access to JSTOR at my local university library, so that list is helpful. I have copies of the Drewal and Bastian articles ready to read through and take notes on. I'm not quite sure what the best course of action is at this point ‚Äî either file an RfC against Mwhs, or write a rival article in my user space and then plop it on top of the mess that's there now. Doesn't help that I'm headed to Japan to teach English in less than three weeks! If you can stomach it, keep an eye on <a href="../../../m/a/m/Talk%7EMami_Wata_e79b.html" title="Talk:Mami Wata">Talk:Mami Wata</a> and pipe in if you feel so led. ‚Äî <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 21:43, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the difference is that Mel Blanc was simply mimicking a Mexican accent, not doing an authentic one. He was playing it up for humor and not going for naturalism. If Speedy had been played by a Mexican voice actor, I would have no problem calling his accent simply Mexican. But I think that we need some sort of modifier there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Henry Miller Shreve</span></h2>
<p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>I have two biographies of Henry Shreve. They're both a mix of fact and myth and I don't recommend either one. They are "Conquering the rivers" by Edith McCall and "Master of the Mississippi" by Florence L. Dorsey.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a great deal of myth associated with Shreve. The source appears to be two biographic articles- actually closer to historical novels- penned by Samuel Treat in 1848.</p>
<p>Shreve was a great man in his own right. If Shreve were alive, I don't think he would approve of the myths associated with his name.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I enjoyed my experience and I will try to make a few more contributions for the purpose of conveying the truth about our American history.</p>

I sort of had an edit war last night with him at the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> article which another editor and I are trying to overhaul. Treybien keeps deleting large amounts of content and adding trivial information to plot summaries. He is not leaving edit summaries or notes on the article's talk page. He finally contacted me (on my user page, not talk page‚Äîtwice) after I placed two vandalism warning templates on his talk page. In my opinion, what he was doing was a form of vandalism; I explained to him that his edits were not helpful and why. He hasn't edited Palpatine since last night (but it appears he moved on to Padm√© after I gave him the article as a reference of a <i>Star Wars</i> FA).</p>
<p>I don't think that his intents are malicious, but he is making these types of edits all over the place and has been contacted by other users in the past. Should I contact an admin if he does this again? <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoon1_9743.html" title="User:Dmoon1">Dmoon1</a> 12:23, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It might be better to request feedback from the Star Wars wikiproject and/or people who monitor <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> (if he's causing the articles to violate that guideline). If you can establish that he's violating consensus, then an admin can do something to stop it. But first it needs preferably to be clear that most people don't agree with his edits. (Witness my long battle over the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mami_Wata_3afa.html" title="Mami Wata">Mami Wata</a> article. Because it was me vs. one other user, my only recourse so far has been to try to negotiate.) In short, I'd label this a content dispute (not vandalism) until the guy's clearly acting against consensus.

<p>I knew there was a bounty, but that was not really my incentive to work on the article. This is something the Star Wars WikiProject plans on doing to all of its articles, it has just been a very slow process. There has been some resistance to the out-of-universe perspective and <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">Marudubshinki</a> is one of those opposed to this change (as evidenced by the discussion on the <a href="../../../j/a/b/Talk%7EJabba_the_Hutt_54b2.html#Update.2Frewrite_of_article" title="Talk:Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt talk page here</a>). He made the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Palpatine_archive1_a414.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Palpatine/archive1">original Palpatine nomination at FAC</a> which failed. This convinced him that there was <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_Archive_42_a282.html#Jabba_the_Hutt" title="User talk:Marudubshinki/Archive 42">some sort of bias against <i>Star Wars</i> articles</a>. The fact that he would decide to remove the bounty on the article at the moment it has wide support at FAC does not really surprise me, as his adminship is now <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Marudubshinki_63e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Marudubshinki">under review at ArbCom</a> for abusing his powers.</p>
<p>It would not have been fair to collect his bounty, because he was really looking for someone to pass the article in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palpatine&amp;oldid=29189028" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palpatine&amp;oldid=29189028" rel="nofollow">version very similar to the one he nominated for FAC</a>, and my revision looks nothing like that. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDmoon1_9743.html" title="User:Dmoon1">Dmoon1</a> 23:13, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Charlie the Red Dog</span></h2>
<p>How can be there never such a cartoon of Charlie the Red Dog, it was aired on some Hungarian program, but I could not understand Hungarian. Although he is brown-reddish, the kids would like to see him. But the dog is still unknown. I don't think it was mostly the reruns of Charlie's Angels, although it has his name on there, but has never any relations to the character.</p>
<p>B.S, if you didn't see the character and the show, your town probably still didn't have an ABC affliate at all. I know Disney owns the right of these characters, although the movies they are currently airing on ABC have not featured the dog. But, the FOX network did not appear until the late 1980's or early 1990's. That doesn't make sense to blame the networks, ABC strongly denied last year or two, they were going to all-reality programming.</p>

<p>Thank you for your concerns. Here's the problem with them:</p>
<p>If you read some of the other comments above, and I've said this many times, you'll understand that a lot of your complaints are really just being anti-what the trends in FAs are rather than against the article itself. First of all, a lot of the sites you have problems with are actually well-respected sites within the community, so they could be considered reliable. Direct quotes from the game itself are required.

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>How are things going? I see you're now in Japan - you've not lost the urge to live in interesting places since Cameroon then! Things are still going nicely here in Rwanda - I've almost finished the translation project now and looking for something else to move onto.

Cameroon won 3-0 though so no major surprise there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm mainly writing because I've just submitted my first article to FAC - <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maraba_Coffee_fcfa.html" title="Maraba Coffee">Maraba Coffee</a>, a fair trade coffee produced here in Rwanda, which I thought you might be interested in looking at and supporting (or opposing) at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>.</p>

<p>Brian - Thank you for your question, which implies (I hope!) that I might have once had a (small) positive impact. After being unfairly hounded by another user and his pet admin, I have lowered my profile on Wikipedia, trimmed my watchlist to a bare minimum, and have stopped participating in the "community".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some help needed</span></h2>
<p>Hey Brian, what's up? I need your help with a slightly rambunctuous user. Most of the following description has been copied from the talk page of <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Boswell_c574.html" title="User:Phil Boswell">Phil Boswell</a>, whom I wrote to initially. You can read my comments there or here (although it's probably best if you stick here since there's some updated info in this entry).</p>
<p>Anyway, I humbly request that you take a look at a user who is acting in such an absurd pathological manner that it's gotten quite irritating. Let me just give you some short background so you can better understand the situation. A few days ago, on September 16, I responded to an RFC request for the article <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront_%28website%29.html" title="Stormfront (website)">Stormfront</a>, which is about a Neo-Nazi website. There was an edit dispute between <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_to_the_Facts_edc7.html" title="User:Stick to the Facts">User:Stick to the Facts</a> and User:Poison sf about neutrality and tone. At first, I and <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">User:Alecmconroy</a> were the ones mostly involved in the RFC, but eventually other editors came.</p>
<p>Anyway, editing disputes continued even after we came. Stick to the Facts was <a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStick_to_the_Facts_963d.html" title="User talk:Stick to the Facts">banned for 24 hours</a> after a 3RR violation. In the meantime the rest of us worked on neutralizing the tone, but after Stick's ban expired, he began acting in a very bizarre fashion. He started flagrantly accusing people of vandalism when there was just an edit dispute. He accused me personally of vandalism no less than 3 times; just check the bottom of <a href="../../../u/b/e/User_talk%7EUberCryxic_1ddf.html" title="User talk:UberCryxic">my talk page</a>. He accused about 4 or 5 well-meaning editors of vandalism and continued to undo our edits on the Stormfront article under the guise of Wikipedia's vandalism policy, which of course does not apply here at all. Furthermore, his edits almost always went against the consensus that was reached on the talk page. The user behaved very unilaterally. After checking Stick's edit history since first registering on September 1, 2006, I found that his edits on Wikipedia were almost exclusively confined to the article.</p>
<p>But, it goes on. A few days ago, Stick opened a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Poison_sf_21c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Poison sf">RFCU on Poison</a> and accused him of having no less than 6 sockpuppets. One of those sockpuppets was me apparently (and I've been here since January, made thousands of edits, and written four featured articles, so Poison sure used me well), but also several other people that are obviously experienced Wikipedia editors who are <i>clearly</i> not sockpuppets. Stick's main premise is that we started to edit the article at around the same time that the edit dispute got hot, so we're somehow involved with Poison in a conspiratorial way. He accused me of lying about coming in when I saw the RFC, suggesting I came before (he even completely fabricated a time about my first edit in the article; you can see that in the RFCU). Yet if you look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;offset=20060917002833&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stormfront_%28website%29&amp;offset=20060917002833&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article's history</a>, the first edit I made was on 17:49 September 16 whereas the RFC for the article was opened by Poison at 15:59 on the same day (see the RFC <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Politics_5012.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Politics">here</a>). Even more alarming than this nomination and the allegations, the RFCU was actually carried out, despite all the bogus evidence! Surprise surprise there was no connection, but Stick has still continued to troll on my userpage accusing me (or this account rather) of being that of another editor.</p>
<p>He's made wild charges like this for several days now and is actually annoying a number of well-meaning editors. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplicitImplicity_97b8.html" title="User:ExplicitImplicity">User:ExplicitImplicity</a> wrote this in the RFCU page: "I am unsure if i should laugh or cry." He's just generally behaving in an odd way and lying pathologically. More depressing, however, he is hiding behind his <i>faulty</i> understanding of Wikipedia policies, which apparently he's a master at after having been here for a grand total of three weeks, to undertake what is nothing less than a campaign of slander and article domination. Beyond the first 3RR and continuing incivility, I don't think there is actually anything that makes his offenses blockable. After all, we don't block people on Wikipedia if they're weird. I was just wondering if you could please give him a very strong message to stop acting erratically. I and many other users have done this already on his talk page, but you can probably see what the difference would be if an administrator did it.</p>
<p>Finally, I am <i>very sorry</i> to take up so much of your time, but this is a pressing matter. I believe users like him, who are here only to subvert the policies of Wikipedia, are even more dangerous than casual vandals. I would really like your opinion on this matter and hopefully a warning against Stick. Thank you very much and, again, sorry for bothering you with this.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 19:28, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I've glanced over the links you've provided, and that looks like quite a mess. I think that if I were to post to his talk page, it would just be more fuel for the fire, since he'd see that you contacted me here. I think at this point the best you can do is to keep an eye out for any 3RR violations on his part and report those. Also, be sure to keep a cool head. If this escalates to an RfArb on Stick to the Facts (which may be the only way to solve this), he will more than likely try to file a countercase against you and the others with whom he is in disagreement. The more cool and civil you have been to this guy, the better the chances that the case against you will be denied or open-and-shut in your favor. It sucks that things have gotten to this point, but this person does not seem to be willing to listen to consensus, so it may be time to file something with the Arbitration Committee. ‚Äî <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 08:23, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll take a look at his behavior in the next few days and see if I need to "go there." If he cools down and starts to act appropriately, I don't think there's any reason for RFAR.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">B'hoy and g'hal - It's Syksey</span></h2>
<p>I know this is a minor point - literally a placement of a letter- but if you check Herbert Asbury's <i>Gangs of New York</i> the spelling of the b'hoy is definitely Syksey.

<p>I changed your dates on the birth/death of Robert McKimson since your information was incorrect. And yes, I realize that it is incorrect at many other online sources as well. We, as Robert McKimson's family, are working to correct that information as well. Thank you for your interest in him.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Robert McKimson</span></h2>
<p>Brian, unfortunately I do not possess a copy of his birth or death certificate. My mother might, but she is not very computer-savvy and did not see the point of my trying to correct the incorrect information listed on the web. I am pretty sure she would object to my providing such a personal document to someone she doesn't know. I will be visiting my grandfather's grave before the holidays and can provide an image of his gravestone with the dates on it, but that won't be for about two months. Since the original information was obviously not verified, can my word as his granddaughter stand until then?</p>

<p>As of October 2006, our project has somehow faltered in the past few months, due to little activity, and now I am counting on you to help me bring it back to life. The main page of our project, from the looks of things, is halfway done; your appreciation is greatly welcome if you want to get it complete.

<p>Don't permit your personal opinions interfere or cry POV with historical fact and its recording. You should not remove credible sources either. If you know nothing of history you should not comment. No I'm not user Christchurch but I'm concerned all the same. 213.122.73.141 12:42, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a difference between presenting referenced "facts" and presenting a one-sided, referenced view of history. Christchurch's edits skewed the article way too far toward a pro-Colonialist viewpoint. I was fully justified to do what I did. ‚Äî <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 22:29, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the correction to the name, sources seem to use a variety of orders and spellings. Could you add the full citation for <i>Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon</i> to the References section under <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seidou_Njimoluh_Njoya_db7e.html" title="Seidou Njimoluh Njoya">Seidou Njimoluh Njoya</a>? Also when moving an article it is polite to check for redirects by clicking on <i>What links here</i>. In this case, you could then have corrected <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers_of_the_Bamum_b528.html" title="Rulers of the Bamum">Rulers of the Bamum</a> as well. I have made the corrections to Seidou Njimoluh Njoya and Ibrahim Njoya there, but given your access to the <i>Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon</i> there may be more that need to be made in the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rulers_of_the_Bamum_b528.html" title="Rulers of the Bamum">Rulers of the Bamum</a> article. <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 18:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thanks</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for putting the photos in place, Brian. I have three photos in a digital camera now that I took from books. However, my computer will not "acquire the images." It is some problem with the computer hookup.</p>
<p>I took one of the photos that you posted for me and tried to follow the steps but could not make any sense. All of the photos seem to have nearly the same captions.</p>
<p>I may have a half dozen other requests coming up in the next month.</p>
