<p>Here is the translation, that needs some editing:</p>
<p>There are a few legends about the island Barsa-Kelmes, for examples: the observation of prehistoric lizards, or the landings of UFO. There is a common belief that time on the island flows differently. Some people who lost their way and spent there, as they thought, just a few hours where returned in a few days. Some refuges hidden themselves there for a year wend back home in a few decades. However these claims were not supported by the facts and, as thought, the result of mystifications.</p>
<p>One of the authors of such mystifications was the science fiction writer <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Lukyanenko_3809.html" title="Sergey Lukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a> who admitted in the “Information Summary of KLF MGU” (at the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow_University_dccb.html" title="Moscow University">Moscow University</a>): “The stories about flying saucers and machines of time at Barsa-Kelmes that are presented by “TM” (the magazine “Tekhnika Molodyozhi”) as true facts were taken completely out of thin air. Independently of each other newer and newer generations were joined this game. And if we do not stop this chitchat, our grand children will organize expeditions to the unhappy islet. So I have to repent my sins. And cheerful picture from “TM”, where pteranodon bears in the beak flying saucer, alas, it is without foundation”.</p>
<p>In June <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, the 80th expedition of "<i><a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosmopoisk.html" title="Kosmopoisk">Kosmopoisk</a></i>" took place here.

<p>I felt that the Image Tagging template was a little too patronising for a user who's been around as long as you have&#160;:) Nevertheless, that's the gist of what I'll attempt to say in this message. I accidentally reverted, then re-reverted the above image, so Orphanbot instructed me to take off the {{fairuse}} tag and replace it with something more appropriate. I substituted with {{promophoto}}, but I guess you should provide the source info.

<dd>It's from the BBC website. But as you said, it's probably got too high a resolution to be fair use. I suppose it's gonna go, then. Pity.

<p>I've been away for a while from Did you know, and I'm kind of missing some info. How long are items supposed to stick on the main page before they become stale nowadays? Also, I think the template indicating the new refreshment time is broken. It states the last update was 9 hours ago, when in fact it was 6 hours ago.

<p>As the author of Chaos Theory of Literature, I'm completely fine with having my article criticized -- perhaps I was hasty in thinking it proper to assign an entire theory to this area of study. I accept all criticisms from you folks who have more experience than I on Wikipedia. I will defer without protest to whatever the WP community decides.</p>
<p>However, calling the page (and its contents) "pomo garbage" is a bit harsh, don't you think? The works I mentioned and the insight they offer are important to me; perhaps there is a way to change the content of the article in a way that doesn't bash its very existence. I am very much opposed to the cult of postmodernism and its relentless effort to co-opt every tiny element of culture (popular and otherwise). I do not feel that this is the case here -- there are very real and significant links to be made between the findings of chaos theoreticians and the study of literature.</p>
<p>Further, I never cited Jurassic Park as evidence for anything; I merely noted that it discusses chaos theory (echoing a comment made by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7EChaos_theory_5b43.html#Shall_we_have_a_Cultural_Refrences_Section.3F" title="Talk:Chaos theory">someone else</a>). If the discussion of chaos theory in the novel isn't erudite enough, I don't know what to say. The fact remains that it is an integral theme of the novel, and that Ms. Hawkins analyzes it in detail.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that the suggestion made by Goethean on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chaos_Theory_of_Literature_b9d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chaos Theory of Literature">afd page</a> is most agreeable (doesn't it suit your erstwhile comment that "there's a big difference between using an idea as a metaphor to aid in explaining another field, and devising an all-out theory of the field"?), but -- as I said -- I will defer to the more experienced here. -- <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScartol_2ebb.html" title="User:Scartol">Scartol</a> 12:38, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brian, I've noticed that you do a lot of work with featured picture candidates, and I was wondering if you could help me out with a FAC I'm interested in getting promoted. The article is <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>, and the lead image is <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Graduale_Aboense.jpg" class="extiw" title="commons:Image:Graduale_Aboense.jpg">commons:Image:Graduale Aboense.jpg</a>. As you can see, someone recently uploaded a straightened-out version of this image, however the quality has been seriously degraded to my eye. I was wondering if you could straighten the original image with less loss in quality? Thanks very much for any time you can give.

<p>Hi. Just wanted to let you know that I removed a block you placed on User:86.140.170.23. While it was certainly a personal attack that's a British Telecom IP potentially used by alot of people. For example, it was impacting <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkittle_f631.html" title="User:Skittle">User:Skittle</a>. As that was the only edit ever under the IP address hopefully it won't be repeated. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 20:20, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Brian. I was trying out the ogg format and i used ffmpegtotheora (something like that, i renamed it so it would be easier) to convert a video that has a framerate of 30 and is 36 seconds long into an ogg file, and it ALWAYS ends up 10 seconds or less! I tried lots of different commands and just converting without any options, and it's always 10 seconds! (The "media help page" told me to contact you) If you can, please leave a reply on my talk page. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, Brian, I was hoping you could help me? User:Uzerbaaji is continually adding some foreign text to articles, which I keep reverting but he won't stop. I was hoping you could ask him to stop – I don't know what I should do. – Sophie (<a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESophielle_6803.html" title="User talk:Sophielle">talk</a>) 15:28, 9 August 2006</p>
