<p>The pupils who go to this school live in Brimington or the nearby areas. There are about 221 boys and 166 girls who attended this school in 2003 and most pupils are entitled to have free school dinners and many do. The school uniform for the boys and the girls are both consist of red and black with Black trousers and a red jumper (with the BJS logo on it) over a plain white polo shirt. The school tried some other designs for the top which were a red simple zip up tops which was greatly reserved by most of the pupils</p>

<p>The old and first building to be the Brimington Junior School was built mainly in 1878 and was a Victorian Junior school. Before it was closed as a school at that site in 1998, the school consisted of one large main building which was where most of the teaching took place, One wooden building divide into two class rooms which a toilet in between, Another building which was used for the school assembly's every day, a couple of outside toilets a wooden bike shed and an old building behind the wooden class rooms which were used for storing donations for the upcoming Summer fair and was also off limits to pupils.</p>
<p>At break times the pupils went outside into the playground which went around the main building. Near the car entrance (which was only used before or after school time) was usually where the football games happened. At dinner times there was a small school run sweet shop where you could buy pick and mix quite cheaply.</p>
<p>If you caught the only bus home you would go out the small wooden gated side entrance and follow the wall down to the end where all the whole bus users would queue up against the wall talking to friend whilst waiting for the bus. The route went from the school up to the one way system then up brimington common and into the calow area.</p>
<p>This building soon after being moved out of by the school was made into expensive private flats yet the outside of the building havenâ€™t changed much as they are most promptly listed building. One difference is that the wooden class rooms were pulled down almost straight away and were just used for extra parking space.</p>
<p>The ground in which the school used for its sports days and other important race advents was a short walk away and was later next to the new Brimington Juniors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brimington_Junior_School_8255.html" title="Edit section: The move to the new building">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The move to the new building</span></h2>
<p>The school was getting to be in bad condition and when it finally stopped being used for a school after 120 years of being open. A new Brimington junior were built not that far away from the old site and was still in walking distance for most people.</p>
<p>To celebrate the moving schools the school handed out commemorative glass tankard. The glass had a picture of the old school on the front which said "1878-1998" above it and the sentence "To commemorate 120 years and the closure of Brimington Junior School. On the back of the tank was a picture of the new Brimington Junior School and the text "To celebrate the opening of the new Brimington Junior School"</p>
<p>On the day that the pupils were to see the new school building for the first time Mr. Dumbar came up with the idea that the pupils should dress up in Victorian cloths and do the short walk from the old site to the new site dressed as like the pupils who attended the school in 1878. This was to Symbolized the student changing school buildings and worked well because every one turned dressed up. The school also had the idea that all the current pupils, at the time of the move, should paint a sink tile with there own design and this tile would go up in the years new area in the school. I made a title which consist of triangles and other shapes which is over the sink in the year four section of the new building.</p>

<p>The new and current Brimington juniors are on Springvale Road Brimington Chesterfield and is a one story building. Unlike the old one this one has different zones for the different years. The year 3's use the class rooms on the first corridor on the right after the main entrance. The year 4's use the class rooms on the corridor on from taking the left. After this you come to the Hall where assembly is hold as well as it being used as a sports courts. The cathoteria is on the left hand side corridor from the hall which then leads to the year 5 area and class rooms and then following it along it leads to the year 6 corridor and class rooms.</p>
<p>The library is in between the year 6 corridor and the year 3 and there is also a small video room which has the room for three classes to join togher and watch the same educational video.</p>
<p>The toilets are all around the school with each year having its own boys and girls toilets which were the only ones they were allowed to use.</p>
<p>Apart from the main building the only other building was the sports shed which was where all the sports equipment and also the summer fair stuff was hold. The main building was full rectangle except for the two small garden area which had small rocks, plants and even a pond. There are also two rememberial benches for Chris and Carl who were two boys ho died in an accident.</p>
<p>The playground unlike lie old one had was in two sections, the normal play ground and a bit which had 30 basket ball nets hanging up to be used which also doubled up as the football pitch area.</p>
<p>There was also a little bit of playground where the smaller kids hung out because the floor had been painted with things like hopscotch and clocks and snake and ladders.</p>
