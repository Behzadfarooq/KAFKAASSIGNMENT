<h2><span class="mw-headline">Candidate for Wikipedia's worst article</span></h2>
<p>I know I've banged on about this before, but this article really is appalling. It's been hijacked by those who want to stir up the imaginary "controversy" about the terminology. The so-called controversy is mentioned in the banner heading and the lead. Then there's a whole section, which covers almost 50% of the article. I'm thinking all of this should be removed from this article and put elsewhere, either in a brand new article, or at the Terminology article. British Isles should only mention the so-called controversy in passing. This article should really be about geography. After all, the term is principally geographic. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 21:40, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Why should the info on the controversy not be on Wikipedia? If you don't want to read about it, then don't. It doesn't do any harm, it doesn't mislead, its written from a neutral point of view. I don't paticularly agree with all of it, but in the end only 1 paragraph of a 4 paragraph introduction mentions the controversy, plus the sourced banner. After that it has its own perfectly ignorable section.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Rob, I'm not saying reference to the controvesy should be removed from Wikipedia. I'm just saying that it's dominating this article in a way that I believe it shouldn't. Of course we should write about it, but elsewhere. The terminology article would be a better location than this article, or perhaps we should have a new article about it. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 17:26, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pliny</span></h2>
<p>Can we have some proof that Pliny included Iceland in the term, or had even heard of it? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 18:52, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose you could read Pliny (the Elder) in his Naturalis Historiae. You can find Pliny in Latin and English online or in a few good academic Bookstores.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you´re only interested in this specific topic go to Book IV, Chapter 30 (the chapter on Brittania/Brittaniae, since chapter numbering isn´t always consistent) and read his description of Britannia (the island) and the islands around it, which he calls Brittaniae.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In VERY approximate order (and the order can be different in Latin and English because of sentence structure), he lists Britain (which he says was formerly known as Albion), Hibernia (Ireland), the Orkneys, then the islands between Britain and Ireland (Anglesea, the Isle of Man, Rathlin, etc), then one of the Friesan islands (which is strange because he listed most of them in the previous chapter - although Ameland may have been further from the mainland than it is now and would probably have had different inhabitants), then Thule (most commonly interpreted to be Iceland, although some feel it may be in modern Norway), then Cornwall. There is also mention of islands off Brittany (probably including Ushant), and then some places which are probably around Bergen in Norway or even further north (although he quotes other writers as describing some of the last places). Although the Latin text prefaces the description of Thule/Iceland with the phrase "last of all", it is listed in Brittaniae before mention of Cornwall and since he describes the fact that there was no winter sun, he probably didn´t mean the Canaries or the Scillies!</dd>

<dd>Can I express some surprise that you´ve been such an active and often forceful participant on these pages and haven´t read this stuff?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, as a note of caution, since I may be reading the Latin wrong, I also read the 1855 English translation and I´m mostly basing my edit on that version. I´m hesitant to trust my Latin, since the last active use was in 1985 and that feels less reliable than a scholarly 1855 translation. Actually, I guess it´s possible that my knowledge of Latin is better than Pliny´s knowledge of geography, so maybe it´s not too bad&#160;;-) <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a> 11:09, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did indeed try to access those texts but was unable to for some reason. Can I request that you reproduce the relevant two sections here? In particular, I would like to know what word Pliny used for such places as Ameland and why we are so sure of the translation - and indeed what words he used for all the places. As for Thule, if he listed it as part of the group of islands between Britain and Ireland, then it is clearly not intended to be Iceland - what could it be? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 11:52, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From Strabo..."Now Pytheas of Massilia tells us that Thule, the most northerly of the Britannic Islands, is farthest north, and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the arctic circle. But from the other writers I learn nothing on the subject — neither that there exists a certain island by the name of Thule, nor whether the northern regions are inhabitable up to the point where the summer tropic becomes the arctic circle." Strabo actually doubted that Thule even existed since there was very little source material (maybe none beyond Pytheas, who was a dodgy source), but included it in the "Britannic Islands". Now there can be LONG discussion on where Thule was, but the most widely held academic view seems to be that it was Iceland, even if this is not beyond argument. If not Iceland, the next most held view is that it was some part of Scandinavia. Personally I read all these sources with a pinch of salt.<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a> 10:38, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Islands (and island groups) listed by Plny as part of the Britanniae:</p>
<ul>
<li>Albion/Britannia = Great Britain</li>
<li>Hibernia = Ireland</li>
<li>Orcades = Orkneys</li>
<li>Acmodae = Shetlands?</li>
<li>Haebudes = Hebrides?</li>
<li>Mona = Anglesey</li>
<li>Monapia = Isle of Man</li>
<li>Ricina = Racklin?</li>
<li>Vectis = White-Horn?</li>
<li>Linmus = Dalkey?</li>
<li>Andros = Bardsey? <i>or</i> Lambay?</li>
<li>Samnis = Sian (Britanny)?</li>
<li>Axantos = Ushant (Britanny)?</li>
<li>Glaesariae/Electrides = Oeland?, Gothland?, <i>or</i> Ameland?</li>
<li>Thule = Iceland?, many other theories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ones with question marks are frankly just guesswork by scholars. As for the islands supposedly off Britanny, we might as well (on just as much evidence) say that they are actually Jersey and Guernsey, thereby giving them a good modern justification for inclusion in the British Isles.</p>
<p>Much more interesting are those islands in the North Sea (German Sea), which almost certainly refer to islands now submerged (such as Lomea off Kent which was submerged in 1099). And Thule - what about Rockall?</p>
<p>Pliny also mentions a number of other places (Mictis, Scandia, Dumna, Nerigos), but he <i>does not</i> say that these were classed under the term Britanniae. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 11:45, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The last line of the chapter on Britannia in the two English translations reads (with varied exact phrasing) "There be that make mention of others beside, to wit, Scandia, Dumna, and Bergos, and the biggest of all the rest Nerigos, from which men saile to Thule. Within one daies sailing from Thule, is the frozen sea, named of some Cronium." As far as I remember, these are the places that may represent anything up to and including the northern part of modern Norway. I can see no difference in the way these are described when compared to others in the same chapter, so I wonder how it is is possible to say that he does not include these if he does include the others in the same section. There is no break or anything that says anything like "the rest are not included under the term Brittaniae". This text is in both English translations (1601 and 1855) I have read but I cannot see it in the (incompletely proofed) online Latin version and without going to my father´s house and digging in the attic I don´t have a Latin version handy. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a> 12:38, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They <b>are</b> included (at least in the two English translations) in the Chapter on Britannia. Their inclusion in the Chapter on Britannia is <b>not</b> ambiguous. The actual locations those specific terms represent may be ambiguous or uncertain but there is published academic opinion that they are places in Scandinavia. Since Pliny´s been dead for nearly 2000 years I would love to know how you propose to provide verifiable evidence to support your view that he introduces them in "a fairly dismissive manner". I am just reading a chapter from Pliny (specifically the chapter on Britannia) and trying to summarise what is written.

<dd>Again, I am trying to summarise what Pliny said by looking at two scholarly translations and their footnotes and (sometimes but not very often) trying to make sense of the original Latin. I do not feel competent to try to figure out which phrasing "clearly implies some sort of termination" of the list, nor to come back on a 2000 year old text and to decide which of the places on the list might "in context" be considered to be "beyond" the Britanniae. Neither - if I might note - did either of the two translators in 1601 or 1855.</dd>
<dd>Pliny lists <b>all</b> these places (and Mictis is generally interpreted as being Cornwall because of the reference to tin mining) in <b>his</b> text in the section where he says he will describe the Brittaniae.</dd>
<dd>Even if you want to argue that the places identified as being on the coast of Norway and also Cornwall were - based on your courageous interpretation of what he meant to imply and what can be inferred from context - clearly "beyond" the Britanniae, you´re still left with places in the North Sea east of Britain that have been identified as being in the modern Friesan islands, Ushant, etc.,etc.,etc., and the rather clear reference to Thule (Iceland).</dd>
<dd>Again, I find it strange to say that the text clearly implies that the coast of Norway (if that´s what the last few placenames represent - which seems to be the scholarly view) is clearly "beyond" the Britanniae when Thule (Iceland or possibly someplace else in Norway) clearly is in the list and thus would belong within Pliny´s Brittaniae. That seems an extremely odd interpretation of the text. Finally, on Mictis, I would personally interpret the meaning as more likely that the Britons that Pliny´s sources knew did not live in Cornwall and had to travel to get there, but that would be only my view, and is not in the edit. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a> 17:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You keep saying that Thule is Iceland, but it was a word that could be applied to all sorts of places. In this context it is clearly referring to a much smaller island somewhere off the coast of either Britain or Ireland. You may be right about Mictis being Cornwall, but by no stretch of the imagination is it 6 days sail from Britain. And again, islands off Britanny are a pure guess, and North Sea islands could be any number of islands (such as <a href="../../../l/o/m/Lomea.html" title="Lomea">Lomea</a>) that have since been submerged. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 19:11, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't keep <b>saying</b> anything....I'm just trying to summarise refence texts. My view on Thule isn't enormously important. The majority of scholarly translators of Pliny say that Thule is - in this context - probably Iceland, but maybe parts of Norway. The classical geoographer's geography wasn't terribly good and Thule was indeed inclined to be used as a term to mean "the ends of the earth"....but in this case the scholarly view is that Pliny's Thule is either Iceland or maybe Norway.</dd>

<dd>Some scholars think that Mictis (spelled in a couple of different ways and sometimes missing the "M" might be the Isle of Wight, but most seem to view it as Cornwall, maybe specifically St. Michael's Mount. As for Lomea, I don't see any suggestion of it in any of the texts or interpretations and I know nothing about it.<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a> 18:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Diodorus Siculus</span></h2>
<p>Has anyone got a source for Diodorus Siculus other than the scanned 1814 version of his Library at Google Books or the (incomplete) versions on the Gutenberg project? The reason I ask is that the first reference to the Preteni on the British Isles page is given as being from Pytheas and from Diodorus Siculus (footnote 4 on the page). As far as I can see, Pytheas work has not survived, and I read the online version of Diodorus Siculus, but this has a different interpretation of the text than is quoted in the footnote currently in the Wikipedia edit.</p>
<p>The footnote states "Diodorus Siculus c.50BC: 'those of the Pretani who inhabit the country called Iris (Ireland)'".</p>
<p>In the scanned 1814 version in Google Books, the text is slightly different and has a footnote that interprets the term Iris differently. The 1814 text talks about "the Britains that inhabit Iris", with a footnote explaining that Iris is "some part of Britain, then so called." (the text is in Book V, Chapter II, page 317 of the 1814 version, easily found on Google Books)</p>
<p>Anyone got another version handy? Does anyone know who put in the footnote? It's a pretty important difference in the context of properly sourcing the origin of the term but dear old Diodorus isn't easy to find online.. I know this was mentioned above, in the discussion on the term Pretani, but that discussion got complicated and I'm just looking for a source reference.<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a> 18:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, no luck finding Book V online, though did find "...Ireland...by Diodorus Siculus Iris..." in Camden's Britannia <a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/irelandeng1.html#ireland1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/irelandeng1.html#ireland1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Why is this a good passage to use for the footnote? Shouldn't we be looking for a use of <i>Prettanikē</i> or <i>Pretannia</i> rather than <i>Pretani</i>?</dd>
<dd>I ran across one source contradicting the "Later Romanised as 'Brittania'" part of the footnote:
<blockquote>
<p>Scholars agree that the name Pretani, which is thus implied as a general name for their inhabitants from at least the fourth century onwards, can hardly be identical with the name Britanni...It is a very probable conjecture that Caesar, finding himself at the outset of his expedition on the borders of a Belgic tribe called Britanni and knowing that the country he was about to invade had been lately colonized from Belgic Gaul, believed himself able to correct a widespread error by substituting the forms Britanni, Britannia, for Pretani and its Latinized correlative Pretania. <cite class="book" style="font-style:normal" id="Reference-Collingwood-1990">Collingwood, R.G.; J.N.L.

</blockquote>
and one in support:
<blockquote>
<p>One of the earliest surviving texts to use the Britannia name was written by the Greek geographer Diodorus Siculus and it is widely accepted that he was drawing heavily on Pytheas. The actual name used by Diodorus was Pretannia, which in the original source would have been Prettanikē...By the first century BC the P had become B and the nickname given to the people of the island by the Gaulish Celts began to be used by Classical authors as the name of the island – Britannia. <cite class="book" style="font-style:normal" id="Reference-Cunliffe-2003">Cunliffe, Barry (2003). <i>The Celts: Very Short Introduction</i>, p. 86.</cite><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=The+Celts%3A+Very+Short+Introduction&amp;rft.title=The+Celts%3A+Very+Short+Introduction&amp;rft.aulast=Cunliffe&amp;rft.aufirst=Barry&amp;rft.date=2003&amp;rft.pages=p.+86">&#160;</span></p>

<dd>Hi... can you tell me the name of the book from the link you gave? I can´t see it on the page. I´ve seen various ideas for the Pretani/Britannia switch, but some indeed seem to view the Pretani term as a sort of catch-all term for "here be painted barbarians" and the term Britain as a post-Julius name for a specific people. For me the most interesting area is the years between the Romans and Sebastian Munster´s 1550 Map, when the term Britain and British existed, but I can´t find a single reference to the British Isles.....even on English/British maps from the middle ages.

<dd>From my POV it's not hugely important if it's in Latin or English (or old english). It's just that 1500 years is a BIG gap in the use of the term, and this can support the view that the modern term is a political resurrection of a classical term. I'd be a little surprised if 1621 is really the first reference in English, given the correspondence between Mercator and his English and Scottish map sources in the 1500's. Meantime, apart from more clarification on Diodorus, references in any language to "The British Isles" that aren't copies of Pliny or Ptolemy in the period AD 100 to AD 1600 would be great to find. I've been looking, haven't found any. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 12:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>I think what is at issue here is the literal meaing of British Isles - meaning the islands owned by Britian - which is disliked in Ireland. After 700 years+ of invasion, irish people are trying to distance themselves from statements that would suggest they are still under british control. This is fact, not opinion. So i would say either mention this in the article or rename it "West Europeon Isles" or something geographicly correct like that. --212.2.165.62 21:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the banner must be removed by the <b>British Editors</b> then the leading paragraphs must be reworked to reflect the fact that most people in Ireland do not class themselves in the British isles. British isles is/was political term, and probably still is. 86.42.132.84 23:54, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

If it is being removed from atlases from next year, and it is only one brand of atlas I hasten to add, then that means it is currently in Irish printed and produced atlases thereby it is indeed used.

<p>Billthekid77, SIGN YOUR POSTS!

<dd>The term "British Isles" IS a widely used term with a reasonably well understood definition, the archipelago (group of islands) IS a geographical and geological reality (except fot the Channel Islands), and the term "British Isles" IS offensive to many (or some, or whatever proportion) people in Ireland. That header had been stable and accurately reflected all the above facts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If people want a page on the "Anglo Celtic Isles" (a term practically nobody actually uses) then let them write such a page. If anyone ever goes looking for information on that term they'll find it. Meantime, this page can talk about the term "British Isles", its climate, geography etc. and the term's origins and whether or not it is a political term can be addressed calmly in the text and with reference to original source material and not POV. Alternative terms can be mentioned in the section "Alternative terms", where they are now. Meantime - a couple of ettiquette points.
<dl>
<dd>1. AFAIK an Irish Minister cannot speak on behalf of the Irish state or the Irish people any more than a UK Minister or one from Bhutan. The right to speak on behalf of the people is a privelige reserved for the head of state. The Irish President can speak on behalf of the people. A Minister can speak on behalf of the government. I believe it's the same principle in the UK and many other states.</dd>
<dd>2. Not only is the controversy real, but the Irish Embassy in London actually went so far as to say "We would discourage its useage.” (<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2385403.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2385403.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>)</dd>

<dd>If a government of a sovereign state has gone so far to say that they do not use, nor recognise, nor encourage the use of a term, that is important. Look at how Wikipedia treats the words Burma, Madras, Bombay, etc. Those are old names of states or cities and they just redirect to the new name. "British Isles" is a shared term without official standing and with disputed meaning or usage and an article must reflect the facts in a reasonable way. Burying the fact that the government (and some/many) of the people of one of the two sovereign states covered by the area of the "British Isles" object to the term way down deep in the text is unreasonable and denies externally verifiable reality. The controversy (which is easy to find on wikipedia but not the only place it exists) needs to be front dead centre and then the rest of the page can be dealt with calmly and without having to put disclaimers and modifiers all over the place. Some people might not like the term and others might not like the fact that it's controversial but the term and the controversy both exist.<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">hughsheehy</a>, 09:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fully agree that the term and dislike of the term exist, but as pointed out by <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a>] in <a href="#.22dab.22_header" title="">#"dab" header</a> above this is not what banners are for: the argument should be neutrally noted in the lead, which it is. The question is one of position in the lead: should this question be elevated in importance purely for fear of edit warring? The Embassy has said "We would discourage its useage”, and the ministerial statement said that the embassy monitored its usage, but there's no evidence that they actually DO discourage its usage which remains common. The CAIN report provides good evidence that the term is politically charged in Northern Ireland, and while only a minority seem to get really worked up about it in the Republic, its use appears to be generally avoided. All of which should be noted in the article. However, as was discussed long ago, this leaves <i>British Isles</i> as the only generally known term for the group of islands. By the way, I think it was the Irish Times that used Wikipedia as the main evidence for "controversy" - it was discussed here at the time. As was done earlier, I'll move the "banner" into an early place in the lead.. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 10:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ah the banner. BTW, hughs' point about ministers not speaking for the state is a very valid one, one I've tried to make before, but one he makes in a much more eloquent way than I ever did. Similarly his point two is important.</p>
<p>The banner started life as a link to British Isles terminology and was pretty much the same as the one at England, United Kingdom etc etc (in fact I even created a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Template%7EBritish_Isles_%28terminology%29_4f27.html" title="Template:British Isles (terminology)">template</a>.

<dd>The problem is that no opinion poll has ever been conducted in the Republic of Ireland to find out what proportion of its population don't like the term. We therefore have to fall back on anecdotal evidence, and I really don't think it's unreasonable to state that such evidence as there is strongly seems to indicate that most people in Ireland really don't care. The term is used, without causing comment, in the Irish parliament, in official government reports, and by government ministers. There are undoubtedly people in Ireland who don't like the term, but for all we know they might be such a small group that every single one of them has appeared here on Wikipedia editing this article. Whilst I'm not seriously suggesting that this is actually the case, it highlights the fact that a vocal minority cannot and should not speak on behalf of an entire country. But even if the entire population of the Republic of Ireland refused to use the term (which isn't the case), then they would still only constitute one in fifteen of the entire population of the British Isles. This is a minority that is large enough to have its views mentioned, but small enough that those views should not overwhelm the entire article. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 09:49, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Has a survey ever been conducted in the UK - or anywhere else? (I'm aware of at least two informal surveys in Ireland) Since there are no surveys, maybe only a few dictionary editors around the world ever use the term. Maybe no-one other than a vocal minority of people come onto Wikipedia and insist that the term is widely used.......let's not be silly. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 11:21, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">Here</a> is a term far, far, far, far, far more offensive to many more people than "the British Isles", use of which (by those who have no respect for their fellow man) can (rightly) lose one one's job or land one in prison, yet it doesn't have banners plastered over it to tiptoe around the sensitivities of a handful of editors. It calmly and factually states the offensiveness in an encyclopaedic tone <i>within the contents of the article</i>. No banner needed. Also, some editors need to consider that Wikipedia reports on things as they are, not how they should be or how <i>they</i> want them to be. The fact of the matter is that if this article devotes <i>too</i> much space to the controversy then it becomes a political POV-pushing essay. Why can't our Irish friends be as mature about this as our French ones when discussing the <b>English</b> Channel?

<dd>Obviously France isn't "in" the English Channel, you idiot, but they don't call it the "English" Channel. They call it La Manche, but noone has seen fit to put a banner at the top of the French article saying that the term English is offensive to them.

<dd>Apologies, I was only trying to stem a debate to which was the most offensive word, the b-word, or the n-word. To me, the b-word is actually more offensive. It must be remembered that b's were most offensive during colonial times, and taking life, especially of the downtrodden was second nature.

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; Thanks for the hint - just changed channel to find Dublin being described as scarcely Irish at all in its history, founded by invaders as a viking Blackpool, Guinness founded by an Anglo-Norman family and a statue of Britannia atop a building – Irish sounding guy says "secretly, Dublin is still a little bit British.. Dublin was the second city of the Empire", contested by the presenter who reckons that was Glasgow, and describes Dublin now as second to no-one. Well, the programme is claimed to be about the British Isles. ... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 20:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC) de-<a href="../../../g/r/e/Greengrocer%27s_apostrophe.html" title="Greengrocer's apostrophe">greengrocer's apostrophe</a> .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 11:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I recall that the promotional trailers for the programme on BBCtv were highlighting that the new series includes the entire British Isles. There is no claim that the RoI is British (although some of Ireland is, although the programmes seem to be omitting any overt references to nations/countries anyway) — but it is the label to use to ensure that most people in the UK (at least) will know that the whole set of islands is being talked about; any other label would be either unclear or unwieldy. Should RTE have produced the new series and needed to promote the inclusion of all islands in the group, how would that have been worded? <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 09:32, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>British Isles</i> is really mainly a British <i>thing</i>. We in Ireland don't use the term. And there are many atlases and internet maps that don't use the term either. It's not universally used, and probably the article does reflect that fact to a degree. It's not really a dispute, it's just more about reality. 86.42.147.234 14:55, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A concise reply which I understand, thank you. I've been following the voluminous circular discussions on this page on and off for a while, but the question I asked above and which I've asked before has never been answered: what label (other than British Isles which you say is not used) do you if you want to talk about all the islands together? It might be that nobody in Ireland ever wants to do this, but I'd be surprised if it never came up. (I'm not after any official names which our respective politicians feel oblige to tiptoe around, just normal folks like you&#160;:-) .) <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 15:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>We in Ireland don't use the term.</i> We don't? What about the examples used in this very article? From the Dáil, to school atlases (bar one, from the next print run sometime next year) to the thousands of examples you can find by googling "British Isles" on google.ie and restricting the results to Irish sites. Sure, many <i>don't</i> use it... but stating that it isn't used is flying in the face of reason. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 16:43, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, <i>Britain and Ireland</i> is the term usually used in Ireland. Irish people do not feel the need to use <i>British Isles</i> because the term is pretty meaningless to them. Why not use Wales when we allude to Wales, or Scotland when we allude to Scotland, and the same for England and Ireland. Britain in the above context pertains to all things in the realm of Britain, including it's islands. And the same for Ireland. British Isles is just a term invented about 400 years ago. What did we call them before then? It's not really a problem as such. It's more about the real world as I mentioned earlier. 86.42.147.234 16:38, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Remark</b>; No, I am not disputing anything. It all depends on your perspective. I, and millions of people all over the world would never use the term. To me the term is meaningless. It did mean something pre 1922 when it was a political term. And if Scotland ever took independence as a nation, which would be wonderful, it would almost certainly refer to itself as Scotland and Scotland only. 86.42.147.234 21:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; Tharkuncoll and others - don´t you realise that even in the event of Scotland leaving the UK (which is not entirely implausible) it´s not geography that would be repudiated, just the name. Names are "repudiated" all the time. Batavia, Bombay, Burma, Rhodesia, Dingle, etc.,etc.,etc. (I wish people would read the page and the archives...right now I am reminded of a song from the past..."you spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round round round.) Hughsheehy (still on a keyboard with no tildes)</p>
<p>Meantime, on the British Isles page, we could note the issue and move on to describe the geography, climate, flora and fauna of the various islands and (heaven help me) maybe even mention history. We could cover alternative terms in the section on alternative terms and if anyone wants to write a page on "Britain and Ireland" or the "Anglo-Celtic Isles" they can do so. I believe pages for some of the alternative terms are long in place. hughsheehy (sorry, still no tildes)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hugh, in the editing page try highlighting the tildes next to "Sign your name:" two lines down from the save / preview / changes buttons, copy and paste. As for the hypothetical question, if the SNP gain power at the parliament elections, if they get a referendum, if it goes their way, if they gain separation, and if they're then in power, quite likely even thinking British will be made a thought crime after the burning of atlases following the Scottish Parliament Building fire... hypothetically.. bit off topic, though.

As I (and others) have said, if there´s a fight about the name, let´s mention it top dead centre then move on. If there is a new name someday, fine. If not, the notice on the dispute can stay. If the name becomes uncontroversial (again) then the notice can go. Meantime, if someone believes the name is political or not - or that only wild eyed Irish Nationalists don´t like it - or that only Tory Imperialists still use the name, provide evidence or calm down. Saying something 1000 times doesn´t make something true and certainly won´t make doubters believe. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 21:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Google hits</span></h2>
<p>The section detailing Google hits for "Britain and Ireland" as against "British Isles" is useless, meaningless rubbish - should we take it out? The term "Britain and Ireland" will cover many instances of use not intended as a replacement for "British Isles", e.g. <i>English is spoken in Britain and Ireland</i>. The reference to the BBC site using the term "British Isles and Ireland" is also worthless. All it demonstrates is ignorance on the part of the writer. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 23:48, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, google will also pull up pages with "Great Britain and Ireland, formerly known as the British Isles".. Ah well. Meantime, reliable published sources (newspapers in Ireland) provide data to support that the term is offensive, so can we stop going round on that one? Also, it now becomes REALLY difficult to assert that the term British Isles is actually more common in use than the other terms, which are demonstrably (even if I haven´t got a non-google source) in common use...just as it´s easy to show that British Isles is often used to mean things other than the current definition.

<dd>So since it appears that Google CAN be use, may we put the alternative terms and their approximate frequency back in - even with only google as the (imperfect) source? Bastun - will you do that or will I? We can add whatever words are appropriate to indicate that the google frequency is only indicative, perhaps in a footnote. It seems to be more helpful than continued discussions on "I know better than you do". As for Kevin Myers, he's certainly controversial but it's interesting to point out that he's also (please correct me if I'm wrong) English by birth, which does tweak the continued bilateralism on this page.. In any case, I suppose that a factual phrase would be "Several major Irish newspapers have expressed the view that the term is often considered offensive in Ireland". <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 11:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Remove indent) Google can certainly be used, as pointed out by Rob - <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">policy</a> - in certain circumstances. And from that page: "See Further judgment: the Google test checks popular usage, not correctness. For example, a search for the incorrect Charles Windsor gives 10 times more results than the correct Charles Mountbatten-Windsor." If the Google results were only only going to be slightly off, fair enough. But that clearly won't be the case. A search for "British Isles" returns <i>x</i>. A search for "Britain and Ireland", for example, will return <i>y</i>. But the pages containing <i>y</i> will include many different contexts where the term is clearly not being used as a replacement or alternative to "British Isles": "The EU consists of France, Germany... Britain and Ireland." "There were storms over Northern France, Britain and Ireland." "The respective ministers from Briatin and Ireland met to discuss the St. Andrews Agreement." And so on. The <i>y</i> result will therefore contain a vast number of false results. Putting it into an encyclopedia (even with a footnote saying basically "This result is wrong") is pointless. Again, this has <b>already</b> been debated on these talk pages. Certainly the sentence on "Several major Irish newspapers..." can be included - if you can cite sources. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 13:53, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Except that I used google on "Great Britain and Ireland", which will reduce the number of false positives significantly since the term "Great Britain" is more common in formal use. In addition, the search for "Britain and Ireland" will include all the hits for "Great Britain and Ireland" but not vice versa. Next, the only aim is to get an approximate indication of popularity in usage so the result would be inaccurate, but not wrong. (there is a big difference) Then, before Arcturus and Tharkuncoll say it again, the aim is to look at usage of alternatives, NOT to state that one or the other is correct.</dd>

Floccinaucinihilipilification has a dictionary definition too, but I challenge you to find it in common use. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 02:37, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry to be verbose, but a follow on point. The section I added on the alternative terms seems to me to be completely in line with the policy on google use in the section on checking idiomatic usage. Why should it not be included? I appreciate and share the concern on using google hits as a deterministic input, but as an indicator it is allowed and approved by Wikipedia policy. And sorry, but I don´t regard the fact that this issue has been discussed on this talk page as being a very serious objection if google use (in that way) is allowed. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 02:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

In my view, it's OK to use Google result counts in an informal talk page discussion in an attempt to reach consensus, but deciding on your own search terms and including your search results in the main article is definitely <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 10:04, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; Again, having read all the policies and guidelines, I disagree. The NOR policy states that something is NOR if;</p>
<pre>
   * It introduces a theory or method of solution;
   * It introduces original ideas;
   * It defines new terms;
   * It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;
   * It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;
   * It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;
   * It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source.
</pre>
<p>The only possible count would be number 5. First, I don´t believe that I was trying to introduce an "argument", and in any case then the only question is then whether google hits are a "reputable source". All I was trying to do is provide some justification for a list of alternative terms, and Google´s guideline seems to apply to that and approve that kind of use.</p>

<dd><b>Idiomatic usage</b>. The English language often has multiple terms for a single concept, particularly given regional dialects. A series of searches for different forms of a name reveals some approximation of their relative popularity. For a quick comparison of relative usage try googlefight, e.g. comparing deoxyribose nucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. Note that there are cases where this googletest can be overruled, such as when an international standard has been set, as in the case of aluminium.</dd>

<p>So, again, the paragraph I entered (and which has since been replaced with entirely unsupported text) was meant to reorder the alternative terms so that their listing reflected their frequency of usage. That shouldn´t be a difficult subject and I think the paragraph met that need, and meantime it should not be difficult to agree that the listing/ranking was approx right. I´m open to suggestions on how to do it, but am not happy with the previous or current situation where there is text with NO SOURCE AT ALL. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 20:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not entirely convinced by the OR argument, but onnly really because I really don't understand that policy. I don't like it cos its bad style and because I think there's a big difference between using google to present arguments here, and quoting it in the article.</p>
<p>I do agree that a source would be preferable here but I think there could be a better way of doing this.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 22:46, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd see more of a conflict with Point 6 rather than Point 5, to be honest: <i>"It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;"</i>. And there is still no reliable way of eliminating the false positives from any result. I disagree too that 'Great Britain' is used more often in a formal context than just 'Britain'. The only common uses of it that I'm really aware of are in the full phrase 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland' - and in sports, where for some reason the UK uses the term 'Great Britain' or 'GB' rather than 'United Kingdom' or UK. Ultimately, though, this an article on the British Isles. I really don't see what the problem is in simply including an 'Alternative Terms' section as it exists now, listing the alternative terms and giving examples of their usage, rather than trying to 'prove' that one term is more popular than another. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 23:45, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure how point 6 would apply, since I'm not sure what particular case I <i>favour</i>...or could be said to favour in that section, and in any case the debate on google as a "reputable source" would apply. Even if I had some funny POV I wanted in that section, I can't fake results on google. As for "Proving" that one alternative is more popular than another, I don't think it should be - or was - said like that. It should - and I think/hope - was used to indicate which alternatives were common and which ones were not. That does imply an indication of common-ness, but we shouldn't be too demanding on <b>any</b> source for quantification of idiomatic usage.</dd>

<dd>Remember, the list of alternatives used to start withsomething like IONA (apparently beloved of the BNP) and the "Anglo-Celtic Isles", neither of which are actually common in use, and neglected "Great Britain and Ireland", "Britain and Ireland" and had "The British Isles and Ireland" right at the bottom of the list. That was - IMHO - a bad order for the edit. Then, if I was to change the order, I felt I had to have evidence before doing so, so I looked for evidence and found it. Now, should we ignore the evidence and have a bad edit, or what? <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 11:37, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whilst I don't doubt that the phrase "(Great) Britain and Ireland" is enormously more common than such contrived and fundamentally inaccurate terms as "IONA" and "Anglo-Celtic Isles", the Google search is flawed because we are not comparing like with like. Consider such sentences as the following, for example: "The Isle of Man lies between (Great) Britain and Ireland", "The Irish Sea separates (Great) Britain and Ireland", or even "The two largest islands in the British Isles are (Great) Britain and Ireland." In all these and similar cases, the term "(Great) Britain and Ireland" is not being used as a single, collective noun, but simply as two nouns that happen to fall together in a sentence, and therefore is not in any sense simply a substitute for "British Isles". <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Or what. :-P I don't think anyone could <i>realistically</i> dispute that 'Britain and Ireland', 'Great Britain and Ireland' or even 'British Isles and Ireland' are <b>far</b> more commonly used than 'IONA' or 'Anglo-Celtic Isles'. The current order is therefore fine, in my opinion. You're dead right that the previous order was a bad edit. If in the (unlikely) event of a non-troll challenging the current order, that would be the time to set up a Googlefight, I think - and the proper place for the debate - and any resulting stats - would be the Talk page. Yes, there is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> but really common sense can and should apply too.

<dd>TharkunColl's point certainly has some merit, and I'm sure there would be many others possibilities too (e.g. my example from several pages up). If we take first the internal order in the list of alternatives, can we use google to INDICATE the order of common-ness just within that list? Given the different rankings from google it hardly seems likely to be terribly controversial that (Great) Britain and Ireland is used as a collective alternative for The British Isles more often than the phrase IONA, and the appropriate words shouldn't be hard to find. Then, since there appears to be significant sensitivity about suggesting an indicative frequency of use in comparison with the phrase "British Isles" itself (i.e. outside the list of alternatives), at least partially because (Great) Britain and Ireland may often turn up as a series of words rather than a phrase, we can leave that debate for another day and another method of proving or disproving the hypothesis. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:43, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Google search for <i>"british isles"</i> comes up 1,990,000, from which in all fairness we must subtract 27,400 for the (absurd) phrase <i>"british isles and ireland"</i>, leaving 1,962,600. <i>"britain and ireland"</i> comes up with 1,280,000, but in strict accuracy we must distinguish this from the phrase <i>"great britain and ireland"</i>, which is after all different, which comes up with 954,000, leaving just 326,000. In surprise second place, therefore, is <b>Great</b> Britain and Ireland. It still suffers from all the problems concerned with collective nouns discussed above, but one thing that we can remove is all instances where it occurs as part of the historical term <i>"united kingdom of great britain and ireland"</i>, which comes up as 115,000, leaving just 839,000. Therefore, British Isles is considerably more than <i>twice</i> as popular as its nearest rival (Great Britain and Ireland), even ignoring the unknown number of times that Great Britain, and Ireland, are used as two separate nouns. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 17:24, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; "Tiny" and "utterly" are unsupported modifiers....even by reference to google hits :-)) Meantime there may (or may not) be a minority. If it is a minority it may or may not be a tiny one. We'll probably get towards the facts of it by looking at usage. The space given to the fact that there is controversy may be excessive (or not). In any case, as I said before, to come with a 15:1 argument about the population of the UK vs the population of the Republic of Ireland is designed to validate the views of the most extreme nationalists and is (IMHO) unhelpful. Any time that "I'm bigger than you" is the only argument is likely to be unhelpful. This appears to be a situation where at least some appreciable fraction of a neighbouring country is saying "hey, we don't like that term". Perhaps a response of "I don't care about what you think, I prefer to refer to the authority of 2000 year old Greek guy" might not be such a sensitive response. It's been mentioned here several times and it's not a perfect analog, but "nigger" has a long classical history as a word and was initially only rejected by a (tiny) minority of the people it was applied to. Now, "British" and "nigger" are not equivalent, but the idea that respect for people's feeling is important is relevant in both cases. I know that British people don't like to be referred to as UKish (pronounced Yuk-ish), so even if it might be an accurate representation of the name of the state as converted into a nationality, it's probably not polite. I live in Spain(Catalunya), so let's not even start with that one! <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 19:32, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A neighbouring country to whom? You are assuming that the term British Isles is in some way specific to Britain. All of the early uses of it in English intended to term to refer to, or be derived from, the Celtic inhabitants of the islands. In this sense the Irish are far more "British" than the English. I have never heard the term "Yukish" before but it really wouldn't bother me, no matter how offensive it was intended to be. As for the "I'm bigger than you" argument, it really refers to how common the term is in English. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 00:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Negative reflection of Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>This is obviously an out-of-date, and outdated, term. In the first place and most importantly, it is now technical incorrect.</p>
<p>In general, it is no-longer generally, commercially, or academically used, and is a politically sensitive term for many in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and to others in Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>It is considered a highly offensive term by many in both the North and South of Ireland. Those who support the term are often doing so because they are politically extremely polarised, or just polarised in historic argument to a small percentage of the people who dislike the term, while the general population has no affiliation with the name, and arguably never has.</p>
<p>The fact that greater focus is not giving to the fact the term is out-of-date (‘old and not useful or correct’ - cambridge.org) amounts to another very negative blur on Wikipedia. Wikipedia should be a dynamic factual international source, not one that has a place for relics of past British imperialism. The context of any ‘British Isles’ article should be historical. 86.42.173.232 21:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Perspectives in Ireland</span></h2>
<p>Mel, some points: The mentions of James give historical perspective as to why there is a controversy at all. The term BI is not "highly" controversial in Ireland - for most people, it's not something they're bothered about. But lets not get into the debate about whether its "highly", "very", "somewhat" or "considered by some/many to be..." controversial and just leave it unqualified. 'Sovereignty' is an exception to the 'i before e' rule<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sovereignty" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sovereignty" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>- and I challenge you to find me any Irish citizen who actually believes "that the United Kingdom retains soveriegnty over the Republic." <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 01:45, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a matter of fact, the BNP, in common with the IRA, prefers to use IONA - so is it any wonder that few other people do? In any case, your argument is flawed. The vast majority of people who live in the British Isles use that term without any hint of political motivation, and only a small minority, probably mostly in Ireland, refuse to acknowledge this. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 19:25, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Didn't you like my discovery of the phrase British Isles (in Latin) from the 10th century? You didn't comment on it, anyway, and I thought you were looking for such things.</dd>
<dd>It is pretty clear reading the ancient sources that the term British Isles is actually older than the term Britain (which was originally called Albion). It is also clear that the island only received the name Britain under Roman influence, as that part of the British Isles over which they had control. If they had deemed it worthwhile to conquer Ireland it would no doubt have been classed as part of "Britannia". British Isles is an ancient, Celtic name. The Irish have just as much ownership of it as the inhabitants of Britain. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:02, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don´t understand the reference to me "liking" your discovery? What has my "liking" got to do with it? I come here when I can (hence no response for a while), and I am interested in such things, and it seems to be a good reference. I am hoping to be able to make some sort of (non-exhaustive) list of references to the term (or alternatives, or major sources that used no collective term) over the years. The current WP edit has references all over the place, with all sorts of points of view imposed on the text. As for the ancient sources, as we´ve seen, Iceland and maybe bits of Norway were also included in what was termed the British Isles, so perhaps the Icelanders and Norwegians have as much ownership of it as the inhabitants of Britain. The question behind the controversy seems to be (A) whether or not people still want to own it (or be owned by it) and (B) whether that fact is relevant. Apart from that, the term was used whenever it was used. We can surely put together a list of examples through the years. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 12:55, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meantime, this again illustrates the lack of facts here. Arcturus and TharkunColl keep saying the controversy is non-existent, but provide no data to support this.

<dd>No, I didn't suggest that. I'd been reading the above and noted that there was "discussion" about whether or not information about the controversy should be moved out to a separate page. Some people seem to say no, it shouldn't be moved because it's very important and at the same time say it must be written about in voluminous detail. My observation was that if it is judged so important, then that, de facto, means it should have its own page. Wanting and eating cake springs to mind. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 13:12, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">most dictionary definitions include Ireland</span></h2>
<p>'In Northern Ireland nationalists reject the term British Isles and use the awkward and ambiguous description these islands as an alternative, whereas unionists, when countering nationalist insistence on the territorial integrity of the island of Ireland, change the geographical frame of reference to that of the whole island-group that they call the British Isles, according to Guelke.</p>
<p>[...]The British government currently uses British Islands (as defined in the Interpretation Act, 1978) to refer to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, together with the Crown Dependencies: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey (which in turn includes the smaller islands of Alderney, Herm and Sark) in the Channel Islands; and the Isle of Man. <a href="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/British_Isles'" class="external free" title="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/British_Isles'" rel="nofollow">http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/British_Isles'</a></p>
<p>As can be seen above the term 'these islands' is used by nationalists and can be seen as equally POV, even more so if the normal dictionary definitions can be said to outline normal use of the term.</p>

<p>-I agree though that just using it to include Northern Island- as the British government does- is probably the most reasonable way to use it, as that part is part of the UK. Why argue with the UK governments' definition and most frequently accepted definitions?

<dd>I think you're misreading that. The British government uses British <i>Islands</i> - specifically - as a legal term precisely because British <i>Isles</i> was already taken.

<dd>Whether or not "The British Isles" is being used as a political term, it is also used in ways that are varied and often confusing. As has been pointed out, even the BBC and other major UK media often (not always, but often) use the term "The British Isles" as a synonym for "British Islands", or even as a synonym for the UK. Since dictionaries generally use usage as their guide, it is perfectly possible that dictionaries will eventually update the definition to note this confusion.

<dd>Hugh, how do you know they are using "British Isles" as a synonym for "British Islands"? On the BBC weather forecast a couple of nights ago <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Avery_0e98.html" title="Philip Avery">Philip Avery</a> used "British Isles" several times and it was abundantly clear what he meant - the whole group of Islands, including Ireland. Clearly it's a useful term for weather forecasters. I believe most people who use the term understand precisely what it means and use it correctly. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 17:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made a list of lots of places that the BBC used the term in various different ways and posted it on the discussion page a couple of months ago, either here or on the terminology page. The BBC (and other UK media) use the term to mean all sorts of things, including the definition that this page uses. I have no doubt that the weather forecast often uses the term in that way, but Philip Avery on the weather forecast is just one sample. It´s a fact that the term gets used in a bunch of other ways - including as in "The British Isles and Ireland". (the specific question of whether that then includes NI or not, and thus whether the implied definition of "Isles" is the same as "Islands" is far too scary to get into).</dd>

<dd>As I said then, I hesitate to put in an edit any view that says to the BBC or other major media that their usage of a term (in an obviously professionally edited context and not just in quotation) is not "correct". I can say that it is inconsistent and confusing...although I got accused of pushing an "Irish Republican agenda" by saying that. I think that - if you look - you´ll see that use of the term in ways that imply clearly different definitions is not at all uncommon. I hesitate to say that it´s the majority use or even close, but it´s certainly not uncommon. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 22:41, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">MAJOR UNILATERAL EDIT TO PAGE</span></h2>
<p>TharkunColl has made a major edit to this page, deleting entire sections, without first building any consensus. Apart from moving references to the controversy, he has deleted whole sections on the origin of the term and surely broken lots of WP links. The addition of the new controvery page may - or may not - be a good idea, but it seems strange that it is done by TharkunColl, who has long asserted that the controversy is tiny and artificial and thus not even worthy of mention on the main page. Now, it is suddenly getting its own page. This seems like a bad faith edit. In addition, the main remnants of the page are now historical and political, which is strange for an entry on something that he (and others) have repeatedly said is a non-political geographical term. These changes may need to be reverted. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 16:21, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope you are not suggesting bad faith on my part. I have repeatedly said that the controversy section is <i>too large</i>. Now that it has its own article it can be as large as it likes. And I did not delete anything at all - the origins of the term can now be found at the beginning of the main article. All the rest, word for word, is in the new article. I have deleted nothing!</dd>

<dd>I am not <b>yet</b> suggesting bad faith. However, the fact that you are asking questions on the terminology page that you already know the answer to from a discussion on the british isles page (or vice versa) is not a good sign - especially since you asked the question with the accusation that someone (probably me in the specific case) was "muddying the waters". In addition, making a large unilateral edits deleting huge chunks of text that others may feel belongs on this page for several reasons is hardly polite. You have also said that the controvery takes up too much space (which is probably true, and the page was too messy and often written in emotive or POV language), but your main argument was that the controvery is tiny - which does not match setting up an entire page to cover it. Finally, <b>of course</b> a geographical unit has a history, but it´s hardly the main point - if it´s a geographical unit. The history entry on Scandinavia is very short. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 16:42, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reasoning is very simple. There was so much detailed info about the controversy - mostly rather one sided - that it overburdened and distorted the whole article. If it needs to be so detailed then it needs its own article. You will notice that there is still a paragraph in the intro that mentions the objections to the term, and this is fair and reasonable. Furthermore, the link to the new article is right at the beginning. I cannot understand why there should be any objections to this. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 23:21, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Reduce indent) Seems logical. The contoversy is highlighted right at the start, leads to further information specifically on the controversy, and yet no longer dominates the article.

<dl>
<dd>Well <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> is controversial. The term itself is POV. Many parts are re-edited and re-edited from a POV perspective. Now POV is not a dirty word. Everyone who wants to edit this article has POV. Let's get the POV correct at least. And since it is claimed to be an nonpolitical term, let's take the history section to a different page, the geography section could do with a separate page too. And the climate page. It has been suggested the the BI page should be very short and brief. Well I have proposed that in the past. Maybe we should go down that avenue with the article.MelForbes 01:44, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That may all be true and a separate page MIGHT be a good idea (although i doubt it). However, the problem with POV editing is now simply likely to be doubled,with POV edits on the "controversy" page saying it´s not controversial (or shouldn´t be), and new people coming here to re-insert the "controversy" again. The same is already the case with the "terminology" page. Good luck trying to keep POV off all three pages. It´ll be a nightmare. There are lots of other problems too, but that´s going to be a major one.</dd>
<dd>Much easier would be to edit the main page with clear and non-POV edits that simply reference the disagreement on the term, then move on. As an example, right now the whole section on "alternative terms" is in controversy, which is silly. These are fact, not controversy. I simply don´t see the need for creation of a separate page. It´s overkill for an issue that can be recognised in a few sentences on the main page - if only people would stop denying the existence of the issue while simulateously proposing it is major enough to get its own page.</dd>
<dd>Again, serious editors will require much more patience to track down the edits on multiple pages instead of one. I am opposed. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're missing the point about why a page is split. It is because a section of an article has become long enough to warrant having its own page (or, from the other side of the fence, too long for its current page). I agree with the split because the section on the naming controversy is too long. I have inserted a summary of the new article as required by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html#Breaking_out_a_controversial_section" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article_size#Breaking_out_a_controversial_section</a>.

<p>Well I'm not going to agree that its an edit I'd paticularly agree with but if consensus is developing then who am I to disagree?</p>
<p>What I would now suggest, though, is that a summary paragraph is needed here. We can then perhaps remove the slightly unstylish links from the intro (or at least pipelink them!).

I therefore wonder if <i>one</i> of them ought to be reinserted. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 00:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is it time for some edits back to the previous stable-ish version? I see little support for this change and quite a few objections. I see a "controversy" page that is silly, a straightforward argument that has now resulted in three pages on WP instead of one, and a future proliferation of the same information in three different versions - all of which will continue to be argued about. Again, I feel that the controversy/disagreement about the name can be handled simply, up front, in the kind of banner that Mel and Rob also support and the rest of the article can be handled in a clean way. The current situation with multiple pages covering slightly different flavours of the same information is a mess. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 07:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Remember that the only reason for splitting a section out of an article should be because it is getting too long. That, I recall, was what was happening to this article. Such splits must <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html#Breaking_out_a_controversial_section" title="Wikipedia:Article size">avoid removing any controversial information</a> which is why I originally followed general good practice and inserted a summary text about the naming controversy with a "main article" link to the new article. I would like to see that back again here; but merging the two back again to recreate the unwieldy page we had before would not be a good move. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 13:27, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The problem for a long time has been that there was repeated insertion and then removal of assertions that the term was offensive to some, leading to new insertions and deletions all over the article. If there is consensus that the controversy/disagreement/dislike exists then this behaviour might stop and we could present the facts (which apparantly are not actually controversial any more) and get on with it. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 08:49, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi- I just want to comment that the name British attached to anything is an old throw back to the days when the rape of other countries made the British strong enough to impose a will on vast swathes of the world. There is nothing British about where i am from... though i have heard that about 200k britons live on Ireland and a welcome to them! simply this then - Ireland is not British (never was - if you consider the name as based on celtic peoples, the ancient Irish coming from differnet stock as the British). I dont know anyone who uses the term on this side of the Irish Sea - and truth be told i wouldnt use it without thinking of centuries of struggle oppression and warfare. so for the people who commented that minority opinion on this should be sidelined i would remind them the minority is the only other independent country of a pair. but having said all that... synonyms are common in all languages - you can call it the british isles if you fancy being childish and can't give up the "old empire", and we'll simply not refer to any geographical association between us and ye. Ireland and Britain covers it just aswell for me.</p>
<p>To the editors - do not edit too heavily as its a fair comment - unfortunately when people are involved differences regularly appear. the term British Isles is offensive.</p>

Great Britain, to the east, covers 83,698 square miles (216,777 km²), over half of the total landmass of the group; Ireland, to the west, covers 32,589 square miles (84,406 km²). The other larger islands are situated to the north and west of the group, in the Hebrides and Shetland Islands.</i> ... It's the last sentence: first the Hebrides and Shetland are not "to the north and west of the group" The may be north but certainly not west. Second, if we are listing "other larger islands", what about Mainland Orkney, the Isle of Wight and Anglesey? Oh and the Isle of Man? To add to my confusion the next paragraph lists the islands starting with Great Britain and then an indented list implying that the smaller islands are part of Great Britain, which they may well be but the para I quote above states "The two biggest being Great Britain ..." <a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 18:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current map is OK until you examine it closely.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of the term</span></h2>
<p>Just checking the references on Bede and Athelstan. First, as far as I can see, it is not at all clear that the reference to Bede is referring to the British Isles. The section quoted, where the text now indicates that the reference to "islands" means the British Isles reads "In his time the Arian heresy broke out, and although it was detected and condemned in the Council of Nice, yet it nevertheless infected not only all the churches of the continent, but even those of the islands, with its pestilent and fatal doctrines. " Second, the reference to Athelstan is not adequate to support the text inserted. The reference is to a translation page, which doesn´t cover the history. The assertion is that the various Kings submitted and gave fealty to Athelstan. The reference doesn´t support this. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 09:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ping. Any thoughts? I have found a reference in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles that supports fealty being given to Athelstan by various Kings in Britain, but nothing to support fealty by any Irish (or Norse-Irish) Kings....and it wasn't in 937 as the edit currently states, but in 926. If no-one has better information I'll have to put in my own version and tag it with "verification needed". Similarly, the Bede reference isn't 100% unsatisfactory. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 16:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Second statement in the article</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>"The term British Isles is often misunderstood, and is sometimes considered objectionable"</b></li>
</ul>
<p>This implies that one must misunderstand the term to find it objectionable - which is not true. I understand the arguments about the age of the term and that it predates the Act of Union, but I still find the term objectionable, from an Irish perspective.</p>
<p>My objection is not to the etymology of the term, it is that the word "British" is immediately associated with the United Kingdom in most people's minds.</p>
<p>I would like to rephrase the above quoted statement to something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>"The term "British Isles" is often mistakenly associated strictly with the United Kingdom or with Great Britain. For this reason, many people in Ireland object to the use of this term to refer to the archipelago as a whole."</b></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">First sentence</span></h2>
<p>User:MelForbes has twice changed the first sentence to read: "The <b>British Isles</b> is a term sometimes used to refer to the group of islands off the northwest coast of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Europe_11b3.html" title="Continental Europe">continental Europe</a> consisting of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and a number of smaller surrounding <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islands.html" title="Islands">islands</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islets.html" title="Islets">islets</a>." This, in my opinion, is ridiculous. The first time I reverted back to "The BI is the term used to refer to..." I put in the edit summary "By the same logic, <a href="../../../p/a/p/Paper.html" title="Paper">paper</a> is a term sometimes used to describe treated <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodpulp.html" title="Woodpulp">woodpulp</a>" (something Mel also apparently disagrees with). Mel, we know you strongly dislike the term, but wishing something does not make it so. The term 'British Isles' <b>is</b> the term used by the majority of people on these islands - and the rest of the world - to describe them. If you want to bring in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, I refer you to the various googlewars already reported on these talk pages.

<dd>Looks like your <b>raison d’être</b> is to revert me on the BI page. It's not your first offence. If you can make the article better, then by all means, go ahead. I reverted another editor, then you started reverting my revert. It's not about opinions, it's about reality. The term British Isles has 2 meanings. One is quasi-political and the other is quasi-geographical. Anyone who claims that the term is used by all and sundry is an absolute pov-pusher. Even the American map from 1926 used on the page doesn't mention the term British Isles. I agree that the term is used and is widely known. The term is rarely used in sovereign Ireland, and if you say anything else, you must not be getting out that much. It's not a universal term. Therefore I am reverting you until the sentence is agreeable. MelForbes 01:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>*sigh* Then I'll be reverting back, per your own arguments. Agreed it's not about opinions, it's about reality, and agreed it's rarely used in Ireland. But it <i>is</i> used.

<dd>I agree with Bastun wrt reverting to a version about reality, but it should be a NPOV version. Now the term British Isles is used quite a bit and used more often than sometimes. By saying 'sometimes' the term is used, (I suspect) some political bias maybe employed in this decision, although the same could also be said with using 'often'. So I think the best option is not to use either and just say that it is <u>a</u> (not <u>the</u>) term used to describe the islands. The term is used as mostly a geographical name and less so political, it seems only the Irish want to make it into a politcal term. I have never used it or seen it used as a political term and I believe the majority would use it as a geographical term ONLY, the majority being those outside the Republic of Ireland (which is probably a ratio of 125 to 1 by English speakers at least).

<p>Hello people, I'm just catching up on the feast of fun that is the 'British Isles' page...having been involved in the extensive discussion about it over the past summer. I see that debate has reignited of late (sigh). I'm from the Republic and, as related previously, am one of many who greatly dislike and avoid the term 'British Isles'...for reasons that must be all too plain! I personally use 'these Islands' or 'Anglo-Celtic Isles' instead. Given the thoroughness expected of any encyclopedic entry and the sensitivity that so many of us Ireland have with the term, I am very glad that the following text appears in the opening paragraph of the article introduction: '<b>...and is sometimes considered objectionable. The term is not used to any great extent in the Republic of Ireland.'</b> I would word this rather more strongly, however this is just about acceptable - I would strongly oppose any further dilution. The link to a fuller explanation of the controversy is a good compromise, avoiding the bitter editing wars that were a feature of last summer. To user Bastun, to back up what several of my countrymen have been saying, I must emphasise that objection to this term is widespread in our country - ranging from avoidance of its use to outright derision at its utterance! This is mainstream feeling and cannot be dismissed as the preserve of any radical minority. I cannot stress how important this is to us. Possibly before you joined us, there was a debate and vote as to whether the then 'British Isles' (terminology)' article should be renamed 'Britain &amp; Ireland (terminology)'. The result of the vote sadly was 25 to 16 against, or thereabouts. This does at least serve to show that the controversy over the term 'British Isles' is quite significant. A fair and reasonable article on the term has to have a clear reference to this controversy. Well done user MelForbes (and others) for fighting the corner this time...let me know if you want me to provide any further clarifications!:O) Kind regards &amp; Happy New Year! <a href="../../../p/c/o/User%7EPconlon_df5e.html" title="User:Pconlon">Pconlon</a> 18:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi again, PConlon, and Happy New Year to you too. Being Irish born and bred, I'm well aware of mainstream Irish opinion on the term. I'd say the majority opinion is probably widespread indifference, to be honest - but I fully acknowledge that it is objectionable to some - those "some" being far more than a radical minority. However, as no survey has ever been done on this issue in Ireland (to my knowledge), we've nothing to back up anyone's claims, for, against, or <i>really</i> against :-P I agree the link to the controversy is a good idea.

<p>It seems to me that it is critical in any good article to define terms at the outset, not as a quasi-footnote long after even diligent readers have given up wading through detail (a crime to which I plead guilty, as can be seen from the edit history). So I've moved the Terminology paragraph up to just after History of the term. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_King_2192.html" title="User:Red King">Red King</a> 17:30, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

My own opinion is that what needs to be in there are four clear statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A definition of the British Isles;</li>
<li>Reference to the existence of the two sovereign states (and crown dependancy), all of which should be linked to;</li>
<li>Recognition that the term can be confusing or misunderstood (with a link to the terminology fork);</li>
<li>Recognition that the term is objected to and/or controversial (with a link to the naming dispute article).</li>

<dd>Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting a ban on editing, or anything like it, till every minute change has been thrashed out, debated, amended, and voted on :-) What I'm suggesting is that if an editor thinks or knows his or her edit is likely to be controversial or unpopular, that it would be a good idea in that case to talk about it here first. Trying to force through a controversial change is pointless - it'll just lead to blocks and page protection. Trying to come up with something that everyone can at least live with would, I think, be more productive.</dd>
<dd>As it happens - I think it was Hugh who was editing around the same time I posted the proposal - the version there now is quite good and an excellent starting point. I can certainly live with the first line, and the only improvement I'd suggest is to split or rearrange the second sentence: <i>"The term British Isles can be misunderstood, and is sometimes considered objectionable, primarily in Ireland"</i> as I still think it implies that its mainly misunderstood in Ireland. While it <i>is</i> misunderstood here, I think it happens more often from abroad (as evidenced by Sony Youth in the Terminology fork and copied below). I'd suggest it be changed to:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>"The term British Isles is sometimes considered objectionable, primarily in Ireland.

<dd>I'd love that that were true; but havn't we got an example of an article from BBC Weather referring to the country of the British Isles? And didn't someone bring up a faux pas from a British TV guide when discussing the recent Coast series? Until <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> becomes a mandatory part of the national carriculums (carricula? carriculae? carriculum?) of the UK and Ireland, I'm afraid that I'm not convinced that we know where we are! <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 13:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Curricula' :-) Yep, undoubtedly there are mistakes made by the British, who at least should know better, but I believe the further away from Ireland you get, the more the 'BI' term in particular (and British/Irish relations, politics and borders in general) is unknown or misundersttod. A friend was once asked by a US <i>geography</i> teacher how long it took to drive from Dublin to London - and only last month a consultant from Canada that we had in work here in Dublin asked us why when he'd driven to Belfast at the weekend, all the postboxes were red and there were Union Jacks flying! <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 14:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
