<p>Hi Brian; thanks for your edits to <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson_Taylor_4602.html" title="Hudson Taylor">Hudson Taylor</a>. I noticed that you have been adding alot of "red" links to the article; that is, linking people who do not have articles on Wikipedia. Normally, that's fine, so long as the person whose name you are linking deserves a Wikipedia article. Wikipedia has <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">guidelines</a> for determining whether or not someone should have an article, but in general, linking people like Grace Dyer Taylor (Taylor's first surviving daughter) is a waste, because she isn't notable except for the fact that she was related to Hudson Taylor. Even Taylor's wife doesn't deserve a link, unless she herself did something spectacular. Hope these comments help. If you have any questions about how Wikipedia works, feel free to leave a note on my <a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer">talk page</a>; I'd be happy to help you out.

<dd>In that case, you're probably right, and you've touched on an important test of notability—that if biographers have devoted significant amounts of print to someone's life, they may warrant an article. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">[es]</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 21:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah the joys of popular culture. For some reason that I only partially understand, human beings spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the here and now. So it seems that everyone is creating websites and writing wikipedia articles for Simpsons characters and Pokemon characters and other largely useless things. Meanwhile, not as many people are writing books about the lesser known but definitely more important people that had an impact on history, and fewer still are writing Wikipedia articles based on those books. It's called <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">systemic bias</a>, and it's something that Wikipedia is never going to fully eliminate. We're always going to be biased toward current events, American/English/Australian/Indian topics, and technology/science. However, to be fair, most of our readers have similarly short attention spans (What! There was life before I was born?) and thus having gigabytes of information on minor plot characters might actually be helpful, or at least interesting, to some people.</dd>
<dd>Sorry for the diatribe—I came to answer a simple question and got sidetracked. Anyway, I don't have immediate access to a biography of Hudson Taylor; to source the article I just used the claims made on the website I added early in the article's development. I imagine that it is verifiable (number of churches he worked with, number of people per church around that time, etc.), so we ought to be able to find a more reliable source to back it up. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Spangineer" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:Spangineer">ws</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 02:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please take a look at <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>, especially point 8. An image of a book cover can't be used as an illustration of a person, just as an illustration of the book.

<dd>I got the Brainerd reference (page 109 in my version), but I couldn't find Muller. Also, there's mention on page 109 about Taylor's other books. I'd like to incorporate these somehow into the flow of the article (rather than have a separate section on all the authors he read), but we'll see. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:Spangineer" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:Spangineer">ws</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 17:38, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Brian. I've moved Mari Jones back to "Mary Jones (Bible) for now, because she is never called Mari Jones by non-Welsh speakers.

<p>You still haven't provided any context to the Manga. It's impossible to tell if it's a tribute or a criticism, and the title certianly implies criticism. Perhaps you might want to summarize it in the description and have it be part of the other books about him.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>An honest mistake, but this bot capitalized "catholic" in the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson_Taylor_4602.html" title="Hudson Taylor">Hudson Taylor</a> article. The quote was referring to him being a universal Christian as opposed to a "Catholic" in the Roman Catholic sense. This could be a problem if the bot is always capitalizing this word that is not a proper noun in itself.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0324_b6f3.html" title="User:Brian0324">Brian0324</a> 14:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, thank you for that. I'm aware of the distinction between Catholic (the religion) and catholic (as in 'of the people'), but I guess I've misidentified its use once too many times. I think I'll take it off my bot's list of rules. Cheers, <a href="../../../c/m/d/User%7ECmdrObot_0605.html" title="User:CmdrObot">CmdrObot</a> 20:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did a quick search online but couldn't clarify it. It would be a good guess that he was a Roman Catholic - Jesuit maybe? Not that it would have been impossible - but a Portuguese Protestant during that time period would have been rare.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0324_b6f3.html" title="User:Brian0324">Brian0324</a> 13:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I notice you specify an interest in Puritans.

Also, since you're a <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Baptist_ca75.html" title="Reformed Baptist">Reformed Baptist</a>, could you tag any relevant articles that are linked to from that article?

<p>Hi. I'm recommending to all participants in WikiProject Calvinism that they keep up with at least the News page ({{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikipedia%7EWikiProject_Calvinism_News_8fde.html" title="Template:Wikipedia:WikiProject Calvinism/News">Wikipedia:WikiProject Calvinism/News</a>}}) for this project. The methods I'd recommend for doing this are any or all of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the abovementioned page to your watchlist</li>
<li>Include the page on another page you look at regularly; in my case, this is my user page, since I keep my personal "todo" list there. That would look something like:</li>

<p>Sorry about redirecting it. The two groups appeared to have exactly the same missions focus, so I thought they were the same group. Thanks for correcting my mistake.
