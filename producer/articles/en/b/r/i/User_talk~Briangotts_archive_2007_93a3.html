<p>Dear Brian, your article on the raven banner is already very interesting. I have little to add at the moment. If you are interested in a dramatic Norse saga on two women in 11th century Sweden, there is something as unusual as a completely historic one told on a series of runestones: <a href="../../../e/k/e/Eker%C3%B6_Runestone_01e0.html" title="Ekerö Runestone">Ekerö Runestone</a>, <a href="../../../f/%C3%A4/r/F%C3%A4rentuna_Runestones_3023.html" title="Färentuna Runestones">Färentuna Runestones</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/%C3%A5/Sn%C3%A5ttsta_Runestones_469b.html" title="Snåttsta Runestones">Snåttsta Runestones</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broby_bro_Runestones_d999.html" title="Broby bro Runestones">Broby bro Runestones</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harg_Runestones_2666.html" title="Harg Runestones">Harg Runestones</a> and <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppland_Rune_Inscriptions_101%2C_143_and_147_4c9e.html" title="Uppland Rune Inscriptions 101, 143 and 147">Uppland Rune Inscriptions 101, 143 and 147</a>.

<p>Hello Brian. It looks good; a major expansion indeed! I knew the Sigurd story, but some of the rest are new, including the fact that it appeared on a coin. I'll have a dig through my stuff and see if there's anything I can add. There may be something in some of my Anglo-Saxon books. I wonder if there's any Irish stuff which is relevant? I'll let you know if I find anything.

<p>Hi Brian, Your map at <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a>, Section Expansions of the Vikings is really helpful, thank you. However, could it be improved? <s>The projection used exaggerates the distances to Greenland and North America.

<p>Hi! I saw your interests page, and I wish to explain a bit situation with mentioned history-related article.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't want to erase content of this, it will be merged into more global article like "Occupation of Ukraine".</p>
<p>Also, as you can notice, current version of article contains &gt;50% about Holocaust, it's not the primary goal of it. If it will be merged into Occupation of Ukraine it will be more title-specific. Because at that times, there were Soviet people, not Ukrainians. And article particularly speaks about Jews.</p>
<p>Also, you mentioned, that article is referenced, but I want to tell you that most references are not valid, since citations were misinterpreted by editors. You can see talk page for more info. Briefly, the strongest accusations were provided from some journalist, which has only one article on history, and has no historical background at all.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding, please provide your arguments. --Galkovsky 06:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the second time you avoid the question. If you don't know, it would make a more honest impression to say so. Nobody taking part in that particular discussion is an expert, so your edit would not be any less worth because of that. This issue has been discussed, but nobody has shown the two theories to be fringe theories, as you claim them to be. If you just wanted to help out a friend, as indicated by the comment by <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a>, you could have said that.

<p>These are AWESOME. Incredibly interesting. It would be appreciated if the colors could represent some kind of scale. Just so you could appreciate the relative "advancement" of each part of the world. And for parts of the world that are all equally as advanced, but have different empires, do some kind of striped pattern. But also appreciated would just be MORE MAPS!</p>

<dd>Thanks for your praise. I fully intend to add to the world map series when I have a free moment. I think the next one will be 1 CE. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 04:24, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree. More detail would be great. I suggest creating a separate site for these (if possible) and allowing the user to click on different regions (West Asia, South America, Europe, etc.) to view a more detailed separate map. It would take a LOT of time, but it would be an excellent resource. I'm salivating at the thought of it. But hey, I've never actually seen world maps before the late 1800s! <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrutannica_6161.html" title="User:Brutannica">Brutannica</a> 20:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your maps contain some inaccuracies regarding Ethiopia (here including Eritrea for simplicity). For instance, the 2000 BCE map shows Ethiopia as not having a bronze age culture and having instead hunter-gatherers, whereas the Bronze age begins about 3000 BCE in the region, around the time that complex cultures start to show up (3rd millenium BCE); Ethiopia in fact had two centers of cereal production: <a href="../../../t/e/f/Teff.html" title="Teff">teff</a> in the north, and <a href="../../../e/n/s/Enset.html" title="Enset">enset</a> in the south, both very early, ca. 13000 BCE, so its inaccurate to portray the region as only inhabited by hunter-gatherers. By 1000 BCE, there's a complex including the Tihama region of Yemen and the area that would be soon controlled by <a href="../../../d/27/m/D%27mt.html" title="D'mt">D'mt</a> (which you spelled Damot, which would more correctly be Da`amat/Daamat, and also less confusingly). Also at this time there is Ironworking throughout this entire complex (at least on the African side). Damot doesn't show up on your maps until 323 BCE (right before its nadir when the Late pre-Aksumite period begins and Aksum, its successor kingdom, comes into existence), however, while it properly began ca. 800 BCE, and probably earlier (but the earliest inscriptions mentioning D'mt are from the 8th c. BCE). Going back to the Yemen side, Saba's first inscriptions date to about 800 BCE, too, even if the roots of the kingdom may be earlier, so unless you're going to show D'mt in 1000 BCE, Saba shouldn't show up until your 500 BCE map. You characterize it as a chiefdom (I assume, since farming societies had existed prior to this), however, which is incorrect (the same in the case of D'mt). Both were clearly states and not chiefdoms at this point, encompassing a number of different tribes under the kingdoms. I think you should include all of Yemen (excluding the Tihama, which was associated with Ethiopia at this time) instead of just saying "Saba" and naming it "South Arabian kingdoms," as Ma'in and Hadhramaut also existed at these times and were states. Tihama should probably be associated with Ethiopia in the 2000 BCE and 1000 BCE maps, but should be part of the "South Arabian kingdoms" in the 500 BCE map.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>2000 BCE - Add N. Ethiopia within Bronze age line, with agricultural complex/chiefdom coloring and separate Tihama from Saba, perhaps adding it to the Ethiopian group. Make all of Highland Ethiopia (including as far east as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harar.html" title="Harar">Harar</a>, where grass cultivation has been dated to the 13th millenium BC) colored as agricultural (simple farming).</li>
<li>1000 BCE - As above, but with the N. Ethiopia/Tihama complex (this time they should unequivocally be part of the same complex) named as "Tihama Cultural Complex" (TCC), alternatively, you can just name it D'mt, and leave out the Tihama, since the dates are flexible (D'mt starting around the beginning of the 1st millenium BCE, and TCC ending around the end of the 2nd millenium BCE). Also include as part of Iron Age. Instead of "Saba," extend eastward and rename "South Arabian kingdoms" (if you name the complex D'mt), or "South Arabian complexes" (if you use TCC). If you use "kingdoms" and "D'mt," they should be colored blue as states.</li>
<li>500 BCE - As above, Tihama definitely separate or part of "South Arabian kingdoms." D'mt and South Arabian kingdoms should be blue as states by this map or the one before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you've included Eastern Ethiopia (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harar.html" title="Harar">Harar</a> mountain region, not the <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a> just south of it) as pastoralist, when it should be agricultural from the earliest times (2000 BCE). The area east, north, and south is correctly labeled as pastoralist, however.</p>
<p>References: For complexes, Rodolfo Fattovich, "Urbanism in the Northern Horn of Africa." Regarding the early association of the Tihama with Ethiopia (i.e. prior to the second millenium, if you want to include it on the 2000 BCE map), Edward J. Keall, "Contact across the Red Sea (between Arabia and Africa) in the 2nd millennium BC: circumstantial evidence from the archaeological site of al-Midamman, Tihama coast of Yemen, and Dahlak Kabir Island, Eritrea." For agriculture, Christopher Ehret, "On the antiquity of Agriculture in Ethiopia."</p>
<p>One more note on the spelling of D'mt. I don't like using "Damot," since Damot was a medieval province in southwestern Ethiopia. It gets even more confusing because there were 2 Damots in history, the first just south of the Nile until the 16th century when the Oromo migrations began, when the entire area was relocated to the area just to the north (by Emperor <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susenyos_of_Ethiopia_d6dc.html" title="Susenyos of Ethiopia">Susenyos</a> in the early 17th century), to the area just north of the Nile so that Susenyos could better protect the people. I know this sounds like a lot, but the changes wouldn't be that difficult to implement. If you don't have time, I can do it myself. I don't mean to be critical, though. Your map is great and on a huge scale, so it's inevitable that mistakes like these can slip by. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 01:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)\</p>

<p>Hey Brian I was just looking at your series of BCE world maps and I must say I am very impressed. One small thing I have noticed however is the fact that on the 200 BCE map (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:World_200_BCE.PNG" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:World_200_BCE.PNG" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), Australia is shown as uninhabited, while on all previous maps it is correctly shown as a hunter gatherer culture. I figured that this was just a small detail that you may want to be brought to your attention. And once again they're all really cool. I just wish I didn't stay awake until 6 am <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Time_Zone_fd43.html" title="Pacific Time Zone">PST</a> looking at the entire series&#160;:) - <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 13:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was a boilerplate message asking you to desist from blanking sourced and referenced portions of an article. If you are suggesting that your blanking was in response to another user's actions on another article, that compounds the impropriety of what you did. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 14:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
