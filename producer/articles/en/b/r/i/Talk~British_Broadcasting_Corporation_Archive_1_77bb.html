<p>Sorry to ask a stoopid question, but--are there private television and radio stations in the U.K.? --AnonymousCoward</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, there are both national and local commercial radio stations, offering a wide variety of news and music genres. The number of national commercial stations is likely to get a lot higher with <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_audio_broadcasting.html" title="Digital audio broadcasting">digital audio broadcasting</a> being phased in.</p>
<p>With television, the market is even more fragmented. There are 3 commercial 'analogue' channels, <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_5.html" title="Channel 5">Channel 5</a>, while on digital services (eg Digital Terrestrial or Digital Satellite), the range is much greater. We have hundreds of (mostly low quality) commercial television services on digital satellite within the UK, mostly showing re-runs of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcoms.html" title="Sitcoms">sitcoms</a>! --Dweir</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Claims of BBC bias</span></h3>
<p>During the middle of the night July 2001 attack by Italian security forces on the independent media centre in Genoa, the BBC allegedly refused to broadcast live footage of the police violence streaming through the internet on the basis that "there were no independent confirmations".</p>
<p>The BBC is generally considered to have given very little coverage to the 2001/2002 silent <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, in which some fraction (initially expected to be about 50%) of 7.5 million people were killed by actions (bordure closures and bombings) expected to be lethal by terminating food supply lines. In preference, the BBC and <a href="../../../i/t/n/ITN_c367.html" title="ITN">ITN</a> chose, for example, stories such as forest fires in Australia which killed noone.[1]</p>
<p>The BBC is also considered to represented corporate and government interests, and not those of ordinary citizens' groups.[2]</p>
<p><i>216, this is interesting and potentially valuable stuff. Would you please review our policy on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>, rewrite it, and put it back in when it conforms to the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></i></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm going to put the reference to the American Supreme Court back in. At the moment the article says that the BBC is independent of the government and this isn't strictly true. Just as the American President can pack the Supreme Court with people sympathetic to his political views, it's possible for the Prime Minister to pack the BBC's board of Governors with sympathisers, as Mrs Thatcher proved. If anyone has a better metaphor, by all means replace the Supreme Court with it but don't just remove the Supreme Court reference and bluntly state that the BBC is independent of government because the situation is not that simple. And it's not particularly Americocentric. I'm not American and I understood what it meant. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Derek, I changed the reference from the Supreme Court to the United States Postal Service. It seems more reasonable an analogy to me. If you disagree, go ahead and change it back. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now it's even MORE Americocentric. Why does there need to be an analogy! I don't think the Supreme Court article needs to make an analogy to the BBC or the Post Office.62.64.250.162</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what the comparison with the USPO means either. I thought that the USPO was a government department which the BBC isn't. The Supreme Court reference was better. However we do need to make some analogy because many people abroad think either that the BBC is a Government department -- an assumption which *this* article originally made -- or they don't know what its status is. Now a lot of people worldwide know what the relation of the US Supreme Court to the US Executive is so it's a useful comparison to make since its fairly exact. If you can come up with a better one which will be more easily understood globally and doesn't refer to the US, be my guest and use it. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yep, That's a good description of the independence issue. Cheers -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<p>Hey, I said, if you don't like the analogy, change it. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Good page. I thought some of the statements were not neutral, and the spelling of some of the words confused me because I am used to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> type of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>. I corrected a couple of typos. But, overall, it was an interesting and long view back at the BBC's history. I say this is an important page to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> about an important <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">tv</a> channel. The page needs to be NPOV'd, but then again, I cant talk. I used to write the most non neutral articles when I began myself..LOL</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonioMartin_6aa4.html" title="User:AntonioMartin">Antonio Im So Excited!!! Martin</a></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, so what needs looking at for NPOV? Obviously it needs more material on the sort of criticisms and difficulties the BBC faces - it is from time to time accused of bias by both left and right; it uses the licence fee to support activities (such as the website) that compete with the commercial sector; what else?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think <i>"It is still generally regarded by viewers and listeners as providing news, entertainment and other broadcast services of the highest quality available anywhere in the world."</i> would be much improved by reference to surveys, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"[Licence fees] ensure that the BBC is sufficiently funded to provide for the British public high quality and diverse media content..."</i> might be better as "aim to ensure that the BBC is sufficiently funded..." or something like that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've also never been entirely happy with the paragraph starting <i>"In places like Northern Ireland..."</i>. It seems to imply that the BBC's import of <i>The Simpsons</i> is specifically aimed at NI. However, I don't know the NI situation well enough to write a better paragraph on it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's also odd in singling out Northern Ireland. Scotland, Wales and the English regions also have their own political, drama, comedy and local interest TV programs. There's nothing special about NI in that regard. All parts of the UK share national programming, like Eastenders and the Simpsons, and opt out for local programming. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've attempted a rewrite of this section - I think this is an improvement, although could probably be further improved in some areas. -- Mark New</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of <i>The Simpsons</i>, the article could do with a better paragraph on the BBC's attitude to imports - <i>Dallas</i> was a great hit for them, but imports seemed to fall right out of favour until the mid-90s, when C4's success with <i>Friends</i> and <i>ER</i> pushed the BBC into buying <i>The X-Files</i>... <i>24</i> seems to be the Beeb's big import at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is getting to be quite a long comment, and I'm supposed to be working. I might look more at this article later. I am going to kill the snarky comment about U.S. spelling, though. --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a> 08:57 Mar 12, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
