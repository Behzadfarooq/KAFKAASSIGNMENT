<p>"bright" needs disambiguation - there is John Bright for example, arguably an important historical figure more worthy of appearing first when searching for "bright", rather than some elitist neologism coined to describe "people who are not as clever as we are". <a href="../../../o/r/e/User%7EOrelstrigo_769f.html" title="User:Orelstrigo">Orelstrigo</a> 08:53, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, so there's nothing elitist about the bright movement. I was in a bad mood when I wrote my comment, for which I apologise. And anyway, in my comment I was not particularly bright myself, when what I really meant to say was "people lke us who are cleverer than you are". Or something like it. Be that as it may, my request for some sort of disambiguation still stands:, E.g. tha aforementioned John Bright - not knowing his first name, on searching for him, this, and only this, page came up. Also, what abougt Bright's disease? Or indeed the town of Bright, Indiana, or the many other "Brights" found in the title pages of this wiki? My problem is essentially that a search took me directly here, as opposed to, at least, a list of relevant pages. Perhaps this page should be entitled "Bright movement" or something similar? <a href="../../../o/r/e/User%7EOrelstrigo_769f.html" title="User:Orelstrigo">Orelstrigo</a> 02:45, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The way to do this is to have a separate page, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bright (disambiguation)">Bright (disambiguation)</a>, linked from the top line of this article and linking to those other topics like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bright_48ea.html" title="John Bright">John Bright</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright%27s_disease.html" title="Bright's disease">Bright's disease</a>, all of which have naturally disambiguated names. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamN_e872.html" title="User:GrahamN">GrahamN</a> 19:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Have the Wikipedia "bright" page be a regular disambiguation page with links to pages for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright%27s_Disease_6cae.html" title="Bright's Disease">Bright's Disease</a>, people named <a href="../../../b/r/e/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Bre-Bri_c527.html#Brig-Brin" title="List of people by name: Bre-Bri">Bright</a>, places named Bright, and the Brights' Movement (new page to replace the current "bright" page). <a href="../../../m/e/m/User%7EMemenen_878a.html" title="User:Memenen">Memenen</a> 18:03, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I've put in your suggestion regarding people called Bright, à la <i>gay</i> article, which solves 33% of my original objection. Probably my reasoning on Bright's disease is wrong, because the phrase "Bright's disease" would surely be the obvious one to look for if you were interested in the disease - I've never heard of anyone suffering from "Bright" (or "Crohn" or "Parkinson" for that matter). So far that's 66% gone leaving 33% for the town(s) called Bright. Now, certainly, world-famous towns like "Paris" or "London" should stand alone, as single-word articles (or redirects to "London, England", "Paris, France", etc) - but lesser known towns such as "Bright, Texas", "Hicksberg, Germany", etc don't really justify articles under their name alone. So, thats another 33% objection gone, leaving just 1% unease about the article heading being just "Bright". The word "gay", meaning "homosexual" has, IMO, overtaken its original meanings, and represents a sizeable number of people, not just a movement and so justifies its inclusion as it is. The Brights' movement currently represents very few people, and the job of an encyclopaedia is surely not to aid (or hinder) propagation of a "meme" according to the vision of any particular movement. So, until the word "Bright" acquires the meaning expressed in this article, then "Brights' movement" seems to me to be a better title. However I'm not sure. My tired brain can't think of anything <i>else</i> that would require the simple title <b>Bright</b>. So, maybe leave things as they are, for now. <a href="../../../o/r/e/User%7EOrelstrigo_769f.html" title="User:Orelstrigo">Orelstrigo</a> 03:10, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC) (a closet bright, perhaps?)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the bright movement is in fact of a elitist movement, to suggest that the word 'bright,' whose connotation is "intelligent" when applied to humans, should be engineered to refer to those who reject belief in the divine or supernatural. I would go as far as to say as the bright movement has arrogance in believing it can label itself this way, and perhaps even prejudice to everyone else who does not share their views.</dd>

<dd>It is obviously not an elitist movement, as it welcomes anyone to adopt their beliefs and join. If you define elitist as people of one belief, most groups are so elitist. Again, every group centered around a belief believes itself to hold the truth, and that people that don't agree are misled, foolish, stupid, in league with Satan, liers, or some other negative modifier. If that's prejudice, then every group is prejudiced. Yes, they are trying to co-op a commonly used word with positive associations; it's a commonly used and sometimes successful strategy.

<dd>The name of the movement is at the root of the problem - if I take the founders of <b>The Brights</b> at face value, they come off as amazingly clueless. They don't seem to have realised the problems with misinterpretation that they face. If I take them as being disingenuous, then they're just being obnoxious. I tend to take the former view, but it astounds me how intelligent folks (e.g. Dawkins and Dennett) don't realise how arrogant the name sounds. There are other problems - how is this movement different from secular humanism, for example. That makes it even more bizarre. It surely doesn't take a lot of work to find various atheist and/or humanist groups today using the Internet, does it? This movement just sounds redundant. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutarch_18bf.html" title="User:Autarch">Autarch</a> 16:47, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. Whether or not you think the movement is reduntant is really beside the point. It is a movement that is taking place, and that is the subject of the article, not the movement's merrit. 2. The question of how this movement is "different" from secular humanism is answered in the definition of the term. It's not really different as such. It is an {i]umbrella term[/i] that includes but is not limited to secular humanist. You don't have to be a secular humanist to be a bright. That question is like asking, how is "religious" different from Christian. Religious is an umbrella term that covers a lot of other beliefs which are more specific. 3. Creating an umbrella term and trying to get it into standard usage doesn't make it's founders unintellegent. Nor is it bizzarre. (obviosly all POV "observations") Even if it did, being bizzare or even illitist doesn't bar it from being covered in wikipedia. Wikipedia has many topics that could be classified as bizzar. Wikipeida also talks about plenty of movements, subcultures ect who's adherants could (and probably are) be considered by some to be "less than intellegent." 4. Although "bright" does carry a conotation of intellegence, it's not the ONLY conotation that it carries, and is not the intended connotation anyway. As the man who coined the term for use this way said, you can always coin a term that YOU like to cover your belief system. By the same logic, you could say that the conservatives are elitist because they claim to be "right." After all, "right" carries connotations of being the only one's who are correct. But we all know that the intended meaning for "right-wing" isn't the correct wing but right of center.</p>

What's wrong with thinking that you are correct? This can be said of the adherents to almost any philosophical or religious worldview. If that's elitist or arrogant, then I don't see what is wrong with elitism or arrogance. Of course if being elitist means excluding people on some ground relating to wealth or social class, or if arrogance means being a pain in the arse (loudmouthed and boastful in style), then these are bad things. But I don't see why anyone would assume that people involved in the movement are like that. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 02:15, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know nothing of these folks, but I agree with the above comment - the criticism section is more prominent than seems reasonable, and the arguments don't really help one understand anything more about this movement than that people are irritated that they have appropriated and "branded" a normal english word. if not delete the section, then move it down.

<p>Repeated use of the term "meme" in the "Bright" article is appropriate. Two of the most vocal advocates for the Bright movement are the originator of "meme" (Dawkins) and one of its most vocal advocates (Dennett). The term "Bright" was explicitly selected as part of an attempt to create a successful meme. <a href="../../../m/e/m/User%7EMemenen_878a.html" title="User:Memenen">Memenen</a> 01:58, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nevertheless, the notion of a meme is (at best) controversial. It's OK to say that the founders thought in terms of memes, but not for Wikipedia to <i>use</i> the term as though it represented any sort of true account of the nature of the world. I, like most philosophers (and, I believe, most scientists; certainly the ones woth whom I've spoken), consider the notion of memes to be without merit, and to have neither scientific nor philosophical justification. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 08:17, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

NO, No, No. I don't think that Naturalistic worldview should be redirected here. Because the brights movement is defined here as consisting of people who believe in a Naturalistic World View. By redirecting the other article to here, you are creating a circular definition. When I was reading the article, I immediatly wanted to click on "Naturalistic Worldview" to see what that was. Also a naturalistic worldview is generic, it discusses a specific type of world view, while "Brights movement" is a movement created for and by people who follow a naturalistic worldview. A worldview is not a movement and a movement is not a worldview. That would be like redirecting democracy to the United States- some people might think they were the same, but that would be an error. <a href="../../../a/m/y/User%7EAmyanda2000_3047.html" title="User:Amyanda2000">amyanda</a> 05:47, 24 February 2007 (UTC)amyanda2000</p>

<dd>By lying to themselves, of course. By the same logic, Christian beliefs aren't necessarily "supernatural" or "mystical" if they're <i>true</i>.&#160;:) -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 01:56, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The answer is "with difficulty". However, I don't think it's all that difficult for Buddhists. Buddhism was originally a philosophical school, not a religion as we normally understand it in the West. Some people who claim to be Buddhists probably just mean that they deny the existence of any metaphysical self, and deprecate the importance of the self/other boundary. That's a reputable philosophical position. Also, a lot of people are, e.g. <i>cultural</i> Christians, wiccans, etc. They don't necessarily take any supernaturalist claims literally. I make no comment about whether that is an intellectually attractive position for them to be in, but it seems quite common. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 02:07, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A philosophical school more than a religion, yes. But certainly nonetheless a spiritual and even mystical one by today's usage of the words "spiritual" and "mystical"; philosophies need not be secular, either (Buddhism is often described as a "religious philosophy" (not to be confused with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_religion.html" title="Philosophy of religion">philosophy of religion</a>).). Other than that, as I said, there are always interesting ways to twist the meaning of the words "supernatural", etc. to suit just about <i>any</i> ideology, regardless of the actual content and practical application of those beliefs. For example, you could say that vampires aren't "supernatural" because they're <i>real</i>, physical, actual beings, and therefore a bright can believe in vampires.</dd>
<dd>I think that this is a direct result of the vagueness of the "bright" concept, and I also think that it's to a large extent deliberate; by becoming open and inviting to a large group of people, rather than just to a certain set of people who identify as being a specific thing (like "atheists" or "materialists"), brights gain in numbers and political power what they lose in clarity and specificity; they gain in use while losing in usefulness. That's one of the reasons I don't self-identify as "bright" myself, despite sharing a common (or similar) view with many, many brights; it doesn't tell enough, in itself, about the people who go by the term to make it worth the trouble. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:15, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most convincing reason given above for not transferring this article to "bright" is that this article is no longer about the <i>concept</i> of brights but about the "movement" (actually more of a lobbying organisation) that calls itself "The Brights". The prominence in the article of their "sun-shines-out-of-our-behinds" logo rather proves the point. This means that there is currently no article about "brights", only one about the "brights movement". The difference between <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brights_movement.html" title="Brights movement">brights movement</a> is the difference between "<a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>" and "<a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonewall.html" title="Stonewall">Stonewall</a>". I don't think anybody would suggest those two articles should be merged. You are wrong to say that the article "bright" was turned effectively into a link here - it was turned into a stub article about the <i>concept</i> of brights, rather than the brights movement. Some of the material in this article should be removed from here and transferred there, because it is about brights in general rather than the purported "movement". If I find time I'll get on try to do this myself. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamN_e872.html" title="User:GrahamN">GrahamN</a> 18:45, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with that conclusion. Although it would be preferable to have an article about brights at bright (something or other) than to have no article about brights at all (which is what would happen if we implement the proposal that's currently leading the poll at at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bright_4bee.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bright">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bright</a>), there is a very good, logical reason why the article should be named <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a> rather than bright (pointless qualifier): <b>It is the natural name for the article, and it is not the natural name for any other article</b>, (except perhaps <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28band%29.html" title="Bright (band)">Bright (band)</a>). On this basis alone it is clearly the correct title. If you want me to get all procedural on you I'm sure, if I could be bothered to read it, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> would back me up. Prosfilaes says <i>"I think it more likely that someone is going to enter bright looking for the article on light or intelligence then they're going to enter bright looking for this neologism.</i> Well let's see, shall we? Currently there are 44 direct links to "<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a>", of which I could find only three (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_%282000_film%29.html" title="Traffic (2000 film)">Traffic (2000 film)</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Sentai_1aff.html" title="Super Sentai">Super Sentai</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_cone.html" title="Traffic cone">traffic cone</a>) that refer to the word in the sense of "light", and none at all in the sense of "intelligent". All three of those links result from arbritarily and inappropriately wikified words, for example in the sentence "The story is <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright.html" title="Bright">bright</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiny.html" title="Shiny">shiny</a>, and saturated in primary colors". Except for <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_%28band%29.html" title="Bright (band)">Bright (band)</a>, I really can't think of any occasion when it would be useful or appropriate to wikify the word "bright" from any article to link to anywhere other than the article about the philosophical outlook.

This isn't a dictionary, and if you know enough about those words to know what they mean, I can't think of any fact that you might need to look up in an encylopaedia about them. Can you?

That would be legitimate, I suppose, but somewhat clumsy. And also ridiculous, seeing as there is a simple six-letter word that has the same meaning.</dd>

<dd>And if they typed in Bright, they would get the disambiguation page. If they don't know that bright means a naturalistic worldview, maybe they should use a dictionary. If they don't know that a naturalist worldview is sometimes called bright, they haven't been reading a small group of people that have been using the word for a few years. It's a terribly uncommon, neologistic word, and should not displace all the other concepts that bright is attached to, including the band. People whose worldview is naturalistic - free of supernatural and mystical elements - and whose ethics and actions are based on a naturalistic worldview is a strawman; there's no need to include "free of supernatural and mystical elements", for one small thing.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 02:53, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The clause "free of supernatural and mystical elements" is an essential part of the definition. Pagans, for example, have a naturalistic world view - they <i>worship</i> nature - but they are the exact opposite of brights. It's not as obscure a thing as you are making out - some very influential thinkers, such as Daniel Dennett, Stephen Pinker, Richard Dawkins and Ian McEwan [I think] have taken to using the word. Nobody looks up things they already know about, (such as bright in the sense of "light" or "clever"). People use an encyclopaedia to look things up that they haven't come across before, such as "bright" in this sense. The fact that it is a bit uncommon makes it <i>more</i> likely that people will look it up in wikipedia when they come across it, not less. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrahamN_e872.html" title="User:GrahamN">GrahamN</a> 03:25, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Neopagans do not have a naturalistic world view. Please read <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Naturalism (philosophy)">Naturalism (philosophy)</a>. Naturalism means that one does not recognize the existence of the supernatural (a reasonable viewpoint, as "natural" can <i>specifically refer</i> to what exists) or does not recognize a distinction between the supernatural and natural. Pagans <i>can</i> be naturalists (just like Christians can), by believing that things like gods and magic are completely natural and physical phenomena, but the vast majority of Pagans are not. Worshiping nature and being a philosophical naturalist couldn't be more distinct; one refers to nature as contrasted with technology and civilization ("worshiping nature" refers to woodlands and streams and all that nonsense, not to all physical phenomena!), and the other refers to nature as contrasted with the supernatural. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 04:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's a basic misunderstanding here. The Brights Movement and the definition of "bright" are not based upon 'philosophical naturalism'. The definition states only that a bright has a "naturalistic worldview, free from supernatural and mystical elements". All of that phrase must be used to complete the definition. This is using naturalistic in the sense of "conforming to reality" and nothing more, and no connection with naturalism is intended. The movement itself is a civic action organisation registered as an educational organisation under US law, and has no philosophical or ideological intent. The correct category for the page would therefore be with other civic action organisations.</dd>
<dd>On the subject of the Brights Movement and the term bright being limited to a small number of people, there are currently between 20,000 and 25,000 registered Brights, across the world, which puts it on equal footing with many of the existing atheist groups currently in existance. As the numbers are growing rapidly, it's likely that an increasing number of people will want to look for Brights and Brights Movement. ProfM 16:15 24 Aug 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The prior statement yielded an incomplete statement of purpose for the movement.

<dd>Hi, I think there might be some subtle wordplay going on here between the concept that "bright" is meant to stand for, which is "a person whose worldview is naturalistic—free of supernatural and mystical elements" and the use/advocacy of the term. First of all, the brights net website lists him as an "enthusiastic bright". <a href="http://www.the-brights.net/people/enthusiastic/index2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.the-brights.net/people/enthusiastic/index2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Second, and far more telling, are his own comments, talking about his book <i>Science Friction</i>, which dedicates an entire chapter to the brights movement, in which he says:
<dl>
<dd>"The movement began at the Atheist Alliance International convention in 2003, and I was the first to sign the petition. The “Bright” movement gained momentum when myself and such luminaries as the evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins and the philosopher Daniel Dennett came out of the skeptical closet through opinion editorials. The reaction was swift and merciless—almost no one, including and especially nonbelievers, agnostics, atheists, humanists, and free thinkers, liked the name, insisting that its elitist implications, along with the natural antonym “dim,” would doom us as a movement." <a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-01-05.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-01-05.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There are four things I would like to highlight here.
<ol>
<li>Shermer states clearly he was <i>the first</i> to sign the petition. That shows that he is in agreement with the aims of the movement, and since he was the first, he must be pretty enthusiastic.</li>
<li>Shermer states that the movement gained momentum when <i>he</i>, along with others, "came out of the skeptical closet."</li>
<li>Shermer notes that many people responded badly to the name, commenting again on the proposed antonym (Dan Dennett, on the other hand has suggested "supers" for people whose world view includes supernatural elements).</li>
<li>Shermer suggests that such concerns about the name would doom "us" as a movement, which suggests that he still counts himself as part of the movement, even if he thinks that "all such attempts will ultimately fail"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The important point to note here, and in the quote above is that Shermer states "I don't <i>call</i> myself a bright" not that he isn't one. Clearly based on the above, he feels perhaps uncomfortable with the term, but not with the movement and its goals. To borrow from the founding analogy with the brights movement, there were probably plenty of people that were homosexual that were uncomfortable with the term "gay". Shermer's writings and actions speak clearly, if even he would prefer a different word to describe them. <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 18:37, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok. Excellent. Thanks for supplying this info. I had known of Shermer's early involvement with the movement, but upon hearing his statement in that video thought it likely that he had since disassociated himself from it. But, I wasn't sure and was waiting for someone else to provide further info. - which is why I waited before going ahead with the edit. So, I'm guessing from the info. provided, that Shermer does indeed consider himself an active member of the movement... just one who is of the opinion that the movement didn't exactly pick the best of possible names for itself. The confusion arose due Shermer not being very clear in the video. In the context it is offered it sounds as if he's saying "I don't call myself a bright" as in "I don't call myself a member of the group that calls itself brights." But, in light of other available information, it becomes clear his meaning is "While I am associated with the group, I don't agree with the term 'bright' and so I choose not to use it to refer to myself."74.104.100.186 21:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I think that's about right... I count myself as a bright, too (although my name isn't as famous as Shermer's) but I tend to agree with him that the name might not be the best one. Unlike Shermer, I have decided to live with it. Thanks for posting to the talk page first, it's nice to be able to develop things... In fact, this might make for an interesting addition on the criticism section, noting that even people that are "enthusiastic brights" are not always sold on the name. It will just take a little thinking to make it into a sentence or two, instead of the paragraphs we have here. <a href="../../../e/d/h/User%7EEdhubbard_3245.html" title="User:Edhubbard">Edhubbard</a> 22:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not calling yourself something, like "gay" when you are homosexual, because of the pejorative connotations received by society today, is not an appropriate analogy. By this logic, any atheist scholar is a "bright," where Shermer clearly dissociates himself with the Brights. The analogy fails because "gay" is something that you can be called based on something that you are, while a bright, is not something that you can be called, based on who you are, but on which organization you classify yourself in. If Shermer says he is not a bright, he is not a bright.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravityExNihilo_1b3a.html" title="User:GravityExNihilo">GravityExNihilo</a> 04:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I question the inclusion of the external link to Brights UK? This takes you to a Google Groups sign-up page, rather than a web site viewable to all.
