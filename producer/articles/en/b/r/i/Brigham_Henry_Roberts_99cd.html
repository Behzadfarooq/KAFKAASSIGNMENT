<p>Roberts served three proselytizing <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary.html" title="Missionary">missions</a>: <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> and southern states from 1880 to 1882; as president of the southern states mission from 1883 to 1886; and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> from 1886 to 1888. Elder <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Golden_Kimball_a4ca.html" title="J. Golden Kimball">J. Golden Kimball</a> was in the mission office in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee_d431.html" title="Chattanooga, Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a> when word came that three elders had been killed by a mob while conducting a service on Sunday, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>. According to Kimball, Roberts decided to retrieve the bodies of the missionaries to return them to their families in Utah. Given the dangerous situation, Elder Kimball tried to get President Roberts to let him make the journey. But Roberts insisted on going, disguising himself as a farm laborer. With local assistance, he went to the site and recovered the bodies. The party took a wrong road on the way back to the railroad station. Roberts later stated that the error may have saved his life, as a mob was waiting for him on the correct road.</p>
<p>Kimball later said about Roberts:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Brother Roberts has been my mentor; he has been my teacher; he has been my chronicler. I was relieved of reading the great histories; I didn't have to read a whole library searching for information. What did I have to do? When anything troubled me about the history of the Church or scripture, I went to Brother Roberts. He had the most wonderful mind and memory of any human being I have ever known, right up to the very last.</i> (LDS Conference Report, October 1933, page 43)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Roberts was ordained to the First Council of Seventy on October 1888. He served as LDS Church Historian from 1901 until his death in 1933.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Henry_Roberts_99cd.html" title="Edit section: Political Service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political Service</span></h2>
<p>Roberts was politically active and served as a Democratic representative in the Utah territorial legislature and the 1895 Utah State Constitutional Convention. During the convention, he took an active role in the debate over the inclusion of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman%27s_suffrage.html" title="Woman's suffrage">woman's suffrage</a> in the Utah State Constitution. In contrast to the vast majority of Latter-day Saint leaders of the day, he strongly opposed woman's suffrage in a number of well received speeches. However, woman's suffrage was strongly supported by both parties and was eventually included in the state constitution. Statehood was officially granted on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>.</p>
<p>Roberts was elected as a representative on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a> ticket to the <a href="../../../5/6/t/56th_United_States_Congress_a724.html" title="56th United States Congress">56th</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_the_United_States_f5e4.html" title="Congress of the United States">Congress</a>, but the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> prohibited him from taking the seat to which he had been elected on the grounds of his practice of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._King_717b.html" title="William H. King">William H. King</a>, the Senator who preceded him won the election to succeed him). A <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_elections_to_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_7e22.html" title="Special elections to the United States House of Representatives">special election</a> was held to fill his seat. He later testified in the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoot_Hearings_ca4e.html" title="Smoot Hearings">Smoot Hearings</a> when Republican <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_Smoot_%28U._S._Senator%29_00b4.html" title="Reed Smoot (U. S. Senator)">Reed Smoot</a> was being attacked in a similar manner (although in Smoot's case the polygamy charges were unfounded).</p>
<p>In addition to his attempted service in the Congress, Elder Roberts was also a member of the Utah National Guard when it was pressed into service in World War I in 1917. In his national guard capacity, Elder Roberts became the first LDS chaplain in the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Henry_Roberts_99cd.html" title="Edit section: Career as a writer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career as a writer</span></h2>
<p>Roberts was a prolific writer and author of some notable historical, biographical and theological works. He wrote <i>A Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i> which was printed as a series in <i>Americana</i> (a monthly periodical published by the "American Historical Society" of New York) from June 1909 to July 1915 and updated to 1930 when it was published.</p>
<p>Ironically, while he was indeed a defender of the faith and expressed a strong <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testimony.html" title="Testimony">testimony</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Book_of_Mormon_606d.html" title="The Book of Mormon">The Book of Mormon</a> (a foundational work of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a>) throughout his life, he also authored a manuscript entitled <i><a href="http://www.signaturebooks.com/studies.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.signaturebooks.com/studies.htm" rel="nofollow">Studies of the Book of Mormon</a></i>, which critically examined the book’s claims and origins. In the manuscript he questions some of the claims of <i>The Book of Mormon</i> regarding the native inhabitants of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Hemisphere_4a04.html" title="Western Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>, compares the content of the book with an earlier book entitled <i><a href="../../../v/i/e/View_of_the_Hebrews_b6aa.html" title="View of the Hebrews">View of the Hebrews</a></i> (finding much in common between the two books), and comments on the likelihood that <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith</a> could have been the author of <i>The Book of Mormon</i> without divine assistance. Whether the manuscript reflects his true doubts or was a case of Roberts playing the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">devil's advocate</a> is a subject of much debate among Mormon historians and scholars.</p>
<p>Roberts asserted that the authenticity of the Restoration must “stand or fall” on the truth of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith</a>’s claim that the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> was the history of an ancient people inscribed on a cache of gold plates. Roberts predicted that if church leaders did not address the historical problems of church origins and possible anachronisms in the Book of Mormon, the problems would eventually undermine “the faith of the Youth of the Church.”</p>
<p>Roberts has been celebrated by <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter-day_Saint_0bda.html" title="Latter-day Saint">Latter-day Saints</a> as "defender of the faith" for his <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apologetics.html" title="Apologetics">apologetic</a> writings of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a>. This title has been widely used for only one other Mormon: <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Nibley_f37e.html" title="Hugh Nibley">Hugh Nibley</a>.</p>
<p>Robert's loyalty was to the LDS Church rather than the principles it taught. As an example, after the Church abandoned polygamy Roberts became one of the most vocal opponents of the practice. Because Roberts lived and wrote during a time of great change in the LDS Church his later writings often directly contradicted his earlier writings. The one constant was loyalty to the LDS Church.</p>
