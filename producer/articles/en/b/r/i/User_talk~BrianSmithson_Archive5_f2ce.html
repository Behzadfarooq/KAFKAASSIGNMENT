<h2><span class="mw-headline">Beaird article</span></h2>
<p>Is this the way to contact you, Brian. I removed some red links from the Beaird article because I thought I was supposed to do so. Can you tell me how in simple language to attach a photo to a biography? The instructions are complicated. Als what key gives one the top-bottom slash. I don't know which key this is -- so I have to copy and past that little symbol when I need it, which is all the time. Thanks, Billy Hathorn (It is not clear how to reply.)</p>

<dd>Hi, Billy. Yeah, there's really no reason to remove redlinks from an article unless you truly feel that <i>no article</i> could conceivably be written on the linked-to subject. Per <a href="../../../b/u/i/Wikipedia%7EBuild_the_web_9cc9.html" title="Wikipedia:Build the web">Wikipedia:Build the web</a>, it's actually a good idea to link to pertinent terms, since others will see the red links and (hopefully) be drawn to create articles about them to turn them blue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for photos, here are some basic instructions: 1) Click "Upload file" on the toolbox to the left of your screen. 2) Click "Choose File". 3) In the window that appears, find the photo you want and choose it. 4) Back in the Wikipedia upload page, choose a "destination filename". Choose something explicit and not easily confused. For example, Charles_Beaird.jpg would be a better name than Charles.jpg. 5) In the "Summary" box, type a brief description of the photo. For example: "Charles Beaird, 1954, at his home." In the same area, give the source of the file (either a website address, or whether the photo is one from your own personal collection, etc.). 6) Click on the "Licensing" pull-down menu. Choose the appropriate license. Assuming you took the photo or have permission from the copyright holder to upload it, you can choose "GFDL" to indicate you are willing to allow others to use the image if they wish. Normally, you may not upload an image that you do not want others to be able to use for their own projects. One other option is to choose "fair use", which indicates that you do <i>not</i> own the copyright but that you are asserting that the photo is being used in accordance with "fair use" laws in various countries. 7) Click "Upload file".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To include the photo in the article on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_T._Beaird_96fa.html" title="Charles T. Beaird">Charles T. Beaird</a>, you only need to include the following line at the top of the article: [[Image:PHOTONAME.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Caption caption caption.]]. Replace "PHOTONAME" with the name of your uploaded photo, and replace "caption caption caption" with a caption about the photo (who's in it, where they are, date, etc.). The 250px part tells the software how big to make the photo in pixels, so you can adjust it up or down to suit your tastes. "Right" tells the software to move the photo to the right of the page. You can also choose "left", but if you're only uploading one photo, right should be fine.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the top-bottom slash, do you mean the pipe character? This: |&#160;? On my keyboard, it is located on the same key as \ , just to the right of ]. So I don't think you will have to copy and paste it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know that some of this <i>sounds</i> complicated, but I have given you very detailed instructions so that you can hopefully follow them easily. Please do not hesitate to ask more questions if you get stuck. Oh, one last note: Don't forget to sign your talk-page comments. You do it by typing ~~~~ at the end of your comments.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opinion needed for a fictional character article</span></h2>
<p>After spending half day yesterday expanding and completing the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldmoon.html" title="Goldmoon">Goldmoon</a> article, reaching a somewhat satisfactory (for me) shape <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goldmoon&amp;oldid=54304363" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goldmoon&amp;oldid=54304363" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, while doing some cleaning patrol I noticed your tips about the Darth Vader article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APeer_review%2FDarth_Vader&amp;diff=45746934&amp;oldid=45286873" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APeer_review%2FDarth_Vader&amp;diff=45746934&amp;oldid=45286873" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Thus, after reading the <a href="../../../1/s/p/WP%7E1SP_77c6.html#Check_your_fiction" title="WP:1SP">fictional article</a> guidelines and your own essay, <i>Writing about fiction</i>, I rewrote the article to fit both criterias.</p>
<p>Since I consider you have quite a good knowledge about the guidelines, if you have an extra minute I would like hearing your opinion about the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldmoon.html#War_of_Souls_series" title="Goldmoon">the War of Souls section</a>, which I finished earlier today. You will realize I wrote the section in the past tense, while it is expected to be in the present tense. Should I change it? Do you have any other thought about it? I know it is hard to understand beginning from the end (hopefully you have already read or not planning on reading the trilogy).</p>
<p>I have also finished the <i>Dragons of a New Age series</i> and the <i>Controversy</i> section, all the others are still focusing on the character as if she were alive, so if you wish to read some more, consider those two other sections only. I am also worried about the references: since I fill all the fields and add a relevant quote from the book, their section becomes just too large. Do you have an advice for this?

<dd>Hi, ReyBrujo. I had hoped to take a look at the article over my lunch break today, but that didn't pan out. I'll try to give it a look in the next couple of days.

<dd>Roger that. If you have any comment to do, please do it in the article's talk page so that it can be seen by anyone else.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disputed history of Igbos</span></h2>
<p>As you have asked me to stop reverting the Igbo people page, I will ask you the same. Please stop reverting the page. How can my edits be removing the source, when I was the one who sourced the edit? While I am fully aware and fully accept that Nat Okafor-Ogbaji's viewpoint, at present, is in the minority in terms of mainstream thought, this does not make him a "controversial" historian. You may be partial and in doubt towards said historians theory, however, this is not evidence enough to qualify Okafor-Ogbaji as "controversial". The whole point of my source, is that viewers can use the link, read the text in its entirety and decide for themselves whether he is credibe/"controversial". Also, whether the fact that the Igbos are descendants of the ancient Hebrews is true or indeed a fallacy, this does not change the fact that Eri, Arodi, and Areli ARE the sons of Gad. So while I accept that it would be slightly biased or partial to refer to them as "great explorers", they are brothers and sons of Gad never the less. This is not just the case, "according to Nat Okafor-Ogbaji", one only needs to open up a King James version Bible to verify this empirical fact (Gen 46:16). Ike.Q 13:15, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was perfectly willing to discuss this, so I hope I didn't offend. My reasoning is basically this: If you've got two subjects that have some relationship to one another, the relationship is only notable for the less famous or "notable" of the two. Thus, for example, we don't add a line to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> stating that <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Clarkson_b0db.html" title="Kelly Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> is from the United States. However, it <i>is</i> worth noting in <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Clarkson_b0db.html" title="Kelly Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>'s article that she is from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>; she's the less notable of the two subjects, and it's relevant information to have. Your article makes many links to other articles, but not all of these do or should link back to it. As a more noteworthy subject, I think <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Foster_7a97.html" title="Stephen Foster">Stephen Foster</a> is one of these. Anyway, sorry if I offended. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 23:04, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. However, as in the Moby/Melville example, you have one person notable from the past, and one person notable from the present. It is hard to measure who has heard more about Moby the singer, for instance, than who have heard about the author of "Moby Dick." Hence, my inclusion. However, I didn't know the ancestor's article had no mention of the descendent. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue">Parsssseltongue</a> 23:11, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Brian</p>
<p>Because a few nominators of FACs have appeared to need/desire a formal explanation of how they can improve their prose, I had the idea of writing an <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_How_to_satisfy_Criterion_2a_02d4.html" title="User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 2a">article</a> dedicated to this purpose. It would be a complement to Taxman's and Jengod's articles, and "Great writing" and "The perfect article". I wonder whether you'd mind having a look at it and letting me know what yout think, in terms of the overall concept and the effectiveness and appropriateness of the training aspect. I've completed only the introduction and the first area, "Redundancy", for which there are about 30 exercises. The remainder is just a messy paste-in of notes.</p>
<p>I don't want to continue until I have other people's opinions on the approach.</p>

<dd>I've piped in with my opinion on the dispute. I thought the discussion was pretty civil, actually, although your last comment is straying out of that territory with its sarcasm.

<p>Thanks. As you will have seen I am pretty new at this. I think perhaps I went into the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">Gambling</a> edit almost expecting trouble because I had previously read the archived comments by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Trail_Guide" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Trail_Guide" rel="nofollow">Trail Guide</a>. I know nothing about that particular dispute except that during the time I have been involved with <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">Gambling</a> (only a week or so, maybe 2) I have witnessed even more comments by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Trail_Guide" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Trail_Guide" rel="nofollow">Trail Guide</a> being archived off the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Talk%7EGambling_a473.html" title="Talk:Gambling">Talk:Gambling</a> page - presumably to conceal the comments from casual passers by. When I read the initial dispute (just for interest, I noticed that it all stemmed from a desire to insert a link (pehaps for commercial gain I don't know but it seemed maybe not) so I decided to see what would happen if I inserted a link. I chose an obviously non-commercial one <a href="http://www.gamcare.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.gamcare.com/" rel="nofollow">GamCare</a> but this was reverted out of hand thus mirroring the experience of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Trail_Guide" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Trail_Guide" rel="nofollow">Trail Guide</a>. I have no particular interest in that site being on or not but it did seem odd that one user could revert, out of hand, a completely harmless but potentially useful link. Then, to demonstrate my serious intent in the article, I carred out some detailed and I believe very helpful edits mostly on the variables involved in gambling - these have been left undisturbed. In the meantime I had read another dispute (can't trace it now) about the contents being on the right. I was amazed because until that point I had assumed it was there only for me because I was using a laptop and it was that which caused the contents to be squeezed out of position. So I decided to put my voice behind the "contents on the left" side by first making my comment about it "looking a mess" and then 2 days later whan no-one had commented, by making an edit. The rest you will have read no doubt. Enough ... I will watch the sarcasm; you are right but it was very tempting when their only justification seems to be "useless whitespace". I won't persue the dispute but maybe you could watch that page occasionally? Incidentally didn't you think his response to your comment was somewhat dismissive? Thanks again I appreciate it; I owe you one. <a href="../../../a/b/t/User%7EAbtract_088d.html" title="User:Abtract">Abtract</a> 07:28, 1 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Yeah, it does appear that TrialGuide was kind of dismissed out of hand (I'm assuming good faith on 2005's response to me). I am guessing that his or her comments were removed because they were construed as <a href="../../../p/a/_/WP%7EPA_04e2.html" title="WP:PA">personal attacks</a>. I don't think he or she was actually trying to attack anyone, but the comments could have been seen that way. And in that case, I believe that archiving is a superior solution to simply deleting comments. I can't speak to his/her accusations that comments were altered.

I think that you understand the issues involved. I feel your book on art may have equated <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennin.html" title="Tennin">Tennin</a> with <a href="../../../a/p/s/Apsara.html" title="Apsara">Apsara</a> to give more weight to the concept of Tennin or to clarify the point to the uninitiated – though I can not comment on that book as I have not read the same. There are several books which claim so many things and all such claims should be weighed on the totality of the available sources. I am not sure if Tennin is an exact <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_language.html" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> word for Apasara – only under this situation, both shall be the same.

<p>Do we have a policy about interwiki "red"links? My thought is that when the Disney-translation cruft gets inserted in articles, it be made into interwiki links. The only problem is, that will probably end up pointing to some articles that don't exist. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 21:27, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm unaware of any policy against "redlink" interwikis, although these will not show up as red. I think your idea is a good one though; tranform this translationcruft into interwiki links.

<p>Hey, I didn't notice your comment on my talk until now (someone else posted after you; I'm not used to more than one at a time&#160;:-)). I do go after print sources; I have a very good library collection at my disposal, which is what gave me the idea in the first place. Of the three reviews I've done so far, only <a href="../../../n/a/v/Talk%7ENaval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal_5b5e.html#Citation_spot_check" title="Talk:Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">one</a> has been print heavy; I've actually been surprised how much some FA noms rely on web sources; I guess the ones I usually comment on tend to be on subjects that tend more towards print sourcing. If I keep this project up over the long term, it may be interesting to see whether there's a correlation between number of errors and type of sources used, or something of that sort. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 04:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hate to bother you, but do you know anything about adding audio clips to articles? Someone at FAC asked for an audio clip of Jabba the Hutt since some of the discussion in the article is over producing his voice and sound effects in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.

<dd>Hmm. I don't know of any exemplary articles on individual television episodes. The <i>Dr. Who</i> episode articles aren't bad, but I think they are too given over to plot synopses. It would be nice to have some production notes to balance them out. In fact, the "Notes" section in a lot of them (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chase_%28Doctor_Who%29_e2fb.html" title="The Chase (Doctor Who)">The Chase (Doctor Who)</a>, for example) gives a lot of this background info, but it would be better to convert it into prose and give it its own section called "Production" or what have you.

As character article go, it's sort of a pilot for us at <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPMACH_7e0e.html" title="WP:WPMACH">WikiProject Machinima</a>. If you have the time and interest, I'd appreciate any feedback that you might have on it. I'll admit upfront that it's a little light on the critical reception side, but I don't think that there's much more that I can do about that, given the relative lack of information there; instead, I tried to focus on how the creators attempted to develop the character and how the voice acting was done.
