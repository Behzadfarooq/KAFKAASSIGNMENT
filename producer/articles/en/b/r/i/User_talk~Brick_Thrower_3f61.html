<p>On the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java (programming language)</a> you alphabetized the <b>See also</b> and <b>External links</b> sections and after I reverted the change explaining</p>

<p>This was news to me as I thought the choice to alphabetize was on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the editors of the page. In looking through the relevant <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbedded_list_d7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Embedded list">Wikipedia:Embedded list</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)</a> I see absolutely no mention of alphabetizing lists.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that all article changes are on a case-by-case basis, and therefore I present mine here. (P.S. I stole the LEAVE A MESSAGE code off of your page. Thanks!) I think the alphabetification rule applies here because:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I am acting to improve the article as recommended under the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Talk%7EJava_%28programming_language%29_ae99.html" title="Talk:Java (programming language)">talk page</a>. The lack of common proper presentation of lists is one of the reasons that this article was referenced to review the <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">Good Article Rules</a>.</li>
<li>Your declaration that there is already established an "order of relevance" about the list, without declaring what that relevance is, shows me that this particular section of the article definitely needs alphabetization. We are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, yes?</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> does not explicitly state that lists must be ordered alphabetically, yet to maintain the encyclopedic style that is the hallmark of WikiPedia, an alphabetical sort further reinforces this Neutral point of view.</li>
<li>I am a Java programmer, and I understand a lot on this page. However, the definite lack of order on this list makes it not only atrocious to read but unappealing and unworthy of a nominated <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Feature Article</a>, even to an experienced Java programmer like me. If the list is indeed "organized in order of relevance", then please edit the page to explain what this formula is (something like, "<i>how this list is sorted and how you can add new entries</i>") and how I can compute the article I am looking for from it. With an alphabetized list, I can scan immediately to the location I am interested in. A good test for whatever rule you post is what happened to me: I see that the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipse_%28software%29.html" title="Eclipse (software)">Eclipse (software)</a> article is good and definitely should be linked to from the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java (programming language)</a> page, but I don't know where to put it. I begin to scan the list, but don't immediately see Eclipse anywhere (The list is ordered in some sort of order, I am sure, but what I don't know). Perhaps others have been randomly adding their entries. It sure does look disordered, I have no idea why they have this list ordered so. While I am in the list adding Eclipse, I maight as well clean it up and place it into alphabetical order so that future editors don't run into this same problem that I did.</li>
<li><i>"...something of a link farm at the end."</i> by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">User:Marskell</a> under <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_review_Java_programming_language_9ceb.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article review/Java programming language">the commentary</a> on why this article was removed from being under review as a Feature Article.</li>
<li>The list in question is not an especially long list, however it does scroll off the page, thus losing focus on what the list is all about when you are near the bottom.</li>
<li>A newcomer to this article does not know that the list is sorted in any particular order of relevance. An alphabetical listing helps the newcomer.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>A good reason posted at the header section on the list would explain it all to me and I will happily <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rollback_%28data_management%29.html" title="Rollback (data management)">rollback</a> my alphabetization. Right now I don't see any reasoning behind the order, and will promote alfabeticazation. Thanks for posting!</dd>

<dd>Just a short reply (and thanks for your long reply to me). First, I've removed <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipse_%28software%29.html" title="Eclipse (software)">Eclipse (software)</a> (and <a href="../../../j/c/r/JCreator_5876.html" title="JCreator">JCreator</a>) from the <b>See also</b> list as they are already listed under the <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html#Java_Integrated_Development_Environments" title="Java (programming language)">Java (programming language)#Java Integrated Development Environments</a> (sorry if this was confusing and hard to know where to put it). Second, as with any decision concerning presentation of the information in the article, there is an element of subjectivity in determining the order of relevanve. This subjectivity is part of the editorial process, and not necessarily indicative of a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. For what it's worth, the relevance formula goes something like this:</dd>

<dd>Well, okay, I agree that it's some form of organization, but it looks a little complicated to me. The presentation of the categories seem like you are trying to tutor the reader, the way an instructor teaches a class, instead of providing information to Him, and He can follow the links of his interest, like an encyclopedia would provide. I think that alphabetification is a simpler solution than having to read categorization instructions for a list, just to understand the list elements themselves. <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html#Java_Integrated_Development_Environments" title="Java (programming language)">Your reference example</a> is alphabetized; why change strategies in mid-article? Why not add sub-categories to the SEE ALSO section, just like you did here? All you have to do is name the subcats and give a one-liner blurb for each. I can work with that! I stand by my assertion: If you work these subcats into the header section then we don't need my alphabetized version. // <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrick_Thrower_da1d.html" title="User:Brick Thrower">Brick Thrower</a> 11:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand (a) why this is complicated, (b) why this would be other than providing information, or (c) why alphabetizing makes everything alright. The assumption is that the user does not have a particular item in mind while reading the <b>See also</b> list, but is instead reading it to discover topics that might be of further interest. The point of organizing the items by relevance is so that as they read the list, they discover the most relevant items first. The other list you refer to is titled for a narrow subject (IDEs), and (a) there is no order of relevance, and (b) the user might be looking for something in particular. If you agree that there was some rational reasoning behind the organization, why isn't it better than organizing in a manner that imparts no information whatsoever? I just guess I'm confused by why not having the list alphabetized is so vexing to you.</dd>

The link to my user page is already on the talk page where it belongs—it definitely doesn't belong as part of the encyclopedic article, which has nothing to do with my contributions on Wikipedia.

<dd>I posted my reasons for alphabetization just a few paragraphs up (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_%28P%E2%80%93Z%29_ba62.html#Q" title="List of Latin phrases (P–Z)">qq.v.</a>). Please address them individually by the number I assigned. I have a good case for alphabetizing as I found direct references from past reviewers who say this part of the article is a link-farm and needs work. You yourself have provided me an additional reason: You say that <i>The assumption is that...</i>, which is definitely a POV stance that is NOT neutral. I came to this list and did NOT have this assumption, therefore that argument is flawed. For myself, I don't understand your insistence and enforcement of some complex artificial ordering which is not even declared to the Reader! Alphabetization is a natural ordering; It is quite common to use dictionaries, encyclopedias, address books, etc. in an orderly alphabetic fashion. Nobody has to think when looking at an alphabetized list; I couldn't figure out your categorized-but-not-declared list, and believe that it does not promote a NPOV. Are you saying that an alphabetized list does not support WikiPedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point Of View</a>? // <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrick_Thrower_da1d.html" title="User:Brick Thrower">Brick Thrower</a> 18:16, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, <b>time out</b>. I'm making an assumption about the reader in order to exercise editorial judgement in order to make the article as useful as possible. By arguing for alphabetization, you are doing exactly the same thing. The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy is about the content of the article...I'm not promoting any point of view on the subject, and I'm not organizing the links to promote a point of view, I'm simply trying to organize the article in the manner that I believe would be most useful to the reader. We may differ on what is most efficient to the reader, but your continued reference to Wikipedia's NPOV policy in regard to this is off base—unless you are making the claim that the order of the <b>See also</b> links is intended to promote a POV (in which case it would help if you identified what that POV <i>is</i>), then there is no POV issue here. Can we get off that subject and just discuss this without finger pointing? I'm not saying you have any motivation other than what you've stated (trying to improve the article), so can you please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume the same good faith</a> with me?</dd>

<dd>I'll address your previous points:
<ol>
<li>We're both just trying to improve the article. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_good_article__31af.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a good article?">Wikipedia:What is a good article?</a> doesn't say anything about lists being alphabetized. In fact, despite your numerous links to Wikipedia policy pages, not a single one of them has talked about alphabetizing—not even a passing mention.</li>
<li>I think I've addressed this pretty completely.</li>
<li>Maybe it would help if instead of continually linking to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> you tell me what part of the policy you think I'm violating.</li>
<li>As I pointed out, the item you were searching for was referenced under an appropriately named section heading. I can appreciate your issue with trying to decide where in the list to place a new item. I certainly agree with adding some of the rationale I gave above for the ordering by precedence as editor comments; maybe even separate the see also list into <b>Java language</b> and <b>Related topics</b> sections to help the reader more quickly find what they are looking for. Does this work for you?</li>
<li>The "link farm" comment is directed at the external links section, not the <b>See also</b> section. The external links are already organized into subsections and there is no clear way to alphabetize them, so I haven't been discussing them.</li>
<li>Breaking into <b>Java language</b> and <b>Related topics</b> sections in the <b>See also</b> should address this concern, such as it is.</li>
<li>I just simply disagree with your opinion on this one.</li>

<dd>One policy page I'd like to point you at that I think supports my reasoning behind using an order of relevance is <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbedded_list_d7c5.html#.22Related_topics.22_.28navigational_lists.29" title="Wikipedia:Embedded list">Wikipedia:Embedded list#"Related topics" (navigational lists)</a> which says:</dd>

<dd>OK, if you don't have anything else to say on the subject I'm going to go ahead and refactor the <b>See also</b> and maybe the <b>External links</b> sections. The <b>See also</b> won't be alphabetic, but I will try to address the points you made to make it better than it was before you alphabetized it. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 18:37, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>May be I am doing something wrong here as I could not work out how to provide the reply on:(cur) (last) 19:50, 6 January 2007 Brick Thrower (Talk | contribs) (// revert unexplained massive deletion of Russian dolmens. Please provide explanation)</p>
<p>This too long section was deleted and separate entry on Russian Dolmens was created because relooking few days later at expanded article it was noted that the general flow of text was not as good as it was before and because specific section on Eurasia being much longer and with separate subheadings if compared against other paragraphs on Europe and Asia, for example.</p>
<p>If you think that there is no case for separate entry, please let me know.
