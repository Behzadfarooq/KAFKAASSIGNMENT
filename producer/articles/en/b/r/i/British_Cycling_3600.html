<p>The British Cycling Federation (BCF) was formed in 1959 after the amalgamation of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Cyclists%27_Union_e7df.html" title="National Cyclists' Union">National Cyclists' Union</a> (the NCU, which had regulated Britain's track and closed circuit racing) and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_League_of_Racing_Cyclists_ef00.html" title="British League of Racing Cyclists">British League of Racing Cyclists</a> (the BLRC, which had taken the lead in promoting road races on public roads since its formation in 1942). The BCF also took over the NCU's international recognition by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Cycliste_Internationale_901f.html" title="Union Cycliste Internationale">UCI</a>.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the BCF also merged with the British Cyclo-Cross Association (BCCA), the British Mountain Bike Federation (BMBF), the English BMX Association (EBA), and the British Cycle Speedway Council (BCSC). Each became a commission within the BCF organisation.</p>
<p>The EBA had been formed by the amalgamation in November 1989 of the UK BMX Association (UK.BMX.A) and the British BMX Association (B.BMX.A).</p>
<p>In recognition of the mergers, the BCF was rebranded as 'British Cycling'.</p>
<p>Only road time-trials in England and Wales remain outside of the British Cycling umbrella at this time, but <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycling_Time_Trials_3242.html" title="Cycling Time Trials">Cycling Time Trials</a> work together with British Cycling in organising the Time Trial National Championships.</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycling_club.html" title="Cycling club">Cycling clubs</a> or <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycling_team.html" title="Cycling team">cycling teams</a> must be affiliated to British Cycling before their members can race in British Cycling sanctioned events. Adult road racers are given a racing licence according to their excellence, ranging from beginners in fourth category through to the top riders in first and elite categories. There are also special licences for under-18 riders and for women.</p>
<p>While Britain has not produced many cycling greats and has few riders on the professional road circuit, there are a number of good British mountain bikers, <a href="../../../b/m/x/BMX_aa44.html" title="BMX">BMX</a> riders and track cyclists. Performances at international level have improved since lottery funding was introduced in the late 1990s with three golds in the 2002 World Track Championships bettered by four golds in 2005. Internal <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur.html" title="Amateur">amateur</a> events are well organised and although cycling is a minority sport, recreational cycling is very popular.</p>
<p>In September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, British Cycling helped organise the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_of_Britain_bcba.html" title="Tour of Britain">Tour of Britain</a>, a five-day cycle race climaxing in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in front of a packed crowd. This did much to improve the profile of <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_bicycle_racing.html" title="Road bicycle racing">road racing</a> in the UK, although many of the teams competing did not send their finest riders.</p>
<p>British Cycling selects the Great Britain cycling teams for European Championships, World Championships, and the Olympic Teams (including for road time-trials were applicable). The organisation is a member of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Europ%C3%A9enne_de_Cyclisme_5dab.html" title="Union EuropÃ©enne de Cyclisme">European Cycling Union</a> (UEC) continental <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederation.html" title="Confederation">confederacy</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Cycliste_Internationale_901f.html" title="Union Cycliste Internationale">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI), and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Olympic_Association_c3d3.html" title="British Olympic Association">British Olympic Association</a>.</p>
<p>British Cycling does have links with many other cycling organisations in the UK, such as the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Cycling_Campaign_39e1.html" title="London Cycling Campaign">London Cycling Campaign</a> (LCC), <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclists%27_Touring_Club_6bc3.html" title="Cyclists' Touring Club">Cyclists' Touring Club</a> (CTC), <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Mountain_Bicycling_Association_52ac.html" title="International Mountain Bicycling Association">International Mountain Bicycling Association</a> (IMBA) and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustrans.html" title="Sustrans">Sustrans</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Cycling_3600.html" title="Edit section: Northern Ireland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Northern Ireland</span></h3>
<p>In 1878 the Irish Cycling Association (ICA) was formed to administer cycling on the island.</p>
<p>In 1884, the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> (GAA) was formed to resist British rule by segregating sport. Cycling soon began to feature at GAA meetings. Before long, the ICA was composed mainly of unionists and moderate nationalists from urban areas, whereas the GAA cyclists were mostly from rural areas and tended to hold strong nationalist views. Conflict soon arose between the two rival groups.</p>
<p>Following <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_Ireland_6ee0.html" title="Partition of Ireland">partition</a> in 1921, the differences were resolved by the formation of an all-Ireland body, the National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland (NACA or NACAI). However, the new body eventually suffered from disputes between its central council representatives from Northern Ireland, and those from the south.</p>
<p>In 1949 a breakaway group in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation, was created and successfully applied for official recognition to international governing body the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Cycliste_Internationale_901f.html" title="Union Cycliste Internationale">UCI</a>. They also formed an association with the British Cycling Federation.</p>
<p>The NACA refused to accept this division, and as a consequence was suspended from international competition by the UCI. Within Northern Ireland cyclists divided between the two bodies largely according to their social and political affiliations.</p>
<p>That same year, another group broke away from NACA, this time in Dublic. They were also recognised by the UCI, and became the Cumann RothaÃ­ochta na hÃireann (CRE). In 1967 CRE changed its name to become the Irish Cycling Federation (ICF).</p>
<p>There were therefore official national governing bodies north and south of the border, and the two bodies cooperated to enter all-Ireland teams in international competitions.</p>
<p>However, the NACA remained in existence, and its cycling branch, the National Cycling Association (NCA) continued to organise cycling both north and south of the border, and continued its association with the GAA.</p>
<p>Participation at international events became a major grievance of the nationalists. At the 1955 World Amateur Cycling Championships, an unofficial NCA team tried to line up alongside the official (CRE/NICF) Irish team, leading to the outbreak of fighting.</p>
<p>At the Munich Olympics in 1972, the ICF send a team to officially represent the Republic of Ireland. The NCA sent a squad selected from the entire 32 counties, who ended up attacking some of the members of the ICF team during the road race.</p>
<p>In 1979 the Irish Cycling Tripartite Committee (ICTC) was set up between the ICF, NCA, and NICF as a forum within which differences between the cycling associations would be worked out and joint racing ventures organised.</p>
<p>The Northern Ireland Cycling Federation (NICF) continued to affiliate to the world body (now the International Amateur Cycling Federation or FIAC) as an independent entity and to pay its own fees. New regulations subsequently stated that only one fee would be accepted from each designated nation, and in 1986 the NICF's fee was rejected with Irish affiliation to the FIAC passing to the ICTC.</p>
<p>This led to proposals for amalgamation of the three governing bodies. This proved acceptable to both the ICF and the NCA, but caused a split within the NICF. A vote to accept the merger was challenged in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courts_of_Northern_Ireland_2460.html" title="Courts of Northern Ireland">High Court</a> where it was overturned.</p>
<p>This caused those who supported the change (nearly 75% of members, and 70% of the clubs) to leave and form a new body, the Ulster Cycling Federation (UCF), which affiliated to the new all-Ireland body, the Federation of Irish Cyclists (FIC), which was then admitted to the FIAC in September 1988 as the sole governing body for Ireland.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, cycling continued to be split between two groups. Funding from the Sports Council for Northern Ireland was channeled to the officially recognised UCF, whereas <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist.html" title="Unionist">Unionist</a> local councils chose to support the NICF, again illustrating how sport became bound up in Northern Ireland's political conflict.</p>
<p>The NICF members felt that, as British citizens, they were entitled to join the BCF. However, for several years the UCI blocked this, stating that the NICF riders should take licences from the FIC.</p>
<p>However, in 1992 the UCI relented, and issued a derogation to its regulations to permit NICF members to race under BCF licences. However, the NICF was not permitted to take any fuller part in the BCF, and had to occupy a 'semi-detached' status. The UCI attempted to further reconcile the NICF and the FIC. This attempt by the UCI was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Then, in 1995, the AGM of the British Cycling Federation passed a resolution granting the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation the same status as the regional governing bodies in Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>Subsequently in November 2001 the BCF placed the Tour of the North, an Ulster-based race, on their 'Premier Calendar'.</p>
<p>This proved too much for the UCI, who passed a resolution at their 2002 congress in <a href="../../../z/o/l/Zolder.html" title="Zolder">Zolder</a> to restrict the actions of the BCF and NICF in Northern Ireland, and to restate that Irish Cycling Federation (or ICF, as the FIC had become in 1998) was the sole governing body for cycling in the entire island of Ireland.</p>
<p>By September 2004, an agreement to properly implement this arrangement had been reached British Cycling (the new name for the BCF) and Cycling Ireland (the new name for the ICF).</p>
<p>To bring to a close the long running split, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_14.html" title="December 14">14 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the NICF held a Special General Meeting, at which they voted to amalgamate with Cycling Ulster in 2007. As a result all NICF member clubs will switch affiliation from British Cycling to Cycling Ireland, and there will only be one body organising cycling events in all of Ireland. Cycling Ireland members will still be able to opt for their preferred nationality code on the licence, thus preserving their political and cultural identities.</p>
