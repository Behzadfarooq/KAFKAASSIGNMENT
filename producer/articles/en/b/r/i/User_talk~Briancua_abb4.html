<p>I think that between us we should be able to significantly clean up/improve this page, but we need to agree on somekinda overall strategy. I think that the fundamentals contribution represented a serious improvement, by helping to draw all the elements together, and making it clear how the RCC understands and builds its ST. Without it the whole article loooks like a fairly arbitary set of rules and conditions. Lets talk about it on the Talk page a bit before we get into any more editing.

<p>Thanks for your comments. One question: do you remember the source for the fact that Pius distributed money to people when Rome got bombed? This was removed a long time ago by another user because there was no source provided. If there is a source, we also need a date for when this happened. Also some context. Pius performed many acts of charity during the war, some notable, some not. If he distributed a lot of money though, this seems notable. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 23:57, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you'll find that I addressed all of your comments with the following exceptions: I really don't know how to follow up on this Knights of Columbus video and I don't have a book on me right now that talks about Pius's relationship with Japan. I'll see what I can do on these.

<p>This move makes sense because Counter-Reformation implies that that the movement was against reform. Rather as a reform movement within the Catholic Church, it is most precisely known as the Catholic Reformation. This is now the more favored term in academic theological circles.</p>

<p>But as I pointed out, I'm a heathen, and worse, an evil homosexual who'll burn in hell for ever if your church has its way. I'm just not interested in the topic, and I'm offended by the way the church has focused on people's genitals for the past century, and killed thousands (millions?) of African women because of the ban on condoms.</p>
<p>Having said that, I want your article to be in the best prose possible. <i>Surely</i> there are WPians who are sympathetic to the cause ... Have you tried researching the categories of WPians? What about other catholic-oriented articles—look at the history for each, and find good copy-editors. This would be an investment in your future WP contributions, too.</p>

<p>Hello, the KofC article is in very good shape and there's not <i>too much</i> copy editing to do. I worked on the intro so as to make it more readable, and I think it's stronger now. I did delet "family" and I apologise if that needs to be in there, though I think "fraternal service organization" covers it and the family aspect becomes apparent later in the article. Let me know if you have any questions regarding that. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurcielago_d7c0.html" title="User:Murcielago">Murcielago</a> 14:50, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! I noticed that in your scratchpad / draft / alternative article <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriancua_list_4126.html" title="User:Briancua/list">User:Briancua/list</a> you have the categories still activated, so it's showing up in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnimals_ac59.html" title="Category:Animals">Category:Animals</a> and a few others. Could I suggest that you deactivate them (by putting a colon before 'Category' in the link) until such time as the article is in the mainspace rather than the userspace? (As per <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a>, "If you copy an article to your user namespace (for example, as a temporary draft or in response to an edit war) you should decategorize it".)

<p>Yes... i hated to use James Dobsons views as an attack, and I know that i should not have. but the main problem is that there are NO I repeat NO counter claims in defense of pornography with a reputable source and easily verifiable claims. This ALONE on such a hotly debated (Though perhaps not quite as much nowadays as in the 90's) topic... is good standing to almost INSTANTLY slap a POV notification, as well as a weasel word template due to it only giving the reader (Whom as i've said in numerous other topics with matters similar to this) Might just be looking for answers, research, or an average teenager trying to see if looking at pornoraphy will send them to hell or not etc. etc.</p>
<p>So that's why I consider it important that at least an EQUAL amount of statements for both sides of this debate be placed INSIDE the article and be in a seperate section for each of them which is easily viewable. (Perhaps set up the article so it has general definition of addiction first, then general info on the debate, and then seperate sections for views FOR and AGAINST or vice versa of the existence and proliferation of pornography addiction which conform to ALL wikipedia standards.)</p>
<p>I think this should be a minimum and that the internet section should have extra details added, and the plethora of recovering from addiction links be shortened down to a few informational ones instead of five links leading to different pages on a single website.</p>
<p>I think this is quite reasonable and I hope that this can be met up with on your part</p>
