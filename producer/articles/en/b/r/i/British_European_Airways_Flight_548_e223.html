<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_European_Airways_Flight_548_e223.html" title="Edit section: Accident Synopsis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accident Synopsis</span></h2>
<p>The aircraft, registered as G-ARPI and known familiarly as "Papa India", was on a scheduled flight from London to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> under the command of Captain Stanley Key, one of BEA's most senior captains. 22-year-old Second Officer J.W. Keighley sat in the right-hand seat, while the slightly more experienced 24-year-old Second Officer S. Ticehurst acted as monitoring pilot. During the climb-out from Heathrow, while the aircraft was flown at the correct speed for the configuration, the leading-edge lift-augmentation droop was prematurely retracted. This led to a series of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stall_%28flight%29.html" title="Stall (flight)">stalls</a>. The condition was not rectified by the pilots despite the operation of the <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stick_pusher.html" title="Stick pusher">stick pusher</a>, and the aircraft entered a <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_stall.html" title="Deep stall">deep stall</a> from which there was no possibility of recovery. The aircraft rapidly descended with a high, nose-up attitude, until striking the ground close to the <a href="../../../a/3/0/A30_road.html" title="A30 road">A30</a> near the King George VI Reservoir on the outskirts of Staines. There was no fire on impact, which was unusual for the flat descent crash the plane committed.</p>
<p>This aircraft has previously been involved in an accident when its tail was torn off by an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airspeed_Ambassador_1123.html" title="Airspeed Ambassador">Airspeed Ambassador</a> which crashed at Heathrow on 3 July 1968.</p>

<p>The question facing the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Accidents_Investigation_Branch_19fd.html" title="Air Accidents Investigation Branch">Air Accidents Investigation Branch</a> was the underlying cause of the crash. Although the immediate cause of the stall was easily determined, detailed examination of the wreckage and <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_data_recorder.html" title="Flight data recorder">flight recorder</a> revealed no evidence of any mechanical or <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structural_failure.html" title="Structural failure">structural failure</a>. Investigators soon discovered, however, that <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_factors.html" title="Human factors">human factors</a> likely played a major role. At the time of the accident, BEA was involved in a labour dispute with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Air_Line_Pilots_Association_b4ed.html" title="British Air Line Pilots Association">British Air Line Pilots Association</a>. Approximately one hour before the flight, the vehemently anti-union Captain Key had entered into a heated argument with another captain about the desirability of strike action. Both of Key's subordinate officers on the flight were present during the confrontation. Also, among the wreckage of Papa India, investigators found a crew table on which the following offensive graffiti directed at the captain had been scribbled:</p>

<p>A handwriting examiner testified at the inquiry that neither S/O Ticehurst or S/O Keighley were responsible for the graffiti. It is not known if Captain Key saw it on the day of the accident.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_European_Airways_Flight_548_e223.html" title="Edit section: Autopsy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Autopsy</span></h2>
<p>Post-mortems of the accident victims showed that all on board had died from injuries received in the accident. However, the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopsy.html" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a> of Captain Key also revealed undiagnosed <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_artery_disease.html" title="Coronary artery disease">coronary artery disease</a>, including evidence of a small healed and possibly silent <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. More telling, a recent tear was found in the inner lining of the left descending <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronary_artery.html" title="Coronary artery">coronary artery</a>. Two <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiologists.html" title="Cardiologists">cardiologists</a> who examined the Captain's remains testified that the tear probably occurred during or after his outburst in the flight crew room. The cardiologists were not agreed as to the level of incapacitation likely experienced by Captain Key in the minutes and seconds preceding his death, but both felt that the Captain would have been distracted to some extent by the developing cardiac event.</p>
<p>The AAIB also examined a number of crew interaction aspects which it found wanting, including Captain Key's forbidding personality and S/O Keighley's previously documented lack of initiative in simulated emergency situations. The Board also examined how BEA's training schedule for new staff had been disrupted by the labour dispute, leaving inexperienced pilots like S/O Keighley unable to undertake the more complicated but less critical duties of monitoring pilot and in effect forcing them into the role of first officer long before they were ready for that position.</p>
<p>The main questions remained, however: who moved the droop retraction lever, and why was action not taken to correct the error? Furthermore, did the crew override the automatic stall warning system because prior experience with false activations led them to believe it was unreliable, or did a medical emergency in the cockpit distract the crew from its duties?</p>
<p>The AAIB ultimately could not determine a probable cause for the accident. Based on evidence presented during the inquiry, the Board made a series of recommendations with respect to operation of the Trident, crew training, cockpit resource management, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockpit_voice_recorder.html" title="Cockpit voice recorder">cockpit voice recorders</a>, and effective medical examinations. The Board's findings were confirmed by a judicial inquiry under <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Lane%2C_Baron_Lane_ea4d.html" title="Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane">Mr Justice Lane</a>. Load control measures were also taken. Prior to the accident, the cabin of the aircraft was divided into 3 sections, A B C. Section B was immediately in the middle of the aircraft over the wing area. When the load sheet was worked out the middle section of the aircraft, section B was not considered as important. It was more important to trim the aircraft by balancing section A and section C. The incident made loading the aircraft stricter by making sure that section B was also taken into account for the aircraft to be in trim for take-off.</p>

<p>Two memorials in Staines were dedicated on 18th June 2004.</p>
<p>The first is in the form of a stained glass window in St. Mary's Church, Church Street. The second is a slightly more accessible area of reflection with seating on the Moormead estate, close to where the accident occurred.</p>
