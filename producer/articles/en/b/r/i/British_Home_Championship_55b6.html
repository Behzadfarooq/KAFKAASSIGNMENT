<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Home_Championship_55b6.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>By the early <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>, the development of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_in_the_United_Kingdom_e389.html" title="Football in the United Kingdom">football in the United Kingdom</a> was gathering pace and the four national football teams of the UK were playing regular friendlies against each other, with nearly every team playing all the others annually. At the time, the football associations of each <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Nations_39df.html" title="Home Nations">Home Nation</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_Association_b0ba.html" title="The Football Association">The Football Association</a> (England), the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Football_Association_46e9.html" title="Scottish Football Association">Scottish Football Association</a>, the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_Association_of_Wales_0625.html" title="Football Association of Wales">Football Association of Wales</a> and the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Football_Association_a162.html" title="Irish Football Association">Irish Football Association</a>) had slightly different rules for football, and when matches were played the rules of whoever was the home team were used. While this solution was workable, it was hardly ideal. To remedy this, the four associations met in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> and agreed on one uniform set of worldwide rules. They also established the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Football_Association_Board_8a69.html" title="International Football Association Board">International Football Association Board</a> (IFAB) to approve changes to the rules (a task that they still perform to this day).</p>
<p>The new rules meant that formal international competitions could now easily be devised. Thus, at the same meeting, the associations formalised the annual friendlies and the British Home Championship - the world's first international football competition - was born.</p>
<p>The Championship was held every football season, starting with the 1883-84 season (the first ever match seeing eventual winners Scotland beat Ireland 5-0 away on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_24.html" title="January 24">January 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>). The dates of the fixtures varied, but they tended to bunch towards the end of the season (sometimes the entire competition was held in a few days at the end of the season). Initially, the winner of the competition was seen as the best team in the world, though as football developed globally this tag was dropped. The rise of other international competitions, especially the <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_e470.html" title="FIFA World Cup">World Cup</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Football_Championship_a5bb.html" title="European Football Championship">European Championships</a>, meant that the British Home Championship lost a lot of its prestige as the years went on.</p>
<p>However, the new international tournaments meant that the Championship took on added importance in certain years. The 1949-50 and 1953-54 Championships doubled up as qualifying groups for the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1950_c40a.html" title="Football World Cup 1950">1950</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1954_32b9.html" title="Football World Cup 1954">1954</a> World Cups respectively and the results of the 1966-67 and 1967-68 Championships were used to determine who went forward to the second qualifying round of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_European_Football_Championship_d16f.html" title="1968 European Football Championship">Euro '68</a>.</p>
<p>The British Home Championship was discontinued after the 1983-84 competition. There were a number of reasons for the tournament's demise, including it being overshadowed by the World Cup and European Championships, falling attendances at all but the England v Scotland games, fixture congestion, the rise of <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooliganism.html" title="Hooliganism">hooliganism</a> to epidemic levels, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">the Troubles</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> (civil unrest led to the 1981-82 competition being abandoned), and England and Scotland's desire to play against 'stronger' teams. The fate of the competition was settled when the (English) Football Association, swiftly followed by the Scottish Football Association, announced in 1983 that they would not be entering after the 1983-84 Championship. <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html#Irony_of_fate" title="Irony">Ironically</a>, the 'weaker' teams that England and Scotland no longer wanted to play excelled in the final Championship: Northern Ireland won it and Wales finished second. The British Home Championship trophy remains at the Irish Football Association's headquarters in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>.</p>
<p>The Championship was replaced by the smaller <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rous_Cup_5f8d.html" title="Rous Cup">Rous Cup</a>, which involved just England, Scotland and, in later years, an invited guest team from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. That competition, however, ended after just five years.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many proposals to resurrect the British Home Championship, with advocates pointing to rising attendances and a significant downturn in football-related violence. It has been suggested that a reborn Championship could replace the international friendlies played by the UK teams between competitive fixtures, which some view as pointless. Qualifying for the 2006 World Cup saw a rise in interest for the rebirth of the British Home Championship, as England, Wales and Northern Ireland were paired in one group, giving it a distinctly nostalgic feel. This was especially apparent at the match in Belfast between Northern Ireland and England, where many Northern Irish fans displayed banners celebrating the fact that they were reigning 'British Champions'.</p>

<p>The competition was contested with each team playing the other three once each (making for a total of three matches per team and six matches in total). Generally (but not always), the teams would play either one or two matches at home and the remainder away, with home advantage between two teams alternating each year (so if England played Scotland at home one year, they would play them away the next).</p>
<p>A team would receive two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. From these points, a league table was constructed and whoever was top at the end of the competition was declared the winner. If two or more teams were equal on points, that position in the league table was shared (as was the Championship if it occurred between the top teams). From the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> Championship onwards, however, goal difference (total goals scored minus total goals conceded) was used to differentiate between teams level on points. If goal difference could still not separate them, then total goals scored was used.</p>

<p>The Scotland v England match of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">April 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a> will always be remembered for the <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrox_disaster.html" title="Ibrox disaster">Ibrox Disaster of 1902</a>. The match took place at Ibrox Park (now <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrox_Stadium_6e37.html" title="Ibrox Stadium">Ibrox Stadium</a>) in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. During the first half, a section of the terracing in the overcrowded West Stand collapsed, killing twenty-six and injuring over 500. Play was stopped, but, incredibly, was restarted after twenty minutes, with most of the crowd not knowing what had happened. The match was later declared void and replayed at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa_Park%2C_England_f097.html" title="Villa Park, England">Villa Park</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>.</p>

<p>As stated above, the 1949-50 British Home Championship was used as a qualification group for the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1950_c40a.html" title="Football World Cup 1950">Football World Cup 1950</a>, with the teams finishing both first and second qualifying. England and Scotland were guaranteed the top two places and World Cup qualification with one match to go, when the Scottish Football Association declared that it would only go to the 1950 World Cup if they were the British champions. Scotland played England at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampden_Park_6ad8.html" title="Hampden Park">Hampden Park</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a> in the final game and lost 1-0 to a goal by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chelsea_F.C._c6c0.html" title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a>'s <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Bentley_ede4.html" title="Roy Bentley">Roy Bentley</a>, dubbed 'the man who robbed Scotland of Rio'. Consequently, Scotland finished second and withdrew from what would have been their first-ever World Cup appearance.</p>

<p>The 1966-67 British Home Championship was the first since England's victory at the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_1966_c38c.html" title="Football World Cup 1966">World Cup 1966</a>. Naturally, England were favourites for the Championship title. In the end, the outcome of the entire Championship rested on the final game: England v Scotland at <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>. If England won or drew, they would win the Championship; if Scotland won, they would triumph. Scotland beat the World Cup winners 3-2. The match was followed by a large, but relatively harmless, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_invasion.html" title="Pitch invasion">pitch invasion</a> by the jubilant Scottish fans, who were quick to jokingly declare Scotland the 'World Champions', as the game was England's first defeat since winning the World Cup. The Scots' joke ultimately led to the conception of the <a href="../../../u/n/o/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships_7223.html" title="Unofficial Football World Championships">Unofficial Football World Championships</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, the 1976-77 Championship came down to the final game between England and Scotland at Wembley on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>. Scotland won the game 2-1, making them Champions. Like 1967, a pitch invasion by the overjoyed Scottish fans followed, but it was now the height of hooliganism and extensive damage ensued: the pitch was ripped up (although it was going to be relaid after the game) and taken back to Scotland in small pieces along with one of the broken crossbars.</p>

<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a> in Northern Ireland had affected the British Home Championship before, with things turning so hostile that Northern Ireland often had to play their 'home' games in <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> or <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. The entire 1980-81 Championship was held in May 1981, which coincided with a large amount of civil unrest in Northern Ireland surrounding the <a href="../../../m/a/z/Maze_%28HM_Prison%29_3ad2.html" title="Maze (HM Prison)">Maze Prison</a> hunger strikes. Northern Ireland's two home matches, against England and Wales, were not moved, so both teams refused to travel to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> to play. As not all the matches were completed, that year's competition was declared void with no winner. It was the only time in the Championship's history, apart from during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, that it was not awarded.</p>
