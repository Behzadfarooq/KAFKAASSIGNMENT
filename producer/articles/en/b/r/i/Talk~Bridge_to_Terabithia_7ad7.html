<p>In the initial information part, before the spoiler warning, it states: " a tragedy happens. So Jesse uses the courage that Leslie gave him to cope with the tragedy." This line, appearing before the spoiler suggestion, strongly implies Leslie's fate, atleast it seems that way to me, and since this stuff about the tragedy is stated again, and in more detail, later on, and past the spoiler warning, I think this little bit should be removed from the begining info at the top of the article. If no one has any objections, I'll take that info out of the introduction a few days from now, unless someone disagree's, and then we can discuss.</p>

<p>There was a fairly short-lived band in the 1990s called Terabithia<sup><a href="http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue1/reviews/rev-T.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spacecityrock.com/issue1/reviews/rev-T.html" rel="nofollow">cite</a></sup> (for which there is not yet an article), but <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terabithia.html" title="Terabithia">Terabithia</a> merely redirects to this article. Could we have a little "For the musical group, see Terabithia (band)" line at the beginning? I ask before placing it, so as to head off any potential edit-war over the issue. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoosh_95d4.html" title="User:Skoosh">skoosh</a> [[User_talk:Skoosh|(háblame)]] 04:13, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I have to admit, I was impressed that by typing in "Terebithia" in the search bar, I got directed here. But in the section under "Controversy", which is titled "Terebithia", I got a little confused. It refers to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terebinthia.html" title="Terebinthia">Terebinthia</a>, but send a link to Terebithia. I'm confused. FruitMart07 01:30, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's been many years since I read the book, but I find it hard to believe that its place in libraries has been widely challenged on the various bases suggested here. (The reference link only establishes that it has been challenged, not why.) In fact, as I recall, the book is explicitly Christian in its consideration of Easter. I think that it's more likely that it has been challenged for its Christian content (in non-sectarian, public libraries) than for "secular humanism" or "satanism". Could someone supply references here?</p>
<ul>
<li>I remember being forced to read this absurd bit of trash as a child, and I suspect that if it's ever been banned, it's because the book is possibly one of the worst novels ever, and the publically stated reasons are just a pretext. The book is so terrible as to have become legendary in my family as the archetype of bad fiction. I may personally vehemenently oppose censorship, but if I had no moral problems with censorship and were in a position to ban that book, I certainly would do so, regardless of what excuse I could come up with. <a href="../../../j/d/s/User%7EJDS2005_7cea.html" title="User:JDS2005">JDS2005</a> 07:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'd like to beg your pardon. This novel is beautifully written by Katherine Paterson, with a true heart and understanding of children, families, friendships, and relationships. Not only does her novel delve into these issues, but its lessons of values such as courage, death, grieving, socioeconomic status, gender roles... are thoroughly linked throughout the story. The author's ability to bring these intense political, religious, and personal beliefs and questions alive through her use of personification, metaphors, and symbolism shows literary genius. It need not matter what religion one is to know that death is inevitable, and the grieving process is real, and the guilt and anger one feels is true. Leslie teaches us all a lesson of risk, and guides scaredy-cat Jess over this symbolic bridge, from one place to another, whether into the land of Terabithia or our own world. Leslie helps to foster Jess's creativity, ability to risk and love, and to help guide him to be a better person. In turn, Jess will pass this on, as we all should. Jennifer Ferrara Educator</p>

<li>The above two comments are not relevant and have no place on Wikipedia, discussion page or not. Anyway, according to deletecensorship.org, this book has been removed from libraries due to "profanity, disrespect of adults, and an elaborate fantasy world that might lead to confusion." (<a href="http://www.deletecensorship.org/bridge_to_terabithia.html" class="external free" title="http://www.deletecensorship.org/bridge_to_terabithia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.deletecensorship.org/bridge_to_terabithia.html</a>). I wasn't sure how to work this into the section as it stands, so I'll leave that to someone more experienced, but thought I would provide the source. Thestorm042 11:21, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Did some looking and found good (and interesting) reference. An on-line newspaper called The <b>Takoma Voice</b> has a June 2005 article called "Lisa Hill and the Bridge to Terabithia by Diana Kohn" at <a href="http://www.takoma.com/features_takomaarchives.html" class="external text" title="http://www.takoma.com/features_takomaarchives.html" rel="nofollow">"Our History:Takoma Archives"</a>.

<p>I am convinced that Lisa Hill's death probably had something to do with some evil, supernatural force. I mean, come on, lightning doesn't just strike out of nowhere on hot sunny days24.29.74.132 21:03, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does May Belle really become the "Queen" of Terabithia? or the Princess?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the last scene Jess says he is the king and that she is his princess. Cheers! Wassupwestcoast 12:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are having a Literary Presentation on the book Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson. So, one of the things we are going to do is a rap on the book. Here it is:</p>
<p>There once was a guy named Jesse (Jesse) And then he met a girl named Leslie (Leslie) Then Leslie had a big idea ('dea) But then Jess had to go so he's like See Ya (See Ya!) Then at school they were being all bullied (bullied) And Jess kept getting all drooly (drooly) Over his teacher cuz he thought she was all cooly (cooly) So when they got home, Leslie had a plan They decided to make a new land So, that's why they created Terabithia, A place where no one else could be (so a few months later, his teacher took him to the museum of art, where he felt some love through his tiny heart) So when Jesse came back Everyone cried, Cuz they told him Leslie Burke had died, (Boo Hoo)</p>
<p>This was the rap. We hope it goes well and we hoped you liked it! See Ya!</p>
<p>Note: above is from <a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.108.244.155.html" title="User talk:207.108.244.155">User talk:207.108.244.155</a>. I didn't want to delete it outright 'cause it's clever. Cheers! Wassupwestcoast 20:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bridge to Teribithia is a great book/story. I think that this story is very heart touching and amusing. When I watched it at the movei theater, I started crying. It is a very sad, but amazing story.</p>
