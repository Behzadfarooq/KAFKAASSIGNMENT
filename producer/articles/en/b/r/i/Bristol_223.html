<p>The <b>Bristol Type 223</b> was a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> supersonic transport project.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company_bac9.html" title="Bristol Aeroplane Company">Bristol Aeroplane Company</a> studied a number of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersonic_transport.html" title="Supersonic transport">supersonic transport</a> models as part of a large <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> inter-company effort funded by the government. These models eventually culminated in the <b>Type 223</b>, a transatlantic transport for about 100 passengers at a speed around <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach_number.html" title="Mach number">Mach 2</a>. At about the same time <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sud_Aviation_c738.html" title="Sud Aviation">Sud Aviation</a> in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> was developing the similar <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle_ac6c.html" title="Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle">Super-Caravelle</a> design, so in November <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> the efforts were merged to create the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concorde.html" title="Concorde">Concorde</a> project.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_223.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> the British lead in aircraft design was continually eroded by a series of technical and commercial disasters. The technically daunting <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Brabazon_846a.html" title="Bristol Brabazon">Bristol Brabazon</a> met all of its demanding performance requirements, but proved to be a commercial failure when customers felt the transatlantic market wasn't big enough to justify such a large and expensive aircraft. Meanwhile the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Comet_b1bf.html" title="De Havilland Comet">de Havilland Comet</a> suffered a series of mysterious and deadly accidents which cast a pall over the market for <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_airliner.html" title="Jet airliner">jet airliners</a>, another area where the British technological lead might have proved decisive. In fact the fatigue failures exposed in the Comet led to prolonged testing of other promising designs like the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Britannia_2af2.html" title="Bristol Britannia">Bristol Britannia</a>, which were so delayed that their production was eclipsed by US designs when they finally reached service. The leading US contender, the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a> series, gained much from the KC-135 Stratotanker project.</p>
<p>Throughout this period the industry had been producing a series of advanced test aircraft however, and had extensively studied the problems of sustained high-speed flight. By the mid 1950s two designs had been shown to have a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lift-to-drag_ratio.html" title="Lift-to-drag ratio">lift-to-drag ratio</a> suitable for supersonic cruise, a sharply swept "M-wing" pioneered at <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armstrong-Whitworth_5f2b.html" title="Armstrong-Whitworth">Armstrong-Whitworth</a> for slightly-supersonic flight, and very slender delta wings suitable for a wide range of speeds. Higher speeds up to Mach 3 had been considered and found to be possible, but it appeared that a practical upper limit was Mach 2.2, above this speed the <a href="../../../d/u/r/Duralumin.html" title="Duralumin">duralumin</a> used for most aircraft construction would start to go soft due to the heat of friction, and some new material would have to be used instead.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_223.html" title="Edit section: STAC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">STAC</span></h2>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> there was enough official interest in this research for the <b>Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee</b>, or <b>STAC</b>, to be formed under Sir <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morien_Morgan_bf8c.html" title="Morien Morgan">Morien Morgan</a> to investigate the creation of a supersonic transport. Through the late 1950s, Bristol, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_13b4.html" title="Handley Page">Handley Page</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Siddeley_4697.html" title="Hawker Siddeley">Hawker Siddeley</a> all conducted a series of studies into various <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_wing.html" title="Delta wing">delta wing</a> designs under STAC.</p>
<p>At Bristol, Archibald Russell studied a number of variations under the generic <b>Type 198</b> label. Using <a href="../../../r/a/e/RAE_7d19.html" title="RAE">RAE</a> wind tunnel data he concluded that a Mach 2 transatlantic machine was the only one worth building; at shorter ranges the added cost and complexity of supersonic flight would not reduce the flight times enough to be worthwhile. By <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> the Type 198 had evolved into an eight-engined shoulder-wing delta of around 150 seats and a Mach 2 speed. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> they received an additional <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">£</a>350,000 study contract to continue work on the design, and by the end of the year the 198 had evolved into a 136-seat aircraft cruising at Mach 1.8.</p>
<p>At the same time Russell started a parallel study on a similar sized but higher speed design built of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stainless_steel.html" title="Stainless steel">stainless steel</a> as <b>Type 213</b>. However this proved uneconomical when their own <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_188.html" title="Bristol 188">Bristol 188</a> design started into production that year. Although much of the problem can likely be traced to the novelty of the 188's steel construction, it cost many times more than conventional designs, and appeared to be impractical. From then on Russell was interested only in designs of Mach 2.2 or less, the upper limit for <a href="../../../a/l/u/Aluminium.html" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>.</p>
<p>In March <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> STAC recommended that the UK should build two supersonic designs, a long range 150 seat aircraft to cruise at Mach 2 for the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> route, and a shorter range aircraft to cruise at Mach 1.2 for use in Europe. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, many British aerospace companies merged to form the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Aircraft_Corporation_403b.html" title="British Aircraft Corporation">British Aircraft Corporation</a>, or BAC. Hawker Siddeley had also been working on the transatlantic version of the STAC designs, but the Bristol design was considered clearly superior.</p>
<p>However Russell soon started having second thoughts about the 150-seat sized version, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> started parallel work on a smaller design known as <b>Type 223</b>, of about 110-seats and with four engines, but otherwise similar to the low-wing version of the Type 198.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, Sud Aviation revealed their plans for the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sud_Aviation_Super-Caravelle_ac6c.html" title="Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle">Super-Caravelle</a> at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Air_Show_fdff.html" title="Paris Air Show">Paris Air Show</a>. By this point STAC was looking at producing the Type 223, but the cost was going to be enormous. Throughout 1962 the two companies and their respective governments talked about forming a consortium to share development and production costs on similar parts. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">November 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> an agreement was signed, and the Concorde project started. Originally two versions of the same basic design were going to be offered, a larger transatlantic version with a size about that of the Type 223, and a smaller short/medium range version similar to the Super Caravelle. However as the group started talking to prospective customers, it soon became clear that the smaller version was not commercially interesting, and it was eventually dropped.</p>
