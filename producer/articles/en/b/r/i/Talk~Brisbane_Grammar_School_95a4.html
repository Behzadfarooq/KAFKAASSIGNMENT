<dd>Kiran, I agree that having the notable old boys section is fine, but it isn't sourced properly. We really do need to try to find sources for including many of these people. Currently only a couple of people have references. Do you know if the school has a list of notable old boys that we could use as a reference?</dd>
<dd>Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brisbane_Grammar_School&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104305000" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brisbane_Grammar_School&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104305000" rel="nofollow">in this edit</a> you and Paaerduag dispute stating "a large number of former students" or "approximately 65 former students". Saying "a large number" is <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel wording</a> and should be avoided. We need to be specific and saying "a large number" is confusing and open to interpretation...what you may think is a large number might be a small number to me. But I would like to know the source for "approximately 65". Paaerduag seems to say in the edit summary that the number is in the source cited <a href="http://www.australianpolitics.com/states/qld/2003/03-04-30_anglican-report.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.australianpolitics.com/states/qld/2003/03-04-30_anglican-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but I searched through the report and couldn't find it. Does anyone know where that figure comes from? If it comes from the Anglican report, can you please let me know which page it's on so I can check it out. Thanks, <b>Sarah</b> 07:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>so you cant source the old boy's to other wikipedia pages? cause if you click on them, their pages all state that they attended the school, and if they didnt, i've provided external links to the information. ang about the 65 students, i changed it to 'a number of students' because paaerduag's sources contradicted themselves. one of the pages said 65, another said 34. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKiran90_78a6.html" title="User:Kiran90">Kiran90</a> 10:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, unfortunately we can't use Wikipedia as a source for itself. I don't think it's urgent or anything, but we will have to try to find sources down the track.<b>Sarah</b> 15:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>perhaps, but saying 'a number' is deliberately ambiguous. The only fair compromise is to say, like before, 'between 34 and 65 students'. hadn't we already reached that concensus?--<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 10:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Paaerduag, where are you getting "between 34 and 65" from? It sounds like you're just guessing! We can't compromise on facts. If 65 (and 34 to 65) is just a guestimate, we are going to have to rewrite that section. I don't like "a number" because it's weasel wording, but it's better than guessing and I think that edit is the one that should stand at the moment. Unless you have a source for the numbers? <b>Sarah</b> 15:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in deleting the heading, you said 'refer to talk page' but there is absolutely zilch on the talk page. Please actually say why you are making major changes like that BEFORE you make them. I reverted because of your purposefully coup d'etat on the edit page. Blitzing the edit summaries with "refer to talk page"s is absolutely ruinous considering there is nothing ON the talk page. your little d'etat has not worked, because someone (myself) has seen through the thinly veiled attempt at a justification. Yep, I used the word, and I'll keep using it, because it is exactly what you AIN'T doing! --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 07:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you're saying that you reverted Kiran's edit purely to make a point? Just like you reverted my edit last night purely to make a point? As in a violation of <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia%7EDo_not_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_f384.html" title="Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>. This business of yours where you revert edits, make edits and use edit summaries to make "undeleteable" insults, is disruptive and you need to knock it off. You should only be editing to improve the article. Please stop <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming bad faith of everyone</a>. I've had enough of all this disruptive behaviour and I'm going to start using blocks if that's the only way to go through to people. And, Paaerduag, I'm going to revert your bad faith edit. <b>Sarah</b> 08:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh please, one thing I wont accept is editors (even administrators) putting words in my mouth. I find it degrading. It WAS NOT a bad faith nomination! I pointed out a flaw in what Kiran90 had done, but my reversion has been explained countless times before. I believe the section heading is important due to its pertainance to a major media attention on the school, rather than the school's own achievements. I've explained all this before. School <b>HIS</b><i>tory</i> is about the school's achievements and milestones, whereas sexual abuse is outlining a major media attention, and NO <b>MAJOR</b> media attention is in school history section. It was quite a big scandal, I was in brisbane at the time. This is the reason why I believe the headings are fine as they are (may I remind you all this ground is already treaded; just look into archives). In conclusion, it was NOT bad faith. It was in fact YOU who assumed bad faith on my behalf. --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 10:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't put words in your mouth. You said them yourself: "I reverted because of your purposefully coup d'etat on the edit page." That's an easy POINT violation. The sexual abuse incident is part of the school's history. As for you being in Brisbane at the time, so what? And so what if you consider the "ground is already treaded"? On Wikipedia, it is common for issues to be readdressed. You have serious <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">ownership</a> problem with this article and I'm not going to let this continue. <b>Sarah</b> 12:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>what do you mean 'at the time'. this implies you're not in brisbane anymore, which you have told me otherwise regarding... <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKiran90_78a6.html" title="User:Kiran90">Kiran90</a> 12:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>oo, i like this ownership policy thing. oh, and by the way. i didnt delete the heading, i reverted it back to they way it was before <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">user:paaerduag</a> reverted the change without justification. i posted the issue on the talk page, and af5ter 5 days no-one has commented, so i assumed it was save to revert it. that is within guidelines, is it not sarah? <a href="../../../5/8/2E/User%7E58.162.106.140.html" title="User:58.162.106.140">58.162.106.140</a> 07:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC) - oh my bad, this is Kiran90</p>
<p>may I ask who the hell the user above IS??? also, sarah, YOU have the ownership problems. I justified having the headings, and the best you can come up with is that I am an obsessed editor who can only have his own way. Why not address the ISSUE instead of sledging me?

<p>The below source validates two key claims that Sarah Ewart and <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKiran90_78a6.html" title="User:Kiran90">Kiran90</a> have both repeatedly deleted from the Sexual Abuse Section.</p>
<p>This is the link: <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20700679-3102,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20700679-3102,00.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> A 'Courier Mail' Article</p>
<p>The article validates the following:</p>
<p>1. That a former principal, Maxwell Howell, was allegedly told about the abuse on TWO occasions, but both times he failed to act, and therefore (in the wording of the article) 'igonored' the claims</p>
<p>2. The number of former students who came forward with the claims of sexual abuse was 'around 70'</p>

<dd>Paaerduag, you need to cut the attitude you have towards people who are trying to write within site policies. I don't know how many times you have to be told this, but removing unsourced material is <b>entirely supported by policy.</b> This is an encyclopedia, everything has to be verifiable.</dd>
<dd>I'm very pleased that you've found a source. However, it highlights why the verifiability policy is a cornerstone policy on Wikipedia. Your previous edits regarding this material were guestimates presented as fact. A source for "Around 70" is completely different to you giving specific unsourced figures of, at one time, 65 and, at another time, 35-65. This illustrates exactly why we need to be careful about getting information sourced before putting it in the article. I hope you understand that now and won't be so difficult in future when people want to verify information. <b>Sarah</b> 09:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've got to be joking. What is the purpose of reverting simple stylistic changes? You are so argumentative and possessive of this article. It is bad writing to have numerous sentences in a small amount of text starting exactly the same, for example "In X year".

<p>um... neither of those sources indicate that their claims were 'ignored'. it says that the headmaster had been informed of the claims. it says nothing further. if you can find a source that clearly shows that they were ignored, the comment can stay. there is no evidence to show that the issue was just not pursued, or there was evidence that the students could have been lying. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKiran90_78a6.html" title="User:Kiran90">Kiran90</a> 05:53, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kiran, it's easy to miss because it's only in the image caption and the intro which says, "BRISBANE Grammar School had to pay out more than $1 million from its own coffers after <b>allegedly ignoring warnings</b> about a pedophile counsellor." It's not the strongest of references since it's just a bit of editorialising by David Murray, the journalist, and isn't sourced to anyone, but it is there. <b>Sarah</b> 04:49, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>well, this particular article is in the journalistic form of 'opinionative piece', that is, the jouralist is presenting his opinion. can we really reference that? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKiran90_78a6.html" title="User:Kiran90">Kiran90</a> 05:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The introduction is opinion, but the actual article is a news report, rather than an editorial piece. It's not the best source and I think it would be better to find one that sources the "allegedly ignored" claim to someone other than the opinion of the journalist, but it will probably do for now.</dd>
<dd>I removed "under the guise of 'relaxation therapy'" because I couldn't find that claim in the cited source (<a href="http://www.personalinjurylawyers.com.au/case.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.personalinjurylawyers.com.au/case.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). It needs to be sourced accurately before it goes back in. I also removed the second mention of "allegedly ignored". I don't think it warrants being mentioned twice in three sentences. And for clarity, I removed the bolded "two" in "Two former students claimed to have lodged <b>two</b> complaints to the then headmaster Maxwell Howell". The way that sentence was written implies that two students made two complaints each and I don't think that is supported by the source. <b>Sarah</b> 06:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The positioning of this information gives it far too much weight and effectively turns the article into an attack piece, which is unacceptable. This is one nasty but basically small incident in the whole history of the school and should be treated as such. Wikipedia is not a newspaper and must balance contemporary matters within the whole history. I have therefore moved it to a more appropriate position at the end of the article.

<p>I'll give my full support to that above comment and the edits proposed / made. All the other GPS schools have had this sort of thing happen, and those with these sort of sections seem to have them at the end. Then again, most of those sections are deleted frequently. I feel that great progress on this article has been made since the early days when it was a big in-joke for those connected at the school and hope that the dispute that had brought progress to a grinding halt over the last few months has now been settled. I hope also that we can move forward together on improving the article while at the same time always bowing to the will of the majority, and that the forces of objectivity will prevail over emotion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheheadhunter_d4c6.html" title="User:Theheadhunter">Theheadhunter</a> 12:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that the former version of the sexual abuse section in no way overemphasizes negative aspects of the school and/or present biased information. I edited the old version to remove many claims, but now it has been severely hacked at. I want to restore the old version because I believe that it complies with all the 'demands' of the above 5... no 4 editors.

<p>I would just like to say that I do not believe that the old section, upon which a general consensus had been reached, is in any way detrimental to the school's reputation (if such a thing should even be considered on a site such as wikipedia. May I remind editors that wikipedia <i>is not an advertisement</i>.) alas, I know that several editors on here are passionate about the school, and I suppose that I have racked up quite a 'reputation', but I urge editors not to delete my changes JUST BECAUSE I'M ME. I am adding positively to an ENCYCLOPEDIA article. I believe the old section was good, and I don't see how it infringes on the rights for the school to receive a good reputation on this site. If there are reasons, I would appreciate if the editors on here vocally opposed to me would tell me why. The entire article has a positive bias to the school, but this section seems to be absolutely neutral. No weazel words, peacock words as far as I can see, and I ask for anyone who sees some to note them on here for revision by a consensus. I am not out to destroy anybody's reputation, but I assume there are people on here out to further damage mine. I am only interested in this article's well being and I have outlined why I returend the old version. I am not striking out in vengeance. I am not violently opposing any and everyone. I am doing what every editor on wikipedia should be able to do: change the article, justify the change on the talk page, and be equally and fairly treated without discrimination. --<a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> 07:32, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>the old version had a consensus reached about it because it had been agreed that the edited section did not give undue weight to the entire page. i know it must be difficult for your opinions to be shunted, but it happens frequently on wikipedia. 2 administrators and 3 users have all agreed on the section, and it isnt really fair to them if the page was reverted because of one users opinion. it certainly wouldnt be ok if the disputing user was on the other side. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKiran90_78a6.html" title="User:Kiran90">Kiran90</a> 08:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
