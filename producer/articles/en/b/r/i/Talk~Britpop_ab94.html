<p>There are some mistakes in this article that i'm not too sure about. Shoegazing was <i>Influenced by</i> jesus and mary chain and my bloody valentine, weren't both of these bands part of this movement, i know for a fact that MBV formed in the late 80's. And the cultural origin, 1993? Pulp have been around since the 70's.</p>

<p>What is a British invasion?, as in 'The movement is regarded as a direct continuation of the British Invasions in the 60s and 80s'. And why is an article on BRITpop seemingly written with an american perspective? It should be written with no perspective, just give the facts etc, or at the very least write with a british perspective.</p>
<p>The british invasion was pretty much the beatles. It's a common term, it means the success of british bands in America.</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/a/i/User%7EPainbearer_a558.html" title="User:Painbearer">Painbearer</a> has redone the article without the copyvio. I'm still somewhat askance at his decision to completely delete the consensus article created between 2002 and 2004 with a completely new article written solely by himself. I feel wikipedia works best when there is a synthesis of contributions combined into one article rather than a single source. I'm also not certain if the Oasis vs Blur material is NPOV. I invite others to scrutinize his work vs the November 2004 incarnation by <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJumbuck_a815.html" title="User:Jumbuck">Jumbuck</a> and make their own comments. <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">Djbrianuk</a> 12:20, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've decided to be bold and take a large axe to this article, which IMHO contained far too much information of peripheral importance. A lot of it is far more appropiate to individual band pages rather than here. I've also tried to tighten the article up considerably, remove a lot of excessively wordy phrasing, and NPOV it as much as possible. Considering this article is one of <a href="../../../p/a/i/User%7EPainbearer_a558.html" title="User:Painbearer">Painbearer</a>'s pet projects I'm anticipating flak, but it needed to be done <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">Djbrianuk</a> 01:59, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe it had to be done - it's people's right to have an opinion. Yet I think that my article couldn't be cut so harshly with the axe being so big. In my opinion this edit is rather radical and inconvinient, with the article more or less unsuitable at places. To clarify the things about the incompabiltiy, it's very visible where the article was cut in pieces and that there were things that didn't match a lot and give this sense of incompability. With more complicated, respectfully and carefully editing, it could be turned to the best, but in my opinion the Britpop section turns to be mediocre. But if any of you guys can propose something better than this - I'd gladly hear it... You'd better do it, because I will leave this project at once...--<a href="../../../p/a/i/User%7EPainbearer_a558.html" title="User:Painbearer">Painbearer</a> 15:06, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's better this way, but I still think it could be better. Considering it's still my revisited article, I'll still consider it as my project.

<p>I really don't think there's any need for the Second Wave stuff - a lot of these bands have nothing to do with Britpop, it's like calling Blur a Second Wave English punk band. I think the article gets by just having the death of Britpop bit. I'd add a bit about the NME 'Noel's burning guitar' issue, just because it was funny that the NME decided it didn't want to have any readers any more, so stopped record executives pouring money into rubbish Britpop bands by declaring it dead.</p>

<dd>Yes that stuff about the second wave of Britpop is cobblers. Travis and Coldplay and the like are not part of the same movement at all, not even the same sound. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 12:03, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are still a lot of problems with this page, especially to do with the writing style (sometimes almost semi-literate) and several factual mistakes (Belle and Sebastian in 1995?). I also personally think that we should limit the frame to 1997 or so. maybe there could be a second article about the "second wave" thing - shame the IPC sub-editors decided not to invent a name for them. --<a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESachabrunel_ca4d.html" title="User:Sachabrunel">Sachabrunel</a> 14:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The influences section needs to be rewritten, as it currently reads like a brief summary of the history of rock music. We should indicate exactly what Britpop bands drew form these influences and why they matter.</p>
<p>And someone please explain to me how progressive rock was a major influence on Britpop. WesleyDodds 11:29, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The whole thing needs to be completely rewritten, I'd say 10 - 20 percent is salvagable. I think we need to get the definition of 'britpop' cleared up once and for all. That utterly ludicrous list of the '100 greatest britpop bands' linked includes The Lighthouse Family, Suggs and David Gray. Also there is a section called 'Death of the Britpop'. What language is that supposed to be exactly? I'm going to take a day out and work on this next week, suggestions welcome. --<a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESachabrunel_ca4d.html" title="User:Sachabrunel">Sachabrunel</a> 15:39, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surely the term 'Britpop' has been around longer than 1987- we used to call The Smiths, Cure, New Order et al Britpop back in the early-mid eighties. The genesis of the word- 'British' and 'Popular' suggests a much broader definition. I'd include the bands listed as influences into the category- were they not British, were they not Popular? If you wish, sub-divide the category into Shoegaze, Madchester, Glam, etc. Here is an admittedly incomplete but I believe instructive list of classic Britpop hits (sort of chronological):</p>

<p>Not neccessarily the best song from each band or the most represtantive either, but a good list nonetheless. Feel Free to add. Less about beats, harmonies, lyrics or insturmentation, Britpop should be defined by its attitude: Bombastic, defiant, and ultimately hopeful.</p>

<dd><b>Re above</b> Pretty poor, Britpop most certainly does not include anything in the 80's. And in any case your list omits Oasis - just shows you how much about britpop! What utter twaddle. PS - The Kasier chiefs - Britpop (dear oh dear)----Chris Phillips</dd>

<dd><b>Re above</b>- We can't have an encyclopedia article about a vague idea. Britpop does not equal British pop, it is a term applicable to a limited number of bands in 1994-1997 only. A scene in Camden around the Good Mixer (yes, even Oasis went there), a magazine, Select, and less a style of music than a style of dress. Unfortunately because the term itself is so vague people think they can apply it as wide as they like. Perhaps we can divide this into two and have a disambiguation page. Of the bands above, Elastica, Blur and Pulp were part of the britpop movement. Radiohead weren't really. The rest weren't at all. Ditto most of the bands mentioned in the article. --<a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESachabrunel_ca4d.html" title="User:Sachabrunel">Sachabrunel</a> 19:37, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, this article is about an indie/alternative movement in the 90's. Sure the term Britpop had been around for a while and used as a simple adjective (like New Wave) but it wasn't until 1995 or so that it was applied to a set of bands to describe a genre/movement. Pretty much all the early artists listed are influences who can be filed under "British guitar pop" which describes an awful lot of bands in the hsitory of music. Bands like the Stone Roses and the La's are more the direct progenators of the genre we call Britpop. WesleyDodds 23:49, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>How about this?</b> We need to seperate this out, much of the information should be in a general history of British guitar music / indie music which should have its own page. This could be explained at the top, perhaps with a disambigation page. Something like "Britpop is a term often applied to a movement in British indie music in the mid 1990s, though it has also been used since as a catch-all term for British guitar music in general." A bit wordy, but you get the idea. --<a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESachabrunel_ca4d.html" title="User:Sachabrunel">Sachabrunel</a> 19:18, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm listing here a few of the more major problems with the article for comments, please explain why any of these things should be here if you want them to stay.</p>
<p><br />
Very POV:</p>
<p>"big, catchy hooks"</p>
<p>"lack of innovation and highly derivative nature"</p>
<p>"live performances tended to be exercises in endurance"</p>
<p>"mainly derivative bands"</p>
<p>"unfairly been associated with the Seattle scene by a lazy media"</p>
<p>"the much-lamented Menswear"</p>
<p>"overproduced and bloated "acid" sound, characterised with endless guitar riffs and lack of originality in making the songs"</p>
<p>"more sophisticated acts like Radiohead and The Verve"</p>
<p>"none managed to show the brilliance that they displayed during their first three albums"</p>
<p><br />
Exaggeration / hyperbole:</p>
<p>"incredibly popular"</p>
<p>"In the wake of these revolutions"</p>
<p>"The movement also exercised a brief period of cultural hegemony"</p>
<p>"Suede's poppy <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> album <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_Up_5e94.html" title="Coming Up">Coming Up</a></i> was a needed tonic"</p>
<p><br />
Broken / garbled / bizarre English:</p>
<p>"Oasis are cited as a transcendental band of Madchester, as the initial line-up were all from Manchester."</p>
<p>"This and the sophomore great albums kickstarted the movement and in the following three years (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> – <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>) other Britpop and similar style acts just poured"</p>
<p>"While this battle raged on Pulp took the spots with the magnificent single"</p>
<p>"The battle was also on a "representative" points as Blur praised Mod bands like Small Faces and the Kinks, while Oasis - obvious Rocker trends"</p>
<p>"because of it massive popularity at the time and because acts represented particular musical influence or movement in their music"</p>
<p>"they granted the movement the chance for rolling for some more"</p>
<p>"Ironically a couple of years after Coxon left, he realigned with Street to record his most successful solo records" (How is this ironic?)</p>
<p><br />
Seemingly endless lists of bands for no good reason:</p>
<p>"Also quite influential were <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glam_rock.html" title="Glam rock">glam</a> idols such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a> <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._Rex_%28band%29_38db.html" title="T.

<p><br />
Outright fantasies:</p>
<p>"Weller in particular is praised as the founder and initiator of the movement" (by who?)</p>
<p>"(In Britain and Ireland it became popular for a time when asked "What's the story?" (lit. "How are you?"), to answer with "Morning glory".)" (I lived there, it didn't)</p>
<p>"their regular alcohol, cocaine and crack usage" (Heroin was on the scene, not crack at all)</p>
<p>"the public was buying almost everything that was released" (Erm...)</p>
<p><br />
Inclusion of unrelated bands:</p>
<p>"There were also Irish acts such as - <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cranberries_e8aa.html" title="The Cranberries">the Cranberries</a>"</p>
<p><br />
The problem here is where to start. I'd like to scrap the whole thing and start again to be honest, and not just because of the problems above. The flow of the article is bizarre - it goes backwards and forwards constantly. A lot of the language just doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article. Maybe some hack job in a bad fanzine. There is too much information that should be on other pages, for example that long paragraph about Pete Doherty and the overdetailed information about Oasis. I could go on.</p>

<p>It's quite late and I'm gonna be brief. I think that truly this article needs a lot of editing. But, I don't know if I am the right person to do this. Anyway, I think that Brett Anderson had an addiction to the crack, but I might be wrong. But, I think that the article truly deserves significant editing. Otherwise, I can provide help, but I do not think that I am capable enough of rewriting the article by my own, although most of it information is done solely by me. On the other look, the work here is something very valuable to me as a person and probably I will stay around to do more work. In fact, I am willing to rewrite big portions of it and probably I will scrap some of it. <a href="../../../p/a/i/User%7EPainbearer_a558.html" title="User:Painbearer">Painbearer</a> 00:45, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In particular there's a lot of hyperbole towards the end about Oasis. OK, they were a significant act but there's no need to try and justify their recent career.</p>
<p>In particular it's annoying when people try and attribute their own music tastes to 'influences', such as early 80s. This has been a problem on other music entries as well, when people have generalised or gone off on tangents.</p>

<p>Surely this is a bit over the top:</p>
<p>"Paul Weller in particular is praised as an initiator of the movement. His solo records Paul Weller (1991) and Wild Wood (1993) are considered seminal forces for the movement."</p>
<p>Whilst there's no doubt about Weller's influence on Britpop, and his assciation with it as it developed (particularly Oasis), it doesn't seem clear to me that it deserves singling out over, say, Ray Davies or Morrissey or the Beatles. I also don't think his debut solo album influenced anyone at all (I do like Paul Weller, but that's not actually a very good example of his work), and the influence of Wild Wood over Britpop certainly needs standing up - it doesn't sound much like a Britpop record.</p>

<p>I've cleaned up some grammatical errors etc. I've also reworked the para regarding influences, as some of it was rather self-contradictory - a good example is citing shoegazer music as both an influence and an 'anti'-influence. I'd argue it was the latter. Very few genuine Britpop bands were shoegazer-influenced, even if some of their contemporaries were, generally those who got lumped in with the Britpop scene by virtue of being British bands active during the mid-1990s. <a href="../../../t/p/t/User%7ETpth_9458.html" title="User:Tpth">Tpth</a> 06:06, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a bit of a dog's breakfast. I don't really know that it adds a lot of information that isn't already included in the article - does it really need to be here?</p>
<p>If it is to stay, it needs fixing. It's factually incorrect in several places - Pulp are almost certainly defunct, so don't really fit into the category of a 'likely continuation' and Blur have been inactive since 2004. Also, including The Tears as a pseudo-continuation of Suede is a bit misleading - notwithstanding that they contain Bernard Butler and Brett Anderson, they're a band in their own right, and in any case I wouldn't include them here. They formed well after Britpop's heyday and are thus no more Britpop than any of the other Britpop-influenced bands who've come to prominence in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Finally, having Radiohead and Supergrass go right through while Oasis and The Tears taper off into grey in 2005 is a bit misleading, given that all these bands are still active.</p>

<dd><i>The British media went so far as the brand the movement the "Third British Invasion"...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Really? I'm not very knowledgeable about this so will bow to others' greater knowledge, but it seems an odd thing for them to say. The phrase "British Invasion" isn't all <i>that</i> common in the UK anyway, and (though the passage of time will have affected this) a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Third+British+Invasion%22+site%3Auk&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Third+British+Invasion%22+site%3Auk&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> for the phrase on .uk sites only produces a grand total of <i>two</i> hits. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 02:59, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The opening section says: "The movement developed as <b>a reaction against</b> various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Acid house and the rise of hip hop had led to a renewed interest in groove and rhythm-led songs in British indie music, leading to <b>the Madchester sound.</b>"</p>
<p>The <i>Style, roots and influences</i> section says: "The Madchester scene was another large influence."</p>
<p>Huh?!</p>

<dd>I'm working on greatly revising the article. I plan to rewrite the lead section. But Madchester was an influence, not the least because the Stone Roses were the main reason Liam Gallagher decided to form the band that would become Oasis. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 20:24, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. The influence of the post-punk/new wave era seems a little understated, especially considering a lot of the Britpop bands were also labelled "New Wave of New Wave". <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_%28band%29.html" title="Wire (band)">Wire</a> were a key influence on Blur, Elastica, Menswear, etc, even to the point, I believe, where Elastica had to credit the Wire members with writing credits for "Line Up". The article currently doesn't mention them at all.</p>
<p>2. I'm not sure about the sentence "Blair represented the new face of the dreams and wishes of the British counterculture" at all.</p>
<p>3. I'm not sure that Belle &amp; Sebastian were ever regarded as a Britpop group.</p>
<p>4. How was Father Ted (a very Irish sitcom) part of the televisual arm of britpop? The theme tune was an atypical instrumental by The Divine Comedy, who weren't really a Britpop band. I can't see any other link.</p>
<p>5. Cornershop are mentioned in the 'Decline' section - I would not have classed them as Britpop.</p>
<p>6. Regarding the timeline, Pulp started way before 1989, though maybe that would be taking the timeline back too far.</p>
<p>7. There's no mention of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene.html" title="Gene">Gene</a> in the article.</p>
<p>Hope this helps - let me know if I can provide any more details.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichig_ca92.html" title="User:Michig">Michig</a> 22:29, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>8. "Many bands that would later be grouped under the Britpop umbrella, such as Primal Scream, originally started off as C86 bands." - were Primal Scream really considered Britpop? They were doing Stones pastiches and dance rock in that era. And while they were on the C86 compilation, they started in the early 80's so can't really be said to have started as a C86 band. I can't think of any other 'C86' bands that came to be labelled Britpop.</p>
<p>9. Key influences: obvious general influences are Wire, Magazine, The Smiths. Clear influences on particular bands are The Beatles (Oasis and Oasis only), The Kinks/Ray Davies (Blur), Bowie (Suede), The Smiths (Gene, Echobelly, Shed 7), Wire (Blur, Elastica, Menswear), The Stranglers (Elastica). Glam was a major influence for Suede and Gene (particularly the guitar-work). I'm not sure of a direct influence from The Buzzcocks, James, The Sex Pistols.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichig_ca92.html" title="User:Michig">Michig</a> 08:31, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>10. From the opening paragraph: "In the wake of the grunge invasion led by bands like Nirvana, many bands incorporated a patriotic rhetoric into their music, writing about uniquely British topics and concerns." - the bit about writing about uniquely British topics and concerns is correct, but the reference to "patriotic rhetoric" is in my view incorrect.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichig_ca92.html" title="User:Michig">Michig</a> 09:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose what I intended to write got mangled in the process, but there often was a patriotic element to Britpop, particularly with most everything that came out of Damon Albarn's mouth during 1993-1994.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oasis and Ash draw influence from the Pistols and Buzzcocks, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most everything else I've tried to address, although I've found I'm mainly interested in fixing everything up to the "Britpop and Cool Britannia" section. I've started some work on it, but right now that's the section most in need of an overhaul. Hopefully when I get my "NME Originals: Britpop" mag in the mail I can contribute more to that section. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 12:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think more Menswear are the Britpop band who mirror the scene best, they were the ones being hyped most in the music press under the Britpop banner and whose career tailed off quickest afterwards. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 12:22, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just removed the line "Suede never regained critical favour after guitarist <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Butler_a0b4.html" title="Bernard Butler">Bernard Butler</a> left in 1994 and gradually diminished to a cult act.". Firstly, the period from 1996-97 was Suede's peak in terms of record sales with 5 top 10 singles from <i>Coming Up</i> alone (which was also well regarded by a lot of critics). They also had a number 1 album and 4 top-30 singles in 1999 - hardly what could be described as "diminishing into a cult act". The decline in sales only really kicked in after <i>Head Music</i> - a good 5 years after Bernard Butler left the band.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichig_ca92.html" title="User:Michig">Michig</a> 18:09, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Over the peak britpop years (94/95-97) shouldn't we also include how part of the decline of Britpop as a media force would the rise of the Girl Band and Boy-ballard band.</p>
<p>The Spice Girl's, All Saints and Westlife etc started killing Britpop as the dominate force in the singles charts (though the albums still could sell well) and they emerged late '96 and '97. Part of the Brit pop history is pop acts were shut out of the charts for a couple of years, even former pop acts like Robbie Williams adopted a Britpop-lite sound to gain success.</p>
<p>I think some references to the rise of girl power in 1997 colliding with the decline in quality Britpop acts should be essential. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_90.240.204.141_8f41.html" title="Special:Contributions/90.240.204.141">90.240.204.141</a> (talk) 22:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>This a minor thing, but shouldn't Suede be listed together with Blur, Oasis and Pulp as the most prominent bands of Brit-Pop. They were one of the first and one of the most successful Brit-Pop-bands and outside the UK certainly more popular than say Pulp.. Allmusic.com's entry on Suede also opens with the line "Suede kick started the Britpop revolution of the '90s, bringing English indie pop/rock music away from the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions of Madchester, and reinstating such conventions of British pop as mystique and the three-minute single" (<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:xmez975jkr0t" class="external free" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:xmez975jkr0t" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:xmez975jkr0t</a>) Cic3r0 21:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sort of undermines the "holy trinity" idea, and they did drop out of the limelight quite early. But it's definatley open for debate. They are mentioned in the first paragraph as an important band. also, from a retrospective point of view, look whose stood the test of time: Oasis are still together and going strong, their music from the 90s being very popular, as is the music of Blur, and Pulp. Cocker and Albarn are still going strong. Brett Anderson brought out a record last year but no-one heared it, and I can't remeber the last time I heard a swuede song on the radio of music tv that wasn't Animal Nitrate. And even that's rare.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 15:07, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(cross-posted from Britrock talk page - <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britrock.html" title="Britrock">Britrock</a> currently redirects to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britpop.html" title="Britpop">Britpop</a>))</p>
<p>Have to disagree with this redirect - <b>Britrock</b> was never used as a synonym for <b>Britpop</b>, at least not in the UK. Britrock was, as I recall, a term used principally by <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerrang%21.html" title="Kerrang!">Kerrang!</a> magazine (a rock/metal publication) in the mid-late 1990s, possibly as an attempt to pull alongside the Britpop bandwagon, or else as a reaction against it. Britrock seemed to be used as an umbrella term for any British rock bands who happened to be around at the time - examples included <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Almighty_5476.html" title="The Almighty">The Almighty</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorvision.html" title="Terrorvision">Terrorvision</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin_%28band%29.html" title="Skin (band)">Skin</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wildhearts_f682.html" title="The Wildhearts">The Wildhearts</a>, <a href="../../../3/_/c/3_Colours_Red_30dc.html" title="3 Colours Red">3 Colours Red</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honeycrack.html" title="Honeycrack">Honeycrack</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/e/Feeder_%28band%29.html" title="Feeder (band)">Feeder</a> and Baby Chaos - but it should be noted that many of these bands had a more commercial sound than traditional metal bands (Iron Maiden et al), and several crossed over into the mainstream, with varying commercial success. Many promising 'Britrock' bands were dropped by impatient record labels and never achieved their potential. I don't yet have any sources to back this up but I'm working on it.

<dd>I think you're probably right. Clearly Britrock was related to Britpop, but it wasn't the same thing. Not sure if it deserves much more than a note in this article, though. -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 05:04, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
