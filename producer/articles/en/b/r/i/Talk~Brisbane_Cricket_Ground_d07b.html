<p><b>Brisbane Cricket Ground, which is sometimes referred to as The Gabba</b> Shouldn't that be the other way 'round? Does anyone really refer to it as the former? --<a href="../../../2A/p/a/User%7E_Paul__4426.html" title="User:*Paul*">Paul</a> 17:53, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The correct title of the ground is <b>Brisbane Cricket Ground</b>, which is still the <b>official</b> name of the ground. The nick-name for the ground as <b>The Gabba</b> only came about as a result of the cricket ground being in the suburb of <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolloongabba%2C_Queensland_d121.html" title="Woolloongabba, Queensland">Woolloongabba</a>.</p>
<p>This is an International encyclopedia, therefore the official name for the ground should remain as the name used for the article.</p>
<p>If you are so keen as to have the article renamed as <b>The Gabba</b>, then make sure that you change every single one of the more than 50 links to the article, from all of the articles which link to the article, at the same time as you 'move' the article to the new name. These link changes are required to be undertaken by a person who makes such a move of title. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 01:42, 30 October 2005 (UTC</p>
<p>I'm not "keen" at all, just making the observation. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html#Rationale" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia policy</a> would the suggest The Gabba being the preferred choice, though --<a href="../../../2A/p/a/User%7E_Paul__4426.html" title="User:*Paul*">Paul</a> 06:53, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it should be moved to the Gabba, but I don't have enough edits to do it myself. When I do, I'll move it and do all the links. I don't agree with Figaro's argument. The official name isn't any more commonly used elsewhere in the world, that I know of. When England tours Australia, the ground is always referred to as the Gabba. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_James_2d06.html" title="User:James James">James James</a> 09:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with changing. <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisden.html" title="Wisden">Wisden</a>'s www.cricinfo.com <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/ground/country.html?country=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/ground/country.html?country=2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> refers to it as the Brisbane Cricket Ground. It's wrong to say that it's _always_ called the Gabba - I heard it referred to the long name on ABC radio today. See also <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/cricket/scores/ckt_schedule_997.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.net.au/cricket/scores/ckt_schedule_997.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://queensland.rleague.com/origin/interstate-matchs.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://queensland.rleague.com/origin/interstate-matchs.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.cricket-online.com/series/fixture.php?id=55" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cricket-online.com/series/fixture.php?id=55" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The 'Gabba is a nickname. The common name and official name is Brisbane Cricket Ground. And note that of you are going to call it the Gabba, it should strictly be wtitten as "The 'Gabba" with a leading apostrophe as it's a shortening of Woolloongabba as stated above. -- <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a> ≡ <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanbrown_5157.html" title="User talk:Ianbrown">talk</a> 13:45, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The official name of the ground is the Brisbane Cricket Ground. This is actually on the signs above the ticket office if you have a look. There is no need to change the name of the article.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanmiles_0d9c.html" title="User:Danmiles">dan, dan and dan</a> 12:41, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">User:Jguk</a> has placed a link to the cricket portal at the top of this page. Despite the Gabba's official name, the BCG is a multi-purpose facility and it's beyond reasonable argument that its primary tenant is now the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">Australian Football League</a> club <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Lions_4cd4.html" title="Brisbane Lions">Brisbane Lions</a>. I've no objection to a link to the portal on this page but surely a <b>See also</b> link is a more appropriate way of notifying people of this portal? The link at the top is more of an advertising banner and is not really in the spirit of Wikipedia's objective of creating an encyclopaedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Brain_of_Morbius_d51f.html" title="User:The Brain of Morbius">The Brain of Morbius</a> 23:29, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Looking at the issue from your perspective, I can see that labelling all cricket grounds with the cricket portal link is a good idea. In the UK, cricket grounds are just that. When you think of Lords or the Oval you think of cricket – and fair enough. Equally it makes sense to put these links at the top of pages for individuals primarily associated with cricket. But venues like the Gabba or the MCG in Australia are much more than that and despite their official names they are not simply cricket grounds. Without Australian rules football played on them as a winter tenant they simply wouldn’t exist at any level other than as a patch of grass and a pavilion. Labelling them in the way you are immediately brands them as primarily cricket facilities to visitors unfamiliar with them, creating an entirely false impression.</p>
<p>It's a bit like putting <b>For more coverage of cricket, go to the Cricket portal.</b> at the top of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>'s page, just because he plays cricket. Does he like cricket? Yes. Is that his major claim to fame? No.</p>
<p>The other objection I have to this practise is that when applied to multi-purpose venues, what happens when an Australian Football League portal is created? Do we then put an AFL portal link at the top of these pages as well? The Gabba also hosts rugby, and Olympic soccer, and rugby league, and greyhound racing, and cycling – do we put links to their portals at the top when they’re created too?</p>
<p><b>For more coverage of cricket, go to the Cricket portal.</b></p>
<p><b>For more coverage of AFL, go to the AFL portal.</b></p>
<p><b>For more coverage of rugby union, go to the Rugby portal.</b></p>
<p><b>For more coverage of rugby league, go to the Rugby league portal.</b></p>
<p><b>For more coverage of Olympics, go to the Olympic portal.</b></p>
<p><b>For more coverage of greyhound racing, go to the Racing portal.</b></p>
<p><b>For more coverage of cycling, go to the Cycling portal.</b></p>
<p>It's ugly, unwieldy, and obviously the wrong way to go, but this is the way we're headed if the cricket portal link at the top stays... and the same applies for the MCG, the SCG, Adelaide Oval, Bellerive, Marrara, the WACA ground, Cazaly Stadium and pretty much every ground in which cricket is played in Australia.</p>
<p>The whole issue is problematic, but could so easily be solved by placing these links in a <b>See Also</b> section at the bottom of these pages. I like cricket and you're doing a fantastic job of creating the cricket portal. It's great to make people aware of the existence of the portal. This is the wrong way of doing it though.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Brain_of_Morbius_d51f.html" title="User:The Brain of Morbius">The Brain of Morbius</a> 00:09, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>mmmm Only the cricket portal exists of those you list as of date. However, I see it could get confusing or silly in the future. I don't object to the bit about the cricket portal was to lose its bolding and italics and go under a "see also" section - I'll make the change myself.

<dd>Thanks for that, that's much better. Yes, only the cricket portal currently exist but there's every likelihood that an AFL, rugby and rugby league one will be created in the future--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Brain_of_Morbius_d51f.html" title="User:The Brain of Morbius">The Brain of Morbius</a> 23:31, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm fairly sure a recent Twenty/20 international broke the ground record, not sure, though.</p>

<dd>The Twenty/20 match holds the record for the ground in its current configuration.
