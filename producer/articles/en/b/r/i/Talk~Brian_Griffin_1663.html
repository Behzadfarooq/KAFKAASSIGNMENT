<p>How old is Brian? A HHGTG fan told me 42, but didn't want to say if that was <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_year.html" title="Dog year">dog years</a>. In Earth years it would make him the same age as his best friend, and old enough to have met Andy Warhol and starred in one of his films (the Christobel episode). But it contradicts two episodes in which Brian has shrink appointments ("Brian in Love" and "Rhode to Road Island"). <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 17:55, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The funny thing is the article says he's 7 immediately after saying he was hangin' out with Andy Warhol in the 1970s.

Despite the uncanonical flashbacks about Brian's past, the age of seven is the most valid human age for him. In his template-box, there is no reason to mention his age "according to the myth" of dog years being seven-per-one human year, when the ratio is 10½ dog years per human year for the first two years, then four dog years per human year for each year after. Presenting Brian's mythical age is presenting incorrect information. According to this online <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/dogyears.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.onlineconversion.com/dogyears.htm" rel="nofollow">calculator</a>, Brian's age would be between 41–44 human years, given Brian's age being between 7.00–7.99 dog years. So, for the template-box and the rest of the article to mention his age as 49 dog years is adding to the fallacy of the "myth" about dog years, and it should be changed in this article so that it presents the most accurate information. —<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotorious4life_30dc.html" title="User:Notorious4life"><font color="#19 19 70"><i><b>№tǒŖïøŭş</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotorious4life_3a21.html" title="User talk:Notorious4life"><font color="#80 00 80"><i><b>4lĭfė</b></i></font></a> <font color="A5 2A 2A"><big><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Notorious4life_400a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Notorious4life">♫</a></big><font color="00 64 00"><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">♪</a></font></font></p>

<p>I have moved an excerpt from the 'background' section to the initial section. The information on Brian's likings for opera and drama are not part of his hisory, but rather part of his personality which the first section describes.</p>
<p>Brian revealed, after Chris asked him the last time he's been with a woman in the episode "You May Now kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Recieves", that it was two years before the Challenger exploded, making him well over 20 human years, meaning that he's at least 140 dogs years old.</p>

<p><i>Later on, Brian worked for Stewie's pyramid scheme company "Cashscam" as a telemarketer to make the $300 that would pay for his ringworm medicine ("Model Misbehavior")</i></p>
<p>Brian had internal parasites. Ringworm is a skin condition caused by fungus. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheusX303_4aad.html" title="User:PrometheusX303">PrometheusX303</a> 12:21, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An anonymous editor keeps trying to add Brian Griffin to the category fictional racists. From what I have seen and read, Brian is not racist. I will once again remove the category. If you wish to make a case as to why he should be labeled "racist", please do so here before you add it back. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrometheusX303_4aad.html" title="User:PrometheusX303">PrometheusX303</a> 13:20, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Brian seems aware of his own racism - his actions in Don't Make Me Over show that much. While in that episode, he seems to be trying to either deny or overcome his beliefs, he still refused to give Cleveland a ride on basis of skin color. Therefore, Brian would be qualified as racist, which is a joke at the expense of his intense liberal belief. Rebochan 20:33, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I admit that I haven't seen the newest episodes, but I never saw any indication of racism in the first seasons. He seemed fine around Cleveland and Loretta, the judge, and various other black and hispanic characters.<br />
He dated Shauna Parks, and although he went overboard to show her he was not racist, it could be attributed to his liking her and not wanting to offende her.<br />
His "refusal" to pick up Cleveland in his cab wasn't clearly based on race. Yes, they played on a stereotype, but they made it seem that Brian simply decided to get the milk while he was out. Maybe he has done this in later episodes too, though.<br />
His barking at Dr. Diddy is something he attributes to breeding, not personal beliefs. Being a dog, his excuse hold some merit.</dd>

<p>There is no way in hell that he is a racist. When he was a pup, his dad acted racist around him, and his subconcise (sorry about the spelling) thought that that's how he was suposed to act. When he grew-up, he learned not to do that, but it's still in his subconsice and it leaks out every once in a while. The same thing happens to Lois with her Pewterschmidt up-bringing. In "The Perfect Castaway", Lois says to the weeping Chris at Peter's funeral, "I know honey, I'm sad to, but come-down, you're making a scean, all our friends are here," (sounds like somthing her dad would say, huh) and in "Jungle Love", after Chris says "This is my wife Loca. We're mairred", Lois responds by saying, "Well, maybe here, but not in America where God pays atention." I belive the only differince is that Brian is 100% aware of his problem and is trying despretly to change it, while Lois has no clue of her little problem (although she has comsideritly more conroil over it). As Stewie would say, "Well, that was my arguement, where's your's."--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianGriffin-FG_280e.html" title="User:BrianGriffin-FG">BrianGriffin-FG</a> 20:13, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just as in the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewie_Griffin_46b0.html" title="Stewie Griffin">Stewie Griffin</a> article this article suggests that Stewie is conservative or a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> just because he supports a flat tax. As I have said in the other talk page, it takes more than supporting a flat tax rate to be considered conservative. Brian has continually shown his liberalism yet Stewie has only shown conservatism once. I don't think its significant enough to suggest any political leanings from Stewie and should be deleted.--<a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 17:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't we include, if not a full section, a mention of that new "Late Night with Brian &amp; Stewie" show that they're showing on MySpace? I would do it, but I haven't seen it.
