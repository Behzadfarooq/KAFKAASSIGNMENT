	    <p>The <b>British Transport Commission</b> (BTC) was created by <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_Attlee_cce2.html" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>'s post-war <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> government as a part of its <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalization.html" title="Nationalization">nationalisation</a> programme, to oversee railways, canals and road freight transport in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> (Northern Ireland had the separate <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Transport_Authority_6c30.html" title="Ulster Transport Authority">Ulster Transport Authority</a>). Its general duty under the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Act_1947_f650.html" title="Transport Act 1947">Transport Act 1947</a> was to provide "an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods", excluding transport by air.</p>
<p>The BTC came into operation on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>. Its first chairman was <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_Hurcomb_3330.html" title="Cyril Hurcomb">Lord Hurcomb</a>, with <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Beevor_0149.html" title="Miles Beevor">Miles Beevor</a> as Chief Secretary. Its main holdings were the networks and assets of the four big national regional railway companies: <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Western_Railway_acda.html" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_and_North_Eastern_Railway_7e84.html" title="London and North Eastern Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway_367a.html" title="London, Midland and Scottish Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a> and the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Railway_%28Great_Britain%29_3d36.html" title="Southern Railway (Great Britain)">Southern Railway</a>. It also took over 55 other railway undertakings, 19 canal undertakings and 246 road haulage firms, as well as the work of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Passenger_Transport_Board_7217.html" title="London Passenger Transport Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a>, which was already publicly owned. The nationalisation package also included the fleets of 'private owner wagons', which industrial concerns had used to transport goods on the railway networks.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Commission_2c69.html" title="Edit section: Organisation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Organisation</span></h2>
<p>The BTC was one of the largest industrial organisations in the world, at one time employing nearly 688,000 people. At first, the Commission did not directly operate transport services - these were the responsibility of the Commission's Executives. These were separately appointed, and operated under what were termed 'schemes of delegation'. The Act provided for five Executives, covering Docks &amp; Inland Waterways, Hotels, London Transport, Railways, and Road Transport. The <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_Executive_1601.html" title="Railway Executive">Railway Executive</a> traded as "<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Railways_c7a8.html" title="British Railways">British Railways</a>". In 1949, Road Transport was divided into separate Road Haulage and Road Passenger Executives, though the latter proved short-lived.</p>
<p>The Commission's extensive activities included:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Advertising:</b> British Transport Advertising sold space on premises and vehicles</li>
<li><b>Buses:</b> the Tilling Group sold its bus interests to the BTC in September <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, as did the Red and White Group in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>. Midland General buses and trolleybuses were transferred by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Electricity_Authority_95bb.html" title="British Electricity Authority">British Electricity Authority</a>. From the railway companies, the BTC also inherited non-controlling interests in many bus companies in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Electric_Traction_9290.html" title="British Electric Traction">British Electric Traction</a> Group. It also manufactured buses for its own use, through the subsidiaries <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Commercial_Vehicles_ffaf.html" title="Bristol Commercial Vehicles">Bristol Commercial Vehicles</a> and Eastern Coach Works. In London and the surrounding area, the BTC ran both the (red) London buses and the (green) country buses, including <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Line_Coaches_1880.html" title="Green Line Coaches">Green Line Coaches</a>.</li>
<li><b>Docks:</b> British Transport Docks (today known as <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_British_Ports_00c2.html" title="Associated British Ports">Associated British Ports</a>), comprising 32 ports taken over from the railway companies</li>
<li><b>Films:</b> the BTC had its own film production company, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Films_637a.html" title="British Transport Films">British Transport Films</a></li>
<li><b>Hotels &amp; Catering:</b> the former railway hotels and catering departments, later re-organised as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Hotels_09fb.html" title="British Transport Hotels">British Transport Hotels</a></li>
<li><b>Museums:</b> The BTC inherited the LNER's Railway Museum at York and appointed a Curator of Historical Relics to build up a national collection. Eventually, much of this collection was displayed at the Museum of British Transport at <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clapham.html" title="Clapham">Clapham</a>, south <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. This closed in the early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>'s and was superseded by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Railway_Museum_c66f.html" title="National Railway Museum">National Railway Museum</a> at <a href="../../../y/o/r/York.html" title="York">York</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Transport_Museum_356d.html" title="London Transport Museum">London Transport Museum</a> (now in <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covent_Garden_b764.html" title="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</a>). The BTC also established the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoke_Bruerne_Canal_Museum_a5aa.html" title="Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum">Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum</a>.</li>
<li><b>Police:</b> the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Police_c1b3.html" title="British Transport Police">British Transport Police</a> was formed chiefly by the amalgamation of the various railway constabularies</li>
<li><b>Railways:</b> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Railways_c7a8.html" title="British Railways">British Railways</a>, including ancillary activities like engineering workshops, and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Underground_1afc.html" title="London Underground">London Underground</a>. The former LMS lines in Northern Ireland (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Counties_Committee_9804.html" title="Northern Counties Committee">Northern Counties Committee</a>) were sold to the Ulster Transport Authority in 1949.</li>
<li><b>Road Haulage:</b> the local road distribution networks of the pre-nationalisation rail companies, plus the removals company <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickfords.html" title="Pickfords">Pickfords</a>, which the railways had owned jointly. To these were added numerous smaller independent concerns taken over at nationalisation, comprising all undertakings predominantly engaged in ordinary long-distance work for distances of 40 miles or upwards. These networks were later re-organised as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Road_Services_daba.html" title="British Road Services">British Road Services</a> (BRS).</li>
<li><b>Shipping:</b> the former railway steamer services, primarily to France and Ireland and around the Scottish coast, and investments in Associated Humber Lines and the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company</li>
<li><b>Tramways:</b> the South London tramways of London Transport, all of which were abandoned by 5 July <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a></li>
<li><b>Travel &amp; Holidays:</b> the travel agents <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cook_b33f.html" title="Thomas Cook">Thomas Cook &amp; Son</a></li>
<li><b>Waterways:</b> canals and navigable rivers, mainly taken over from canal companies, like the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Union_Canal_d56e.html" title="Grand Union Canal">Grand Union Canal</a> Company, but also including those bought out earlier by the pre-nationalisation railways. The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caledonian_Canal_654e.html" title="Caledonian Canal">Caledonian Canal</a> was already State-owned. The canals are today run by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Waterways_56c9.html" title="British Waterways">British Waterways</a>. As well as the canal infrastructure, BTC also managed canal carrying services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission was permitted to "secure the provision" of road passenger services, although it did not have general powers of compulsory purchase of bus operators. To obtain specific powers of acquisition it had first to draw up, and get approval for, a 'Road Scheme', area by area. Only one was published, the North East Area Road Scheme, though work began on a second scheme, covering East Anglia. The NEARS was never confirmed, as it was fiercely opposed by private and municipal operators.</p>
<p>The quasi-federal structure of Commission and Executives proved to be an obstacle to integration and was largely abolished by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> government with effect from <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> (the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Transport_Executive_e99e.html" title="London Transport Executive">London Transport Executive</a> alone survived). On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, the railways were re-organised on the basis of six Area Railway Boards, which had a wide measure of operational autonomy under the Commission's overall supervision. The Commission took direct charge of the remaining assets, though these were significantly reduced by the Conservatives de-nationalising much of the road haulage sector. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, separate managements were also set up for road haulage, hotels, docks and inland waterways.</p>

<p>By the late 1950s the BTC was in serious financial difficulties, largely due to the economic performance of the railways. It was criticised as an overly bureaucratic system of administering transport services and had failed to develop an integrated transport system (such as integrated ticketing and timetabling). It was abolished by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> government under the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Act%2C_1962_c1d9.html" title="Transport Act, 1962">Transport Act, 1962</a> and replaced by five successor bodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Railways_Board_52a0.html" title="British Railways Board">British Railways Board</a> (railways, hotels and some shipping)</li>
<li>the British Transport Docks Board (docks)</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Waterways_56c9.html" title="British Waterways">British Waterways Board</a> (inland waterways)</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Transport_Board_dc34.html" title="London Transport Board">London Transport Board</a> (London buses and the London Underground)</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Holding_Company_1958.html" title="Transport Holding Company">Transport Holding Company</a> (remaining interests, in shipping, travel and road transport)</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes took effect on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. Notwithstanding the abolition of the BTC, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Transport_Police_c1b3.html" title="British Transport Police">British Transport Police</a> continues to exist. The BTC heraldic shield is still displayed on the BTP badge.</p>
