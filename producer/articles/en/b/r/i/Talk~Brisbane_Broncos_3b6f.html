<p>Is Gorden Tallis actually meant to be spelt Gord<u>o</u>n Tallis? Also, perhaps it would be a good idea to put in a Club Information section, like the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a> have?</p>

<li>The history needs some serious fleshing out. It just discusses the first final etc. THeres a massive hisotry (not very long granted) about the Bronocos... their defection to Super League, the turmoil of Powers beer vs XXXX leading to the move to ANZ. The loss of Wally Lewis because of rumoured fighting between him and Wayne....</li>

<li>The history section is still very bland and very vague. The Broncos have so much history and in this web article such little is written. Would expect to see alot more.

<p>This article is untidy. Its lengthy and has unnecessary information</p>
<p>Many times is it filled with biased and emotive language as well as informal language. There is a load of information in this article, but with that alot of biased one sided commentary in the writing.</p>
<p>Also I dont see any sourcing to the article in the history section? I would expect something like this addressed. Since I don't have access to Brisbane Broncos sources you have been using I would think it appropriate any uncited, unsourced material be removed.

<p>I've watched this article take shape over the past month or so and I'm paticularly amazed at the number of editors that contribute to the article. The history section seems quite comprehensive from a neutral point of view and I can see that a lot of people have put in much dedication into the article. But personally I think this article could be improved dramatically with relatively little effort at all. All the basic parts of a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">featured article</a> are there, but a lot of tidying up needs to be done. Check out the layout of <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Roosters_833b.html" title="Sydney Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_FC_7f38.html" title="Arsenal FC">Arsenal FC</a> and have a look what needs to be done to get it to this stage. As I said, what's been done so far is great, but I think tables and statistics need to be reduced in numbers and a few more direct references need to be made if you guys want this to be pushed up to featured status. Where do you guys want this article to head? --<a href="../../../m/d/m/User%7EMdmanser_7d3d.html" title="User:Mdmanser">mdmanser</a> 11:43, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've moved some stuff around, and added info on the crest, colours, etc from Gallaway's The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat. Stuff that was taken off was put into the Brisbane Broncos records and Brisbane Broncos Stadiums sections - imo its still good info, just it couldve been in a better place. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteeden_e301.html" title="User:Steeden">Steeden</a> 08:04, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The 2006 Grand Final was the first final between two non-NSW based teams, not Sydney based. For example, the 1994 GF between St George and Broncos, both of these teams are not based in Sydney.</p>

<p>Does this section really help make the article better? I would say that really the only major rivalry the Broncos have is with NQ and the Gold Coast (possibly - the Giants/Seagulls/Chargers vs. Broncos games were always great). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteeden_e301.html" title="User:Steeden">Steeden</a> 04:19, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Are you kidding me? What about the rivalry with st george in the 90s?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The dragons one is/was a good one, but I was concentrating more on the value of having the Broncos vs. Wests and other rivalries there. TBH they're not games that the media sits up and pays attention to year after year. Think of all the attention the Gold Coast generated when they wanted to open their season against the Broncos. IMO that showed the rivalry (and respect) the Cowboys and Broncos have for each other. I wouldnt rate the Tigers in the same bracket. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteeden_e301.html" title="User:Steeden">Steeden</a> 02:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really don't think the broncos have a greater rivalry with one club than another. I'm against the inclusion of this section.

<p>I'm a little concerned with the language used in the section particularly the comment about navy blue being used to complement Ergon Energy's sponsorship. It makes the club seem a little mercenary and seems more like a opinion than a fact.</p>

The figures are different from those in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_Players_9ce9.html" title="Brisbane Broncos Players">Brisbane Broncos Players</a> list. Is this because the wiki list isn't including super league or World Club Challenge games, but the broncos.com.au list is?
