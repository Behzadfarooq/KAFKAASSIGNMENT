<p>BYU–Idaho operates on an expanded year-round basis to allow more students the opportunity to attend. The academic calendar is divided into winter, summer, and fall semesters. Students are admitted to one of three tracks: summer/fall, fall/winter, or winter/summer. The system allows students to be “off-track” for one semester each year, and they stay on the same track through graduation.</p>
<p>A year-round Fast Track program is also available. Students participating in Fast Track generally start after their sophomore year at BYU–Idaho and continue year-round (summer, fall, and winter) until graduating.</p>
<p>Starting in 2007, BYU–Idaho will implement a revised academic calendar utilizing three 14-week semesters. This will enable more students to attend the summer semester.</p>

<li>Obeying the law and all campus policies</li>
<li>Using clean language</li>
<li>Respecting others</li>

<p>The school's relative geographic isolation from a metropolitan area, combined with the strong moral standards taught and encouraged by the school and it's sponsoring organization, contribute to a unique student culture similar to other BYU schools but unlike that of any other school. Alcohol and drug use are practically non-existent, as the use of the aforementioned is strictly prohibited by the school's honor code as well as the LDS Church. There is also no Greek community.</p>
<p>Much of BYU-Idaho student life revolves around events sponsored by the College, which frequently hosts dances, concerts, and sports events, among other things. One event that has proven immensely popular with the student body is a three-day series of concerts called "Guitars Unplugged," held each semester, which features mainly acoustic music performed by student performers and groups who are selected by audition. The last concert is normally held in the Hart Auditorium, which features selected acts from the previous two nights, and almost always sells out the roughly 4,300 seat arena.</p>
<p>Another popular event is an annual Halloween concert performed by the Symphony Orchestra. Music department faculty, students in the ensemble, and even audience members dress up in Halloween costumes. It features music commonly associated with the Halloween season, as well as skits by various faculty members.</p>
<p>The school has recently been developing a thriving jazz scene, which is aggressively promoted by students who participate in jazz area classes, such as the Sound Alliance Big Band and jazz combos, as well as music department faculty. As of Fall 2006, students in the jazz combo program have began performing at a local restaurant/club called the "Heart, Mind and Soul," as a free service to get the students more performance time. Faculty jazz concerts and the annual BYU-Idaho Jazz festival are also becoming popular events with students. The school has featured such artists as <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_Chestnut_7909.html" title="Cyrus Chestnut">Cyrus Chestnut</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Payton_3337.html" title="Nicholas Payton">Nicholas Payton</a>, Ed Calle, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Mintzer_59e9.html" title="Bob Mintzer">Bob Mintzer</a>, Harold Jones, and recently, Kevin Mahogany.</p>
<p>A few independent student bands have had moderate success locally and regionally, such as My Camera, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Holiday_a2d0.html" title="National Holiday">National Holiday</a>, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortunate_Son_761e.html" title="Fortunate Son">Fortunate Son</a>. Rexburg has two recording studios that have contributed to the thriving music scene.</p>
<p>Rexburg is situated in a strong northern climate in which winter dominates, and as such, winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding, ice skating, and ice hockey are popular. There are two nearby ski resorts, Grand Targhee and <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Canyon_33ca.html" title="Kelly Canyon">Kelly Canyon</a>, which are frequented by students. However, Rexburg also experiences warm summers, and bridge jumping has become a popular activity with many summer students. Students also visit the nearby <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Anthony_e4b6.html" title="St. Anthony">St. Anthony</a> sand dunes frequently, where large bon fires have become popular, but are also illegal.</p>
<p>BYU-Idaho also has a reputation as a focal point for young Latter-day Saints to seek out a prospective spouse, and as such dating is an important activity.</p>

<p>One of the unique characteristics of the "BYU–Idaho experience" is referred to by students, employees, and alumni as the “Spirit of Ricks”—a campus tradition of service, hard work, friendliness, and compassion. Throughout the transition from Ricks College to BYU–Idaho, leaders have stressed the importance of preserving and enhancing the “Spirit of Ricks.”</p>

<p>The BYU–Idaho campus includes nearly 40 major buildings and residence halls on over 400 acres. Since the transition from Ricks College, new buildings have been constructed and others have been renovated or expanded. Several auditoriums and theaters are found on campus, including the acoustically renowned Barrus Concert Hall, which houses the acclaimed Ruffati organ, the third largest organ owned by the LDS Church, after the Tabernacle and Conference Center organs in Salt Lake City, Utah. On October 31, 2006, groundbreaking was held for the final phase of the expansion of BYU-Idaho from Ricks College. This expansion will include an addition to the Manwaring Center and a new auditorium with the capability of holding the entire student body.</p>
<p>The school is also home to a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetarium.html" title="Planetarium">planetarium</a>, an <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arboretum.html" title="Arboretum">arboretum</a>, natural history, geology, and wildlife museums, and a Family History Center for genealogical research. <a href="../../../k/b/y/KBYI_a1cb.html" title="KBYI">KBYI</a>-FM, a 100,000 watt public radio station, broadcasts to eastern Idaho and parts of <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a>.</p>
