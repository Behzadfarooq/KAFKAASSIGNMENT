<p>This article, while good, has the tone of a biography, not an encyclopedia. There are numerous <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> statements, especially with regards to his influence on the Beatles, and what might have happened if he didn't die. All judgements needs to be attributed to notable <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">sources</a>. I'm going to add tags. Could someone go through and add the sources (or chop the problem statements)? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmoo_727a.html" title="User:Ashmoo">Ashmoo</a> 04:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the anecdotes that have been tagged have been culled from Peter Brown's <i>The Love You Make.</i> Mr Brown is a notable insider to the Beatles and Mr. Epstein - indeed, he was name-checked in the song "The Ballad of John and Yoko":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally made the plane into Paris, honeymooning down by the Seine<br />
Peter Brown call to say, you can make it O.K.<br />
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Brown had unprecedented access and authorization from the Beatles during the writing of the biography; it should be and is considered a primary source for anything Beatles-related.<br />
It's been a couple decades since I've read <i>The Love You Make</i> but I'll check it out of the library this weekend, and start the process of removing those onerous "citation needed" tags.<br />

<p>I removed the following paragraph:</p>
<p>One source, longtime Lennon friend and confidant <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Shotton_10e3.html" title="Peter Shotton">Peter Shotton</a>, claimed in his book <i>The Beatles, Lennon and Me</i> that under provocation from Epstein, Lennon did partly give in: "I let him <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">toss me off</a>, and that was it." Biographer <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_Davies_4d1e.html" title="Hunter Davies">Hunter Davies</a> also recalled Lennon telling him he had consented to an encounter "to see what it was like." Writer <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Goldman_cade.html" title="Albert Goldman">Albert Goldman</a> expanded on both claims in his <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lives_of_John_Lennon_5774.html" title="The Lives of John Lennon">The Lives of John Lennon</a></i>, alleging a longtime affair between the two men. In any case, throughout his management of The Beatles, Epstein was very careful not to play favourites for fear of creating a strain in his stewardship of the group.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>because I felt like a discussion of whether or not Lennon got a handjob has very little to do with Brian Epstein's life and accomplishments. Maybe somebody wants to move this 'graph to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>? (Although anything involving a quote from Albert 'I Hate Famous People' Goldman is inherently suspect, to me). I also (reluctantly) rmv'd the hilarious quote about "<i>Cellarful of Boys</i>" as being uncited and only peripherally relevant (if at all).</p>
<p>And as it turns out, there's a few other bits related to Brian's particular preference in partners that didn't seem the least bit necessary. Ok, so he was gay. It's covered. Nobody cares if he was a top, bottom, liked rough trade or fresh chickens. Well, at least, I don't think a concise, encyclopedic description of this important figure in music history is the proper forum to discuss it.</p>
<p>And, what they hey, I'm on a roll, so I deleted a bunch of stuff about suicide notes from the 'Death' section. Well, condensed it down, at least, since it does deserve mention. Just not elaboration and speculation. And that bit about rumours of a poisoning conspiracy?? Not only did no evidence appear to support it, no evidence appears to support the existence of said rumours. Anyone else ever hear this before? Paragraph summarily, boldly executed. Enjoy castigating me for my text-deletionist bias.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 10:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These removals appear to be done more to personal taste than in the historical interest. These were events in the lives of Epstein, Lennon and the Beatles inner circle, and warrant a mention. Stick around for sourcing (and the source was given, if not a precise citation, in Shotton's case). In the case of the "conspiracy", Philip Norman's <i>Shout!</i> devotes a couple pages to detailing its backstory (beginning in 1964), not as a supporter, but as a biographer. I have also seen it mentioned or alluded to in other biographies. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyrad_22f0.html" title="User:Zephyrad">Zephyrad</a> 12:42, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also notice a tendency on Wikipedia to remove things alleged in Albert Goldman's Lennon biography, simply because Goldman is involved or noted for writing about it. This is a disservice; unanswered questions tend to fester, and I think the best remedy is to answer speculations (and fictions) with facts. Borrowing from Derek Taylor, "I raise the point to lower it, and hopefully to bury it." I reject Goldman's claims, but I think their stench will go away sooner with airing. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyrad_22f0.html" title="User:Zephyrad">Zephyrad</a> 23:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, the fact that you just blanket reverted 2 hours worth of carefully considered edits looks like you saw a bunch of sudden edits, didn't like 'em, and removed 'em, <i>en masse</i>. That would be a better example of editing to personal taste. I assure you, each and every change I ever make to any damned is purely for my own personal goal of improving the clarity, tone, and above all neutrality of Wikipedia. I really would have preferred you to have undone parts you had specific objections to, and then detailed those objections here. As I understand it, that's a common procedure 'round this neck of the net. But here I'm really close to what I feel is a personal attack, so I'll re-focus.</dd>
<dd>Let's do things the slow way, ok? Bit by bit, that is. Since I added Bill Harry's story to the article in the first place, let's start with that. I reworded that paragraph because I think Harry's claims had become over-emphasized from just plain too many words, thus being made to seem more legitimate than they actually are. As far as I know, the majority of the Beatles-fan community (including me) feels that Bill Harry is a disgruntled old guy with an axe to grind, that is to say (more politely) that he probably made it up, you know? Am I wrong about this? Have a dozen biographers suddenly decided maybe Brian, Paul, John &amp; etc were all lying about how the lads first met the man? If not, then I'll ask you -- nicely -- to explain to me what exactly is wrong with my rewriting in this particular instance (which I have re-reverted) <i>before</i> you dismiss my efforts with the click of of mouse, ok?

<p>This is not a settled matter at all. The accepted version prevailed until 2001 when Alistair Taylor reversed his own confirmation of this story in his earlier book - with another new version of the story in his NEW book. However - suspicions were immediately raised that Taylor had needed "something new" to enable him to sell a new book - when he had claimed to have "told all" in his FIRST book. Furthermore - a Liverpool based journalist actually tracked down the legendary NEMS customer Raymond Jones (then living in Spain) and discovered that he DID exist and HAD initiated Epstein's search for the record.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bob Spitz has rightly received some praise for his book - but there have also been numerous factual errors in his book that have been documented. Spitz is certainly not the definitive writer on matters to do with the Beatles. And certainly not on the topic of Epstein. The works of Epstein's biographer Ray Coleman (who knew him well) and his former assistant Derek Taylor (no relation to Alistair Taylor) are far more valid than Spitz - who had no first-hand knowledge of Epstein or the Beatles.</p>
<p>Last but not least - as previously noted on these pages - Bill Harry has had an openly-declared animus towards Epstein - and his words relating to Epstein must take account of that. The recollections of Lennon and the other Beatles in respect of Epstein always concur with Epstein's descriptions - and those of Derek Taylor (from 1964 up till his death in 1997) and with Alistair Taylor from 1964-2001 (prior to his revisionist second book) - and not with the views of Bill Harry. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 15:42, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) Taylor worked very closely with Epstein. Interviewed him extensively in April 1964 - and co-wrote/ghosted his autubiography. 2) The journalist who tracked down Raymond Jones (I think it may have been Spencer Leigh - I am checking) was/is known to be reputable and an expert. This was a big deal in Liverpool when he was finally traced. It was not a flaky thing. 3) Epstein wrote a few columns for Mersey Beat. Please do not put words into my mouth! I did not say Harry "hated him so much". I purposely and carefully wrote that he had an openly-declared animus. Which is not the same as hatred. Epstein usurped Harry's intimacy (to the extent there was some) with the Beatles. And was very responsible for their worldwide success. Harry felt that Epstein took advantage of him when Epstein purchased "Mersey Beat". Harry has been quite open about his feelings against Epstein. That is why in Beatles circles he is respected in general. And with good reason. But his opinions on matters relating directly to Epstein are taken cautiously. It is not likely that you will find any direct quote from a Beatle that supports what Harry says about Epstein. 4) McCartney's recall - like any human - is not perfect. His recollections in the late 90s are inevitably not as sharp as those in the early 1960s. None of the Beatles have/had perfect recall. Neither McCartney and Lennon could remember (in 1967) in which YEAR they had first met! eg Lennon would say 1956. (It was actually 1957) <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 17:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the objective. Worth working towards the GA.</p>
<p>Spitz is a useful resource but truly not definitive. He is a journeyman writer of biographies. Not an expert on the Beatles. He did do some good research. But his work - like any biographer - is fallible. And prey to agendas of the interviewees. The words written by those who were there... who knew Epstein... who captured memories just a few years after the events - rather than 40 years later - are much more valid. Read Michael Braun. Hunter Davies. Ray Coelman. Derek Taylor. Alistair Taylor's original book. George Martin. Brian Epstein's own book. The 1964 edition AND the 1998 reissue with extensive prologue. And of those who were NOT there - Lewisohn. Those provide better facts and insights. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 21:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The sources you mention are probably better than Spitz, who AFAIK is indeed a journeyman biographer. That said, in cases like this where a story is in dispute and both sides are credibly sourced, we simply present both sides of the story, with references, and let the readers decide. I can't see what there is to argue about because it really is that simple. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 11:10, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm saying you could have used the page preview, instead of burning up Wikipedia's disc space with EIGHTY-THREE (as I counted) basically minor edits, in one day. That's eighty or so EXTRA VERSIONS of the WHOLE PAGE that now need to be stored. If excessive edits-n-saves qualifies an article for GA status, you have no worries... and I have <i>no idea</i> what your girlfriend's nursing job has to do with it. <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyrad_22f0.html" title="User:Zephyrad">Zephyrad</a> 05:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyrad_22f0.html" title="User:Zephyrad">Zephyrad</a>, I think we might want to take a look at <a href="../../../p/e/r/WP%7EPERF_8d3b.html" title="WP:PERF">WP:PERF</a> which says in part: "When making some improvement to Wikipedia's content, such as editing a page, reorganising a category, or modifying a template, the impact on Wikipedia's servers is the last thing you should be worrying about. When the time comes that some common practice is having a negative impact on the servers' ability to provide access, the developers will step in. They worry about the servers' performance so we don't have to." In other words, Andreasegde is a diligent, thorough editor who gives an enormous amount of time and energy to the Beatles articles, and this is the way he works best. Until the developers step in and ask him to use a different method, I think we should all be saying thanks, not criticizing his volume. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 08:08, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are to be commended for all your hard work on this article. I urge you to look at two key books (my copies are currently in storage). The 1998 reissue of "Cellarful Of Noise" (Pocket Books 1998) That contains a lot of well-researched info and stats in the introduction. Plus important quotes by George Martin. And the second book is Ray Coleman's biography of Epstein. You will find invaluable help for the article there. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 18:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can we accept Epstein's ghost-written book as being honest? We probably can, as concerning quotes from other people. I'll look for it. (I had it - years ago - but finding books in Austria is a bugger...

<dd>I had my doubts until reading it and one other book. The following things became apparent. It contains many more of Epstein's actual words than one would think. Derek Taylor's limited edition autobiography "Fifty Years Afrift" (1984) includes reproductions of extracts from the TRANSCRIPTS of the audio-recorded interview he conducted with Epstein in April 1964. Based on a comparison of these words with the equivalent section in the finished "Cellarful" it appears that - certainly in those sections - Taylor simply used Epstein's actual words - with some tidying up for grammar and syntax. ie - Taylor did not create the words out of his own head based just on a series of facts. This makes the book more authentically Epstein's voice than one would expect. Secondly - the book contains several episodes that are not flattering of Epstein. The interviews were conducted - and the book written - in a more innocent era where "spin control" was not automatically considered. While Epstein - like most people - undoubtedly presented his story in a favorable light - he included a few unflattering details of his relationship with the Beatles - including some tensions between himself and the individuals - that would probably have been excised from such a book in later more self-conscious times. So the book is really helpful. And the 1998 edition is even better. Alas my copy is in storage. Good luck finding it!

<p>I think there IS a need for this section - but I agree it needs more work. The reason for keeping it is this: Epstein's relationship with the Beatles evolved - just as their music evolved. We know that there was a vast difference between the group that recorded Love Me Do - and the band that recorded Sgt. Pepper - and we note this in the Beatles article. Different sections. There was undeniably a shift in the relationship between Epstein and the Beatles - just as there was in their relationship with George Martin. What started out as a paternal guardianship evolved into a friendly business partnership. Numerous comments from the Beatles in Anthology that he was above all - their friend. That was new in relationships between artists and managers. We need to convey that. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 17:34, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I totally agree, but are there enough (I know I'm pedantic about this - sorry) citations for that?

<p>I have just thought about this, and think that the whole thing started to break down when they stopped touring. Epstein, Mal Evans and Aspinall were all relegated to the sidelines as the Beatles concentrated more on studio work. Maybe the section could be renamed: Studio years, End of touring, After Candlestick Park, or whatever you think is right... Their relationship with Epstein definitely changed after they stopped playing live gigs (which meant a drastic reduction in income for Epstein.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 18:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>From all I know and all I've read by those who knew the situation best - the relationship certainly changed. And that caused Epstein some insecurity. However the relationship was still a very strong one. It didn't get worse. It was that the work was different. Epstein was not primarily driven by money. He valued the achievements more than the money alone. His accomplishments in getting the Beatles to partake in the "Our World" first-ever worldwide satellite hook-up, in getting the Beatles to acquiesece (albeit begrudgingly and reluctantly) in the "Yellow Submarine" film - were both prescient. The latter has yielded the Beatles a lot of money in recent years. That is why we should get hold of the 1998 edition of the Epstein "Cellarful" which details much of this. Check out the Brian Epstein website. Some great quotes by George Martin, Derek Taylor and Ray Coleman. I trust their words much more than Bob Spitz who is a well-intentioned journeyman writer interviewing people 40-50 years on - with fading memories - and sometimes with their own agenda... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 19:33, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look at these sentences:</p>
<p>"While by present-day standards this was a poor deal, these were standard terms in 1962 for a new artist with no leverage. Especially an artist that had already been rejected by every major competitor."[citation needed]</p>
<p>This was slipped into a paragraph that had a citation, but has no citation by itself, <i>making it look as if the citation covered it as well</i>. This is just not on...</p>
<p>"Epstein arranged for the Beatles to enter into a publishing agreement with Dick James Music (DJM) and set up a company called Northern Songs, <i>which was also standard for the time</i>: songwriters received the statutory minimum of 50% of the gross monies received, with the publisher retaining the other 50%." [citation needed]</p>
<p>If there is no citation added to these statements they will have to be deleted. This is not my personal opinion, it is simply why we are here. We can not put facts/POV inâeven if they are trueâwithout citing where they came from. I don't want to fall out about this, but I will rigidly stick to what is expected from us...</p>
<p>I also expect the new paragraphs in Business dealings to be left in, because they are cited and convey information that is factual. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 16:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBrian_Epstein_9811.html" title="Edit section: Commission">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commission</span></h2>
<p>Let's address the last point. There is a need to weigh what is factual with what is relevant. Classic case: The stated surprise expressed by Isherwood about the management commission.</p>
<p>1) Was Isherwood genuinely surpised? Possibly. Assume he was. 2) Did he express this surprise to Barry Miles? Probably. Miles is an honest writer. Assume he did. 3) So is the FACT that Isherwood said this to Miles true? Almost certainly. So THAT is a fact.</p>
<p>Now... 4) Was Isherwood erroneous in being surprised? If he was a CPA with a lot of entertainment industry experience (of which they were very few in 1964) he would have known that they were two entirely different roles in the business. Agents who secured engagements for a 10% commission. And personal managers (sometimes called "managers" or "talent managers") who performed a far broader role and customarily received remuneratin ranging from 15% to 30% (usual range) all the way up to 50% (Elvis' manager). Let's say he didn't know this. So his surprise is legitimate. it's just that it was ill-informed.</p>
<p>So now we come to the decision to include or exclude such a nugget in the article.</p>
<p>At best this is misleading trivia. It almost certainly is true that the person thought that and that he imparted his view to Miles. Who included it among TENS OF THOUSANDS of other facts in his book.</p>
<p>The question isn't is it factual that it was a view that was uttered and <b>that it was uttered</b> it can be cited.</p>
<p>The question is it relevant to include the mis-perception of one individual merely because it was included in one book which can cited as evidence of it being a "fact"? (A fact that <b>it was uttered</b>. NOT a fact that it was true about Epstein.)</p>
<p>The likelihood is that an uninformed reader (not knowing the difference between managers and agents) might tend to draw a conclusion that Epstein was doing something outrageously wrong by being paid a commission that a CPA thought was unusually high. That leaves an impression that is defamatory of Epstein.</p>
<p>It is ludicrous that this erroneous misperception by one individual would then have to be countered by cited examples simply to prove that this individual was mistaken in his belief.</p>
<p>That would be self-defeating madness.</p>
<p>I have put some simple refutation in on a temporary basis. But I think it should be deleted. The views of one individual - erroneous or otherwise - is just not MATERIAL to this article. And since it also leaves a defamatory impression - it should not be in the article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 16:40, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a strong danger that the article is including too much unnecessary detail on Epstein's personal/sexual life.</p>
<p>The fact that he was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in England - and generally a taboo in social circles - is legitimate. It also had some impact on the way he lived his life. So these facts must be included. Many of his friends and associates commented on this in recent years. With a few people going into great detail. Again this is factual. So there are plenty of on-the-record statements that can be cited.</p>
<p>But how MUCH detail is NECESSARY in a biographical article. At what point does it cross over from being information essential in a biographical article to being a titillating litany of sexual preferences and activities? Are there similarly detailed accounts in the articles of other notable individuals? Is there a different amount of detail included? If so why? Is it because he was homosexual? Is there the same amount of detail included about heterosexual people who were promiscuous in their personal lives? Is it because the activities were illegal?</p>
<p>I am NOT advocating any type of whitewash. I AM advocating that we look at other articles about notable individuals and ensure that the AMOUNT of detail included is proportionate and appropriate. Simply because something has been stated in a book and a reference to that book can be included does not in itself make something relevant. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 16:57, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that Brian's sexuality should not overdue the details, but deciding when that threshold is reached is difficult. With regards to comparisons to other people, every case is different. From all the accounts I have read, his sexuality played a major part in his life, and unfortunately, his death. To the extent there is a disagreement about what to leave in/leave out, editors should discuss it here. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Cardinal_6b2b.html" title="User:John Cardinal">John Cardinal</a> 21:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As per my comments above, I too felt there was way too much material about specific sexual details -- in fact, it almost like felt the article had been hacked over by a homophobe trying make gays look bad, but that's just a personal opinion. In any case, I will repeat that the paragraph referencing the probably-apocryphal Epstein/Lennon handjob is, imo, entirely excessive, and should be cut completely. At best, it is a trivial detail about <i>Lennon</i> more than it is about Epstein. The reference to 'rough trade' is also over the top, to me; it's purely speculation by some biographer (afaik). But after getting annoyed with Zephyred's undoing of my efforts w/o apparent consideration (again, imo) I decided not to work on this article any more. Clearly, other editors have (finally!) taken it under their wings to give Brian the high-quality article he deserves.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEaglizard_0156.html" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> 05:40, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is fine as regards comments made about his business dealings, since most seem to be cited, and his percentages. As for some of his business dealings, perhaps he wasn't quite as smart as he could have been and trusted people too much but he was singularly devoted to the band, and again there are references (and qualifications about general practice at the time).</dd>
<dd>As for his sexuality, it seems that it did inform much of his life and as being <i>queer</i> was illegal and socially unacceptable in his formative years it must have played a significant part of his character development. Other than his sexuality and dealings with the Beatles, and other acts, are there any decent sources for the rest of his life outside of the Beatles and his orientation? I wouldn't be surprised if there was precious little outside of the Beatles and being gay. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is about whether some people want to "carry a torch" for Epstein, or to relate the facts (which are from cited sources). One user believes that Epstein's homosexuality should not be overly stressed, or his mistakes/naivety in business. This user does not like adding citations, but merely adds his own POV. I am here purely to relate the facts as quoted from cited sources, and to raise Brian Epstein from a B-article to a GA. I have my doubts as to whether the user in question is really interested in Epstein becoming a GA. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 22:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Factsâmentioned above a few timesâare very slippery things. I think it's better to discuss <i>evidence</i>, supported by reliable sources, and in some cases, conclusions drawn from that evidence. A lot of the content in Beatle-related articles are accounts by observers made after the event, and subject to enormous complications of truth. I am not talking about people being dishonest, I'm talking about 2 honest witnesses watching the same event and sincerely believing they saw something different. Thinking of evidence as <i>facts</i> is error-prone, but luckily, not really necessary. When treated as evidence, you record the source, capture what it says, and leave most of the conclusions to the reader. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Cardinal_6b2b.html" title="User:John Cardinal">John Cardinal</a> 05:59, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay. Can you provide a postcode area (or name) for Chapel Street. There are likely to be several in London. Should his pre Beatles life be split between pre and post National Service? The latter shows the adult, whereas the former is early and family life orientated.</dd>
<dd>Er... that's it, really. Perhaps his management of other bands should be more than a couple of lines, since some were very succesful and they are noted in the info box, but perhaps the reference books used do not say much.

<dd>That's a different kettle of fish, and probably does need to be cited.

<dl>
<dd>I have to disagree with kingboyk here: The band as an national and international success happened during Epsteins tenure as manager, those with only a passing knowledge of the band would not be familiar with their pre-Epstein career. The visibility of Epstein as a mover and shaker in 60's pop society is obvious, since a management deal with him was second only to having a Lennon/McCartney composition in terms of credibility. Whatever it was that the Beatles embodied as 60's icons only happened whilst Epstein was their manager. It was only in the period after Epstein's death that there was criticism over their musical directions, business dealings, public personae, etc. The perception of the Beatles as <b>the</b> foremost musical act of the era is during Epstein's management, and as such (I suggest) does not require referencing/citing. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:06, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>The opening of this paragraph was NOT a fair reflection of prevailing opinion about Epstein. And certainly not on the very webpage that was cited as the reference for it! The conventional wisdom on Epstein has always been primarily that he was honest. There has definitely been some criticism (long after his death) about some of the deals he made. Though the prevailing opinion has always been that any mistakes were because of naivite. And as Denis O'Dell (and also Ray Coleman and George Martin make clear) there is a lot of Monday Morning Quarterbacking. Lennon made one remark about Epstein that contradicted volumes of positive remarks about Epstein that he made. (At certain times - Lennon also attacked George Martin, Derek Taylor, McCartney and Harrison - and many others. These views - expressed mainly in the immediate aftermath of the Beatles; break-up - are not held to be the definitive views by Lennon on any of the objects of his temporary wrath.) It certainly is not accurate to imply that approx. 50% of people regard Epstein as having been honest and 50% think him dishonest. Far and away the opinion of those closest to him (Alistair Taylor, Derek Taylor, Peter Brown, George Martin) or those who have researched his life (Ray Coleman, Martin Lewis, Debbie Geller) is that he was a scrupulously honest man who was utterly devoted to the Beatles (probably to his own detriment in terms of emotional and physical health. To suggest otherwise is a grave disservice and unfactual. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 19:53, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Various points...</p>
<p>This contained a lot of minor detail that does not belong in the opening paras. The fact of where he was during the recording of Sgt. Pepper is valid and factual - but doesn't belong in an overview. The fact of his death does.</p>
<p>The most salient part of Epstein's success in getting George Martin to sign the Beatles was not that Martin hadn't seen them play live. (That was NOT an essential component of a decision to sign a recording artist in 1962.) If anything needs to be said - it was that Epstein succeeded after the group had been turned down by every other major record label.</p>
<p>The term "businessman" is not the key word to describe Epstein. That implies he was primarily a businessman. He was a minor store manager who became a very successful impresario. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 20:04, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry you seem to be upset. I can only speak for myself. I really am not that worried about the article receiving peer approval or brownie points. To me it is infinitely more important that the article be actually fair and factual than that it be given an award SAYING that in the opinion of some reviewer - it has met some subjective standard. Nice to have it - but way less important than just the knowledge of doing decent work. IMO the hard work that you and others (and myself as well) have put in has been good - but not perfect. There is still far too much reliance on one or two books. Just because they have been published and can be cited in our article - doesn't automatically mean that they are correct.</p>
<p>And the existence of one or two opinions about him or his life - that are discounted by the vast majority of published accounts doesn't mean that we then have this artificial "balance" inserted that (by way of example) "on the one hand some people believe he was honest - but others think he was a crook. So opinion is divide on the subject". That is artificial balance that means theoretically that any crackpot theory or assertion could be included - just as long as it is in a book and we cite the page number.</p>
<p>There is a lot of material that may be factually true (or not) but even if true - is needless detail and minutiae. And there is a preponderence of detail about his sexual preferences that is not present about those who are promiscuous heterosexuals. That is not to seek to airbrush his personal life - but to keep the amount of detail limited to what is necessary for a biographic article - not what is titillating gossipy detail.</p>
<p>This article needs a lot more work. And that work IMO is NOT about inserting dozens of assertions from mainly one or two books that are not even primarily about Epstein (primarily books by Spitz and Miles) adding the page references as in-format citations - and then taking the attititude that that is good enough. I think we need to read and draw from a wider variety of sources - especially: Ray Coleman's 1989 biography. Derek Taylor's two books "As Time Goes By" (circa 1971) and "Fifty Years Adrift" (circa 1984), Epstein's own "Cellarful of Noise" (1964) and the Martin Lewis companion narrative to the 1998 reissue of "Cellarful" - together with George Martin's introduction to that edition. Also check out Denis O'Dell's book "Apple To The Core". My book collection is in storage now - or I would do it. All of those people (with the exception of Lewis) knew Epstein well. (And Lewis - who is a protege of Derek Taylor - is an acknowledged Beatles historian who has produced multiple Beatles projects). Let's look at what THEY have to say. Do NOT depend primarily on Spitz - who is a well-intentioned writer but a professional biographer - he has written books on diverse subjects - not an expert on the Beatles. And never met Epstein. Just interviewed people (some of whom have "agendas") 45 years after the events. Barry Miles is a very respected writer - but he was writing an "authorized" biography of McCartney - so as with any authorized biography - they tend to have to please the person who is authorizing the content. And Miles only knew Epstein slightly. Nowhere near as much as the others mentioned above.</p>
<p>I'm up for more work on this. But let's focus on creating a worthy article rather than on "passing the audition". A worthy article is its own reward. And may even achieve recognition too. But the work is more important than the award... That's MY opinion. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 19:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why are people's books always "in storage"? I have read that so many times that it's laughable. Are people constantly on the move? I doubt it. It just means that people have read them, but don't own them - so are unable to put page number citations in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't understand that getting an article rated as being good is worthy, then you do not understand the concept of an encyclopedia. Wikipedia states that an article is B class because it is not good enough. If you worked for a newspaper, you wouldn't last long in the job with your attitude.</dd>

<dd>Remember Watergate? That came from one source.</dd>

<dd>I have stopped working on this article, as I have no desire to tangle with someone who is "carrying a torch" for Epstein, and does not want anything negative said about him. I wish you well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 19:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even though I no longer contribute to this project, I will defend the the citations I provided. Spitz spent seven years researching/writing his book (fact) and that is not the sort of time a Pop biographer would think of giving. He did make one mistake that I spotted, but other books also have them - but that is no reason to discount his work. <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/spitzbob/beatles" class="external text" title="http://www.metacritic.com/books/authors/spitzbob/beatles" rel="nofollow">I suggest you read this...</a> User <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> does not know how to put in-line citations in (fact) and I strongly suspect that he has not even read Spitz's book. I would even go so far as to say that I think he is a Trojan Horse, and has his own hidden agenda. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 12:40, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
