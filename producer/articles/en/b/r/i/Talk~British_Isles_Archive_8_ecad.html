<p>The fact of the matter is that the term British Isles is not recognised in any official or legal form by the Irish Government. Therefore it needs to be clearly stated on the site. <a href="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html" class="external text" title="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0606/D.0606.200509280360.html" rel="nofollow">Irish Government Website</a></p>
<p>The use of the word "some" suggests to me that a minority of Irish people have a problem with this term, despite the fact that most Irish people prefer the term "Britain and Ireland" instead. Last year, Dermot Ahern, the minister for foreign affairs, said that British Isles was not recognized "in any legal or inter-governmental sense". The Irish embassy in London has been urged to keep an eye out for any perceived abuse of the term in the British media. An embassy spokesman said that the British Isles had a "quaint ring to it … as if we are still part of the Empire". He said that the embassy did not like it being used, saying: "It is important to us, we are independent, we are not part of Britain, not even in geographical terms."

<dd>I'm in Ireland, and am an Irish citizen, and I am not offended by the term "the British Isles" because I understand what it does, and what it does not refer to. There has neve been a plebecite or poll, so your suggestion that "most Irish people prefer the term 'Britain and Ireland' instead" is unsubstantiated. What Ahern and the embassy say is also not necessarily "most Irish people". (I am not suggesting that those comments be dismissed; I'm only saying that "most" isn't appropriate here. "Many" is as far as we can go; it is better than "some" or "most". (One other thing: the term "British Isles" means more than just the two largest islands in the group. It means the Isle of Man and lots and lots of other islands.) -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 13:49, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Been discussed many times: Wikipedia is based on verifiability, not truth. It may be true (and some dispute that - I don't know) that 'most' Irish people have a problem with it. But it is not verifiable. Until we have a verifable source that says otherwise, we can't go making these claims.
<dl>
<dd>I am also an Irish citizen and it is my opinion, having lived in Ireland for 30 years, that Irish people in general do not like the term British Isles. I can't of course prove that. However, the use of "some" suggests that only a minorty of Irish people have a problem with this term. Its like saying "some humans have 10 fingers". Instead why not say, "the term is controversial because it can be seen to imply that Ireland is British". No need for "some". Zimmer79 16:12, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am also an Irish citizen and it is my opinion, having lived in Ireland for more than 35 years, that Irish people in general don't care one way or the other about the term 'British Isles' and rarely, if ever, think about it. Certainly some object to it. Demonstrable and verifiable. Possibly many object to it. But there are pages and pages of Talk archives, most of them discussing the topic ad infinitum. I think the current wording is fine. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 15:28, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia has a clear policy on antedotal evidence. We can't use it. Personal expiriences will be naturally skewed towards people objecting to the term. You simply don't get Pro-British Isles campainers. You either object to it, use it or don't use it. Any arguments need to be backed up with the relevent sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshurtree_32f2.html" title="User:Joshurtree">josh</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshurtree_fda5.html" title="User talk:Joshurtree">talk</a>) 15:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And it makes no sense either. If the term is "without any official status", how can this possibly constitute its being "officialy contested"? Surely the very opposite is true. In any case, all this goes to show is that that politicians are not omnipotent, and cannot legislate for language. The term "British Isles" has been used, in a completely neutral sense, in Irish parliamentary debates, official Irish government reports, and by Irish politicians, so clearly the term really is recognised in Ireland (and by <i>recognised</i> I mean the normal English meaning of that word, not some political fiction). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 08:59, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The subject is very delicate. Given the fact that the Irish Government has publicly pronounced on the matter in the Irish Parliament it is essential to include the information on this. If the article is called "British Isles", and refers to the Republic of Ireland in any form, it is essential to show the Irish Government's positon on this. As the article is, it is too vague and the Irish Government's position is not stated early enough in the article. Although I agree with Rockpocket that the Irish Government's position should not start as a lead paragraph, the Irish Government's position should be clearly stated directly after the first mention of Ireland as being a part of the British Isles. I have made an edit to reflect this need - 03/11/2006 Frankdeano</dd>

<dd>Billiethekid, I think you overestimate the value of a simple PQ. And maybe you should re-read the last line of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermot_Ahern_6162.html" title="Dermot Ahern">Dermot Ahern</a>'s response. Its not actually saying what you think its saying. Lastly, <i>"The term British Isles has also been removed from the Irish atlases that are used in all state schools"</i> is untrue. <i>One</i> publisher will be removing the term from future print runs of the Irish edition of its atlas. Hardly the officially sanctioned censorship you're making it out to be. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 22:19, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&lt;reduce indent&gt; Ah, little willy, thanks for the laugh. Sadly your innocent reading of a politician's words has misled you. Monitoring doesn't mean actually doing anything about what they find. This Dáil Éireann discussion was noted way back on this talk page, when it was also noted that the BBC and the Guardian were using the term <i>British Isles</i> with nothing in their style guides to say they shouldn't, and not a cheep from the RoI government. Enemies of the State can relax, if it takes those nationalist Irish over a year to even draw their policy to the attention of the UK media. As for "most", so far we have evidence that one parent objected to the famous atlas, and didn't get much help from the RoI government that you seem to think is so draconian.

<p>==== Bastun, the fact that Folens have removed the term should not be underestimated. Anyone who knows the Irish System of Education would tell you that Folens are the biggest publishers of Georgraphy books and Atlases in the Republic of Ireland. Furthermore, the fact that Dermot Ahern made that statement should not be underestimated. Little Dave Souza, Dermot Ahern is the Minister of Foreign Affairs and speaks on behalf of the Irish people when it comes to this subject. He was democratically elected. The fact of Ireland's stance on the term "British Isles" is not highlighted enough in the article...and according to this "talk", I'm not the only person who believes this. The fact that the Irish Government does'nt recognise the term, the fact that it is not used in the Irish Republic should be highlighted more. No part Ireland, excluding the 6 counties which are still under British rule, should be included as part of the term "British Isles, when it is clearly not part of the British Isles. If it is to be included the Irish Government's stance should be clearly highlighted. The opening note on the page is too weak. talk</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with you really. The content is in there. The intro has stayed relatively stable for a few months now. I'm sure not everyone is compeltely happy with the article - that's a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compromise.html" title="Compromise">compromise</a> for you - but to be honest, I think it would struggle to do the job of remaining neutral any better. Remember that the 'NPOV' does not mean constantly reporting every point of view - it means not expressing any politically driven one as its own. I don't think the article does that at the moment. It reports the point of view of the Irish governemnt. I'm sure there are some changes that could occur but in general, I think the opening of the page is fine. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 10:05, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am looking for some help, cooperation and suggestions on this issue.I feel it's fundamental to have the Irish Government's position put forward in a clear way. The fact of the matter is that the Republic of Ireland is a huge part of the so called "British Isles" and if the Irish Government, which democratically represents the Irish people, doesn't recognise the term "British Isles" surely this should be respected and highlighted with more clarity. The introductory note that currently leads the article is too weak, and doesn't refer to the Irish Government's position. I propose putting my edit in the body of the text , not as the introduction as suggested by <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket">User:Rockpocket</a> I would like some feedback on this before I edit, Thanks Billthekid77 06/11/2006 23:57 (-4:00 GMT)</p>

<dd>Sounds like a good idea. I think it may have to be couched in slightly more neutral terms (try reading <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to see what i mean), but I think it certainly could be covered in detail in the article with, perhaps, a mention in the intro. Why don't you make a draft, either here or on a subpage on your userspace, and i'll be happy to work with you on it. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 04:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is a worthy point to ask the question that has led to a multi-revert situation of late.

<dd>Well whilst I disagree with how you're personally using the term British Isles - well, not disagree as such, but rather I don't think we should pretend that anywhere near a majority use it as such - I don't see the harm in generally using 'the archipalego' or 'the islands' (unless it gets stupid stylistically... I mean most people can judge if a term or phrase is being over used) instead of British Isles. But I wouldn't put a hard rule down on which and I wouldn't start reverting here there and everywhere either. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 16:38, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed, Rob. Or a mix of 'British Isles', 'the islands', and 'archipelago' would possibly be better. I have to say that personally I'd always associated 'archipelago' more with more-or-less equally sized island chains, moreso than a couple of really big islands (relatively speaking) and lots of tiny ones.

<dd>The term <i>archipelago</i> is not really appropriate. From the OED: "Any sea, or sheet of water, in which there are numerous islands; and transf. a group of islands." So its primary meaning is not islands, but the sea around. Appropriate for the south sea groups, because they are mostly water, but not for Britain and Ireland and the wee ones around them. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 20:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ireland is not British, so it cannot be a British Isle. This is a no-brainer. It may have been the case pre-1922. Some people in the United Kingdom continue to include Ireland, but many people in Ireland, where it counts, exclude Ireland. Even atlases that are used in Irish schools do not use the term. The article talks about the archipelago, now we are told that the so-called archipelago is an erroneous description. And wrong again here too, the article should state the Ireland is sometimes included, depending on <i>point of view</i> (pov). Many good editors have tried to help balance the article, but it still needs the pov element addressed, to state the fact that Ireland is sometimes included.

One publisher of an Irish edition of an atlas will remove the term 'British Isles' from its next edition. Irish school atlases from when I was in school and for many years before, and up to my own daughter's primary school atlas used, and still use, the geographical term 'British Isles'. Atlases using the term will be in Irish classrooms for many a year to come, because (thankfully, says my wallet!) they're not a book that changes every year. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 23:08, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Ireland is not British, so it cannot be a British Isle. This is a no-brainer.</i> — I assume the last part of that refers to the assertion. I can't find any references to Ireland being a <i>British Isle</i>; indeed I can't find any references to any single island being called a <i>British Isle</i>. The assumption that because the names <i>British Isles</i> has the word <i>British</i> in it, then everything covered by the name is claimed by the United Kingdom is is bad logic. The same argument means that much of the United Kingdom's western coastline forming part of the <i>Irish Sea</i> is part of the republic of Ireland. I agree, of course, that calling Ireland a <i>British <b>i</b>sle</i> is factually incorrect. <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 08:55, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I suppose the problem is that some people feel they are so danged <i>RIGHT</i> about what the word <i>British</i> means that they have to cause this foolish ruckus so incessantly. Worldwide, groups of islands typically have a name. Off the west coast of the European mainland there is a big group of islands.

<dd>Yeah, I mean your first sentence contians the essence of the 'problem' here; Bazza's point also hints on it. Namely, its that some people think that by calling Ireland part of the British Isles, we are calling it a British isle, and so are uncomfortable with it; some think that by saying it's in the British Isles, does not necessairily make it a British isle (a reasonable point but, the problem is, that outsiders who do not know the geopolitical history of the isles would get rightly confused by this); a smaller minority think that if it's in the British Isles then it is a British isle, but that does not necessairily make it 'British' in the sense of 'of the United Kingdom' (again, a reasonable stance to have in theory, but one that wilfully ignores misinterpretations of your own language.) And then there are those who think that words don't have set meanigns and frankly, everyone can use them in the way that they want, just as long as you don't deliberatly or knowingly offend someone&#160;;) --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 11:41, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we are in agreement here. To say that something is <b>a British island</b> <i>does certainly imply</i> that it belongs to the government of the United Kindgom in some sense. To say that something is <b>a British isle</b> to me means <i>nothing at all</i> because I don't think that term is used in English. It isn't a natural phrase that one would apply to Iona or Lewis. much less than Britain or Ireland. The term <i>the British Isles</i> as a plural is a geographical term, not a political term, and has been throughout the historical use of the term. Perhaps a non-polemic historical discussion would be valuable. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 15:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, the British government can't even get the name of Ireland right. The Irish Republic hasn't existed for about 90 years (and never in an official context); it's no wonder it's geographically confused. A reference that has incorrect terminology re the actual name of a neighbouring country has very little, if any validity. Absolutely incredible.</dd>

<dd>Geographical, political... these are certainly not the only two options we could use when defining a term. How about cultural? If we are talking about a cultural similarity, then the Channel Islands deserve a place in the British Isles, whereas the Faroes don't. To the ancients, whilst primarily geographical, the term British Isles was derived from the name of an ethnic culture that existed in the islands, namely that of the Insular Celts. And in any case, didn't the Good Friday Agreement set up some multi-layered council with representatives from all the states (sovereign or otherwise) in the British Isles, which included representatives from the various Channel Islands governments? But <i>not</i> the Faroes? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 15:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>À propos the Channel Islands, who said that they are considered part of the British Isles?

<p>I think very much of the above qualifies as original research. It does not matter what we think or understand: verifiable, reliable references are what are important. It would be nice if some of the people most keen on fiddling around with this page would actually make a substantial contribution to the encylcopaedia, you know, with references and things rather than pushing personal agendas. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 21:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, removing the name of the article from the article is just silly, and confusing: for example, there is a banner at the top of the history section leading to the <i>History of the Orkney Islands</i> article, and then a paragraph starting <i>The islands ..</i>. First mention, at least in each section needs to be the full name, euphemisms later where they do not make things obscure.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there is not a single verifiable source where <i>British Isles</i> is used in a political sense i.e. meaning British jurisdiction over the whole island group. I am sure that they exist, but I can't see any at the moment.</p>
<p>Incidentally, one for fact fans: if you are wondering what is the difference between <i>island</i> and <i>isle</i>, away from the lala lands of politics and legal texts, the former is from Old English, the latter from Latin <i>via</i> Old French <i>and apparently only used poetically or with proper nouns (as in you know what); however, the silent</i> s <i>in</i> island <i>is only from the influence of</i> isle<i>. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 21:49, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Well the name of the article ought to be changed to reflect the reality of the current situation i.e. the repugnance felt by many people regarding Ireland being a so-called constituent of the <i>British</i> Isles. How about the Irish Islands or perhaps the Emerald Isles which is much more poetic? Can we also stick to the three revert rule please? Oh and if you wish to view the term being used in a political sense then take a look at the Daily Mail website and search for <i>British Isles Folens Atlas</i> and you will see several jingoistic comments left re that article referring to the <i>British</i> Isles as a country. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.125.54.4 (<a href="../../../1/9/4/User_talk%7E194.125.54.4.html" title="User talk:194.125.54.4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.125.54.4_e74a.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.125.54.4">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>If this is aimed at me, then 1) Read Wikipedia policy on naming pages. Encyclopaedias describe things as they are not how they ought to be. 2) Emerald Isles is rather lovely, but not widely used. I rather like Heylin's description for British Isles + Iceland, Faeroes &amp;tc, the <i>Isles of the Ocean</i>, but again not widely used. Interestingly enough the islands are named after the Celtic inhabitants, but language has shifted since. 3) I have never breached the three revert rule- you can check my contributions if you like. 4) If that is true then fine, lets see the references in the article. I don't like to pollute my mind with the contents of <i>The Daily Mail</i> anymore than is strictly necessary, but nope, nothing that says that the British Isles is a single country. The article on the atlas states explicitly that Ireland became a republic in 1949. Sensible, explicit refs please. I would be surprised if you could not dig something up from Northern Ireland. 5) Have the courtesy to sign your comments. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 23:14, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) I try to keep up with them, but they seem to be dominated by a few people (in fact I think it may be as few as three) who seem to think that everyone should fit in with their point of view. One upshot of the discussion is that <i>archipelago</i> is an inaccurate description. 2) 3RR refers to reverting the same information three times within 24 hours, not the number of separate edits in 24 hours. In fact it is more transparent to make several separate edits than one big one (and easier for people to change back as well, if that is what they want). 3) The point about signing is again transparency: anyone can see my edits, if I do breach 3RR it can be plainly seen, if I make personal attacks I can be held responsible, and it enables sensible conversations to take place. Many anon IPs make serious contributions to the encyclopaedia, however a few use it as a means to evade these policies. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 12:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your understanding of 3RR is flawed, perhaps you should peruse the 3RR policy again. Also, the 28 comments regarding the article refer to the Daily Mail article, which were left on the Daily Mail site by British residents. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 194.125.54.4 (<a href="../../../1/9/4/User_talk%7E194.125.54.4.html" title="User talk:194.125.54.4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_194.125.54.4_e74a.html" title="Special:Contributions/194.125.54.4">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Right, lets stop the reverts, or I'll protect the page.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, a discussion has been had above which kinda came to the conclusion that British Isles/these isles/the islands/the archipalego should be spread relatively equally around the article; it generally improves readability to not have the same phrase over and over again (in an article on a person, the name would not be used everytime - you'd throw in "he" or "she" now and again). There were a few problems with 'archipalego', so it has been suggested that this should be used fairly sparsely.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, the 3RR - jsut so we know - states that you must not revert in whole or in part any edit by another user more than 3 times in 24 hours; so you don't have to revert the same point, and you don't have to revert someone in full; however, multiple small edits that in effect act as one edit would just be considered as one. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quite, and just so no one is deceived into wrong ideas by Mr/s Mysterious of Dublin, the mix of terms was maintained- there was not some sort of wholesale replacement of terms, and an explanation (based on readability) provided here. it would be nice if everyone stayed within the rules, especially <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>I do also take people's comments seriously, but even though random comments on a newspaper's website are far from reliable, even on the Daily Mail they do not imply that there is some sort of sovereignty over Ireland. One even lifts text from this article. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 22:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>MAG1 I've read the reader comments on the Daily Mail article and at least 2 imply UK sovereignty over the archipelago and another refers to Ireland as a "British isle."

<dd>That the term 'British Isles' includes Ireland is not a point of view, it is a verifiable fact, as shown in thousands of atlases, encyclopedias, academic references and 99.9% of usage of the term. That the term is used on very rare occasions not including Ireland is also true, but not relevant. The term 'Europe' is occasionally used not to include the British Isles, but this doesn't change the fact that the British Isles is part of Europe, by long-standing and virtually universal convention. If these conventions change, Wikipedia should reflect that, but trying to engineer such a change is not what Wikipedia is for. This is not a matter of getting offended: it is about Wikipedia reflecting realities, not people's wishes (however justified they might be).--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 16:29, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the issue here Mel, is that you would have to provide with a decent number of sources that explicitly use the term 'British Isles' to exclude Ireland (as in RoI) but include Northern Ireland. Furthermore, we'd need at least one or two of these to be 'official'; or rather from sources that can we can confidently say would have intentionally used the term in that way, and not go confused over it.</p>
<p>I know we've had some sources showing that before, but I'm simply not convinced that this use is 'that' common. It is already mentioned in the lead - proabbly justly - but I think people are more likely to not use 'British Isles' all together, rather than use it just to mean the UK (+IoM).</p>
<p>As for the intro; it was written as a compromise to people who disliked the article beginning "The British Isles = GB + Ireland" (or words to that affect).

Any reasonable man would deduce that Sandwich Islands does not imply that the islands are made of sandwiches. Can you not understand this point?

<dd>How about the Canary Islands? I imagine there are loads of people who imagine them to be named after canaries, rather than the other way round. That's why we have encyclopedias, to point out such errors (rather than muddy the issue with political polemics). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 23:01, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Iolar - for someone with no access to information sources, that would be a perfectly reasonable interpretation. But for everyone with access to atlases, encyclopedias etc there is no need for any interpretation, as the answer is there in black and white. Believe me, I quite understand your frustration. Personally I think it would be great if, say, 'British and Irish Isles' would replace the term. For an Irishman to be told by some ignorant American tourist that his country is in the British Isles and is somehow linked to the entity that Ireland struggled so long to be independent of must be toothgrindingly frustrating. But Wikipedia is here to represent present day useage of terms, not to act as a pressure-group for changes in use of those terms (however justified those changes might be). --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 23:12, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I don't really have much of a problem with the term (much as this may surprise you), it doesn't offend me, however I don't use it because I believe it to be a misnomer. In Ireland the reality is that the term is rarely used and does cause offence to many people. As you state: <i>Wikipedia is here to represent present day useage of terms</i>, presently the term is not used (mainly because of its political connotations) in Ireland and this should be reflected to a much greater extent in the article. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 23:29, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem though, is that Wikipedia is <i>not</i> written for an Irish (or British, or American) audiene. It's an international project with a worldwide audience. The article already does state, quite clearly, that the term is controversial or offensive to some in Ireland, and is rarely used here. Nonetheless, the rest of the world <i>does</i> use it, and uses it to mean 'the two big islands of the coast of mainland Europe, and lots of the little islands around them'. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 23:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would imagine that much more commonly used terms to refer to the archipelago as a whole are: Britain &amp; Ireland; and UK &amp; Ireland. For instance Lonely Planet uses UK &amp; Ireland when referring to the archipelago. Of course they are factually inaccurate but one could argue that British Isles is aswell, and factaul inaccuracy does not mean that these terms are not used. These alternatively used terms are given no prominence in the article. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 00:07, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To many people the British Isles do not include Ireland, and that's a fact of life that some British Wikipedians find difficult to grasp. So the British Isles is really a whole load of POV. If one is British, they are likely to include Ireland. If one is Irish, they are very very likely to exclude Ireland. And the rest of the world doesn't give a 4x. How WP represents that reality is important in this instance. MelForbes 00:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The islands were not known by that term during prehistory. To use it to refer to that time appears to be an attempt at validating an objectionable term. The paragraph on prehistory requires modification; I believe that <i>islands</i> or <i>island-group</i> is nPoV and cannot understand the difficulty with this more accurate change. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 18:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC) <i>Addendum</i> The fact that geographical terms are used to refer to prehistory in other wikipedia articles is not really relevant to this one, as this article concerns a contentious term that is not merely viewed as geographical e.g. the Channel Islands are included in this so-called geographical term by the States of Jersey government, yet they are not geographically part of the archipelago. That's political, maybe cultural, but certainly not geographical. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 19:01, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Iolar - No term was known by a present-day name during pre-history. The logic of your position is that no names should be used for anything when referring to pre-historic times. This is obviously absurd. Have a look at the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> article: "Ireland was mostly ice-covered and joined by land to Britain and continental Europe during the last ice age." Do you object to this too? You should, if your position is based on logic rather than POV.</dd>
<dd>All geographical terms are contentious and political. The States of Jersey has no power to define the British Isles. Nor does the British or Irish government. Nobody has the power to define the British Isles, as it is not a legal or offical term. It is a geographic label, and whether or not it is applied to Sark, or Rockall, or the Goodwin Sands, is essentially a matter of pedantry. Look at Europe: its eastern boundary is essentially arbitrary (political, cultural and hotly contested) yet few would deny it is a geographic term.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 20:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for this whole geographical political thing; I'm afraid, Iolar, that there is no more basic truth to geography than to say that all geographical terms are political. The fact is that the term can be used in BOTH a geographical and political way; but, in reality, these are not two things that can be seperated from each other into nicely portioned boxes anyway.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pretani</span></h2>
<p>The problem with <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretani.html" title="Pretani">Pretani</a> is that there were very few of them in Ireland, and <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pytheas.html" title="Pytheas">Pytheas</a> was referring to the Pretani around Cornwall. The article gives the impression that the Pretani were dominant in both <i>"Britain and Ireland"</i>, which is not correct. The ref, "Isles of the Prettanike", even though it's 3500 years old and <i>dug up</i>, is a false description, especially concerning Ireland where the q-Celtic (Gaelic) culture was dominant, whereas Britain was p-Celtic, and it was not a culturally homogeneous area. Can anyone better this paragraph? MelForbes 09:32, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Political Useage of the Term</span></h2>
<p>Certain editors clearly have an agenda when it comes to political useage of the term and are attempting to circumvent this reality. The term <b>is</b> used politically and to claim that it is not, or to allude to it not being used in this way, either by stating that the term is <i>purely geographical</i> or via an ommission is blatant PoV. Everytime evidence of political useage of the term is produced the goalposts are substantially moved. It appears that the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burden_of_proof.html" title="Burden of proof">burden of proof</a> is much greater to show evidence of political use than it is for so-called geographical useage. How does anybody know that an organisation is using the term in a geographical sense and not a political sense? The addition of the disclaimer: <i>The British Isles is a geographical term</i> means absolutely nothing if the organisation using same has been culturally and/or politically influenced to use it, just as I (as an Irish person) have been politically and culturally influenced not to use the term the <i>British</i> Isles. I am reverting the article to state that the Channel Islands are sometimes included by political convention. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 16:38, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because something is used on a political website doesn't mean its use is political. The statement "Kent is located to the southeast of London" isn't a political usage, and neither is the usage on the site of "Jersey is the most southerly island of the British Isles". It's a simple geographic usage, like saying Great Britain is in Europe, or Canada is in the northern hemisphere. There is quite a difference between something being used as a term by a political body and a term being used as political. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:07, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Technically Mel is correct as it is used in the <i>The Education (Listed Bodies) Order, 1997 (UK)</i> when referring to a theological 3rd level institution that contains the term "British Isles," but I don't think it has been contained in any UK statutes as a term, legal; political; geographical or otherwise since, I believe the <i>Interpretation Act, 1978</i> was implemented. However, the Isle of Man government uses it in official government addresses, which it could be argued is further evidence of political useage, as addresses are political constructions rather than geographic. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 00:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the most likely explanation is that the person writing the website was not aware of the grey areas around the boundaries of the term 'British Isles' (it is an obscure topic to say the least, and a pretty meaningless one as the term does not denote any status other than geographic) and used it mistakenly. Possibly they confused it with British Islands. As you will know, the terminology for this island group is famously confusing. There are many possible explanations, and it is pretty pointless to speculate on them. But I think that to suppose that the front page of the Jersey governmental information portal is being used to demonstrate that there is a political convention in the Channel Islands that they should be included in the label 'British Isles' in the next edition of school atlases is pretty unlikely. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a>22:30, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The Channel Isles flit into and out of definitions of the British Isles: their inclusion does not necessarily imply soem sort of political scheme. In the original English (language) reference to the British Isles (Peter Heylin's <i>Microcosmus</i>, a piece of historical geography), they were included, but only because Heylin could not think of where else to put them (he says this). Just to remind everyone, he used the name 'British Isles' after the ancient Britons, not to make some sort of imperialistic point (which he was only too glad to make elsewhere): its coining, at least, is therefore not a misnomer, and as yet there are no references to its use as a political term in the way that it implies some sort of modern British sovereignty over the whole island group. I would have thought it would be possible to dig something up- anyone looked at DUP stuff? By the way, it's not a legal term so there is going to be a variety usage and definitions.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, the Faroe Islands are not included because there is no overlap with the rest of the isles geologically, naturally, culturally, or politically. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 22:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody has stated that political useage implies a political scheme, did Heylin not think to include them as geographic parts of France? That would be the first place that I would think of, primarily because that's where they are, but being a mere lawyer, geography is clearly beyond me. Again, just because someone claims (or even believes) that they are using the term in a geographical sense does not make it so. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 22:50, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that the article currently states: 'The term British Isles is in widespread use, and is defined as "Great Britain and Ireland and adjacent islands". However the term carries additional meanings; political, economic, cultural, geopolitical, legal and cultural'</p>
<p>I actually wonder what anyone's problem is? There it is in plain English - the term is political/but also geographical (and others). --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 07:06, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That statement is buried in the article, the average person's attention span wouldn't be long enough to reach the point where it is raised. Up until that point one is led to believe that it is a mere, inoccuous geographic term which clearly circumvents the reality of the situation. Just as the reality that the Channel Islands are included by <i>political convention</i> has been circumvented, and the Faroes have been left out because as MAG1 says there is no <i>political</i> overlap. The sentence also has factual problems; it isn't a legal term and carries no legal meanings, as the Irish government has stated. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 11:10, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Before the article proper even starts, there's a note saying "The term "British Isles" can be confusing and is objectionable to some people, particularly in Ireland [1]. See the Terminology section below for details of the controversy." So readers are alerted <b>immediately</b> to the 'controversy', get a footnote outlining aspects of it and a whole section discussing the terminology, suggested alternatives in use and not, whys and wherefores... That's <b>plenty</b> of advertisment, for those who are seeking info on the 'controversy', or those who aren't but who stumble on it and find it interesting. And those just seeking info on the generality of the British Isles can ignore that (or not, as they see fit) and read the rest of article. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 12:16, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's face some facts here. If one is Irish, then Ireland is not included. If one is Northern Irish (e.g. a Unionist), then Ireland is included. Both sets of people live on the island of Ireland, and somehow both sets must be accommodated. That's where the wording of the article comes into play. To say Ireland is included is a POV to many, and to say it is not included is a POV to others. It must be remembered that Ireland is not a British Isle. But some would argue that Northern Ireland is British, and others would argue strongly against that view. Therefore my position is that Ireland is sometimes included, depending on ones <i>point of view</i>, and that the term first of all is a political term, and secondly a geographical term. To say it's not political is indulging in POV too. MelForbes 14:01, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">British perspectives regarding Ireland's inclusion in the term</span></h2>
<p>Apparently, The Rt Hon. David Lloyd George didn't agree that Ireland was included in the term the <i>British</i> Isles during his time as prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain <b>and Ireland</b> when he wrote the follwing to Éamon de Valera in 1921: "The geographical propinquity of Ireland to the British Isles is a fundamental fact." For those of you unfamiliar with the word <i>propinquity</i>, it doesn't mean <i>constituent of</i>, <i>part of</i> or <i>inclusion in.</i> <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 01:01, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We've had this before. Lloyd George - the "Welsh Wizard" - was a wily old politician, and if he chooses to use what even in those days was a rare word like "propinquity" he is obviously doing so for a very good reason (hint: who is he writing to?). Propinquity does indeed carry connotations of spatial proximity, but it <i>also</i> carries connotations of kinship and identity. In short, Lloyd George was being deliberately ambiguous. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 08:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>Propinquity</i> still does not imply that he believed Ireland to be a part of the <i>British</i> Isles. There is no ambiguity there. It can mean <i>proximity</i> or <i>kinship</i> but not <i>part of</i>. Anyway, how can the term be used to refer to Northern Ireland excluding the republic, at such time is the republic floating around the Pacific? When Lloyd George used the quote in question the republic didn't exist, thus he was referring to the island of Ireland. I am thus modifying the introduction to reflect this; the quote is easily referenced it's from an article calle <i>"The doctrine of self-determination and the Irish move to independence, 1916-1922"</i> by Bill Kissane (Dept of Government, London School of Economics), <i>Journal of Political Ideologies</i>. When I attempted to reference it in the article, it distorted it and it was unreadable. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 10:54, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an Irish man whos lived in Britan for a few years I can say that this question never arrises to 99.99% of Britons. They don't care and have only a very vague knowledge of Ireland's existance at all, north or south. Before this I lived in Moscow, where it was hard to find someone who had heard of Ireland at all. They look at you confused and can't hear the difference between 'Ireland' and 'island'. I once saw a bureau de change selling "Iclandic Punt and Irish Kronar". My language teacher, an educated woman, point blank - would not accept that the Rebublic of Ireland was not part of the UK. She had learned it was in school. It made me think: What do we know about 'West Timor'. This whole issue of the British Isles is really very silly. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 14:39, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that's unfair and untrue. How can it be that most Britons hardly know of Ireland's existence, when we have been bombarded with almost daily news reports of violence and killings there for the best part of 40 years? Furthermore, the Irish population living in England is large, widespread, and integrated into the general community - in short, there are Irish people everywhere. There are also countless Irish people in the British media, ranging from comedians to politicians. I hasten to suggest that as far as most English people are concerned, the Irish are just as "foreign" or "alien" as the Scots or Welsh - i.e., not at all (and regardless of whether the feeling is mutual or not). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 15:25, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From my experience, British people (not just English) do know of a place called Ireland, and know it is somehow connected to terrorism, but honestly, that is where their interest and knowledge ends. This even includes people of Irish descent in Britan. I'm constantly running into 'Irish' people here who know nothing except that their father/grandfather/uncle came from 'Ireland'. Where in Ireland? When did they leave? Don't know. I was once verbally assaulted in a pub in London by an 'Irish' guy who complained that I used to bomb them, and now 'the towel heads' do. Geographical knowledge is not a strong point here. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Lord Seabhcán of Baloney</a> 15:40, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not quite sure what the problem is here. You appear to believe that by showing "political" usage of the term British Isles, you can somehow invalidate the whole concept. Not so - the term exists in English, and has a specific meaning. It means Great Britain and Ireland, plus surrounding islands. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 23:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you, it is a concept. The concept of the "British Isles" to include Ireland is only held by a few people nowadays, and those people are usually British. That concept is no longer recognised by general world opinion. And that's fact. MelForbes 00:43, 21 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bollocks, really. You want this to be the result, but the fact is that there are a bunch of islands to the west of continental Europe, and the only common name they have ever had historically is British Isles. They've had that name since long long long before the United Kingdom existed. And there's no common <i>alternative</i> name for this bunch of islands that <i>has</i> taken root in the consciousness of English speakers, or anyone else for that matter. And the term is not political, and has nothing to do with Irish dependence or independence. Indeed, the vituperativeness of the "British Isles cannot refer to Ireland" crowd is pretty darned ridiculous. Ireland's sovereignty is not threatened by the common use of the term "British Isles". Your (collective) POV is extrordinarily tiresome. This argument adds no value to the Wikipedia. I live in Ireland and am not a stooge for "British Imperialism". But this whole war is waged on the basis of a selective interpretation of linguistic facts. "British" means a lot of things. "British Isles" does not mean "Islands belonging to the United Kingdom". -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 01:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term "British <i>Isle</i>" is incorrect, and is never used. "British Isles" is only ever found in plural form.

My point stands: in standard English, one does not say that "Britain is a British Isle", "Ireland is a British Isle", or "Iona is a British Isle"; the term isn't used in the singular. The term "the British Isles" refers to the whole grouping of thousands of islands, two of which are particularly large. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 12:58, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

What distinction you make by labelling Thar as "English" and Bastun as "British" is obscure to me, but as far as I can see, you are the one who maintains that only a True Irish Editor can contribute reliably to this article. As a member of the community of speakers of the English language worldwide, only 4 million live in Ireland. Your <i>unsubstantiated</i> statement that <i>the concept of the "British Isles" to include Ireland is only held by a few people nowadays, and those people are usually British</i> is decidedly unproven, and is extraordinarily unlikely. Felicitous or infelicitous in light of the political history between the two islands, the term <b>British Isles</b> is the only commonly used term to designate the thousands of islands in this area.

<dl>
<dd>I've made no personal attack, regardless of your suggestion. It is not a question of "understanding grammar". It is a question of understanding the common denotation and usage of words. The term "British Isles" is used as a collective noun, referring to thousands of bits of turf, two of which are quite large indeed. The term "British Isle" in the singular is <b>not</b> standard English usage. The question <i>Which British Isle was he born in?</i> is not a sensible question. Questions that make sense in the <i>usual way</i> in which these terms are used in English are "On which of the islands in the British Isles was he born?" In this sense "the British Isles" is a simple collective, like "the Philippines". "On which of the islands in the Philippines was he born?" But "Which British Isle was he born in?" is not perfectly good English. -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a>·<a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEvertype_12bd.html" title="User talk:Evertype">✆</a> 22:45, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A personal attack? Of course you don't agree! I see you have misrepresented what I wrote by adding an "s" to "isle" in your quotation, well you don't fool me, thank you. You seem to have assumed upon yourself to be the authority on how one might use the word "isle". Simply, you don't have that authority on how the word "isle" is used, sorry! <i>Which British isle was he born in?</i> is perfectly good English, sorry again! Just because someone with your superior knowledge does not use it, does not mean that the ordinary mortal is wrong in using that wordage. <i>The Philippines</i> is very poor analogy as the word "isle" is not attached to that term, and how is one to know (without prior knowledge), that the Philippines are a bunch of islands.

<dd>The word "isle" is not a collective noun, but the term "British Isles" most certainly is. If you say "a British isle" (note that "isle" here is uncapitalised, unlike in your previous posts) you could be referring to anything ranging from Bermuda to Pitcairn. This is because "isle", on its own, carries connotations of smallness. It would be a distortion of the language to call Great Britain "a British isle". And even when referring to Bermuda or Pitcairn, I suggest that most people would simply use "island" anyway, as "isle" has a somewhat archaic feel to it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 08:46, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah. Take a vote in Dingle on whether they consider themselves part of the BRITISH Isles! (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 09:02, 23 October 2006 (UTC))</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">British Isles in Irish</span></h2>
<p>This may have been covered befored - there was a brief period where we were looking at other languages - but is there a term for the British Isles in Irish? I'm not trying to prove/disprove anything by brigning this up, I'm just intrigued. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a bit in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> on this. Perhaps it could be included in this article (though I suppose that would generate another few GigaBytes of discussion)&#160;;) Rhion 10:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest, I wouldn't refer to the islands by one name in any language. The most common term in Irish would probably be: "<i>An Bhreatain agus Éire</i>," which is also the most commonly used term in English but funnily enough receives no mention in the article. It means "<i>Britain and Ireland</i>." There is another term which would be less commonly used and is <i>Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa</i>, it translates as <b>West European Islands</b>. Obviously, one could translate the misnomer into Irish as <i>Oileáin Bhriotanacha</i>, however I have never seen this phrase used. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 14:58, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The phrase "Britain and Ireland" is not a name, but two names put together in a normal sentence. In fact, I think "UK and Ireland" is a lot more common. It's like saying that North America is <i>also known as</i> "USA and Canada". As for "Anglo-Celtic Isles", I'd like to see some <i>very secure</i> references for that one, because I've never come across it outside Wikipedia, and suspect that it's just made up. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 16:35, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For those too lazy to check:</dd>
<dd>In Irish, the term <i>Oileáin Bhriotanacha</i> is attested as a version of the English term 'British Isles'. The 1937 book <i>Tír-Eóluíocht na h-Éireann</i> ('The Geography of Ireland') by T. J. Dunne, translated by Toirdhealbhach Ó Raithbheartaigh and published in Dublin by the Government Publications Office, states: <i>Tá Éire ar cheann de na h-oileáin a dtugar na <b>h-Oileáin Bhreataineacha</b> ortha agus atá ar an taobh Thiar-Thuaidh de'n Eóraip. Tá siad tuairim a's ar chúig mhíle oileán ar fad ann. (<b>Oileánradh</b> an t-ainm a bheirtear ar áit ar bith i n-a bhfuil a lán oileán agus iad i n-aice a chéile mar seo.) Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór (Sasain, an Bhreatain Bheag, agus Alba) an dá oileán is mó de na h-Oileáin Bhreataineacha.</i> 'Ireland is one of the islands which are called the <b>British Isles</b> and which are on the North-Western side of Europe. It is thought that there are five thousand islands in total there. (<b>Archipelago</b> is the name which is borne by a place in which there are many islands next to each other like these.) Ireland and Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) are the two largest islands of the British Isles.'</dd>

<p>Mmm. Very interesting. I can only ever remember seeing <i>Na hOileáin Bhriotanacha</i> once, possibly from the same source. However, I work with the Irish language everyday and can attest, as can anyone working with the language that the term is never used in Irish, and if it is, it is so rarely used as to be negligible. The fact remains that that <i>Na hOileáin Bhriotanacha</i> is simply never heard or seen in print on a regular basis. Just because one author or one broadcaster, whether in Irish or English, decides to use this term does in no way mean that the term <i>British Isles</i> is used or deemed to be acceptable by the majority of the Irish people. 213.94.210.30 10:04, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Political intepretations aside, is there a term in Irish used to refer to the whole island group together? <a href="../../../b/a/z/User%7EBazza_7_060e.html" title="User:Bazza 7">Bazza</a> 13:56, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Political interpretations aside, no, there isn't an official, widely-used term in Irish referring to Ireland, Great Britain and surrounding islands as a geographic unit. I have the terminology database of An Coiste Téarmaíochta, the Terminology Committee of the Department of Education open in front of me and it has no official term conforming to "British Isles". I've also checked both Niall Ó Dónaill's and Dineen's Irish-English Dictionaries under "Breataineach", "Breatanach" and "Briotanach" to see if such a term as "Oileáin Bhriotanacha/Bhreataineacha" exists and have found nothing. Tomás de Bhaldraithe's English-Irish dictionary has no mention of "British Isles". However, under "oileán" (island) Dineen has "Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa, the British or West European Isles". The plates for this dictionary were laid out before 1904 when the first edition of the dictionary was published. Ireland back then, of course, was still ruled as a whole by the British. Ó Dónaill (1977) makes no mention of "Oileáin Iarthair Eorpa". <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Muimhneach_Machnamhach_62bf.html" title="User:An Muimhneach Machnamhach">An Muimhneach Machnamhach</a> 10:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
