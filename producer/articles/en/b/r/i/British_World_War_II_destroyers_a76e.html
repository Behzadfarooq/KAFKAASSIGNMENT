<p>British destroyer flotillas were formed from single classes, with a slightly adapted flotilla leader; the aim had been to produce a flotilla each year. As a broad summary, British destroyers developed from the successful <a href="../../../v/_/a/V_and_W_class_destroyer_9a6a.html" title="V and W class destroyer">V and W class destroyers</a> of World War I, increasing in complexity until World War II. The Royal Navy then needed new ships quickly to increase numbers, replace losses and exploit experience and so design became simplified and cheaper to produce, with greater anti-aircraft and anti-submarine power (<a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Emergency_Programme_destroyers_f4ca.html" title="War Emergency Programme destroyers">War Emergency Programme</a>).</p>
<p>British destroyer design had developed with incremental changes in the inter-war years, apart from the larger <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribal_class_destroyer_%281936%29.html" title="Tribal class destroyer (1936)">Tribal class destroyer</a> which was not repeated. In 1937, there was a radical change in destroyer design with the production of the more complex J, K and N classes and the modified Ls and Ms. It was deemed to be a successful design, but was discontinued in favour of the a simpler War Emergency Programme design.</p>
<p>Later in the war, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_class_destroyer.html" title="Battle class destroyer">Battle class destroyer</a> was developed, with a greatly enhanced anti-aircraft capability.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_World_War_II_destroyers_a76e.html" title="Edit section: Convoy escorts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Convoy escorts</span></h2>
<p>British practice had been to produce fleet destroyers and to relegate older vessels to escort duties. This was unsatisfactory for several reasons. Firstly, the fleet destroyers' power plants were designed for the higher speeds required of the naval fleet: they were inefficient when used for convoy speeds. Secondly, fleet destroyer range was inadequate and this was exacerbated at convoy speeds; significant adaptations were necessary. Thirdly, armament did not address the air and submarine threats to convoys and essential inclusions affected stability. Lastly, there were insufficient units and the urgent need was more for numbers rather than quality of build.</p>
<p>This need was initially met by adapting elderly destroyers from the Royal Navy and the United States Navy. The Hunt class escort destroyers, which were ordered from early 1939, were the first response by the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty.html" title="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> to the circumstances of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convoy.html" title="Convoy">convoy</a> escort, but they were really suitable for just North Sea and Mediterranean service. Later, new types of vessel were built for escort work in the North Atlantic - Flower and Castle class corvettes, River, Loch and Bay class frigates and <i>Black Swan</i> class sloops.</p>
<p><a name="Weapon_systems" id="Weapon_systems"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_World_War_II_destroyers_a76e.html" title="Edit section: Weapon systems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Weapon systems</span></h2>
<p>The armament, naturally, reflected the changing circumstances of warfare and technological progress. At first, the destroyers were expected to escort, augment and protect the battle-line, that is, the capital ships. This was reflected in the emphasis on the installation and development of anti-ship weaponry - guns and torpedoes. As a result, the "legacy" and inter-war classes were deficient in anti-submarine (A/S) and anti-aircraft (A/A) weapon systems. The effect can be seen in the particularly high rate of loss to air attack in the early war years.</p>
<p>Attempts to resolve this resulted in both improved new ship designs and in modifications to existing ships. A/A weapons were improved in number, power and fire control, with some classes equipped with main armament capable of A/A use, even at the expense of reduced <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliber.html" title="Caliber">calibre</a>. Secondary armament progressed from largely ineffective batteries of machine-guns and <a href="../../../q/f/_/QF_2_pounder_naval_gun_4370.html" title="QF 2 pounder naval gun">pom-poms</a> to <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors.html" title="Bofors">Bofors</a> and <a href="../../../o/e/r/Oerlikon_Contraves_53a8.html" title="Oerlikon Contraves">Oerlikon</a> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocannon.html" title="Autocannon">rapid-fire cannon</a>, sometimes at the expense of torpedo tubes. Some classes were fitted with a single 3-inch AA gun, but this was unsatisfactory and discontinued. Effectiveness was further improved by improvements in fire control, such as the adoption of the Dutch Hazemeyer system.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of war, A/S weapons were limited to the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depth_charge.html" title="Depth charge">depth charge</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar.html" title="Sonar">ASDIC</a> (sonar). The weaknesses of this combination had been known before the start of the war, but the development of a replacement - the ahead-throwing weapon - had not been advanced with much urgency. The <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedgehog_%28weapon%29.html" title="Hedgehog (weapon)">Hedgehog</a> spigot mortar arrived in early 1943 and was fitted in older destroyers converted for convoy escort work. Hedgehog was followed by the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squid_%28weapon%29.html" title="Squid (weapon)">Squid</a> mortar later in the same year. Although it was trialled on <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Ambuscade_%28D38%29_afdd.html" title="HMS Ambuscade (D38)">HMS <i>Ambuscade</i></a>, it was rushed into service in <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_class_corvette.html" title="Castle class corvette">Castle-class corvettes</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_class_frigate.html" title="Loch class frigate">Loch-class frigates</a> and few destroyers received this weapon before the cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>The effectiveness against surface threats was improved by new guns and the introduction of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar.html" title="Radar">radar</a>. Radar, in particular, gave British destroyers a decisive advantage such as in night actions against the Italian <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regia_Marina_e403.html" title="Regia Marina">Regia Marina</a>, enabling clear victories at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cape_Bon_3752.html" title="Battle of Cape Bon">Cape Bon</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Tarigo_Convoy_7ffb.html" title="Battle of the Tarigo Convoy">off Sfax</a>. Gun mountings were developed to provide high angle, anti-aircraft capability and all round gun houses.</p>

<p>It is impractical to give detail here of the entirety of British destroyer actions during the war. British destroyers were engaged in the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans; the North and Mediterranean seas. Of the 389 British destroyers involved in the war, 144 were destroyed <sup><a href="http://www.lemaire.happyhost.org/ship/classe1/724.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lemaire.happyhost.org/ship/classe1/724.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup>. They were used to defend and escort convoys and the fleet, to perform aggressive operations against enemy merchant and naval ships, to act as transports and to deliver bombardments in support of armies. Here, however, is a sample of significant and famous actions:</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../v/_/a/V_and_W_class_destroyer_9a6a.html" title="V and W class destroyer">V and W class destroyers</a> had been ordered from 1916 onwards in response to increasing German specifications and to provide vessels capable of operating in poor weather with the fleet. By year's end, 25 Vs and 25 Ws had been ordered. Compared with the earlier M and R classes, the Vs and Ws were larger with better <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeboard.html" title="Freeboard">freeboard</a> and increased armament, initially four or five four-inch gun mountings and four or six torpedo tubes.</p>
<p>It was learnt that the Germans would mount five inch guns, so the 4.7 inch was adopted for sixteen further ships that were ordered in 1918, the "modified V &amp; Ws".</p>
<p>Although still in service in the 1930s, these were no longer frontline units, but necessity saw thirty-nine adapted for escort duties in World War II.</p>

<p>The fifty <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_class_destroyer.html" title="Town class destroyer">Town class destroyers</a> were elderly American destroyers transferred to the Royal Navy and the Canadian and Norwegian navies in an Anglo-American "ships-for-bases" deal that preceded <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lend-Lease_1d38.html" title="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a>.

<p>From 1930, the Royal Navy commissioned one destroyer flotilla each year, at first with eight ships plus a slightly larger flotilla leader. Additional ships were built as required for sale abroad. The convention was to assign a letter to each class, ships' names starting with that letter, except for the leader.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Amazon_%28D39%29_1ef2.html" title="HMS Amazon (D39)">HMS <i>Amazon</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Ambuscade_%28D38%29_afdd.html" title="HMS Ambuscade (D38)">HMS <i>Ambuscade</i></a> were launched in 1926 and they were the prototypes for the following nine classes (A to I) launched between 1929 and 1941. The classes J to N, 40 ships launched between 1938 and 1940, were more complex, with heavier armament and expensive to build. The pattern was cut short by the need for numbers of basic ships arising from the hard lessons of war.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribal_class_destroyer.html" title="Tribal class destroyer">Tribal class destroyers</a> broke with the incremental evolution of the inter-war classes. They were larger ships designed to match the heavier destroyers built by several other navies.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_class_destroyer.html" title="A class destroyer">A class</a> was the first full class of the inter-war years and reckoned to be a successful design for theit time.

Eight were lost during the war.</p>
<p>They displaced 1,350 tons and they could attain 35 knots. Main armament was four 4.7 inch QF Mark IX guns, in single mounts, and eight 21 inch torpedo tubes. Anti-aircraft weaponry consisted of one of the unsatisfactory 3 inch Mark II 20cwt QF gun and two <a href="../../../q/f/_/QF_2_pounder_naval_gun_4370.html" title="QF 2 pounder naval gun">2-pounder Mark II pom pom</a> guns.

<p>They were only slightly larger than the A class, 1360 tons (standard). The original kit of four 4.7 inch and eight 21-inch torpedo tubes was reduced before the start of the war to three and four respectively, to boost anti-submarine (ASW) capability.

<p>Another pair of flotillas, the <a href="../../../g/_/a/G_and_H_class_destroyer_1472.html" title="G and H class destroyer">G and H class destroyers</a> continued the gentle evolution of the design with a revised engine room layout.

One ship was transferred to Canada. Five survived the war. One of the Greek ships was captured by the Germans and used by them in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The six requisitioned Brazilian ships are sometimes referred to as the <i>Havant</i> class. The Brazilians subsequently built their own, the Acre class destroyers, based on the H class but with five-inch guns supplied by the United States.</p>
<p>Two of the Hs had a modified bridge arrangement arising from the use of a new and taller gun mounting. The new design became the standard.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../j/%2C/_/J%2C_K_and_N_class_destroyer_e725.html" title="J, K and N class destroyer">J, K and N class destroyers</a> were a new destroyer design, larger and more powerfully armed than their predecessors. Twenty-four vessels were ordered, in three eight ship flotillas, built between 1937 and 1942.</p>
<p>The standard displacement was increased from around 1350 tons (classes A to I) to around 1700 tons, length by 30 feet to more than 355. The engine room layout was made more compact, despite vulnerability to complete engine failure by a single well-placed hit. The basic strength of these ships was derived through longitudinal members instead of the earlier transverse ones. The design was deemed sturdy, compact and successful and provided the basis for the following classes.</p>
<p>The four single 4.7 inch guns were increased to three twin mountings (originally four twins), and two five tube banks of torpedo tubes. The anti-aircraft weaponry wes not significantly improved, however, and this was a serious flaw. In 1940 and 1941, the anti-aircraft establishment was increased in all ships. Their after torpedo tubes were landed and replaced with a single 4 inch gun on a high angle mounting. The ineffective 0.5 inch machine guns were replaced with single 20 mm Oerlikon guns, and another pair were added on the searchlight platform, amidships. Further modifications took place in 1942, upgrading the single Oerlikons and reinstating the aft torpedo tubes. The radar installations were frequently enhanced during the ships' service.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_class_destroyer.html" title="Battle class destroyer">Battle class destroyers</a> were designed to provide improved anti-aircraft defence on a platform with improved stability. The early war years had exposed the weakness of the inter-war designs in this respect and there had been serious losses to air attack. As a result, the "Battles" were significantly larger (effectively successors to the Tribals) and incorporated stabilisers; the main battery was four 4.5 inch guns on two twin <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_ordnance_terms.html" title="British ordnance terms">high angle</a> (HA) mountings, supported by fourteen <a href="../../../4/0/_/40_mm_Bofors_c35c.html" title="40 mm Bofors">40 mm Bofors</a> <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocannon.html" title="Autocannon">cannons</a>. The superstructure was so arranged as to maximise the fields of fire.</p>
<p>The design authorised for 1942 was actively debated even after construction had been started. As a result later ships were sufficiently modified to form a separate sub-class - the "1943 Battle class". In addition, two enlarged ships were ordered, with a rearranged engine room layout and capacity for a third twin 4.5 inch turret.</p>
<p>Two eight ship flotillas were ordered of the original "1942" design and four flotillas of the later "1943" design. In the event, construction and completion were slow, due in part to the unavailability of equipment. As the outcome of the war became assured, the need for warships declined and the numbers of the two Battle types was reduced to a total of twenty-four ships. Only one saw action in the Pacific.</p>
