<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Bears_6517.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>In 1986, the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">VFL</a> Commission announced plans to set up privately owned clubs based in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Western_Australia_3c92.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, motivated by the need to sell multimillion-dollar licences to save a number of Victorian clubs which were struggling financially. A consortium headed by former actor Paul Cronin and bankrolled by entrepreneur <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Skase_8c0d.html" title="Christopher Skase">Christopher Skase</a> was controversially awarded the licence. Not long afterwards, the club was officially announced as the Brisbane Bears, signing recently-retired <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorn_Football_Club_2b9f.html" title="Hawthorn Football Club">Hawthorn</a> player <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Knights_125c.html" title="Peter Knights">Peter Knights</a> as coach, and unveiling an innovative playing strip consisting of a gold with a maroon yoke and a triangular "BB" logo intended to represent a stylised map of the clubs home state, Queensland, with the outline of a <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koala.html" title="Koala">koala</a> head appearing inside of the larger B.</p>
<p>The choice of the koala as a mascot and moniker was often mocked and tagged tacky as the Australian marsupial animal is typically sedate and hardly ferocious. Despite this, the bear appeared roaring on many of the marketing and promotional materials for the side, including the club's official VFL logo <a href="http://www.footystamps.com/bb_gold_coast.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.footystamps.com/bb_gold_coast.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. However, regardless of such marketing, the team's poor on-field performances in the first 7 years allowed the bears mascot to be targeted gratuitously, with nicknames like "The Bad News Bears" and "The Carrara Koalas".</p>
<p>The new club was given very little time in which to set itself up, with few players and no home ground. No venue in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> was suitable (the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Cricket_Ground_dd74.html" title="Brisbane Cricket Ground">Gabba</a> was encircled by a greyhound track at the time) and so the Bears based themselves at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrara_Oval_c1c8.html" title="Carrara Oval">Carrara Oval</a>, an hour's drive south-east of Brisbane on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a>. Temporary stands, club rooms and facilities were hastily erected on the slopes surrounding the field.</p>
<p>Carrara was very convenient for Christopher Skase, now acknowledged as the owner of the club. To Skase, the Bears were another outpost in his media and leisure empire which also included the Mirage resorts (one of which was very close to Carrara) and the TV0 television station (later sold to acquire the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven Network</a>), official broadcasters of the VFL.</p>
<p>Unlike their fellow new boys, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Coast_Eagles_14b7.html" title="West Coast Eagles">West Coast Eagles</a>, the Bears did not have a large reserve of local players from which to draw on, and so the VFL arranged for every other club to provide at least two players. Understandably, other clubs were averse to providing topline players and few of the players provided were of any use. Indeed, some of them had long-term injuries and one or two had already announced their retirement. Skase opened his chequebook and the Bears pursued a number of stars aggressively. They were rewarded with a few key signings, including <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood_Football_Club_b05a.html" title="Collingwood Football Club">Collingwood</a>'s captain <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Williams_%28AFL_footballer_and_coach%29_3207.html" title="Mark Williams (AFL footballer and coach)">Mark Williams</a>, and 1985 <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Brownlow Medal">Brownlow Medallist</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Hardie_b5d2.html" title="Brad Hardie">Brad Hardie</a>. However a significant proportion of the player list was recruited from the <a href="../../../s/a/n/SANFL_91a2.html" title="SANFL">SANFL</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Australian_Football_League_7e37.html" title="West Australian Football League">WAFL</a> and was unused to playing football at this level.</p>
<p>As a result, there was general surprise if not shock when this rag-tag band of cast-offs, widely tipped to finish last, won their first game against <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroos_Football_Club_6c61.html" title="Kangaroos Football Club">North Melbourne</a> at the <a href="../../../m/c/g/MCG_3bc3.html" title="MCG">MCG</a> in the first round of 1987. They also won their second game, against <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geelong_Football_Club_e3ed.html" title="Geelong Football Club">Geelong</a> at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skilled_Stadium_3b36.html" title="Skilled Stadium">Kardinia Park</a>, leading to much optimism. After 5 rounds they had won 3 games. However, as the season progressed the players' inexperience became more and more apparent, sliding to the bottom of the ladder by round 20. In the final round they won a playoff with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_Football_Club_fabd.html" title="Richmond Football Club">Richmond</a> to avoid the wooden spoon in their first season, finishing with 6 wins.</p>
<p>The club again recruited aggressively, landing <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essendon_Football_Club_46a8.html" title="Essendon Football Club">Essendon</a>'s enforcer <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Merrett_c4c5.html" title="Roger Merrett">Roger Merrett</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Swans_645f.html" title="Sydney Swans">Sydney</a>'s glamour spearhead <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warwick_Capper_4cc9.html" title="Warwick Capper">Warwick Capper</a>. However, the Bears failed to learn the lessons taught during their first season. In 1988 and 1989, the club suffered some severe beatings and Knights was sacked with eight rounds to play in 1989. Club psychologist <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Feltham_d768.html" title="Paul Feltham">Paul Feltham</a> took charge of the team for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>The club was also under severe financial pressure. Attendance had been very poor due to the diabolical performance of the team and the travel required to get to Carrara. The collapse of Skase's business empire and his sudden departure for Spain in late 1989 almost resulted in the death of the Bears. Over the ensuing preseason the players threatened strike action, but Cronin resigned, the club was taken over by the AFL, re-sold to Gold Coast businessman Reuben Pelerman, and the crisis was averted. With former Fitzroy player Norm Dare appointed coach, the club battled on.</p>
<p>The near-loss of the club appeared to galvanise the AFL into action. Having almost killed the club through neglect, the AFL now spent significant amounts of money to help the Bears. The club was provided with priority draft picks and special recruiting zones to give it access to some of the nation's best talent, which over the next few years allowed the club to recruit future stars such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Voss_4868.html" title="Michael Voss">Michael Voss</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Akermanis_b2df.html" title="Jason Akermanis">Jason Akermanis</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Keating_2ae0.html" title="Clark Keating">Clark Keating</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Lawrence_0371.html" title="Steven Lawrence">Steven Lawrence</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darryl_White_f441.html" title="Darryl White">Darryl White</a>.</p>
<p>Former premiership coach <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Walls_1f9c.html" title="Robert Walls">Robert Walls</a> was installed as coach for the 1991 season and immediately set about getting rid of the dead wood around the club. Having inherited the oldest list in the league, by the end of the season he had the youngest. He insisted that the Bears not bend over to the will of powerful Victorian clubs in recruitment matters, particularly in the case of young Northern Territorian <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Buckley_eb1a.html" title="Nathan Buckley">Nathan Buckley</a>. At the time of his recruitment, Buckley was clearly the best player in the country not playing in the AFL, and his signing was a coup for the club. Signed on a one-year contract, his manager stipulated that he would be released to the club of his choice if he so desired at the completion of the contract. At the end of the contract he was cleared to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood_Football_Club_b05a.html" title="Collingwood Football Club">Collingwood</a> as he had requested, but not without suitable compensation in the form of premiership centre-half forward <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Starcevich_ddbf.html" title="Craig Starcevich">Craig Starcevich</a>, goalsneak Troy Lehmann and an early draft pick which the Bears used to snare future star <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_M._Scott_0737.html" title="Chris M. Scott">Chris Scott</a>.</p>
<p>Things were changing off-field too. Pelerman, who was losing millions of dollars annually on the club, agreed to release the Bears from private ownership and revert to a traditional club structure in which the club's members were able to elect the board. In 1992, the club ditched its ridiculed "BB" teddy-bear jumper in favour of a predominantly maroon strip with a gold V and white trim. And more significantly, the Bears moved permanently to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Cricket_Ground_dd74.html" title="Brisbane Cricket Ground">Gabba</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> for the 1993 season and membership and attendances instantly tripled. The greyhound track around the ground was removed, the surface upgraded and the stands gradually replaced over the next few years with a view to converting the tired old ground to a state-of-the-art sporting facility.</p>
<p>However on-field results were still elusive. Although the Bears were now competitive, the club was underachieving. Walls announced his resignation halfway through the 1995 season, but committed himself to seeing out the year. By three-quarter time in round 16 the Bears were 45 points behind <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawthorn_Football_Club_2b9f.html" title="Hawthorn Football Club">Hawthorn</a>, third-last on the ladder and another mediocre placing seemed inevitable. Astoundingly, the Bears rallied to win the match by 7 points and won all bar one match for the rest of the home-and-away season to scrape into the finals for the very first time. The team was not disgraced to go down to eventual premiers <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Football_Club_f590.html" title="Carlton Football Club">Carlton</a> by 13 points in their first-ever final. A club that had become a laughing stock was beginning to find its feet.</p>
<p>Inspired by their barnstorming finish to the season, the Bears, now coached by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Northey_a281.html" title="John Northey">John Northey</a>, had an excellent 1996 season, culminating in two finals wins (both at the Gabba) and a loss in the Preliminary Final to eventual premiers North Melbourne. Michael Voss was awarded the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brownlow_Medal_2578.html" title="Brownlow Medal">Brownlow Medal</a>, sharing the honour with Essendon's <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hird_bbf9.html" title="James Hird">James Hird</a>.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, however, things were less rosy. The club was still struggling financially and was running out of opportunities to generate revenue. One of the Bears' biggest problems was its lack of support (both on and off the field) in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, the location of most of its away matches. When <a href="../../../f/i/t/Fitzroy_Football_Club_aa48.html" title="Fitzroy Football Club">Fitzroy</a> collapsed due to financial pressures an opportunity to alleviate that problem presented itself. Fitzroy needed to merge its assets with another club, and when a merger with North Melbourne failed to win the support of the other AFL clubs, the Bears stepped into the breach and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Lions_4cd4.html" title="Brisbane Lions">Brisbane Lions</a> were born. 1996 would be the last season for the Bears and Fitzroy as individual entities, however the histories and traditions of both would be carried into the future by the new merged entity.</p>
