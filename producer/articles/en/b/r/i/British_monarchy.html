<p>The <b>British monarch</b> or <b>Sovereign</b> is the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_state.html" title="Head of state">head of state</a> of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_overseas_territory.html" title="British overseas territory">British overseas territories</a>. The British monarch is also head of state of fifteen other countries, all of which were once part of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>—these, together with the UK, are known as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realm_4960.html" title="Commonwealth Realm">Commonwealth Realms</a>. The current British <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> can trace its ancestral lineage back to the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Anglo-Saxon_England_6756.html" title="History of Anglo-Saxon England">Anglo-Saxon period</a>, and ultimately back to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_kings_of_the_Angles_d2fc.html" title="List of kings of the Angles">kings of the Angles</a>. During the ninth century, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> came to dominate other kingdoms in England, especially as a result of the extinction of rival lines in England during the First <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking_Age_00e7.html" title="Viking Age">Viking Age</a>, and during the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_century.html" title="10th century">tenth century</a> <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_England_1e4c.html" title="Kingdom of England">England</a> was consolidated into a single realm. The <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Scotland_2d91.html" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> dates its inception to 843 and the reign of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland_269a.html" title="Kenneth I of Scotland">Cináed I</a>. The English and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Scotland_2d91.html" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Scots</a> crowns were united in the person of a single monarch in 1603 when <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James VI of Scots</a> acceded to the throne of England. The kingdoms themselves were joined in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_Union_1707_b9a1.html" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union 1707</a>, to form <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Great Britain</a>.</p>
<p>The powers of the monarchy, known as the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Prerogative_cb9c.html" title="Royal Prerogative">Royal Prerogative</a>, are still very extensive. Most prerogative powers are exercised not by the monarch personally, but by ministers acting on his or her behalf; examples such as the power to regulate the civil service and the power to issue passports. Some major powers are exercised nominally by the monarch herself, acting on the advice of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet</a>, and according to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_convention_%28political_custom%29.html" title="Constitutional convention (political custom)">constitutional convention</a>. An example is the power to dissolve Parliament. According to a parliamentary report,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> "The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers".</p>
<p>It has long been established in the uncodified <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom_ea17.html" title="Constitution of the United Kingdom">Constitution of the United Kingdom</a> that political power is ultimately exercised by the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom_dcaf.html" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a>, of which the Sovereign is a non-partisan component, along with the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, and by the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Thus, as the modern British monarchy is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional</a> one, the Sovereign's role is in practice limited to non-partisan functions (such as being the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fount_of_honour.html" title="Fount of honour">fount of honour</a>). This role has been recognised since the 19th century; <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Bagehot_7c50.html" title="Walter Bagehot">Walter Bagehot</a> identified the monarchy as the "dignified part" rather than the "efficient part" of government in <i>The English Constitution</i> (1867). In practice, political power is exercised today through Parliament and by the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The sovereign also holds the title of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England_4249.html" title="Supreme Governor of the Church of England">Supreme Governor</a> of the <a href="../../../e/s/t/Established_church.html" title="Established church">established</a> <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, although in practice the spiritual leadership of the Church is the responsibility of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.</p>
<p>The present sovereign is <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, who has reigned since <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. The <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">heir apparent</a> is her eldest son, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles, Prince of Wales</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Rothesay_3277.html" title="Duke of Rothesay">Duke of Rothesay</a>. The Prince of Wales undertakes various public ceremonial functions, as does the queen's husband, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>. There are several other members of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Royal_Family_853c.html" title="British Royal Family">Royal Family</a> besides those aforementioned, including the Queen's other children, grandchildren and cousins.</p>
<p>The British monarch is also <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_the_Commonwealth_6f6f.html" title="Head of the Commonwealth">Head of the Commonwealth</a>, and the same person is also separately monarch of 15 other <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realm_4960.html" title="Commonwealth Realm">Commonwealth Realms</a>; each nation—including the UK—being sovereign and independent of the others.</p>

<p>Following the Viking raids and settlement of the ninth century, the kingdom of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> emerged as the dominant English kingdom. <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_the_Great_636c.html" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> secured Wessex and achieved dominance over western <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercia.html" title="Mercia">Mercia</a>, but he did not become King of England; the nearest title he assumed was "King of the Anglo-Saxons". It was Alfred's successors of the tenth century who built the kingdom now recognised as England, though even by the reign of <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_of_England_d118.html" title="Edgar of England">Edgar the Peaceful</a> England was not beyond fracturing into its constituent parts. The eleventh century saw England become more stable, despite a number of wars with the Danes which resulted in a Danish monarchy for some years. When <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William, Duke of Normandy</a> conquered England in 1066 he became monarch of a kingdom with probably the strongest royal authority in Europe. The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Conquest_6c94.html" title="Norman Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> was crucial in British history, in terms of both political and social change. The new monarch continued the centralization of power begun in the Anglo-Saxon period, while the <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal_System_cc76.html" title="Feudal System">Feudal System</a> also continued to develop.</p>

<p>William I was succeeded by two of his sons: <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_II_of_England_5a49.html" title="William II of England">William II</a>, and then <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_I_of_England_5215.html" title="Henry I of England">Henry I</a>. Henry made a controversial decision to name his daughter <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Matilda_697d.html" title="Empress Matilda">Matilda</a> (his only surviving child) as his heir. Following Henry's death in 1135, one of William I's grandsons, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_of_England_b476.html" title="Stephen of England">Stephen</a>, laid claim to the Throne, and took power with the support of most of the barons. Stephen's weak rule, however, allowed Matilda to challenge his reign; as a result, England soon descended into a period of disorder known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Anarchy_89c8.html" title="The Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>. Stephen maintained a precarious hold on power for the rest of his life; however, he agreed to a compromise under which he would be succeeded by Matilda's son <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry</a>, who accordingly became the first monarch of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angevin.html" title="Angevin">Angevin</a> or <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenet.html" title="Plantagenet">Plantagenet</a> dynasty as Henry II in 1154.</p>
<p>The reigns of most of the Angevin monarchs were marred by civil strife and conflicts between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_I_of_England_89e8.html" title="Richard I of England">Richard I</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_England_14d6.html" title="John of England">John</a>. Nevertheless, Henry did manage to achieve an expansion of his empire; most notable was the conquest of Ireland, which had previously consisted of a multitude of rival kingdoms. Henry granted Ireland to his younger son John who ruled as "Lord of Ireland".</p>
<p>Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; Richard, however, was absent from England for most of his reign, as he was fighting the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a> in the <a href="../../../n/e/a/Near_East_da5f.html" title="Near East">Near East</a>. When Richard died, John succeeded him, thereby uniting England and Ireland under a single monarch. John's reign was marked by conflict with the barons, who in 1215 coerced him into issuing the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Carta_56fc.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "Great Charter") to guarantee the rights and liberties of the nobility. Soon afterwards, John repealed the charter, plunging England into a civil war known as the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Barons%27_War_be79.html" title="First Barons' War">First Barons' War</a>. The war came to an abrupt end after John died in 1216, leaving the Crown to his nine-year-old son <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III_of_England_cd17.html" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a>. The barons, led by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_de_Montfort%2C_6th_Earl_of_Leicester_8ad4.html" title="Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester">Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester</a>, again rebelled later in Henry's reign, beginning the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Barons%27_War_45b2.html" title="Second Barons' War">Second Barons' War</a>. The war, however, ended in a clear royalist victory, and in the execution of many rebels.</p>
<p>The next monarch, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_I_of_England_530d.html" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a>, was far more successful in maintaining royal power, and was responsible for the conquest of Wales and the attempt to establish English domination in Scotland. However, gains in Scotland were reversed during the reign of his successor, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_II_of_England_c4d9.html" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a>, who was also occupied with a disastrous conflict with the nobility. Edward II was, in 1311, forced to relinquish many of his powers to a committee of baronial "ordainers"; however, military victories helped him regain control in 1322. Nevertheless, in 1327, Edward was deposed and executed by his wife <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabella_of_France_d06b.html" title="Isabella of France">Isabella</a> and by his son, who became <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_III_of_England_1878.html" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a>. The new monarch soon also claimed the French Crown, setting off the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Years%27_War_fd8c.html" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a> between England and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. Edward III's campaigns were largely successful, and culminated in the conquest of much French territory. Edward's reign was also marked by the further development of Parliament, which came to be divided into two Houses for the first time. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his ten year-old grandson <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_II_of_England_5f00.html" title="Richard II of England">Richard II</a>. The new monarch, like many of his predecessors, conflicted with the nobles, especially by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, whilst he was away in Ireland, his cousin <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_IV_of_England_6f6d.html" title="Henry IV of England">Henry Bolingbroke</a> seized power; Richard was then forced to abdicate and was murdered.</p>
<p>Henry IV was the grandson of Edward III and the son of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Gaunt_2ed2.html" title="John of Gaunt">John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster</a>; hence, his dynasty was known as the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lancaster_3055.html" title="House of Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a>. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_V_of_England_d61f.html" title="Henry V of England">Henry V</a>. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Henry V was victorious in his conquest; however, his sudden death in 1422 left his infant son <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VI_of_England_8b59.html" title="Henry VI of England">Henry VI</a> on the Throne, and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule. The unpopularity of Henry's regents, and afterwards, Henry's own ineffectual leadership, led to the weakening of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard%2C_Duke_of_York_38d8.html" title="Richard, Duke of York">Richard, Duke of York</a>. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_IV_of_England_a1fe.html" title="Edward IV of England">Edward</a> led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, nevertheless, continued intermittently during the reigns of the Yorkists Edward IV, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_V_of_England_99e4.html" title="Edward V of England">Edward V</a>, and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_of_England_e98b.html" title="Richard III of England">Richard III</a>. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch, led by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_of_England_2c03.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry Tudor</a> (Henry VII), in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bosworth_Field_0ad8.html" title="Battle of Bosworth Field">Battle of Bosworth Field</a>.</p>

<p>The end of the Wars of the Roses formed a major turning point in the history of the monarchy. Much of the nobility was either decimated on the battlefield or executed for participation in the war, and many aristocratic estates were lost to the Crown. Moreover, feudalism was dying, and the feudal armies controlled by the barons became obsolete. Hence, the Tudor monarchs easily re-established absolute supremacy in the realm, and the conflicts with the nobility that had plagued previous monarchs came to an end. The power of the Crown reached its zenith during the reign of the second Tudor king, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>. Henry VIII's reign was one of great political change; England was transformed from a weak kingdom into one of the powers of Europe. Religious upheaval also occurred, as disputes with the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> led the monarch to break away from the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and to establish the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> (the Anglican Church). Another important result of Henry VIII's reign was the annexation of Wales (which had been conquered centuries earlier, but had remained a separate dominion) to England under the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535%E2%80%931542_22ce.html" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542">Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542</a>.</p>
<p>Henry VIII's son and successor, the young <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>, continued with further religious reforms. Edward VI died in 1553, precipitating a succession crisis. He was wary of allowing his Catholic elder half-sister <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a> to succeed to the Throne, and therefore drew up a will designating the <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Jane_Grey_5231.html" title="Lady Jane Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a> as his heiress, even though no woman had ever reigned over England. Jane's reign, however, lasted only nine days; with tremendous popular support, Mary deposed her, revoked her proclamation as Queen, and declared herself the lawful Sovereign. Mary I attempted to return England to Roman Catholicism, in the process burning numerous Protestants at the stake as heretics. Mary I died in 1558, to be succeeded by her half-sister <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a>, who once again returned England to Protestantism.</p>

<p>In Scotland, as in England, monarchies emerged after the withdrawal of Rome in the early fifth century. The three groups that lived in Scotland at this time were the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picts.html" title="Picts">Picts</a> (who inhabited the kingdom of <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pictavia.html" title="Pictavia">Pictavia</a>), the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Britons</a> (who lived in several kingdoms in southern Scotland, including the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde_cb80.html" title="Kingdom of Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>), and the <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gael.html" title="Gael">Gaels</a>, or <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotti.html" title="Scotti">Scotti</a> (who would later give their name to Scotland), of the Irish province of <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/l/D%C3%A1l_Riata_541a.html" title="Dál Riata">Dál Riata</a>. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_I_of_Scotland_269a.html" title="Kenneth I of Scotland">Cináed I</a> is traditionally viewed as the founder of united Scotland (or <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Alba_1365.html" title="Kingdom of Alba">kingdom of Alba</a>). The expansion of Scottish dominions continued over the next two centuries, as other territories such as Strathclyde were subjugated or obtained through dynastic marriage.</p>
<p>Early Scottish monarchs did not inherit the Crown directly; instead the custom of alternating segments was followed, as in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and previously among the Picts. The monarchy alternated between two, sometimes three, branches of the House of Alpín. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. The problems relating to succession were especially illustrated by the period from 942 to 1005, during which seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle. The rotation of the monarchy between different lines was abandoned after <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland_eda0.html" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">Máel Coluim II</a> ascended the throne in 1005 having killed many rivals. Thus, when <a href="../../../d/u/n/Duncan_I_of_Scotland_078f.html" title="Duncan I of Scotland">Donnchad I</a> succeeded Máel Coluim II in 1034, he did so as <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanistry.html" title="Tanistry">tanist</a>, with no opposition.</p>
<p>In 1040, Donnchad suffered defeat in battle at the hands of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth_of_Scotland_3dd6.html" title="Macbeth of Scotland">Macbeth</a>, the subject of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s famous play (<i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">The Tragedy of Macbeth</a></i>). Later, in 1057, Donnchad's son <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland_c146.html" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">Máel Coluim</a> avenged his father's death by defeating and killing Macbeth. A few months later, after the murder of Macbeth's son <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lulach_of_Scotland_9dbe.html" title="Lulach of Scotland">Lulach</a>, Máel Coluim ascended the throne as Máel Coluim III, becoming the first monarch of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Dunkeld_7470.html" title="House of Dunkeld">House of Dunkeld</a>.</p>
<p>From 1107, Scotland was briefly partitioned under the will of <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_of_Scotland_ab6e.html" title="Edgar of Scotland">Edgar</a>, who divided his dominions between his eldest surviving brother <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_I_of_Scotland_0ee5.html" title="Alexander I of Scotland">Alexander I</a> (who ruled northern Scotland as a king) and his younger brother <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_I_of_Scotland_9be5.html" title="David I of Scotland">David</a> (who ruled southern Scotland as an earl). After Alexander's death in 1124, David inherited his dominions, and Scotland became unified once more. David was succeeded by the ineffective <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland_1952.html" title="Malcolm IV of Scotland">Malcolm IV</a>, and then by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_Scotland_5d51.html" title="William I of Scotland">William the Lion</a>, the longest-reigning King of Scots before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_the_Crowns_615c.html" title="Union of the Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a>. William participated in a rebellion against King Henry II of England; however, the rebellion failed, and William was captured by the English. In exchange for his release, William was forced to acknowledge Henry as his feudal overlord. The English King Richard I agreed to terminate the arrangement in 1189, in return for a large sum of money needed for the Crusades. William died in 1214, and was succeeded by his son <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_II_of_Scotland_aa6a.html" title="Alexander II of Scotland">Alexander II</a>. Alexander II, as well as his successor <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_III_of_Scotland_ed9b.html" title="Alexander III of Scotland">Alexander III</a>, attempted to take over the Western Isles, which were still under the overlordship of Norway. During the reign of Alexander III, Norway launched an unsuccessful invasion of Scotland; the ensuing <a href="../../../1/2/6/1266_Treaty_of_Perth_27ff.html" title="1266 Treaty of Perth">Treaty of Perth</a> recognised Scottish control of the Western Isles and other disputed areas.</p>

<p>Alexander III's death in 1286 brought his three year-old Norwegian granddaughter <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_of_Scotland_%28Maid_of_Norway%29_aafd.html" title="Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)">Margaret</a> to the throne. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, precipitating a major succession crisis, during which there were <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competitors_for_the_Crown_of_Scotland_9d1e.html" title="Competitors for the Crown of Scotland">thirteen rival claimants</a>. Several Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England to settle the dispute. A court was set up with the Balliol and Bruce "factions" each nominating "assessors". Contrary to popular opinion, Edward did not choose <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Balliol_b536.html" title="John Balliol">John Balliol</a> to be king. Balliol won the overwhelming support of the majority of assessors. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert considerable influence over Scottish affairs. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded and conquered Scotland. During the first ten years of the ensuing <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence_7020.html" title="Wars of Scottish Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>, Scotland had no monarch present; however, it was informally led by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Wallace_7afd.html" title="William Wallace">William Wallace</a>. After Wallace's judicial murder in 1305, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_I_of_Scotland_06e8.html" title="Robert I of Scotland">Robert the Bruce</a> took over and declared himself king. Robert's efforts culminated in success, and Scottish independence was acknowledged in 1328. However, only one year later, Robert died, and the English again invaded under the pretext of restoring John Balliol's rightful heir, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Balliol_bf32.html" title="Edward Balliol">Edward Balliol</a>, to the throne. Nonetheless, during further military campaigns, Scotland once again won its independence under Robert the Bruce's son <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_II_of_Scotland_367d.html" title="David II of Scotland">David II</a>.</p>
<p>In 1371, David II was succeeded by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_II_of_Scotland_0b92.html" title="Robert II of Scotland">Robert II</a>, the first Scottish monarch from the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Stuart_ff20.html" title="House of Stuart">House of Stewart</a> (later Stuart). The reigns of both Robert II and his successor, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_III_of_Scotland_1aab.html" title="Robert III of Scotland">Robert III</a>, were marked by a general decline in royal power. When Robert III died in 1406, regents had to rule the country; the monarch, Robert III's son <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_Scotland_8930.html" title="James I of Scotland">James I</a>, had been taken captive by the English. Having paid a large ransom, James returned to Scotland in 1424; in order to restore his authority, he used ruthless measures, including the execution of several of his enemies. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_Scotland_3d2f.html" title="James II of Scotland">James II</a> continued his father's policies by subduing influential noblemen. At the same time, however, the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Estates of Scotland</a> (the Scottish Parliament) became increasingly powerful, often openly defying the King. Parliamentary power reached its zenith during the reign of the ineffective <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_III_of_Scotland_e2d3.html" title="James III of Scotland">King James III</a>. As a result, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_IV_of_Scotland_5dae.html" title="James IV of Scotland">James IV</a> and his successors tended to avoid calling parliamentary sessions, thereby checking the power of the Estates.</p>
<p>In 1513, James IV launched an invasion of England, attempting to take advantage of the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Flodden_Field_93f9.html" title="Battle of Flodden Field">Flodden Field</a>; the King, many senior noblemen, and over ten thousand soldiers were killed. As James IV's son and successor, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_V_of_Scotland_bb34.html" title="James V of Scotland">James V</a>, was an infant, the government was taken over by regents. After he reached adulthood, James ruled successfully until another disastrous war with the English in 1542. James's death in the same year left the Crown in the hands of his six-day-old daughter, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_Scotland_749f.html" title="Mary I of Scotland">Mary</a>; once again, a regency was established. Mary, a Roman Catholic, reigned during a period of great religious upheaval in Scotland. Due to the efforts of reformers such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Knox_74e0.html" title="John Knox">John Knox</a>, a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused considerable alarm by marrying a fellow Catholic, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Stuart%2C_Lord_Darnley_c428.html" title="Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley">Lord Darnley</a>, in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted an even more unpopular marriage with the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hepburn%2C_4th_Earl_of_Bothwell_5867.html" title="James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell">Earl of Bothwell</a>, who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate and to flee to England (where she was imprisoned and later executed by Elizabeth I). The Crown went to her infant son <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James VI</a>, who was brought up as a Protestant.

James VI and I was the first monarch to rule over England, Scotland, and Ireland together.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Elizabeth's death in 1603 brought about the end of the rule of the House of Tudor; she had no children, so was succeeded by the Scottish monarch <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James VI</a> whose maternal great-grandmother was <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>'s older sister. James VI ruled in England as James I after what was known as the "<a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_the_Crowns_615c.html" title="Union of the Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a>". Although England and Scotland were in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_union.html" title="Personal union">personal union</a> under one monarch - James I became the first monarch to style himself "King of Great Britain" in 1604<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> - they remained separate kingdoms. James belonged to the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Stuart_ff20.html" title="House of Stuart">House of Stuart</a>, a royal house whose monarchs experienced frequent conflicts with the English Parliament. The disputes frequently related to the issue of royal and parliamentary powers, especially the power to impose taxes. The conflict was especially pronounced during the reign of James I's successor <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>, who provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640 (the "<a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleven_Years_Tyranny_f069.html" title="Eleven Years Tyranny">Eleven Years Tyranny</a>"), unilaterally levying taxes, and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterianism.html" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterians</a> and the English <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritanism.html" title="Puritanism">Puritans</a>). In about 1642, the conflict between King and Parliament reached its climax as the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> began. The war culminated in the execution of the king, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the establishment of a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> known as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_England_2192.html" title="Commonwealth of England">Commonwealth of England</a>. In 1653, however, <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, the most prominent military and political leader in the nation, seized power and declared himself <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Protector_9813.html" title="Lord Protector">Lord Protector</a> (effectively becoming a military dictator). Oliver Cromwell continued to rule until his death in 1658, when he was succeeded by his son <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cromwell_1316.html" title="Richard Cromwell">Richard Cromwell</a>. The new Lord Protector had little interest in governing; he soon abdicated, allowing the brief re-establishment of the Commonwealth. The lack of clear leadership, however, led to civil and military unrest, and for a popular desire to restore the monarchy. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> came about in 1660, when Charles I's son <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> was declared king. The establishment of the Commonwealth and Protectorate was deemed illegal; Charles II was declared to have been the <i>de jure</i> king since his father's death in 1649.</p>
<p>Charles II's reign was marked by the development of the first modern political parties in England. Charles had no legitimate children, and was due to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James, Duke of York</a>. There arose a parliamentary effort to exclude James from the line of succession; the "Abhorrers," who opposed it, became the Tory Party, whereas the "Petitioners," who supported it, became the Whig Party. The Exclusion Bill, however, failed; on several occasions, Charles II dissolved Parliament because he feared that the bill might pass. After the dissolution of the Parliament of 1681, Charles ruled as an absolute monarch until his death in 1685. The Catholic James II accordingly succeeded Charles (who himself converted to Catholicism on his deathbed). James pursued policy of offering religious tolerance to Roman Catholics, thereby drawing the ire of many of his Protestant subjects. Many opposed James's decisions to maintain a large standing army, to appoint Roman Catholics to high political and military offices, and to imprison Church of England clerics who challenged his policies (see <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Bishops_738d.html" title="Seven Bishops">Seven Bishops</a>). As a result, a group of Protestant nobles and other notable citizens known as the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortal_Seven_2743.html" title="Immortal Seven">Immortal Seven</a> invited James II's daughter <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_II_of_England_765d.html" title="Mary II of England">Mary II</a> and her husband <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_III_of_England_5927.html" title="William III of England">William of Orange</a> to depose the king. William obliged, arriving in England on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">5 November</a> <a href="../../../1/6/8/1688.html" title="1688">1688</a> to great public support. Faced with the defection of many of his Protestant officials, James fled the realm on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_23.html" title="December 23">23 December</a> of the same year. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">12 February</a> <a href="../../../1/6/8/1689.html" title="1689">1689</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention_Parliament_8906.html" title="Convention Parliament">Convention Parliament</a> declared that James's flight constituted an abdication, and that William III and Mary II (not James II's Catholic son <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Francis_Edward_Stuart_a104.html" title="James Francis Edward Stuart">James Francis Edward Stuart</a>) were joint Sovereigns of England and Ireland. The Scottish Estates soon followed suit.</p>
<p>James's overthrow is normally known as the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, and was one of the most important events in the long evolution of parliamentary power. The <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_of_Rights_1689_2865.html" title="Bill of Rights 1689">Bill of Rights 1689</a> affirmed parliamentary supremacy, and declared that the English people held certain rights, including the freedom from taxes imposed without parliamentary consent. The Bill of Rights also required future monarchs to be Protestants, and provided that, after any children of William and Mary, Mary's sister <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Great_Britain_81c8.html" title="Anne of Great Britain">Anne</a> would inherit the Crown. Mary died childless in 1694, leaving William as the sole monarch. By 1700, a political crisis arose, as all of the Princess Anne's children had died, leaving Anne as the only individual left in the line of succession. Parliament, afraid that the former James II or his Roman Catholic relatives might attempt to reclaim the Throne, passed the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Settlement_1701_8dbd.html" title="Act of Settlement 1701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which placed William's distant Protestant cousin <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_of_Hanover_bc15.html" title="Sophia of Hanover">Sophia, Electress of Hanover</a>, in the line of succession. Soon after the passage of the Act, William III died, leaving the Crown to his sister-in-law Anne.</p>

England and Scotland were united as Great Britain under Queen Anne.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After Anne's accession, the succession issue quickly re-emerged; the Scottish Estates, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia of Hanover, passed the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Security_1b53.html" title="Act of Security">Act of Security</a>, threatening to end the personal union between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Act_1705_9550.html" title="Alien Act 1705">Alien Act 1705</a>, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by cutting free trade. As a result, the Scottish Estates acquiesced to the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_1707_ebbb.html" title="Act of Union 1707">Act of Union 1707</a>, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession to be determined under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in 1714, Queen Anne was succeeded by the son of the deceased Sophia of Hanover, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_I_of_Great_Britain_5447.html" title="George I of Great Britain">George I</a>, who consolidated his position by defeating <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobitism.html" title="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was much less active in government than many of his predecessors, preferring to devote much of his time to the affairs of his German kingdoms. Instead, George left much of his power to his ministers, especially to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Walpole_b90d.html" title="Robert Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a>, who is often considered the first (unofficial) <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of Great Britain</a>. The decline of the influence of the monarch and the rise of the power of the Prime Minister and <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom_1af8.html" title="Cabinet of the United Kingdom">Cabinet</a> continued during the reign of the next monarch, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_II_of_Great_Britain_0274.html" title="George II of Great Britain">George II</a>, but was halted during that of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a>. George III attempted to recover much of the power given up by his Hanoverian predecessors; he also acted to keep the Tories (who favoured royal control in government more than the Whigs) in power whenever possible. George III's reign was also important because of the union of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom under the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_1800_7ae6.html" title="Act of Union 1800">Act of Union 1800</a>. At the same time, George III also dropped the claim to the French Throne, which had been nominally made by all English monarchs since <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_III_d701.html" title="Edward III">Edward III</a>.</p>

King George III asserted his political authority on several occasions, in contrast with his two Hanoverian predecessors.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From 1811 to 1820, George III was insane, forcing his son, the future <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_62b2.html" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George IV</a>, to rule as Prince Regent. During the Regency, and later during his own reign, George IV continued to maintain what remained of royal authority, instead of ceding it to Parliament and the Cabinet. His successor, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_b611.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a>, attempted to do the same, but met with much less success. In 1834, William dismissed the Whig Prime Minister, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lamb%2C_2nd_Viscount_Melbourne_96d9.html" title="William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne">William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne</a>, over policy differences, and instead appointed a Tory, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Peel_d3b1.html" title="Robert Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a>. In the ensuing elections, however, the Whigs maintained a large majority in the House of Commons; they forced Peel to resign by blocking most of his legislation, thus leaving the King with no choice but to recall Lord Melbourne. Since 1834, no monarch has appointed or dismissed a Prime Minister contrary to the will of the democratically chosen House of Commons. William IV's reign was also marked by the passage of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Act_1832_66a8.html" title="Reform Act 1832">Great Reform Act</a>, which reformed parliamentary representation and abolished many <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotten_borough.html" title="Rotten borough">rotten boroughs</a>. The act, together with others passed later in the century, led to an expansion of the electoral franchise, and the rise of the increasingly legitimate House of Commons as the most important branch of Parliament.</p>
<p>The final transition to a constitutional monarchy was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Victoria</a>. As a woman, Victoria could not rule <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanover.html" title="Hanover">Hanover</a>; thus, the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover came to an end. The <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Era_73a5.html" title="Victorian Era">Victorian Era</a> was an historic one for the United Kingdom, and was marked by great cultural change, technological progress, and the establishment of the United Kingdom as one of the world's foremost powers. In recognition of British rule over India, Victoria was declared <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_India_d442.html" title="Emperor of India">Empress of India</a> in 1876. However, the reign was also marked by increased support for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_republican_movement.html" title="British republican movement">republican movement</a>, due in part to Victoria's permanent mourning and lengthy period of seclusion following the death of her husband in 1861.</p>
<p>Victoria's son, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom_9851.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a>, became the first monarch of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha_aaff.html" title="House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha">House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha</a> in 1901. However, in 1917, the next monarch, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V</a>, replaced "Saxe-Coburg-Gotha" with "Windsor" due to the anti-German sympathies aroused by the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>. George V's reign was also marked by the separation of Ireland into Northern Ireland (which remained a part of the United Kingdom) and the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_628e.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> (an independent nation) in 1922.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_monarchy.html" title="Edit section: Monarchy in Ireland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Monarchy in Ireland</span></h3>
<p>In the twelfth century Pope <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_IV_2cdf.html" title="Adrian IV">Adrian IV</a> gave a papal bull authorizing King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II of England</a> to take possession of Ireland. This was because the Irish Christian church at the time was not following the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic Church</a> and had various heretical beliefs. So the pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into the Catholic Church. The pope granted Ireland to the king of England as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship.</p>
<p>Around 1170 King <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermot_MacMurrough_7a02.html" title="Dermot MacMurrough">Dermot MacMurrough</a> of <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster.html" title="Leinster">Leinster</a> was deposed and his country taken by his archenemy King <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rory_O%27Connor_bdb0.html" title="Rory O'Connor">Rory O'Connor</a> of Connaught. Dermot escaped to England and asked Henry for help. Henry refused but agreed to allow him to use a group of Anglo-Norman aristocrats and adventurers, led by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_de_Clare%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Pembroke_2e94.html" title="Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke">Richard de Clare</a>, the earl of Pembroke, to help him regain his throne. Dermot and his Anglo-Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again. As a reward Dermot let de Clare marry his daughter. Because of this when Dermot died in 1171 de Clare inherited his throne and became King of Leinster. This made Henry afraid that de Clare would make Ireland a rival Norman state or a place of refuge for Anglo-Saxons, so he took advantage of the papal bull giving him possession of Ireland and went to the island with his English armies and forced de Clare and the other Anglo-Norman aristocrats in Ireland and some of the Gaelic Irish chieftains to recognize him as their overlord. Henry was thus <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lordship_of_Ireland_1183.html" title="Lordship of Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a> under nominal papal overlordship after this.</p>
<p>This remained the status of Ireland until 1541. By then King Henry VIII of England had broken with the Catholic Church and made England Protestant. This made the pope's granting of Ireland to the English monarch invalid. So he summoned a meeting of the Irish Parliament that year to change his title of sovereignty over the island. There his title was changed from Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland, thus making the island a kingdom in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_union.html" title="Personal union">personal union</a> with the kingdom of England.</p>
<p>Ireland continued to have this status until 1800, when the Act of Union merged the kingdom of Great Britain and the kingdom of Ireland into one kingdom called the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>. Ireland continued to be an integral part of the United Kingdom until 1922, when much of it was granted independence as the Irish Free State. Ireland was a separate kingdom with the same monarch as Great Britain in a personal union from its independence in 1922 until 1949, when what had become Southern Ireland became a republic and severed all ties with the monarchy, while Northern Ireland remained loyal to the Union and the Crown, thus creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

Map of the Commonwealth Realms where once the British Monarch reigned over all, but now the Crown is 'divided' so that one shared Sovereign reigns as Monarch of each nation separately.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Formerly, the Crown operated over the entire <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> as a single entity. The British Crown was seen as a unitary one, to which all Dominions and colonies were subordinate.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balfour_Declaration_1926_8827.html" title="Balfour Declaration 1926">Balfour Declaration</a> of 1926 stated that the Dominions were "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs." In 1931, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_Westminster_1931_c78a.html" title="Statute of Westminster 1931">Statute of Westminster</a> was passed, ending the right of the government in London to advise the King on actions to take regarding the individual Dominions. As a result, the unitary British Crown that operated over the entire empire was replaced by separate Crowns for each Dominion.</p>
<p>Thus, the institution of the Monarchy ceased to be exclusively British, the particular British Monarchy only existing within the Crown's British jurisdiction - the UK. Reflecting this, while the George VI was one person, he was separately King of the United Kingdom, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Australia_2c0b.html" title="Monarchy in Australia">King of Australia</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">King of Canada</a>, and so forth. This "division" was further enhanced with the subsequent patriation of each Realm's constitution from the UK over the ensuing decades.</p>
<p>One Canadian constitutional scholar, Dr. Richard Toporoski, stated on this: "I am perfectly prepared to concede, even happily affirm, that the British Crown no longer exists in Canada, but that is because legal reality indicates to me that in one sense, the British Crown no longer exists in Britain: the Crown transcends Britain just as much as it does Canada. One can therefore speak of "the British Crown" or "the Canadian Crown" or indeed the "Barbadian" or "Tuvaluan" Crown, but what one will mean by the term is the Crown acting or expressing itself within the context of that particular jurisdiction."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Formerly every member of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">British Commonwealth</a> was a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Realm_4960.html" title="Commonwealth Realm">Commonwealth Realm</a>. However, when <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> became a republic in 1950, it was decided that it should be permitted to remain in the Commonwealth, even though they would no longer share a common monarch with the other Commonwealth Realms.

The position is purely ceremonial, and is not accompanied by political power.</p>

The reign of Queen Victoria was the longest in the history of the United Kingdom.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>George V's death in 1936 was followed by the accession of the celebrated <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VIII</a>, who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry a divorced American woman, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallis%2C_Duchess_of_Windsor_9664.html" title="Wallis, Duchess of Windsor">Wallis Simpson</a>, even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorcées. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdication_Crisis_of_Edward_VIII_e377.html" title="Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII">abdicate</a>; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth realms granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by his new wife were to be excluded from the line of succession; instead, the Crown went to his brother, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a>.</p>
<p>The new monarch served as a rallying figure for the British people during the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, making morale-boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and to areas bombed by <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. George VI was also the last British monarch to hold the title "Emperor of India," a title relinquished when India became independent in 1947.</p>
<p>George VI's death in 1952 was followed by the accession of the present monarch, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>. Like her recent predecessors, Elizabeth II continues to function as a constitutional monarch. During her reign, there has been some support for the republican movement, especially due to negative publicity associated with the Royal Family (for instance, the divorce of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana%2C_Princess_of_Wales_d703.html" title="Diana, Princess of Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>). Nevertheless, a large majority of the British public supports the continuation of the monarchy.</p>

<p>Succession is according to the rules of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primogeniture.html" title="Primogeniture">male-preference cognatic primogeniture</a>, under which sons inherit before daughters, and under which elder children inherit before younger ones of the same sex. The Act of Settlement, however, restricts the succession to the natural (i.e. non-<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">adopted</a>) legitimate descendants of <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_of_Hanover_bc15.html" title="Sophia of Hanover">Sophia, Electress of Hanover</a> (1630–1714), a granddaughter of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_of_England_1562.html" title="James I of England">James I</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The Bill of Rights and Act of Settlement also include certain religious restrictions, which were imposed because of the English people's mistrust of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> during the late seventeenth century. Most importantly, only individuals who are <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestantism.html" title="Protestantism">Protestants</a> at the time of the succession may inherit the Crown. Moreover, a person who has at any time professed Roman Catholicism, or has ever married a Roman Catholic, is also prohibited from succeeding. One who is thus disabled from inheriting the Crown is deemed "naturally dead" for succession purposes; the disqualifications do not extend to the individual's descendants. In recent years, there have been some efforts to remove the religious restrictions (especially the specific rules relating to Roman Catholicism), but the provisions remain in effect.</p>
<p>Upon a "demise in the Crown" (the death of a Sovereign) his or her heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony. (Hence arises the phrase "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_King_is_dead._Long_live_the_King%21_c02c.html" title="The King is dead. Long live the King!">The King is dead. Long live the King!</a>") Nevertheless, it is customary for the accession of the Sovereign to be publicly proclaimed by an <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accession_Council_d82f.html" title="Accession Council">Accession Council</a> that meets at <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James%27s_Palace_473e.html" title="St. James's Palace">St. James's Palace</a>. After an appropriate period of mourning has passed, the Sovereign is also <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch_17c1.html" title="Coronation of the British monarch">crowned</a> in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, normally by the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. A coronation is not necessary for a Sovereign to rule; for example, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a> was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short reign.</p>
<p>After an individual ascends the Throne, he or she continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only monarch to voluntarily abdicate, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom_3b8e.html" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a> (1936), did so with the authorisation of a special Act of Parliament (<a href="../../../h/i/s/His_Majesty%27s_Declaration_of_Abdication_Act_1936_3b7f.html" title="His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936">His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936</a>). Historically, however, numerous reigns ended due to irregular or extralegal procedures; several monarchs have been killed, deposed, or forced to abdicate, chiefly during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The last monarch involuntarily removed from power was <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">James II</a>, who fled the realm in 1688 during the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glorious_Revolution_fc02.html" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>; Parliament interpreted his flight as an abdication.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regency_Acts_d5a3.html#Regency_Act_1937" title="Regency Acts">Regency Act 1937</a> and Regency Act 1953, the powers of a monarch who has not reached the age of eighteen, or of a monarch who is physically or mentally incapacitated, must be exercised by a <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent.html" title="Regent">regent</a>. A physical or mental incapacity must be certified by at least three of the following people: the Sovereign's spouse, the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Speaker_a8b6.html" title="Lord Speaker">Lord Speaker</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons_0fba.html" title="Speaker of the British House of Commons">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chief_Justice_0c75.html" title="Lord Chief Justice">Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_the_Rolls_914c.html" title="Master of the Rolls">Master of the Rolls</a>. The declaration of three or more of the same persons is also necessary to terminate the regency and to allow the monarch to resume power.</p>
<p>When a Regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession becomes Regent; no special parliamentary vote or other confirmation procedure is necessary. The Regent must be aged at least twenty-one years (eighteen years in the case of the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_apparent.html" title="Heir apparent">heir apparent</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_presumptive.html" title="Heir presumptive">heir presumptive</a>), be a British citizen, and be <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domicile.html" title="Domicile">domiciled</a> in the United Kingdom.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_monarchy.html" title="Edit section: Political role">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political role</span></h2>
<p>Although the monarch's powers are vast in theory, they are limited in practice. As a constitutional monarch, the Sovereign acts within the constraints of convention and precedent, almost always exercising the Royal Prerogative on the advice of the Prime Minister and other ministers. The Prime Minister and ministers are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Commons, and through it, to the people.</p>
<p>Whenever necessary, the Sovereign is responsible for appointing a new Prime Minister; the appointment is formalised at a ceremony known as <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kissing_Hands_095b.html" title="Kissing Hands">Kissing Hands</a>. In accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the Sovereign must appoint the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Commons: usually, the leader of the party which has a majority in that House. If no party has a majority (an unusual occurrence given the United Kingdom's <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Past_the_Post_ad1b.html" title="First Past the Post">First Past the Post</a> electoral system), two or more groups may form a coalition, whose agreed leader is then appointed Prime Minister. In a "<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hung_parliament.html" title="Hung parliament">hung parliament</a>," in which no party or coalition holds a majority, the monarch obtains an increased degree of latitude in his or her choice of Prime Minister. Still, however, the individual most likely to command the support of the Commons, usually the leader of the largest party, must be appointed. Thus, for example, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> was appointed Prime Minister soon after the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1974_%28February%29_7f6a.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1974 (February)">February 1974 general election</a>, even though his Labour Party did not have a majority. It has also been suggested that in the same situation, if a minority government tried to dissolve Parliament to call an election early to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and instead allow opposition parties to form a coalition government. However, Harold Wilson's minority government elected in February 1974 successfully called an early election in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_October_1974_136e.html" title="United Kingdom general election, October 1974">October 1974</a> which gave it a majority.</p>
<p>The Sovereign appoints and dismisses Cabinet and other ministers on the Prime Minister's advice. Thus, in practice, the Prime Minister, and not the Sovereign, exercises control over the composition of the Cabinet. The monarch may, in theory, unilaterally dismiss a Prime Minister, but convention and precedent bar such an action. The last monarch to unilaterally remove a Prime Minister was <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom_b611.html" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a>, who dismissed <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lamb%2C_2nd_Viscount_Melbourne_96d9.html" title="William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a> in 1834. In practice, a Prime Minister's term comes to an end only with death or resignation. (In some circumstances, the Prime Minister is required to resign; see <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>.)</p>
<p>The monarch holds a weekly audience with the Prime Minister, as well as regular audiences with other members of the Cabinet. The monarch may express his or her views, but, as a constitutional ruler, must ultimately accept the Prime Minister's and Cabinet's decisions. Walter Bagehot, the nineteenth century constitutional writer, summarises this concept, "the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy ... three rights—the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn."</p>
<p>Any member of the Cabinet who wishes to be absent from the United Kingdom for any reason, except for official visits to <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a> member countries, must seek both the Prime Minister's and the Queen's approval to leave the country, and must at the same time inform "Her Majesty ... of the arrangements made for the administration of the Minister's Department during his or her absence"<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The monarch has a similar relationship with <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolution.html" title="Devolution">devolved</a> governments of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> presently has no devolved government; its Assembly and executive have been suspended.) The Sovereign appoints the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Minister_of_Scotland_28fc.html" title="First Minister of Scotland">First Minister of Scotland</a>, but on the nomination of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Parliament_4b1f.html" title="Scottish Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>. The <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Minister_of_Wales_5bfa.html" title="First Minister of Wales">First Minister of Wales</a>, on the other hand, is directly elected by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Assembly_for_Wales_2e41.html" title="National Assembly for Wales">National Assembly for Wales</a>. In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Scottish Executive. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom in Welsh matters.</p>
<p>The Sovereign also plays the role of Head of State in the United Kingdom. <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath_of_allegiance.html" title="Oath of allegiance">Oaths of allegiance</a> are made to the Queen, not to Parliament or to the nation. Moreover, <i><a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Save_the_Queen_65ab.html" title="God Save the Queen">God Save the Queen</a></i> (or, if the Sovereign is male, <i>God Save the King</i>) is used as the British <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a>.

<p>The powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Prerogative_cb9c.html" title="Royal Prerogative">Royal Prerogative</a>. The Royal Prerogative includes many powers (such as the powers to make treaties or send ambassadors) as well as certain duties (such as the duties to defend the realm and to maintain the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_peace.html" title="Queen's peace">Queen's peace</a>). As the British monarchy is a constitutional one, however, the monarch exercises the Royal Prerogative on the advice of ministers. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the Consent of the Crown must be obtained before either House may even debate a bill affecting the Sovereign's prerogatives or interests. Although the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited. For example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>The Sovereign is one of the three components of Parliament; the others are the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It is the prerogative of the monarch to summon, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prorogation.html" title="Prorogation">prorogue</a>, and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_Parliament_7e37.html" title="Dissolution of Parliament">dissolve</a> Parliament. Each parliamentary session begins with the monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Opening_of_Parliament_6b71.html" title="State Opening of Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>, during which the Sovereign reads the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speech_from_the_Throne_ba0a.html" title="Speech from the Throne">Speech from the Throne</a> in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term (which lasts a maximum of five years), and is followed by general elections for all seats in the House of Commons. These powers, however, are always exercised on the Prime Minister's advice. The timing of a dissolution is affected by a variety of factors; the Prime Minister normally chooses the most politically opportune moment for his or her party. The Sovereign may theoretically refuse a dissolution, but the circumstances under which such an action would be warranted are unclear.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> (See <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lascelles_Principles_dc85.html" title="Lascelles Principles">Lascelles Principles</a>.) No parliamentary term may last more than five years; at the end of this period, a dissolution is automatic under the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Acts_d3d3.html" title="Parliament Acts">Parliament Act 1911</a>.</p>
<p>All laws are enacted in the monarch's name. The words "BE IT ENACTED by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows," known as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_enacting_formulae.html" title="List of enacting formulae">enacting formula</a>, form a part of each Act of Parliament. Before a bill can become law, the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Assent_5f14.html" title="Royal Assent">Royal Assent</a> (the monarch's approval) is required. The Sovereign may, in theory, either <i>grant</i> the Royal Assent (make the bill law) or <i>withhold</i> the Royal Assent (veto the bill). In practice, however, the Royal Assent is always granted; the last monarch to withhold Assent was Anne, who rejected a Scots militia bill in 1708.</p>
<p>The Royal Prerogative with respect to domestic affairs is extensive. The Crown is responsible for the appointment and dismissal of ministers, Privy Counsellors, members of various executive agencies, and other officials. Effectively, however, the appointees are chosen by the Prime Minister, or, for less important offices, by other ministers. In addition, the monarch is the head or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_in_chief.html" title="Commander in chief">commander in chief</a> of the Armed Forces (the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a>, the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>). It is the Sovereign's prerogative to declare war, make peace, and direct the actions of the military, although the Prime Minister holds <i>de facto</i> decision-making power over the British armed forces. Many of the Sovereign's prerogative powers are exercised through the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Council</a>.</p>
<p>The Royal Prerogative, in addition, extends to foreign affairs. The Sovereign may negotiate and ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements; no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Sovereign also accredits British <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Commissioner_2c7a.html" title="High Commissioner">High Commissioners</a> and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, all British <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passport.html" title="Passport">passports</a> are issued in the monarch's name.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sovereign is deemed the <i>fount of justice</i>, and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. The Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. For instance, prosecutions are brought on the monarch's behalf, and courts derive their authority from the Crown. The common law holds that the Sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 allows civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government); however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. The Sovereign also exercises the "prerogative of mercy," and may <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pardon.html" title="Pardon">pardon</a> offences against the Crown.

<p>Similarly, the monarch is also the <i><a href="../../../f/o/u/Fount_of_honour.html" title="Fount of honour">fount of honour</a></i>, or the source of all honours and dignities in the United Kingdom. Thus, the Crown creates all peerages, appoints members of the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">orders of chivalry</a>, grants knighthoods, and awards other honours. In practice, peerages and most other honours are granted on the advice of the Prime Minister. Some honours, however, are within the personal gift of the Sovereign, and are not granted on ministerial advice. Thus, the monarch alone appoints members of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Thistle_5879.html" title="Order of the Thistle">Order of the Thistle</a>, the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Victorian_Order_8658.html" title="Royal Victorian Order">Royal Victorian Order</a>, and the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Merit_165c.html" title="Order of Merit">Order of Merit</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the Sovereign is the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England_4249.html" title="Supreme Governor of the Church of England">Supreme Governor</a> of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, the officially <a href="../../../e/s/t/Established_church.html" title="Established church">established church</a> in England. As such, the monarch has the power to appoint archbishops and bishops. The Prime Minister, however, chooses the appointee, though he or she must select from a list of nominees prepared by the Crown Nominations Commission. The Crown's role in the Church of England is titular; the most senior clergyman, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, is seen as the spiritual leader of the Church and of the worldwide <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Communion_20fc.html" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>. The monarch is only an ordinary member, and not the head or leader, of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scotland_1b71.html" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>; however, he or she does hold the power to appoint the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_High_Commissioner_5451.html" title="Lord High Commissioner">Lord High Commissioner</a> to the Church's <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland_97a8.html" title="General Assembly of the Church of Scotland">General Assembly</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm_88ec.html" title="Great Seal of the Realm">Great Seal of the Realm</a> is the device used to authenticate important official documents, including <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letters_patent.html" title="Letters patent">letters patent</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proclamation.html" title="Proclamation">proclamations</a>, and <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writ_of_election.html" title="Writ of election">writs of election</a>.

<p>The monarch also has the power to claim any <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturgeon.html" title="Sturgeon">sturgeons</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porpoise.html" title="Porpoise">porpoises</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale.html" title="Whale">whales</a>, or <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphin.html" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a> that are either washed ashore, or captured within 3 miles of the British coast. This power comes from a statute from <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edward_II_bfca.html" title="King Edward II">King Edward II</a> in 1324. Today, if you purchase a sturgeon, you still request the honour as an act of loyalty to the crown.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Parliament meets much of the Sovereign's official expenditure from public funds. The <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_list.html" title="Civil list">Civil List</a> is the sum that covers most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. The size of the Civil List is fixed by Parliament every ten years; however, any money saved may be carried forward to the next ten year period. Thus, the Sovereign's Civil List expenditure in 2003 was approximately £9.9 million. In addition, the Sovereign receives an annual Property Services Grant-in-Aid (£15.3 million for <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fiscal_year.html" title="Fiscal year">FY</a> 2003–2004) to pay for the upkeep of the royal residences, as well as an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid (£5.9 million for <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fiscal_year.html" title="Fiscal year">FY</a> 2003–2004). The Civil List and the Grants-in-Aid are paid from public funds.</p>
<p>Formerly, the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues, including the profits of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_land.html" title="Crown land">Crown Estate</a>. In 1760, however, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom_cc72.html" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a> agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the Civil List; this arrangement still persists. In modern times, the profits surrendered from the Crown Estate have by far exceeded the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid provided to the monarch. For example, the Crown Estate produced over £170 million for the Treasury in the financial year 2003–2004, whereas parliamentary funding for the monarch was less than £40 million during the same period. The monarch continues to own the Crown Estate, but cannot sell it; instead, the estate must continue to pass from one Sovereign to the next.</p>
<p>Aside from the Crown Estate, the Sovereign also owns the <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Lancaster_8fb6.html" title="Duchy of Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a>. The Duchy is the monarch's private inherited property, unlike the Crown Estate, which belongs to the monarch in an official capacity. Like the Crown Estate, however, the Duchy is held in trust, and cannot be sold by the monarch. The revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster need not be surrendered to the Treasury; instead, they form a part of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Purse_efb6.html" title="Privy Purse">Privy Purse</a>, and are used for expenses not borne by the Civil List. The <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Cornwall_0a31.html" title="Duchy of Cornwall">Duchy of Cornwall</a> is a similar estate held in trust to meet the expenses of the monarch's eldest son.</p>
<p>The Sovereign is subject to indirect taxes such as the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_added_tax.html" title="Value added tax">value added tax</a> (VAT), but is exempt from <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_tax.html" title="Income tax">income tax</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_gains_tax.html" title="Capital gains tax">capital gains tax</a>. Since 1993, however, the Queen has voluntarily paid taxes on personal income. As the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid are used solely for official expenditure, they are not taken into account when calculating taxes.</p>

Buckingham Palace is the monarch's principal residence.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Sovereign's primary official residence is <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Westminster_d04f.html" title="City of Westminster">City of Westminster</a>. Buckingham Palace is the site of most state banquets, investitures, royal christenings, and other ceremonies. Moreover, visiting heads of state usually reside in Buckingham Palace. Another principal residence is <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Castle_4be3.html" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, the largest occupied castle in the world. Windsor Castle, located in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor%2C_Berkshire_8835.html" title="Windsor, Berkshire">Windsor, Berkshire</a>, is used principally as a weekend retreat; the monarch also resides there during the <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascot_Racecourse_1c85.html" title="Ascot Racecourse">Royal Ascot</a>, an annual race meeting that forms a major part of the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Season_%28society%29.html" title="Season (society)">social calendar</a>. The Sovereign's principal official residence in Scotland is the Palace of Holyroodhouse, more commonly called <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyrood_Palace_0388.html" title="Holyrood Palace">Holyrood Palace</a>, in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The monarch stays at Holyrood Palace for at least one week each year, and when visiting Scotland on state occasions.</p>
<p>There also exist a number of other palaces not used as residences by the monarch. The <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Westminster_357b.html" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> was originally the Sovereign's primary residence until 1530; although it is still officially a royal palace, it serves as the home to both Houses of Parliament. Thereafter, the Sovereign's principal London residence was the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Whitehall_f9e5.html" title="Palace of Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>, which was destroyed by fire in 1698, to be replaced by <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James%27s_Palace_473e.html" title="St. James's Palace">St. James's Palace</a>. Although it was replaced as the monarch's primary residence by Buckingham Palace in 1837, St James's is still used for various official functions. For example, foreign ambassadors are accredited to the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_St._James%27s_77d7.html" title="Court of St. James's">Court of St. James's</a>, and the Palace is the site of the meeting of the <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accession_Council_d82f.html" title="Accession Council">Accession Council</a>. However, St James's Palace is not one of the Sovereign's official residences; instead, it is used by other members of the Royal Family. Other residences used by the Royal Family include <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_House_566b.html" title="Clarence House">Clarence House</a> (presently the home of the heir-apparent, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">The Prince of Wales</a>) and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensington_Palace_9c50.html" title="Kensington Palace">Kensington Palace</a>.</p>
<p>The aforementioned residences belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch. However, the monarch does own certain homes in a private capacity. <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandringham_House_0514.html" title="Sandringham House">Sandringham House</a>, a privately owned <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_house.html" title="Country house">country house</a> near the village of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandringham.html" title="Sandringham">Sandringham</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, is typically used from <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> to the end of January. Similarly, during parts of August and September, the monarch resides in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balmoral_Castle_6b50.html" title="Balmoral Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>, a privately owned castle in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire_%28traditional%29.html" title="Aberdeenshire (traditional)">Aberdeenshire</a> in Scotland.</p>

<p>The present Sovereign's full style and title is: <b>Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.</b> The title <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_the_Commonwealth_6f6f.html" title="Head of the Commonwealth">Head of the Commonwealth</a></i> is held by the Queen personally, and is not vested in the British Crown. (However, her father, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a>, was also recognised as such.) <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_X_6993.html" title="Pope Leo X">Pope Leo X</a> first granted the title <i><a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidei_defensor.html" title="Fidei defensor">Defender of the Faith</a></i> to King Henry VIII in 1521, rewarding him for his support of the Papacy during the early years of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, particularly for his book the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defence_of_the_Seven_Sacraments_a3b5.html" title="Defence of the Seven Sacraments">Defence of the Seven Sacraments</a>. However, Henry VIII later broke from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England; <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Paul_III_fefa.html" title="Pope Paul III">Pope Paul III</a> revoked the grant, but Parliament passed a law authorising its continued use.</p>
<p>The Sovereign is known as "His Majesty" or "Her Majesty", though, in certain formal circumstances, "Most Gracious Majesty" or "Most Excellent Majesty" is used instead. The form "Britannic Majesty" appears in international treaties and on passports to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers. Queens Consort (wives of Kings) and Queens Dowager (widows of Kings) are also entitled to the style "Majesty", but husbands of female monarchs are not. Thus, the husband of the present Queen, the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh_e472.html" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a>, is only styled <i>Royal Highness</i>.</p>
<p>The monarch chooses his or her <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regnal_name.html" title="Regnal name">regnal name</a>, which is not necessarily his or her first name - <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom_9851.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> did not use their first names.</p>
<p>The ordinal used for the monarch only takes into account monarchs since the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_conquest_of_England_1189.html" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman conquest of England</a>. If only one monarch has used a particular name, then no ordinal is used; for example, Queen Victoria is never known as "Victoria I". After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, numbering was based solely on previous English monarchs, and not on Scottish ones. In 1953, however, Scottish nationalists challenged the right of the Queen to style herself "Elizabeth II", on the grounds that there had never before been an "Elizabeth I" in Scotland. In <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/MacCormick_v._Lord_Advocate_a778.html" title="MacCormick v. Lord Advocate">MacCormick v. Lord Advocate</a></i>, the Scottish <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_of_Session_09c9.html" title="Court of Session">Court of Session</a> ruled against the plaintiffs, finding that the Queen's title was a matter of her own choice and prerogative. Nevertheless, it was announced that future monarchs would use the higher of the English and Scottish ordinals. Retroactively applying this policy yields no change in numbering.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a monarch's signature includes his or her regnal name (but not ordinal) followed by the letter <i><a href="../../../r/_/_/R.html" title="R">R</a></i>. The letter stands for <i>rex</i> or <i>regina</i> ("king" and "queen", respectively, in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>). Hence, the present Queen signs "Elizabeth R". From 1877 until 1948, the reigning King or Queen also signed an <i><a href="../../../i/_/_/I.html" title="I">I</a></i>, due to his or her status as <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_India_d442.html" title="Emperor of India">Emperor or Empress of India</a>; thus Queen Victoria would sign her name "Victoria RI".</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">coat of arms</a> used by the Sovereign, known as the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_f9b5.html" title="Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom">Arms of Dominion</a>, are: <i>Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland).</i> The supporters are <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_lion_and_the_unicorn.html" title="The lion and the unicorn">the lion and the unicorn</a>; the motto is <i><a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieu_et_mon_Droit_45cc.html" title="Dieu et mon Droit">Dieu et mon Droit</a></i> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> for "God and my Right").

<p>In Scotland, the monarch uses an alternative form of the Arms of Dominion in which quarters I and IV represent Scotland, II England, and III Ireland. The motto is <i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i> (<a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> for "No-one provokes me with impunity"); the supporters are the unicorn and lion.</p>
<p>The monarch's official flag in the United Kingdom is known as the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Standard_03d7.html" title="Royal Standard">Royal Standard</a>, and depicts the Arms of Dominion. (The Royal Standard used in Scotland depicts the Scottish version of the arms.) This flag is only flown from buildings, vessels and vehicles in which the Sovereign is present; elsewhere, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Flag</a> is flown. The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast because there is always a sovereign: when one dies, his or her successor becomes the sovereign instantly.</p>
