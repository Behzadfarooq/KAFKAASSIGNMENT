<h2><span class="mw-headline">6000 islands</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone have a source for the comment about the british isles consisting of 6000+ island and islets, it seems a lot. I'm researching this subject and I'd love to find a source.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't have a source - but <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clew_Bay_1033.html" title="Clew Bay">Clew Bay</a> alone has 365, so although 6000 does seem high, it's also plausible. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 23:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The drumlins in Clew Bay do not actually number 365.

<dd>I've never found a definitive source on this. I think part of the problem is how you define an island. Do count every rock poking out of the water or does it have to be habitable or a minimum size and at what tide. Estimates seem to vary between 2000 and 6000. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshurtree_32f2.html" title="User:Joshurtree">josh</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshurtree_fda5.html" title="User talk:Joshurtree">talk</a>) 11:16, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I too would love to know the answer to this. I think the simple definition of "A land mass, especially one smaller than a continent, entirely surrounded by water" is inadequate for this purpose until you describe the boundaries of the area (Faeroes? Sark? Irish Sea?) and the minimum land mass (? a hectare? an acre?) I can find no usefully defined number but I did find, on bbc.co.uk in a page about an Alan Titmarsh programme - British Isles, A natural history, this quote: "The UK coastline is nearly 32,000km long if you include the islands." I fear that's another unsupported comment.</dd>
</dl>
<p>DuncanGrey 14:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've just found on the www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk site the claim that "The coastline length around mainland Great Britain is 11 072.76 miles." I calculate this to be 17 819.8799 kilometers - without islands.DuncanGrey 18:06, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another source is the Rough Guide to Scottish Highlands and Islands 2006: "there are aproximately 790 islands, 130 of which are inhabited." DuncanGrey 11:50, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">So, when does 'some' become 'many'?</span></h2>
<p>'Rejected by "some" in Ireland' Just what, precisely, is the basis for this false representation of the reality in Ireland? As has been shown relentlessly here, the term is rarely used in Ireland. It's great to see so many experts on Ireland from, well, Britain. The Empire is finished, lads. Get over yourselves. From the fields of Mullaghbawn to the hills of <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ard_na_Caithne_4e5c.html" title="Ard na Caithne">Ard na Caithne</a> to the mountains of <a href="../../../s/l/i/Sliabh_na_mBan_fe50.html" title="Sliabh na mBan">Sliabh na mBan</a> this country continues to resist incorporation into the myths of British nationalism, myths which the very term "British Isles" encapsulates so well. Your tribe is just that: your tribe. Only at the heart of the British tribe could you mistake the terminological constructions of the British state, of your institutionalised nationalism, as being representative of the mass of people in Ireland.

<dd>I have said it again and again and again, the term BI is rarely used in Ireland, so why do some editors go berserk over this truism? MelForbes 21:08, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your question, basis for that text is given by the provided citation: (Barber, Ellis 1995) "The very concept of 'the British Isles' is rejected by some Irish historians. In part this reflects the different nuances of the term within the two islands..." I took the liberty of extrapolating "Irish historians" to "some in Ireland" which would seem to be justified by the other available sources.</dd>
<dd>I take it you have no objections to the balance of the sentence, but simply wish to change <i>some</i> to <i>many</i>. If so, then provide a citation which supports such a change. Your assertion that something "has been shown relentlessly here" betrays a lack of understaning of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a>. Article text is supported by reference to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, these endless protestations and ancedotes count for nothing.</dd>

<dd>El G and Mel - though I appreciate that most/many is probably the most accurate and truest respresentation of reality, we cannot say 'many' until we have some sort of unrejctable proof that this view is held by the majority; until then we can say 'some' only. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 07:05, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Google Fight</span></h2>
<p>Interestingly, and considering the "British Isles" brigade's love for Google, Google has just fought "British Isles" out against "Britain and Ireland". Unfortunately for the British far right here, the results are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=British+Isles&amp;word2=Britain+and+Ireland" class="external free" title="http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=British+Isles&amp;word2=Britain+and+Ireland" rel="nofollow">http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&amp;word1=British+Isles&amp;word2=Britain+and+Ireland</a></p>
<p>Translation: 87 million results for Britain and Ireland; a mere 19.6 million for British Isles. How ironic that the British far right <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_Isles_51dc.html" title="Talk:British Isles">here</a> want the Britain and Ireland article to be deleted as soon as possible because it, in their unique world view, is "not in widespread use". This entire issue is an astounding reflection of British nationalism in 2006. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 22:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See my note below. As for my comments, I admit it was a brutal outrage that I should never have let out of the back of my mind, and I apologise profusely for it. However, my girlfriend was attacked in Dublin by irish nationalists for her English accent, so I did have a slight reason for doing it.

<dd>Odd, as all my friends in Northern Ireland call Northern Ireland part of Britain (I guess some catholics may not -- don't know). After all, nowadays <i>Britain</i> is just a short and convenenient way of saying <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i>, in the same way that <i>America</i> is just a short and convenenient (but equally inaccurate) way of saying <i>United States of America</i>.</dd>

<dd>But the term "Britain" is indeed very often used as a synonym for the UK, especially in informal speech or writing. To say that this is "wrong" is to misunderstand how language actually works. Linguistic prescriptivists may fulminate as much as they like against double negatives or split infinitives, for example, but it won't stop people using them. If you wish to talk about the island of Britain, I would recommend calling it "Great Britain", as this is much less often used as a synonym for the UK (except, for some reason, in international sporting contests such as the Olympics, or on vehicle license plates). <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 07:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, in answer to your question, yes and no. Of course "Britain" means the island also known as "Great Britain" - that is its "correct" meaning. But the fact remains that a lot of people, including members of the British government, have used the term "Britain" in an informal sense to mean the UK. Is this wrong? It really depends on whether you are a prescriptivist or a descriptivist in linguistic terms.

<dd>But Britain originally meant <i>British Isles</i> before England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland even existed (well <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britto.html" title="Britto">Britto</a>). The use of <i>Britain</i> to mean <i>Great Britain</i> is incorrect, but more convenient in conversation. Equally, the use of <i>Britain</i> to mean <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i> is also incorrect, but more convenient in conversation, and the most widely used meaning in my experience. <a href="../../../r/n/t/User%7ERnt20_32c8.html" title="User:Rnt20">Rnt20</a> 14:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Diodorus clearly refers to Ireland separately as Iris. This historical point has been raised before, and not addressed. Can someone quote and cite (eg. from Loeb) the exact passages in the ancient historians from which the term <i>British Isles</i> is said to derive?

<p>Hi Shtove, I think the pretaniki is a bit of a supposition (after all, for a very long time "British" was supposed to derive from "<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutus_of_Troy_aa08.html" title="Brutus of Troy">Brutus of Troy</a>"). However, you can find the most authoritative text of Ptolemy here <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/home.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and Pliny is here <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/home.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (book 4, para 102 onwards), but in Latin only, which is not one of my languages I am afraid. You can actually find images of pre-17th century maps which use the equivalent of <i>British Isles</i> in Latin and French can be seen here <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_Pages/ENG_pages/aaEng.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_Pages/ENG_pages/aaEng.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.

<dd>Thanks, MAG1, for the links - will check them out. <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutus_of_Troy_aa08.html" title="Brutus of Troy">Brutus of Troy</a> is interesting, because it's use in Tudor history writing and propaganda in relation to Ireland is one of the roots of the arguments on this talk page. There's been a fair amount of literary studies on <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Spenser_a27f.html" title="Edmund Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>, which analyse the use of the Brutus myth during the <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_re-conquest_of_Ireland_f2a6.html" title="Tudor re-conquest of Ireland">Tudor re-conquest of Ireland</a> when English historians had ditched the myth in their general writings. Also, the political origins of the term British Isles (early Stuart) have been raised above (somewhere). It seems an attempt is made on this page to reduce the term to its geographical significance, whereas on <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnited_Kingdom_651d.html" title="Talk:United Kingdom">Talk:United Kingdom</a> the attempt is to treat the term <i>Britain</i> as largely political.

<dd>Hi Shtove, the whole use of "British" (as in "ancient") in early modern times is interesting as it specifically excludes the English. I managed to find a copy of Peter Heylyn's <i>Microcosmus</i> (1621) (first surviving use of <i>British Isles</i> in English) today in which, you may be interested to know, he takes great pains in demolishing the Brutus myth and the myth that the Irish were descended from <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythians</a> after the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_%28mythology%29.html" title="Flood (mythology)">Flood</a>. He then explicitly equates <i>British Isles</i> to the islands occupied by the ancient Britons. I don't know how that ties in with what you know, but I think this actually may be at the heart of arguments. In the UK, the historical meaning of <i>British</i> has persisted alongside the eventual growth of the modern political meaning, while in Ireland it had the very definite meaning of people from Great Britain in the here and now from the early 16th century (1641, earlest recorded usage) onwards. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 17:21, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On what authority have you unilateraly decided that Britain = Great Britain and not the UK. Both the British and Irish governments and media use Britain to refer to the state and usually reserve Great Britain for the island (although the irish consolate used has a <a href="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/embassies/display.asp" class="external text" title="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/embassies/display.asp" rel="nofollow">Great Britain</a> embassy). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshurtree_32f2.html" title="User:Joshurtree">josh</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshurtree_fda5.html" title="User talk:Joshurtree">talk</a>) 14:22, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maybe out in the eternally benighted 13 colonies it's a bit "vague"; indeed, so "vague" that calling <i>Britain</i> England is very commonplace in 2006. Strangely, I don't see anybody here rushing to support that sort of "vagueness". But that's another matter. At any rate, nothing vague about <i>Britain</i> here in Ireland. In fact, historical, political, cultural and intellectual discourse has been quite taken by the entire <i>British</i> thing for some time now. Precision is everything in such a context. Only an outsider would fail to appreciate the importance of this. And only a sloppy mind would attempt to imbue the ignorance of equating Britain with the UK with the legitimacy of precision. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 23:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>El Gringo: Britain is not a formal geographical term like "Great Britain" is. It is a term which can refer to either a) the Roman province of Britannia, and its area, up to the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons; b) the entire island of Great Britain; and c) the United Kingdom. As to "England" the issue is that it is generally considered to be <i>wrong</i> to say that Edinburgh is in England (I think that has always been considered wrong) and since World War II or so, it has also been considered wrong to use expressions like "English government" or the general "England" to refer to the UK. "Britain" on the other hand, is a term used frequently, including by British media. It is, more or less, a back formation from "British" which is the official adjective to describe the UK. It may not technically be right, but it is also pretty clearly not technically wrong in the way that "England" has become. And note that England didn't used to be wrong. It used to be perfectly acceptable to use "England" as a shorthand substitute for the UK. Were people in the 19th century, say, "wrong" to do this, in spite of everyone doing it and there being no sense that it is wrong?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'd add that to use "Britain" as being synonymous with the UK is different from saying that places in Northern Ireland are <i>in Britain</i>. The latter strikes me as on the borderline of incorrectness. The former is perfectly appropriate. "Britain, France, and Belgium were among the countries which joined the peacekeeping forces in Lower Kislavastan" That would be a perfectly correct sentence, I think. "Derry is a city in Britain" would be awkward. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:15, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Alright, let's go backwards for a moment. A century ago, "England" was the conventional short form for "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland." This was used by English people, by people from outside the, er, British Isles, and, in fact, by many people from Ireland, Wales, and Scotland (although I will not venture to say that everyone used it.) The way the term was used was generally not to say absurd things like "Dublin and Edinburgh are cities in England." It was to talk about, for instance, "the English government" or "England" in a general sense as a political entity. "England will not tolerate French interference in Egypt", "The Queen of England has done such and such" - that kind of thing. "England" as a geographical entity meant the same thing it does today, but as a political entity it meant the entire United Kingdom. There were other examples of this in the past. For instance, "Piedmont" was frequently used as a political equivalent for the Kingdom of Sardinia, but one of course would not have said that Cagliari was in Piedmont. Here's another example that you are perhaps aware of: "Ireland" geographically means "Republic of Ireland+Northern Ireland," but politically it means simply "Republic of Ireland." The use of terms like "President of Ireland" does not imply that Mary McAleese is also president of Northern Ireland, does it? Basically, political shorthand terms are often essentially synecdoches. England was the most important part of the UK, so it was used as a shorthand for the whole country by people who knew very well that the full name of the country was "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". It was used in the same way that "London" can be used as shorthand for the government of the country. This is <i>clearly</i> a common usage of "Britain." Because of the usage of "Great Britain" for the island (or, more accurately for England+Scotland+Wales), usage of "Britain" for the UK is probably at least as common as for the perhaps strictly more accurate meaning of "Great Britain". It is not for us to say that standard usage is incorrect. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 12:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>I have had a go at taking up Red King's challenge and revising the history. It's not much shorter, I am afraid, but I have tried to focus it on things best done here rather on national pages. As well as a brief survey of the development of political structures, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>History before the national formation. Could be done elsewhere, but isn't. Only drawback is that it is very complicated, so a bit of a sketch.</li>
<li>Middle Ages. National entities exist, but they are being run by an international elite. I think a decent overall story emerges.</li>
<li>17th century. I am a complete convert here: the history of this time can only be properly understood on the basis of the entire archipelago (and even then it is a bit insular). There are some other decent articles around, such as that on the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, so I have avoided detail.</li>
<li>Population movements. Lots of this and very important: it could be argued that this is one of the real motors of history.</li>

<p>Interestingly enough, I barely changed any of the early history as I could not see how it could be improved. There is a bit on the Celts/Gaels/Britons/Brythons in the first para of the "Pretani, Romans and Anglo-Saxons" section.</p>
<p>As to the replace-with-a-list-of-articles idea, this was my starting point; however, there are aspects, as discussed above, which are not dealt elsewhere, and there are things which can only be dealt with on an all-archipelago basis (again, see above). Now, if people want to generate the articles elsewhere within Wikipedia, then that would be great, but until then this is probably the best place for the material. I have tried, and I think it is a good principle, not to reproduce substantial chunks from other articles. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 11:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to note, a history of the "British Isles" ought not concern itself solely with "British-Irish relations," which at least implies, to my mind, the history of relations between Ireland and the present-day British state. It should, I think, be about the history of the islands as a unit. There's a ton of stuff that doesn't full under the rubrik of "British-Irish relations" - the effects of the Viking Invasions, for instance, make a great deal of sense to discuss in a broad view as to their effects on the British Isles as a whole. So does the spread of Norman-style feudalism, which occurred in different ways in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Relations between Scotland and Ireland (which are, I suppose, technically covered by the term "British-Irish relations," but which, in practice are likely to be ignored) are also worth discussing. A history section seems essential to me. If the current one is bad, improve it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 20:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>History of the islands as a unit</i>" - isn't this an example of <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">Begging the question</a>? If you're talking invasion by Vikings/Norsemen and by Normans, then the unit should include the territories of Scandinavia and France. The Norsemen had a trading empire defined by sea lanes that connected fortified ports (like the Spanish and Portuguese empires) right across northern Europe. The Normans kicked butt and intermarried from Sicily to Scotland - so eg. the rebel <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Desmond_e026.html" title="Earl of Desmond">Earl of Desmond</a> in 16thC Ireland was just as interested in talking up his connections with the city state of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a> in order to prove his credentials with <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> as he was in bending the knee to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>. Why cut it off at the channel/<i>la manche</i>? Why not see the islands from a europe-wide celtic POV? Why treat them as a unit, when the roman and germanic invasions were limited to the south of Britain? And the biggest influence of the lot - Christianity: what unit is appropriate there? The history section isn't bad - it's just hopeless, both restrictive and over-ambitious in its artificiality. Why do history editors want to treat the islands as a unit? Because the islands were united in one state at the height of the British empire, and the books we read are mostly the product of navel-gazing national historiography from that era. The state of play was different before the union, and it's different now.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 22:53, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is ridiculous. The British Isles form a distinct geographical unit, and also, in many ways, a distinct geopolitical one. Of course the Vikings and their Norman descendants had influence beyond the British Isles, but that doesn't mean that there's no sense in referring to the British Isles as a unit. Sure there are aspects of history limited to one part of the islands, but there are others that are fairly universal. It's also worth noting that the Kings of England were, from the 12th century onwards, the dominant political force in all four nations (they were Kings of England, their great vassals controlled most of Wales, they were Overlords of Ireland, and the King of Scots acknowledged himself intermittently as their vassal. But even if we acknowledge that such a history is somewhat artificial (as, of course, any largely political history of a geographical unit which does not form a single state is bound to be), I'm not sure why that matters. We have a section on the history of the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_Peninsula_03ea.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, which only comprised a single state during the Roman period, for a brief part of the Visigoth era, and between 1580 and 1640, we have a <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Italy_8cd5.html" title="History of Italy">History of Italy</a> article which dicusses the history of the area from ancient times. Furthermore, the idea of trying to write the history of the Isles from a non-English perspective is a recent one which is quite strong - there's Norman Davies' <i>The Isles</i>, for instance, and the recent fad for discussion of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_52ce.html" title="Wars of the Three Kingdoms">Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a>. What advantage, precisely, is gained by removing the history section? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 09:30, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shtove's argument sounds like an argument against encyclopaedias: classifications never can be applied rigorously; therefore things should not be classified. Taken to its extreme, there should be just one article. There is, I believe, currently a live debate on how navel gazing were the Victorians and Edwardians; however, I do not think that it is really possible to stick the concept of the <i>British Isles</i> on the Victorians trying to make the world fit in with their ideas of what it should be like: it existed before the heyday of the Empire, and you would havve to be well into yopur fifties by now to have had an 'Our Island History' type of education. While there are always connections to the rest of Europe and the world, the British Isles have been seen as distinct from continental Europe: originally it was seen as being ethnically different (hence the name), and, then for better or worse, they remained out of European political structures from the Reformation until 1974, and the societies were developed by people from the British Isles or at least those who lived there. It would be difficult, for example, to describe any effect that Desmond had on Spain or Milan, or indeed the effects that Spain or Milan had on British society (with the exception of Philip's influence on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_of_England_20f7.html" title="Mary of England">Mary</a>. During the Middle Ages, they were part of transnational feudal structures, but developed distinctively from the continent. Christianity is a particularly interesting (and neglected) part of British Isles history with the assimulation of Celtic Christianity by the Roman sort, and again while obviously it has many outside influences, but this is an area where the British Isles is precisely the right scale. Yes, it is different now and it may become even more different if Northern Ireland is ever sorted out, but that does not affect the past unless you are a fully paid-up post modernist. That the world can be described using several different scales is not an argument for ignoring them, but trying to reflect them all. I think (as I have said consistently) is that a test for this section is that it should not merely parrot what can be found in other articles, but should be introducing new material or maiking connections between existing material that have not been made. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 11:56, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Josh, you have to remember that Northern Ireland opted out of the democratic will of the majority of the nation of Ireland, so they have no special rights to the name <i>Ireland</i>.

<dd>In terms of population, NI makes up 29% of Ireland, and the Republic only 71%. The Republic does not <i>own</i> the name of Ireland, and indeed the legal entity that was given (virtual) independence in 1922 had already existed for two years as a devolved part of the UK under the name Southern Ireland - hence the continued though now fairly rare use of that term in the UK to refer to the Republic. Yes, I am fully aware that the most northerly point in Ireland, in Co. Donegal, is in what was called "Southern Ireland", but it must be born in mind that these are just convenient - i.e. shorthand - names for political entities. And I'm also fully aware that the devolved entity of Southern Ireland was derailed by agitation and never really got off the ground. And what is NI? It is a <i>province</i>. It is always called a province, and whether or not this is part of its legal status, that is how people refer to it. Without any doubt it is called a province because of the four historic provinces of Ireland, of which NI is based on Ulster (and yes, I am fully aware that three Ulster counties are in the Republic). Indeed, NI is often called "Ulster", which is just as inaccurate and for precisely equivalent geographical reasons as calling the RoI "Ireland".</dd>

<dd>To cut a long story short - the modern entity of the Republic of Ireland is just as much a gerrymandered state as NI, and could never have existed in its present form if it had had to take into account the aspirations of the large Protestant minority that lives in the island of Ireland. Its legitimacy, therefore, is questionable at best - it <i>cannot</i> in all fairness appropriate the name "Ireland" solely for its own exclusive use. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 15:44, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No confusion about it. The term is objectionable to me and any Irish person I know. That this discussion continues is testimony to how controversial the term is.

<p>No better people for the euphemism than those claiming something they have no right to claim. And I'll leave my general observation at that. Anyway, a quick Google of that "British Isles" phrase on Google's Pages from Ireland function gives the following results:</p>
<p>"British Isles"= 56,900 <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=ga&amp;q=%22british+isles%22&amp;btnG=Cuardach+Google&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryIE" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=ga&amp;q=%22british+isles%22&amp;btnG=Cuardach+Google&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryIE" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>;</p>

<p>In other words, 112,600 hits for two of the most common alternatives for British Isles, and a mere 56,900 hits for "British Isles" on Irish webpages. (and I note that many of the latter involve a discussion on Politics.ie about the phrase). So, again, tell us what <i>British</i> historian is the basis for misrepresenting the reality by saying "some" instead of "most"? Only somebody who is not Irish would deny that the phrase is not used by the majority of people in Ireland. It is only British nationalist delusions, from over there, which is refusing to face the reality in Ireland and trying to falsely represent the reality in Ireland when it comes to this most British, and most colonial, of terms. The correct adjective in this article is 'most' not 'some'. Not being wanted is a consequence of being a colonial power. It is time for you all to grow up and accept yout rejection by us natives rather than being dishonest about it. You are, collectively, being profoundly immature on this issue.

<dd>1. Ok then. Assuming we accept that counting Google hits <i>is</i> scientific and qualitative, then far from my point being "retarded", El Gringo, your own post clearly demonstrates that the term "British Isles" <i>is</i> widely used - <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=ga&amp;q=%22british+isles%22&amp;btnG=Cuardach+Google&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryIE" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ie/search?hl=ga&amp;q=%22british+isles%22&amp;btnG=Cuardach+Google&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryIE" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. While that shows its used only 79% as often as "Britain and Ireland", that's hardly insignificant, and is certainly enough to justify the use of the word "many".</dd>

<dd>1. In fact, it indicates that the term "British Isles" is rejected by <i>most</i> Irish people, not merely by <i>some</i>. This objection is shown in the far greater use of the above two alternative names for "these islands". This article says the term is only objected to by <i>some</i> in Ireland. Why, if <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">this wikipedia article</a> is true, is Google reflecting a minority (<i>some</i>) usage of the phrase "British Isles" in Ireland and an overwhelming majority (<i>most</i>) usage of two alternatives to that phrase?</dd>

<p>So does this mean that North America is a controversial term. People obviously prefer "United States and Canada" as a term for the region.

Not surprising really given your understanding of Irish geography. After that, I suggest you address the issue of the phrase British Isles being only used by some in Ireland, with an overwhelming majority using alternative phrases. This is the reality which is in contrast with the claim in this article.

<dd>This gets funnier. El Gringo, all that your figures "prove" is that the terms - all of them - are in wide use. A ratio in use of 1:1.2 between "British Isles" and "Britain and Ireland" does <b>not</b> qualify as an "overwhelming majority" by any stretch of the imagination. Nor does it "prove" that just because somebody used one term over the other that they have actively "rejected" the other term. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 18:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact, I used the word 'indicates'. Evidently unlike you, I use my words carefully. In contrast, there is no 'proof' whatever that only <i>some</i> in Ireland object to its use. The indications from Google, backed up by the views of the overwhelming majority of Irish people in this discussion, strongly support the idea that the term "British Isles" is a minority usage in Ireland. This article claims otherwise. That is the issue at hand. Now, if you are having difficulty sticking with this discussion, perhaps you should confine yourself to discussions which may hold your attention more easily. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 18:47, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with geography. My use of the two largest countries to describe the contienent isn't any different to the use of Britain and Ireland ignoring the Isle of Man (and the Channel Islands in some definitions). North America can sometimes be used to apply to the US and Canada only, with the others being counted as Central America. Slight descrepicies do not change the fact that if you use the main two counties as opposed to its geographic term you get more hits.</dd>

Whilst wanting to ignore the many personal attacks from pretty much all of the users above (I exclude Josh and MelForbes from that criticism, though I haven't read the whole thing through), I'd like to say something about that first. Frankly, the conduct on this is embarassing at times, and I am quite serious that I will report any further personal attacks to the relvant admin noticeboards; this has really got to stop.</p>
<p>As for the issue here, it seems to me that we have a reality in which 'most Irish people' (paticularly in the indepdent part) never use British Isles, not through any political choice but through habit and a simple lack of contact with the term. However, I think that my experience on here and my discussions with friends indicate that the term is fairly common in Northern Ireland, and can be used there as a geographical term (Im not saying its never political - it has been historically and can be now).</p>
<p>However, my 'evidence' for all this only from my interactions and discussions with irish friends, or with Irish users on here. As a result, it is effectively useless for Wikipedia. Google searches, whilst often helpful, are not on their own a good enough source for using a term in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>So, whilst I would like to see us being able to change this to 'most' - I think it would reflect the reality of the situation - I do not see how we can do this until we can find some sort of newspaper survey, or a thick bank of newspaper/academic articles, which make the same claim. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 11:23, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How did the publisher get it wrong? BI <i>is</i> a geographical term for these islands. Just because Folens changes their school atlas doesn't mean any other publisher in the rest of the world will be changing theirs. It is interesting, though. It's not too long ago at all since I wrote on this talk page that my daughter's Irish-published school atlas used the term 'British Isles' - and then suddenly this story appears - and quotes Wikipedia. I wonder if this is an example of metaWikiness, where Wikipedia editors initiate events that can then be written about on Wikipedia?&#160;:-P <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastun_82b1.html" title="User:Bastun">Bastun</a> 09:51, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Folens were probably in this "oblivious" category - it doesn't mean the issue didn't exist.

<dd>Thanks for a good link, interesting story. The "recent complaint by a parent" contrasts with the hordes of enraged Irish parents we might have expected from discussions here, and the advice from Minister for Education passing the buck to the parent to take the matter up indicates less than active Irish government concern about the issue. Their monitoring of the British media also seems not to have resulted in any action. By the way, although "John O'Connor of Folens" suggests some Irish connection, <a href="http://www.folens.com/page.cfm?cfid=2232115&amp;cftoken=66988490&amp;webpageid=12" class="external text" title="http://www.folens.com/page.cfm?cfid=2232115&amp;cftoken=66988490&amp;webpageid=12" rel="nofollow">Folens</a> is apparently Dunstable based. ..<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 10:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"The history of the islands tends to be considered on a national basis"</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is far too simplistic without an explanation. Quite often the histories are not treated separately, and what is meant by "national" is open to interpretation - certainly it is usually the case that the history of Ireland is dealt with on a national basis (i.e. across the whole island) prior to 1922 (and in the case of history *in* the south, across the whole island subsequently too - in fairness the southern *news* refers to the North most days!). Going further back, Scottish and English history can be regarded separately, but anytime in recent centuries it is invariably considered across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I think this sentence is just causing trouble - at best it is imprecise, at worst, just flat out wrong.</p>

<p>Well, I certainly don't live on a British island. I live in Dublin. The "British Isles" was a geographical term invented when the islands dominated by the London Government. Persia was once inhabited by Persians. Names change to reflect demographic and political change. You can't get Peking Duck in Peking anymore, there is no such place as Siam. The entire Spanish speaking world knows "The Falklands" as the "Malvinas". There is no such thing as "politically neutral" geographic names.</p>
<p>I might also add that some of the "British" contributors here lend way too much authority to colonial British Law in supporting their definitions of Irish and British.</p>

<p>"British Isles" actually predates London's dominance of the islands.

<dd>"British Isles" predates London's dominance of the islands? We've had this before (see "Armagh and Derry ..." section above), but nobody cited precise use of the term prior to James I.

<p>I actually very much enjoy the historical debate provided it is historical rather than polemical. This is particularly interesting as an example of a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_etymology.html" title="False etymology">false etymology</a>, and they can matter. Shtove is not quite telling it as it is- here is my own quote from the section above in reply to his original point about the Pretaniki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the pretaniki is a bit of a supposition (after all, for a very long time "British" was supposed to derive from "<a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutus_of_Troy_aa08.html" title="Brutus of Troy">Brutus of Troy</a>"). However, you can find the most authoritative text of Ptolemy here <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/home.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, and Pliny is here <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/home.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/home.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> (book 4, para 102 onwards), but in Latin only, which is not one of my languages I am afraid. You can actually find images of pre-17th century maps which use the equivalent of <i>British Isles</i> in Latin and French can be seen here <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_Pages/ENG_pages/aaEng.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_Pages/ENG_pages/aaEng.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have read the reference for the first quote in English, and explicitly it is a historical use- it has nothing to do with James I. Judging from the rest of the relevant sections Heylin would have had no hesitation in asserting a political rather than historical use should he wanted to have done so. In fact, I don't think <i>British</i> had much of a political charge at his time of writing, away from the Court anyway: Shakespeare used it without any gloss or qualification twenty years previously to describe ancient Britons. Incidentally, this is the earliest surviving reference, it is not necessarily the earliest usage. Anyway it is far from clear what the point of this conversation (again) is.</p>
<p>For the record, I agree with Zoney's action: the statement had truth in it, but it's complicated, and perhaps this is not the place for it unless anyone wishes to write a section or even an article on the changing historiography of the British Isles. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 19:33, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In no less than four locations - including a banner and a whole section - was reference made to the view that some people in Ireland don't like the term <b>British Isles</b>. This article had become a vehicle for POV pushers who don't like the term. By all means make reference to it, but don't labour the point. I've removed some of the duplication and unnecessary references, but it's still highly POV. Please also, stop reverting to put this POV back. The term British Isles IS NOT confusing - it's just that some don't like it. To try and justify the term being confusing, one editor made reference in his reverting edit summary to a Texan who thought Edinburgh was in England.

<p>Banner read; Quote "<i>The term "British Isles" can be confusing and is objectionable to some people, particularly in Ireland. See the <a href="#Terminology" title="">Terminology</a> section below for details of the controversy.</i>" Unquote. This banner had been agreed upon, seemingly to skew the edit wars which may ensue, and which were a feature of the past. Prudent editors to this page should put fundamental changes to talk first, before proceeding with their view. MelForbes 19:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally I think the banner as quoted above by MelForbes is fine. It touches upon the fact that some do take issue with the term, and that there is indeed misunderstandings in the world at large as to just what the British Isles covers and means. I feel it's a good balance of the differing opinions and viewpoints on the matter, helps to get this across without being too intrusive or labouring the points at that point in time. Plus the wording of that was discussed by many members on these talk pages and that is the wording that was agreed upon. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 20:15, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree entirely: the very existence of an article on the term British Isles reeks of centuries of British colonial pov regarding Ireland and the Irish people, and self-serving British state perceptions of Ireland's political position in the world. It's just that now, via medium like this, British people can hear those objections. I notice that the Wikipedia article entitled <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niggers.html" title="Niggers">Niggers</a>, a name given by a powerful group to those whom they controlled, also comes with appropriate warnings as to its usage in the introduction.

<dd>Gringo, Your comment above is one of the most stupid and ill informed I've come across for some time. To liken a topic such as British Isles to that of Niggers just beggars belief. In any case, there is no such banner in that article. Maybe there used to be and editors thought better of it. Banners are generally used to direct readers to other related articles (disambig) or to clarify the subject matter. They are not there to make a weasel-worded political point as this one does. Incidentally, I couldn't find where the wording was agreed - I'm not saying it wasn't agreed, but if someone could point me to the appropriate archive of this page I'd be grateful. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 21:12, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm sure <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">User:Robdurbar</a> will inform on you for that ad hominem (albeit with a thinly veiled ad rem). Ahem? At any rate, the British rightwing won that debate and that you are fighting for yet more concessions is mighty in itself. More power to your elbow. I've never agreed with it for the simple reason (see above) that it is not a mere "some" in Ireland who object to Ireland's inclusion in this "British Isles" lark but the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, a people who reject <i>most explicitly</i> any attempts at forcing them into the British nation. You don't need a PhD in history to get the basics of Irish identity here, most especially the part where British occupation created Irish resistance and British repression fueled that same resistance. Sticking "British" on to a people with that sort of history can only be deliberate, or obtuse in the extreme. At best, at very, very best: insensitive. There are 6 archives (of utter shite, mind you, because this little term is so utterly colonial it ain't goin' to last much longer) here debating this non-entity product of British imperialist claims to Ireland. And tucked in there somewhere is plenty of argument about it. The term, like the precious British Empire, has been ditched by all respectable entities both in Ireland and Britain. No matter how often I listen to the weather on the BBC, ITN or Channel 4, they all share one thing in common: they no longer use the term "British Isles". Would that liberal, open-minded and decent Britain were more represented here in this discussion. As they say, the battlefield attracts the warriors. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 23:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The quote "the very existence of an article on the term British Isles" says a lot about El Gringo's attitude to this article. It is not an article about the term, or at least it shouldn't be. The fact that you believe it is causes the problems with the article becoming overwhelmingly bogged down in the fact that the term is disliked in Ireland. There is no-one here banging on about how the term must be promoted for the glory of the empire. In case you hadn't noticed, the empire is dead. Everyone else has moved on. You seem to be the only one who hasn't got over it. Its just left behind a language with a load of inaccurate terms that people just use without caring how they came about.</p>
<p>The only thing the banner does is say "Ignore the the article just read the controversy section". Banners are there for the benifit of readers, not editors. They point them in the correct direction if they end up at the wrong article so using it to promote the controversy section is an abuse of the technique. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshurtree_32f2.html" title="User:Joshurtree">josh</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJoshurtree_fda5.html" title="User talk:Joshurtree">talk</a>) 00:56, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly the point. I recommend this banner is re-worded or removed entirely. It is blatant misuse of editorial facilities. Here's what I tried to use, but it has been reverted - <i>For an explanation of the term "British Isles", including the controversy surrounding its use, see British Isles (terminology).</i> <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArcturus_dd0a.html" title="User:Arcturus">Arcturus</a> 07:52, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The banner was initially a terminology one linking to the BI(t) page like those I pointed out before; it was changed I don't know when (oh, very poetic), but I do recall a general consensus over the change - at any rate, its been there a while and been unquestioned, which I always take as equivalent to a full consensus.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The comparison to Niggers is a little over the top, but given the anger that has been displayed here, isn't entirely inappropriate. To be honest, the best reason for there being a banner is that is prevents the fairly regular apperance of a user coming to this talk page and complaining about how biased Wikipedia is by claiming Irish is British. If it stops that confusion then its helpful to both readers and editors, and I'd fully support it.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I think that the wordage of the banner is splitting hairs slightly. The terminology section of this article links to BI(t) anyway. It seems in general (with the exception of the some/most issue that ElG mentions, which I see more as a problem of source-lacking, rather than differing views) that we've reached an unesay consensus on the content and layout of the page. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 07:32, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Channel Islands are part of British Isles!</span></h2>
<p>I've edited towards the top of the page to include the fact that the Channel Islands like the Isle of Man are considered to be part of the British Isles. The fact they are closer to the European continent is irrelevant. They are still well within "territorial limits" of the British Isles to be included (there are islands further from the coasts of the two main islands that are still considered part of the British Isles) and have always been considerd to be part of the British Isles. I was surprised and puzzled to see they were excluded! <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYourPTR%21_3d33.html" title="User:YourPTR!">YourPTR!</a> 05:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've also edited the section that starts: "The islands encompass an area south to north from..." to include the approx 76 square miles of the Channel Islands (including Chausey which is geographically part of the Channel Islands but claimed by France. I say claimed by France because I dispute their rightful ownership of those islands. Therefore sovereignty over them is in dispute). Obviously the most southerly part of the British Isles will have to be edited. Not sure what it is. A small reef south of Jersey I expect but I am not sure of it so have left it alone for now. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYourPTR%21_3d33.html" title="User:YourPTR!">YourPTR!</a> 05:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Obviously other sections will also have to be edited later to correct the blatant error of the Channel Islands being originally excluded as being part of the British Isles such as this nonsense "The following islands are sometimes also included, though officially are not geographically part of the archipelago: Rockall and the Channel Islands." Since when? Both are part of the British Isles as legitimately as any other part. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYourPTR%21_3d33.html" title="User:YourPTR!">YourPTR!</a> 05:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is part of the reason that many Irish people object to this misnomer. "Territorial limits" would lead me to believe that you think of the archipelago as a political construct.

<dd><a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYourPTR%21_3d33.html" title="User:YourPTR!">YourPTR!</a> you are confusing the term British Isles with British <i>Islands</i>. The former is an ancient geographical term existing in many languages and dating back to Classical Antiquity, that predates the formation of the British state (which stole its name) by literally hundreds or even thousands of years.

<dd>The point about the Channel Islands, and any other debatables such as Rockall is that they are tiny. Great Britain and Ireland are by far the only two major islands in the group. These two form the core of what the ancients called the British Isles - as for outlying peripherals, it really doesn't matter that much. Is Andorra part of the Iberian Peninsula?

Not very British after all. Rockall is on a different sea shelf, so it doesn't count in the equation. It's a political term from about 1600. The British Isles still does exist, but it does not include Ireland, having since departed in 1922. MelForbes 17:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd be happy to include the Faroes, but I don't really care as they are tiny and insignificant. Same with the Channel Islands. How can the term possibly be a political one from about 1600, when it existed in both Greek and Latin? The late 16th century saw a flowering of Classical scholarship which is all we really need to account for the term gaining ground in English at that time - as for political motivation, you will really need to cite reputable sources for that I'm afraid. To the Ancients, the term described both Great Britain and Ireland, plus the surrounding much smaller islands. Whether we choose to include this or that tiny outcrop of rock is supremely irrelevant to the overall meaning. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 18:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, I respect your opinion. In your analysis the <i>archipelago argument</i> is out the window. That would mean that the article as it stands now on the BI, would need correcting. MelForbes 19:08, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How the Ancient Greeks or Romans ever used the term "British Isles" is beyond me; as they didn't speak English, in fact the language didn't exist at that time! The banner at the top of the article should read "this article is jingoistic nonsense and a relic of British imperialism." <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 20:11, 11 October 2006 (UTC) Actually to say that the term is merely <i>objectionable</i> to <i>some</i> is a gross understatement; since we can't say <i>many</i> (which is more accurate) repugnant would be more appropriate adjective. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 20:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if my point wasn't clear. It is claimed that Britain and Ireland, with all their bits and pieces, have been known collectively as the <i>British Isles</i> since they were first described in writing ie. by the ancient Greeks - namely by <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pytheas.html" title="Pytheas">Pytheas</a>, who supposedly coined the term <i>in Greek</i>. I have sought a citation for this several times, but none appears, even though the geographical nature of the term depends on the claim. My view is that the term is purely political, invented by the Stuart dynasty in the early 17thC to help vindicate its authority under the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_the_Crowns_615c.html" title="Union of the Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a>.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 22:23, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My remark was not aimed at you Shtove but at TharkunColl and his/her assertion that the term <i>British</i> Isles dates from Classical Antiquity. Since TharkunColl puts so much faith in the geographical knowledge of the Greeks and Romans I wonder why they do not request that France be reffered to as Gaul, since that is what the Ancients called it, and while we're at let's wipe the Americas and Oceania off the map. The Greeks and Romans never referred to them so they mustn't really exist, afterall our modern understanding of geography and demographics is insignificant compared to that of the Ancients. <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIolar_Iontach_bfc9.html" title="User:Iolar Iontach">Iolar Iontach</a> 23:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ignorance is not a virtue, and I hesitate to even respond to your statement. For your information, Gaul (or <i>Gallia</i>, in Latin), designated an area considerably larger than modern France. To the Greeks and Romans, the British Isles comprised the two major islands of Great Britain and Ireland, plus their surrounding much smaller islands. This usage has remained stable to the present day. Please bear in mind that during the 17th century the English <i>hated</i> the idea of calling themselves "British", because to them the term meant what we today would call "Celtic" (or rather, insular Celtic). The term "British" was associated with the ambitions of the Stuart dynasty (Scottish, be it noted, and definitely not English), and was specifically rejected by such English leaders as Oliver Cromwell. I find it almost risibly ironic that certain modern Irish nationalists on Wikipedia should reject a term that, as Celts, they have far more historical right to than the English. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 00:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference between "isles" and "islands" probably doesn't exist in most other languages, and is a result of the polyglot sources for modern English (I believe they are Norse and Old English respectively, but I could be wrong and haven't checked). Words go in fashions, and "isles" has a very slightly archaic feel to it today. So the English rendering of the Greek and Latin terms could indeed have been either "isles" or "islands", but obviously one was preferred above the other and stuck - to the extent that the other one, "islands", would now be considered wrong and was able to be used by the government for something different. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 22:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
