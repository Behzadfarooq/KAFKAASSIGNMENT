<h2><span class="mw-headline">Venn Diagram</span></h2>
<p>Am I being stupid, or does the Venn diagram say that England and Wales are part of Scotland? Shouldn't Scotland either be in the same circle as England and Wales, or otherwise shouldn't England, Wales, and Scotland all have their own circles? Lexy lexy 21:50, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I changed the circle back to an ellipse, and moved some captions around a little, so the new version of the image should be clearer now. "England and Wales" is a significant legal and historical entity. -- AnonMoos 06:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. The general idea is that the "label" for the overal whole contents of a circle is always horizontally centered near the top of that circle (and the word "Scotland" is not horizontally-centered within its enclosing circle, nor near the top of the circle). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 16:08, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Britain</span></h2>
<p>"Britain in its modern usage is the usual short form for Great Britain and also for United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland." - This is, more or less, what the OED says but I don't think I have ever seen it used as the short form of Great Britain. Does anyone have any citations of it actually being used that way? <a href="../../../n/a/o/User%7ENaomhain_92c2.html" title="User:Naomhain">Naomhain</a> 09:26, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the Shorter OED is clear: "Britain: More fully (esp. as a political term) Great Britain. As a geographical and political term: (the main island and smaller offshore islands making up) England, Scotland, and Wales, sometimes with the Isle of Man. Also (as a political term) the United Kingdom, Britain and its dependencies, (formerly) the British Empire." The Collins Cobuild cd-rom dictionary is wonderful--it gives over 800 usage examples from written and spoken English on "Britain" (and 1500 on "England"). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 09:38, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, no arguments about that: As I say, the OED says more or less the same thing. But I was after an example of it <b>actually</b> being used to mean Great Britain. I don't remember ever having heard it myself and I haven't found one. Can you give one or two of the examples from Collins? <a href="../../../n/a/o/User%7ENaomhain_92c2.html" title="User:Naomhain">Naomhain</a> 09:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hadn't thought of that usage but I suggest that these refer to the ancient Celtic "nation" of Britain rather than the island (though I guess they may be fairly coincident.) The article says that it is the "usual short form for Great Britain" but my feeling is that it is highly <b>un</b>usual to refer to the island (or the political unit that is the UK less Northern Ireland) this way. <a href="../../../n/a/o/User%7ENaomhain_92c2.html" title="User:Naomhain">Naomhain</a> 17:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
