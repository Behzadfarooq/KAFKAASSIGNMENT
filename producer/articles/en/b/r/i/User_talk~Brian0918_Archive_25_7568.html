<p>If you would have read the entire subpage of the Muybridge nomination, you would have found a written agreement by myself to independently nominate the two within 24 hours, in hopes of finding a counter-solution to the current chaos. Times not up. Whether intentional or not, I would hope in future circumstances of this sort, that you would examine the discussion more carefully. In order to prevent further eccentricity by some users, I will not, respectively, counter your actions. You wrote there was no such thing as replacement. It was exercised when the monopoly board image was nominated for <i>replacement</i>, and no person presented complaint. And due to your large, bolded text, I suppose you would be most interested in the future outcome of situations such as this. A line must be drawn between nominating for replacement images of exact representation/similarity and images that are completely similar but represent different genres. The third option being replacements are automatically forbidden and a permanent notice is present on the FPC Nominations page. Due to the upheaval of the current replacement, I propose the third.

<p>Hi Brian. In response to your intervention over <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Khaybar_d5a2.html" title="Talk:Battle of Khaybar">talk:Battle of Khaybar</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article in question is a highly contentious one involving disputes over historical fact and interpretation</li>
<li>The article was neither new nor recently "unstubbed"; see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=38873763" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=38873763" rel="nofollow">this version</a> from three months prior to the DYK listing</li>
<li>The DYK extract which appeared on the main page included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Did_you_know&amp;oldid=52260855" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Did_you_know&amp;oldid=52260855" rel="nofollow">a controversial claim</a> not supported by consensus</li>
<li>The editor who has involved you in this dispute is a notorious edit warrior who was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3APecher" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3APecher" rel="nofollow">24-hour blocked for 3RR</a> only yesterday</li>
<li>The listing was neither innocent nor really "an error"; it was, in fact, a calculated piece of POV-pushing by partisan editors</li>
<li>Given the DYK listing was not legitimate, retaining the DYK notice serves only to reward these wiki-gamers, and to encourage them</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you're now able to see why retaining the notice on that page is not in the interests of the project. —&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 16:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay I sat down and worked solidly at my concept for the header for a couple of hours. I finally hit on a format that I'm able to present for comment.

<p>Howdy, I noticed that you and I seem to post in one or two articles dealing with progressive issues in political science/sociology. There's currently a debate beginning in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Tea_Party_3189.html" title="Boston Tea Party">Boston Tea Party</a> as to whether the article should include the category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_incidents_in_the_United_States" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_incidents_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It meets definitions set in the articles <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definition_of_terrorism.html" title="Definition of terrorism">Definition of terrorism</a>, however, there are several self-proclaimed patriots who watch BTP who refuse to recognise the fact. The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be <i>intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared</i>. Some users would rather use recent acts of terrorism as a yardstick, rather than using a firm definition, and hence lose their ability to discuss matters calmly. Would you be able to pop in to the Talk page and join in the discussion?

You insert your comments into my comments, cross out part of what I wrote, cross though part of my header (!!) and tell me I can't start a poll on a talk page. FYI, the issue had been extensively discussed above on the talk page (including by you), I was merely trying to focus the discussion. HOW DARE YOU!!</p>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could help me, recently watching a television programme where you had to guess the word up-something to win £30,000 and nobody had it so they revealed the answer and guess what it was upbrixle???? I have searched and searched the web for the meaning of this word and the only place it comes up is here, by any chance do you know what it means? as i am a member of a quiztelly forum and its driving us all mad!!!!</p>

Thanks

<p>Hello. Never had anything much to do with wikipedia before, except as a reader. Was just looking at the Arrested Developement Talk page and noticed there are TWO "Bush comparison" sections. I'm guessing it's an editing error, but may be intentional. Figured I'd point it out to someone and found your name first as having something to do with the page. Would send email, but need to register/log in first so this seems to be the only recourse available. Still I hesitate to add something to this 'page', but I guess you can always delete it... right?

<p>Brian, thanks much for adding the section headers! I'm new and still feeling my way through all the ways &amp; means of formatting. But as the article has grown in length, I was already thinking about dividing it into sections; you've made that little task easier for me now, and I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>BTW, I do think it may be a point not worth quibbling over, the use of "today's" vs. "modern American" standards. If you will go read the two short typescript accounts, reproduced verbatim at source #3 in my list, I think you might agree with me that the nasty, vicious attitude displayed there would indeed be considered racist *anywhere* on any continent in "today's" world, not only in America. Go check them out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>The issue is that right now every nomination at DYK conforming to the guidelines is accepted and displayed on the main page, with no discretion on the part of the admins. This means that every single eligible Eurovision article gets featured on the main page eventually. So adding more articles on other subjects is not a useful way to reduce the number of the DYKs on a single repetitive subject appearing on the front page. What is needed is less frequent updating of DYK, which will allow admins to exercise more discretion in choosing from among the submissions and allow for more variety. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 02:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

To me it looks like that it is a different shot taken during the same photo session; people are in a slightly different position compared to the Commons picture. Not only that, to me it looks like that it is even sharper than the one you uploaded to Commons. I don't know what to do with it; I am hesitant to upload it to Commons, because I have my doubt wrt copyright status. The website states <i>"Billederne herunder kan frit benyttes af pressen."</i>, which I think means something like <i>"the pictures below can be freely used in print"</i>, but my knowledge of Danish is not what it should be&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/d/h/User%7EJdH_4dd2.html" title="User:JdH">JdH</a> 21:41, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, Brian. I've already done the translation and posted it (<a href="../../../n/i/c/Talk%7ENicolau_Tolentino_de_Almeida_6bab.html" title="Talk:Nicolau Tolentino de Almeida">here</a>). I hope it helps with the article. Cheers, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 03:04, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I've seen your request on my talk page. Do you still need this? The post above seems to indicate otherwise, but let me know, and I'll get into it if need be.--<a href="../../../s/a/o/User%7ESaoshyant_bdf9.html" title="User:Saoshyant">Saoshyant</a> 11:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
