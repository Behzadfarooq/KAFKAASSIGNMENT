	    <p><b>Bridget Cleary</b> was an <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> woman <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murdered</a> by her husband in 1895. The homicide is notable for several peculiarities. The stated motive for the crime was her husband's belief that she had been abducted by <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairies.html" title="Fairies">fairies</a>, and a changeling left in her place; he claimed to have slain only the changeling. Its gruesome nature-- Cleary was immolated, either causing or immediately following her death--prompted extensive press coverage, at a time when her country's prospects for self-government were being hotly contested, and in a period in which folklore (such as fairies) had become a focus of Irish nationalists. The trial was closely followed by newspapers across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. As one reviewer commented,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> nobody, with the possible exception of the presiding judge, thought it was an ordinary murder case.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Cleary_a18d.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Cleary was born Bridget Boland around 1869 near <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clonmel.html" title="Clonmel">Clonmel</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> She married Michael Cleary in August of 1887. Bridget developed a reputation as an attractive, if somewhat uppity, woman. Somewhat unusually for the era and location, she was also a professional woman. She obtained a Singer sewing machine, state of the art at the time, and was variously described as a dressmaker and a milliner, or maker of ladies' hats.</p>
<p><a name=".22Disappearance.22"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Cleary_a18d.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Disappearance&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Disappearance"</span></h2>
<p>Bridget was reported missing in March of 1895. She had evidently been ill for several days, although her specific diagnosis is unknown.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> More than a week into her illness, on 13 March 1895, a physician visited her at her home; her condition was considered sufficiently grave that a priest soon followed, to give her last rites. Several of her friends and family members attended her over the next two days, and a number of home remedies were administered, including one ritual that anticipated her later demise: her father and her husband accused her of being a fairy sent into Bridget's place, urine was thrown on her, and she was carried before the fireplace to cast the fairy out.</p>
<p>By 16 March, rumors were beginning to circulate that Bridget was missing, and the local police began searching for her. Michael Cleary was quoted as claiming that his wife had been taken by fairies, and he appeared to be holding a vigil. Witness statements were gathered over the ensuing week, and by the time Bridget Cleary's burnt corpse was found in a shallow grave on 22 March, nine people had been charged in her disappearance, including her husband. A coroner's inquest the next day returned a verdict of death by burning.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Cleary_a18d.html" title="Edit section: Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trial</span></h2>
<p>Legal hearings ran from 1 April through 6 April 1895. A tenth person had been charged, and one of the original nine was discharged at this stage, leaving nine defendants bound over for trial. The court session began on 3 July, and the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Jury_c046.html" title="Grand Jury">Grand Jury</a> indicted five of the defendants for <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>, including Michael Cleary. All nine were indicted for "wounding." The case proceeded on to trial.</p>
<p>The evidence tended to show that on 15 March, Michael Cleary summoned the priest back to the Cleary household. Fr. Ryan found Bridget alive but agitated. Michael told Ryan that he had not been giving his wife the medicine prescribed by the doctor, because he had no faith in it. According to Ryan, "Cleary then said, 'People may have some remedy of their own that might do more good than doctor's medicine,' or something to that effect." Bridget was given communion, and Ryan departed. Later that night, neighbors and relatives returned to the Cleary house. An argument ensued, again tinged with fairy mythology. At some point, Bridget told Michael that the only person who'd gone off with the fairies had been his mother. Michael attempted to force-feed his wife, throwing her down on the ground before the kitchen fireplace and menacing her with a burning piece of wood. Bridget's chemise caught fire. Michael then threw lamp oil on Bridget; the witnesses were unclear as to whether she was already dead by this point. Michael kept the others back from her body as it burned, insisting that she was a changeling and had been for a week previously, and that he would get his wife back from the fairies.</p>
<p>Michael Cleary was found guilty of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manslaughter.html" title="Manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, and spent 15 years in prison. His co-defendants were convicted of wounding.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Cleary_a18d.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Cleary's death has remained famous in popular culture. An Irish nursery rhyme reads,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you a witch, or are you a fairy,/Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her death is also notable in more serious historical contexts. She is popularly described as the "the last witch burned in Ireland",<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, or as the occasion for the last of the witchcraft trials<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> although it has been noted<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> that Cleary was never actually described as a witch as ordinarily defined.</p>
<p>Cleary's death and the publicity surrounding the trial were regarded as being politically significant at the time. <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Rule_0742.html#Irish_home_rule" title="Home Rule">Irish home rule</a> was an active political issue in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>; <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_E._Gladstone_9e98.html" title="William E.
