<p>"Brig" and "brigantine" are not synonymous - for instance Chapelle's History of the American Sailing Navy, p. 392 makes reference to the <i>Porpoise</i> being built as a brigantine and later being re-rigged as a brig! The basic difference is in the use of fore-and-aft sail on the mainmast, but I'm still looking for a definitive authority to quote (good excuse for a short article also covering snows, bilanders, etc). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan Shebs</a> 04:55 Feb 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <i><a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> says brig and brigantine are different, from the definition of <i>brig</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. a. A vessel</dd>
<dd>(a) originally identical with the <i>brigantine</i> (of which word <i>brig</i> was a colloquial abbreviation); but, while the full name has remained with the unchanged brigantine, the shortened name has accompanied the modifications which have subsequently been made in rig, so that a brig is now</dd>
<dd>(b) A vessel with two masts square-rigged like a ship's fore- and main-masts, but carrying also on her main-mast a lower fore-and-aft sail with a gaff and boom.</dd>
<dd>A brig differs from a <i>snow</i> in having no try-sail mast, and in lowering her gaff to furl the sail. Merchant snows are often called <i>brigs</i>. This vessel was probably developed from the brigantine by the men-of-war brigs, so as to obtain greater sail-power.</dd>

<p>It seems that the terms <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brig.html" title="Brig">brig</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigantine.html" title="Brigantine">brigantine</a> may have been synonyms at times, and not at others.

<p>There has always been a huge amount of debate about where a two-masted schooner ends and a brig begins. After restoring, maintaining, and sailing aboard each of these types of vessels, many discussions with fellow tall-ship sailors of all persuasions, and researching as much as possible, I have determined that the progression is:</p>
<p><b>Two-Masted Schooner</b>: Two masts, both masts setting a sail attached to the mast at the luff. All sails fore-and-aft. Sails may be gaff or marconi.</p>
<p><b>Stays'l Schooner</b>: as above, but with no sail set with luff attached to foremast. One or more 'tween-mast stays'ls. Note: Modern Stays'l Schooners may sometimes set fore-and-aft tops'ls with luffs attached to the mast; this is outside the classical definitions.</p>
<p><b>Square-Tops'l Schooner</b>: As <b>Two-Masted Schooner</b>, but with square topsail(s) on the foremast. A course may be set on the fore.</p>
<p><b>Main-Tops'l Schooner</b>: As above, but with square tops'l(s) on main mast as well. No course is ever set on the main, but may (rarely) be set on the fore. The schooner <i>Sultana</i> is an example of this rare rig.</p>
<p><b>Brig(English)</b>: Two-masted. Square top'sl's and courses on both masts. No sparred fore-and-aft sail set on the foremast. Stays'ls set 'tween masts. Main course typically referred to as the "mains'l", while the sparred fore-and-aft sail set aft of the mainmast is typically called the "spanker" or "driver". The <i>Stavros S Niarchos</i> is an example, although rarely pictured with the maincourse set.</p>
<p><b>Brigantine(American)/Hermaphrodite Brigantine(English)</b>: As the <b>Stays'l Schooner</b>, with addition of square tops'ls and course on foremast. The <i>Exy Johnson</i> and <i>Irving Johnson</i> are the best examples that come to mind.</p>
<p><b>Brig(American)/Hermaphrodite Brig(English)</b>: As the <b>Brig(English)</b>, but with no course set on the mainmast. The sparred fore-and-aft sail set aft of the mainmast is typically referred to as the "mains'l". The <i>Lady Washington</i> is a good example of this rig.</p>
<p><b>Snow</b>: As the <b>Brig(English)</b>, with the sparred fore-and-aft sail aft of the mainmast set at the luff not to the mainmast itself, but to a small "tys'l mast" stepped immediately aft of the mainmast.</p>
<p>The major stumbling block is the difference between New World and Old World definitions. Also, there is the somewhat archaic convention of using terms like "Brig" or "Sloop" to denote classes of vessels based on tonnage or usage, not just rig types. Also, and very rarely, one sees a picture of a Main-Tops'l Schooner setting a full stack on the main, or even worse, a Brig(British) setting a gaff fores'l (like the reproduction <i>Pilgrim</i>). In these strange cases, the distinction is made by carefully scrutinizing the overall sail and rig proportions; a schooner derives her primary drive from fore-and-aft sails (the squares being auxillary sails), whereas the brig derives her primary drive from her tops'ls (the fore-and-aft sails being secondary). <a href="../../../o/s/t/User%7EOsteoderm_646e.html" title="User:Osteoderm">Osteoderm</a> 03:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am happy to see the difference between a Brig and Brigantine spelled out, although I wouldn't even know what was different was looking at the actual vessels unless it was pointed out to me by someone with more experience. The problem I have with maintaining Brig separately as a stub is that unless the article <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brig.html" title="Brig">Brig</a> is significant on it's own, it should be combined together with Brigantine and have the differences explained which is basically what is already being done now. Brig is an archaic reference to a similar type of ship and can refer back to Brigantine in order to clarify the differences between both.</p>
<p>The fact that Brig and Brigantine are not synonymous does not justify a separate page for Brig if it is only a stub. Unless there is significant content that clearly delineates one type of ship by another, not just a slight modification of the masts and ship construction, then the articles belong together, not separate.</p>
<p>In reviewing the other ship links, it would be likely that <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermaphrodite_brig.html" title="Hermaphrodite brig">Hermaphrodite brig</a> should also be combined here for the same reasons.</p>
<p>I thereby propose that Brig and Brigantine be combined. <a href="../../../g/o/h/User%7EGohiking_2c7c.html" title="User:Gohiking">Gohiking</a> 19:12, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Makes sense after all, since the definitions apparently vary through time and places. After a lifetime reading everything I happen to stumble on about sailingvessels, I can sum up that anyway in the Baltic it has <i>mostly</i> (not always) been defined that a <i>brig</i> has square sails on both masts, and a gaff sail in addition on the mizzen mast, whereas a <i>brigantine</i> has squares on the main mast, but only fore-aft sails on the mizzen, exactly as the pictures in both articles show today. <i>Snow</i> is an unknown type here, but seems to me to have more to do with size and possibly countryvise differings. With thorough explanation and redirections above proposal seems logical. <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslander%28Scandinavia%29_7131.html" title="User:Islander(Scandinavia)">Islander(Scandinavia)</a> 01:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this would be ok as long as <b>both terms</b> are <b>emboldened</b>, and the difference between the two is clearly articulated at the beginning of this article.

<dd>Modern parlance makes distinctions where, historically, there were none in regard to brig vs. brigantine. For much of the brig(antine)'s history as a working vessel, the terms <i>brig</i> and <i>brigantine</i> were fully interchangeable. Unless significant material can be added to contextualise these intimately related vessels, I agree that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigantine.html" title="Brigantine">Brigantine</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brig.html" title="Brig">Brig</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermaphrodite_brig.html" title="Hermaphrodite brig">Hermaphrodite brig</a> should be merged.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChang_E_6df0.html" title="User:Chang E">Chang E</a> 04:33, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The terms 'brig' and 'brigantine' are still interchangable for the most part. People know what a 'brigantine' is, but a 'brig' could be a 'brig' or a 'brigantine'. The difference between brigs and brigantines is incredibly small, and the 'brig' article is - right now - completely focused on that difference, leaving little to discuss. I think that if someone found a different focus for the article, while still conveying the difference it would be worth preserving the article individually. But as it stands the article could be merged into 'brigantine' with a line similar to: "a brig is similar to the brigantine, however it is square rigged on both masts". Edit: In light of the de-stubbing of the brig article and large addition of material I don't think that the articles 'brig' and 'brigantine' should be merged.
