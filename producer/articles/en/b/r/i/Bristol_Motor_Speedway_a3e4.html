<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Motor_Speedway_a3e4.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>One of the most popular tracks in NASCAR, this all-concrete construction is similar to <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dover_International_Speedway_2e01.html" title="Dover International Speedway">Dover</a>, except far shorter. The advertised banking of 36 degrees in the turns makes Bristol the most steeply banked track used by NASCAR (but see the <a href="#Trivia" title="">"Trivia"</a> section for a differing opinion on the turns). However, the track is so short that speeds here are far lower than is typical on most NASCAR oval tracks, but very fast compared to other short tracks due to the high banking, making for a considerable amount of "swapping paint". Also, the initial starting grid of 43 vehicles extends almost halfway around the track, meaning that the slower-qualifying cars begin the race almost half a lap down. Another anomaly is that the short overall length means that there are two sets of pits. Until 2002, slower starters were relegated to those on the backstretch. In 2002, the rules were changed to form essentially one long pit road. During caution periods, cars wishing to pit must enter pit road in turn two, drive all the way down the back stretch, through turns three and four and down the front stretch, exiting pit road in turn one. This rule eliminated the inherent disadvantage of pitting on the back stretch. Pit stops under green flag conditions have different rules. Cars with pits on the back stretch enter the pits in turn two and exit in turn three; Cars with pits on the front stretch enter the pits in turn four and exit in turn one. Since the new pit rules were instituted, several drivers have made major mistakes during green flag pit stops by driving through both pit roads when only one is necessary for green flag pit stops.</p>

Bristol Motor Speedway's Frontstrech Grandstand</div>

</div>
<p>The congestion inherent in this facility and the power of the cars has been likened to "flying fighter jets in a gymnasium" (the terms "washing machine" and "toilet" have also been used). The track is one that tends to be either loved or hated by fans and drivers alike--purists who grew up driving or attending races at older short tracks located at fairgrounds and similar places tend to love Bristol while those raised on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superspeedway.html" title="Superspeedway">superspeedway</a> racing tend to chafe at the lower speeds. Often, Bristol races are the scene of the highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_bd9d.html" title="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the unpredictable nature of the racing meant that this was one of the few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15 seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race his way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of his laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.</p>
<p>The drag strip at this facility has long been <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nicknamed</a> <i>Thunder Valley</i>. Both current <a href="../../../n/e/x/Nextel_Cup_1575.html" title="Nextel Cup">Nextel Cup</a> races held at Bristol are for 500 laps; the spring race (historically a day race; however, the 2006 race ended under nighttime conditions because Standard Time and the late afternoon start) is sponsored by area grocery chain <a href="../../../k/v/a/KVAT_Food_City_8144.html" title="KVAT Food City">Food City</a>, and considered one of <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_bd9d.html" title="NASCAR">NASCAR</a>'s top ten annual races.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. The late summer race (the popular night-time race, considered "the toughest ticket in NASCAR" to obtain) has rotated among several sponsors; the current sponsor is <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newell_Rubbermaid_2de6.html" title="Newell Rubbermaid">Newell Rubbermaid</a>'s <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharpie_%28marker%29.html" title="Sharpie (marker)">Sharpie</a> marker.</p>
<p>Tickets for the Bristol NASCAR event are said to be the second hardest to obtain in all of sports, second only to the opening ceremony of the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympics</a>. Bristol is also a very fertile ground for other levels and types of racing; <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busch_Series_8aef.html" title="Busch Series">Busch Series</a> races here often draw over 100,000 spectators, making it one of the best-drawing Busch venues, and resulted in the Fox network televising the race nationally in 2004-2006.</p>
<p>In 2004, it was the first Busch Series race of the season televised on broadcast network television, and the race, which had been 150 laps in 1982, 200 laps in 1984, and 250 laps since 1990, was a 300-lap race in 2006.</p>
<p>It is also the home of the only midweek (Wednesday) night NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series event, held in conjunction with a USAR Hooters ProCup event.</p>
<p>In the past, dirt has been spread over the oval and it has been used for <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprint_car_racing.html" title="Sprint car racing">sprint car</a> racing. Even these events have drawn over 100,000 spectators, a crowd almost unheard of in sprint history. Many of the fans come from the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Tennessee_a4d0.html" title="East Tennessee">East Tennessee</a> area, but thousands more come from all parts of the country to experience Bristol's unique brand of racing. Even in the off-season, the complex attracts fans during the Christmas season by facilitating a miles-long holiday lights display that culminates with a lap on the actual speedway track itself.</p>

<p>Bristol Motor Speedway could very easily have opened in 1961 under a different name. The first proposed site for the speedway was in <a href="../../../p/i/n/Piney_Flats%2C_Tennessee_a0ef.html" title="Piney Flats, Tennessee">Piney Flats</a> but, according to Carl Moore, who built the track along with Larry Carrier and R.G. Pope, the idea met local opposition. So the track that could have been called Piney Flats International Speedway, was built five miles down the road on Highway 11-E in Bristol. The land, upon which Bristol Motor Speedway is built, used to be a dairy farm. Larry Carrier and Carl Moore traveled to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway_18dc.html" title="Charlotte Motor Speedway">Charlotte Motor Speedway</a> in 1960 to watch a race and it was then that they decided to build a speedway in northeast Tennessee. However, they wanted a smaller model of CMS, something with a more intimate setting and opted to erect a half-mile facility instead of mirroring the 1.5-mile track in Charlotte.</p>
<p>Work began on what was then called Bristol International Speedway in 1960 and it took approximately one year to finish. Carrier, Moore and Pope scratched many ideas for the track on envelopes and brown paper bags.</p>
<p>Purchase of the land on which BMS now sits, as well as initial construction of the track, cost approximately $600,000. The entire layout for BMS covered 100 acres and provided parking for more than 12,000 cars. The track itself was a perfect half-mile, measuring 60 feet wide on the straightaways, 75 feet wide in the turns and the turns were banked at 22 degrees. <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seating_capacity.html" title="Seating capacity">Seating capacity</a> for the very first NASCAR race at BMS – held on July 30, 1961 – was 18,000. Prior to this race the speedway hosted weekly races. The first driver on the track for practice on July 27, 1961 was <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tiny_Lund_f05f.html" title="Tiny Lund">Tiny Lund</a> in his <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac.html" title="Pontiac">Pontiac</a>. The second driver out was <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Pearson_90a8.html" title="David Pearson">David Pearson</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Lorenzen_f593.html" title="Fred Lorenzen">Fred Lorenzen</a> won the pole for the first race at BMS with a speed of 79.225 mph. Atlanta’s <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Smith_f37c.html" title="Jack Smith">Jack Smith</a> won the inaugural event – the Volunteer 500 – at BMS. However, Smith wasn’t in the driver’s seat of the Pontiac when the race ended. Smith drove the first 290 laps then had to have <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Allen_%28NASCAR%29_8546.html" title="Johnny Allen (NASCAR)">Johnny Allen</a>, also of Atlanta, take over as his relief driver. The two shared the $3,225 purse. The total purse for the race was $16,625. Country music star <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenda_Lee_cad4.html" title="Brenda Lee">Brenda Lee</a>, who was 17 at the time, sang the national anthem for the first race at BMS. A total of 42 cars started the first race at BMS but only 19 finished.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1969 BMS was reshaped and re-measured. The turns were banked at 36 degrees and it became a .533-mile oval.</p>
<p>The speedway was sold after the 1976 season to Lanny Hester and Gary Baker. In the spring of 1978 the track name was changed to Bristol International Raceway. In August of that year, the first night race was held on the oval, one that would become one of the most popular and highly anticipated events on the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup (nee Winston Cup) Series calendar.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1982 Lanny Hester sold his half of the speedway to Warner Hodgdon. On July 6, 1983, Hodgdon completed 100 percent purchase of Bristol Motor Speedway, as well as <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Speedway_3029.html" title="Nashville Speedway">Nashville Speedway</a>, in a buy-sell agreement with Baker. Hodgdon named Larry Carrier as the track’s general manager. On January 11, 1985, Hodgdon filed for bankruptcy. Afterwards, Larry Carrier formally took possession of the speedway and covered all outstanding debts.</p>
<p>In 1992, the speedway abandoned the asphalt surface that it had used since its inception, switching to the concrete surface it is now famous for.</p>
<p>On Jan. 22, 1996, Larry Carrier sold the speedway to Bruton Smith's <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedway_Motorsports%2C_Inc._2a7c.html" title="Speedway Motorsports, Inc.">Speedway Motorsports, Inc.</a> (SMI), at a purchase price of $26 million. At the time of the sale, the facility seated 71,000. On May 28 of that same year, the track’s name was officially changed to Bristol Motor Speedway. By August, 15,000 seats had been added bringing the seating capacity to 86,000.</p>
<p>BMS continued to grow and by April of 1997 was the largest sports arena in Tennessee and one of the largest in the country, seating 118,000. The speedway also boasted 22 new skyboxes. For the August 1998 Goody’s 500 the speedway featured more than 131,000 grandstand seats and 100 skyboxes. Improvements to the speedway since Smith took possession are in excess of $50 million. Under Smith's ownership, all seating sections have been renamed for past race winners and NASCAR champions.</p>
<p>The capacity for the Food City 500 in March of 2000 was 147,000 as the Kulwicki Terrace and Kulwicki Tower were completed. Both were named after the late NASCAR star <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Kulwicki_6b17.html" title="Alan Kulwicki">Alan Kulwicki</a>, who was the reigning NASCAR champion when he died in a plane crash in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> while on his way to the spring race at Bristol, which he won the previous year. As a tribute to retiring star <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrell_Waltrip_f1f8.html" title="Darrell Waltrip">Darrell Waltrip</a>, the entire Turn 3 and 4 sections were renamed in his honor in 2000, including a section of seats in Turn 4 near the start-finish line marked as alcohol free. (Waltrip refused to drive for a team in 1987 because its sponsor was of alcoholic beverages.) The Allison family and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Pearson_90a8.html" title="David Pearson">David Pearson</a> were also each given grandstands as part of the renaming of grandstands.</p>
<p>As has been the case since the SMI purchase of BMS, improvements continued in and around the Speedway. The 2002 season saw the addition of a long-awaited infield pedestrian tunnel, allowing access into and out of the infield during on-track activity. Also in 2002, a new building was constructed in the infield to house driver meetings. That same year also witnessed the christening of a new BMS Victory Lane atop the newly constructed building. <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Busch_1a43.html" title="Kurt Busch">Kurt Busch</a> won the 2002 Food City 500 on March 24 and became the first Cup winner in the new BMS winner's circle. Additional improvements in 2002 included new scoreboards located on the facing of the suites in Turns 2 and 3.</p>
<p>On Monday, August 26, 2002 work began on the most ambitious construction project since SMI's purchase of BMS in 1996. The entire backstretch, including the Speedway’s last remaining concrete seats, was demolished. The new backstretch increased the venue’s seating capacity to more than 160,000. The new backstretch includes three levels of seating and is topped with 52 luxury skybox suites. These seats are also named for NASCAR figures, with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Petty_5d34.html" title="Richard Petty">Richard Petty</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cale_Yarborough_0927.html" title="Cale Yarborough">Cale Yarborough</a>, and Robert Glen Johnson, Jr. each having a section of the new seats named for them. <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt_2015.html" title="Dale Earnhardt">Dale Earnhardt</a> was given a section in his memory on top.</p>

<ul>
<li>In an interview with <i>Stock Car Racing'</i>s Larry Cothren, driver <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Newman_463f.html" title="Ryan Newman">Ryan Newman</a> openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, and found that the turns were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The 2006 Disney-Pixar film <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Cars_%28film%29.html" title="Cars (film)">Cars</a></i> used Bristol Motor Speedway as the basis for the racetrack seen in the film's opening race, the "Motor Speedway of the South." The size of the track was increased to give it a more stadium-like appearance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For many years, teams were unable to park their transporters inside the infield. Nor did the track have any significant garage area. Team transporters were parked in a lot outside of the track. During racing periods, crews and participants were landlocked by the track, and thus, unable to return to the transporters for spare parts, repairs, or rest. In the early 1990's, the infield was reconfigured, and completely paved. Teams began parking the transporters in an orchestrated, extremely tight arrangement that takes several hours, and highly skilled drivers, to accomplish. Teams are now able to work out of their transporters in the same fashion as other facilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On March 25, 2007, the first race featuring <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_bd9d.html" title="NASCAR">NASCAR</a>'s new car design, the "<a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_of_Tomorrow_3893.html" title="Car of Tomorrow">Car of Tomorrow</a>" (COT) was run at Bristol Motor Speedway. <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gordon_d0fa.html" title="Jeff Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> won the first ever pole award in a Car of Tomorrow, and <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyle_Busch_b22f.html" title="Kyle Busch">Kyle Busch</a> won the race, becoming the first winner in the COT.</li>

<p>In 2005, track owner Bruton Smith made a public offer of $20 million apiece to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Tennessee_21d3.html" title="University of Tennessee">University of Tennessee</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University_a523.html" title="Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University">Virginia Tech</a> to schedule a non-conference <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">college football</a> game between the powerhouse <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Volunteers_football_5a79.html" title="Tennessee Volunteers football">Volunteers</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_football_7f5f.html" title="Virginia Tech Hokies football">Hokies'</a> programs. Smith suggested that grass could be grown in the infield section of the racetrack. Virginia Tech was said to be interested, but Tennessee was not supporting the proposal at this time due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
<p>If a football game was held at BMS, it would undoubtedly draw over 150,000 spectators, which would break all previous American team sports records for attendance. The track's location near the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>/<a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> state line puts BMS about 125 miles from Tech's campus in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacksburg%2C_Virginia_4987.html" title="Blacksburg, Virginia">Blacksburg, Virginia</a> and about 110 miles from the UT campus in <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee_7d3c.html" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>.</p>
<p>Holding a football game at the site would now seem highly impractical following the recent construction of a tall scoring pylon &amp; jumbotron in the infield.</p>

<p>In addition to the speedway, there is a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarter_mile.html" title="Quarter mile">quarter mile</a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragstrip.html" title="Dragstrip">dragstrip</a> that hosts an annual <a href="../../../n/h/r/NHRA_e653.html" title="NHRA">NHRA</a> event each year. Prior to its status as an NHRA national event track Bristol Dragway had a long association with the rival <a href="../../../i/h/r/IHRA_7c13.html" title="IHRA">IHRA</a> organization through Larry Carrier which ended when Bruton Smith took over its ownership. The dragstrip has long been <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nicknamed</a> <i>Thunder Valley</i> due to its location and surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>(Ironically, Carrier's sons now field cars in the NHRA.)</p>
