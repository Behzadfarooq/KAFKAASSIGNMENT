<p>Hello Brian, and welcome to Wikipedia. Re: the encyc. Frobozzia&#160;: more Zork information is a good thing! But it should be in the form of neat, structured encyclopedia articles, not random links to original sources. It will be excellent to have the original in Wikisource, and to have articles about <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Frobozzia_89ff.html" title="Encyclopedia Frobozzia">Encyclopedia Frobozzia</a>, the Zork Universe, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>That is, if someone searches for "Belwit" or "Belwit Flathead", they would automatically be redirected to the actual entry about Belwit Flathead in the Wikisource EF article</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redirection to original content is not our goal. When someone searches for these terms, they should not find a stub-article, or an original-source article (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> the place for original content), but a contextualized discussion of, say, Belwit Flathead. That would not be in an article devoted solely to B.F., but in a broader article with enough depth to mature into a good read, and with internal links to other Zork and EF content.</p>

<p>Yeah, I noticed <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoma.html" title="Acoma">Acoma</a> was pointing to the wrong place too, but forgot to change it. I'm curious - were most pages which referred to Acoma referring to the Pueblo itself, or were nearby villages included in the link context? I ask because according to what I have read, about 50 people live in the Pueblo proper, but nearly 3000 people live on the federal trust land surrounding the pueblo. I'm considering creating the article for <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoma_Pueblo_5ded.html" title="Acoma Pueblo">Acoma Pueblo</a>, but if you feel strongly and would like to, I found quite good information from Encyclopedia Britannica (subscription only), New Mexico Magazine (<a href="http://www.nmmagazine.com/NMGUIDE/acoma.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nmmagazine.com/NMGUIDE/acoma.html" rel="nofollow">www.nmmagazine.com/NMGUIDE/acoma.html</a>), and the US Census Bureau (<a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/AdvGeoSearchByPlacenameServlet?_command=getResults&amp;_keyword=Acoma&amp;_programYear=50&amp;_geoAreaType=ALL&amp;_treeId=420&amp;_currentGeoAreaType=ALL&amp;_geoIdsHierarchy=&amp;_geos=&amp;_placename=25100US0010999&amp;_geoBucketId=50&amp;_lang=en" class="external text" title="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/AdvGeoSearchByPlacenameServlet?_command=getResults&amp;_keyword=Acoma&amp;_programYear=50&amp;_geoAreaType=ALL&amp;_treeId=420&amp;_currentGeoAreaType=ALL&amp;_geoIdsHierarchy=&amp;_geos=&amp;_placename=25100US0010999&amp;_geoBucketId=50&amp;_lang=en" rel="nofollow">here</a>). -<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 21:53, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed the problem because I was going to put a satellite photo of the mesa on the Acoma Pueblo page (which doesn't exist). It looked most or all of the links were talking about the pueblo, not about the surrounding land (and <i><b>definitely not</b></i> about the city in MN. You can start a page if you want to, I'm not particularly good at encyclopedic writing. If you do create a page, add this template in for some cool picture links: --[[User:Brian0918|<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918">brian0918</a> <sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918">talk</a></sub>]] 22:04, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Terrific find on the Ansel Adams picture of Acoma Pueblo. I had seen some similar pictures, but none included copyright information, so I went with the dusty and old 1899 variety. When (eventually) I get some time, I'm going to work at bringing in a bit of information from a few of those sites I listed on the talk page - but for now it's final exam studying time. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 20:43, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you've misunderstood one of the recommendations in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Battles_64fd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles</a>. The name "Battles of the X Campaign of the Y War" is preferred over "Y War Battles of the X Campaign", but World War II and Vietnam are exceptions to this that no-one has yet had the enthusiasm to change. But that's not a big deal, we can live with a bit of inconsistency. My main concern is that these categories will sit empty for a long time and just make it hard for people to find the article they want when browsing the categories. Surely, the time to make a Category:American Civil War cavalry operations along the Rappahannock is when you have three or four articles about such operations and the parent category is looking crowded. I think it will be many years before we have that kind of level of detail, if ever.</dd>

Logically speaking we might eventually need a Category:Battles of the Gorlice-Tarnow campaign of World War I ... but since we don't even have an article on the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_the_Masurian_Lakes_f70b.html" title="Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes">Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes</a> it would seem a bit premature to make such a category.

<dd>I didn't know that WWII and Vietnam were exceptions. I was going simply by the examples they gave in the WikiProject, which seemed fine. I do think that the categories are necessary, even if they remain blank. Not only do they encourage people to add to wikipedia, but they also allow one to understand the timeframe of the battle/campaign as well as other events in the war. Also, by creating all of the categories now, I am encouraging people in the future to put them in the proper category, instead of a generic list of battles category. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918">brian0918</a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918">™</a> 02:15, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sure, and congrats on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads_f10a.html" title="Battle of Hampton Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads</a> featured article! It is my second, and with several failure, I can attest that it is not easy to accomplish. The map came from the library of Virginia website. They have 4 old state-sponsored maps of the entire state (on-line), one done around 1827?, and then a revision put out in 1858-59. The on-line version has ability to zoom sections, etc. You can get a lot more detail if desired. I used the later, multi part version, and zoomed in to get the Hampton Roads area as it was presented just before the Civil War. I have read both dates in various places (1858-59).</p>

<p>It looks as the two of us share a common interest in civil war battles. I am in the process of writing new articles on various civil war battles and adding content to existing articles. Judging by the amount of red links on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_the_American_Civil_War" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_the_American_Civil_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_the_American_Civil_War</a> there is a lot of work to be done.

<dd><i>I haven't had much of an interest in the civil war until recently. It started with editing the Battle of Hampton Roads article (which recently became a Feature Article), and I noticed that the campaignboxes for the civil war were nonexistent... so, after some work, I made all of Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles/Campaignboxes#American Civil War those, and moved on to putting battleboxes on all the existing battle page, along with public domain pictures when available. Right now, I'm working on a US map showing which counties were involved in the civil war, color coded for the theater and year of battle. This could... take some time... hehe...</i></dd>

<p>It looks great a job well done. Just a thought (and i know this would take a long time) but it would be neat if you could click on one of the counties with in the map that would then take you to a list of all the battles that took place in that county.

<p>The Battle of Fort Blakely officaly took place over 8 days (april 2-9) however the main attack, and only real attack, on Fort Blakely was on April 9. The total amount of Casualties listed is 4,475 but [<a href="http://www2.cr.nps.gov/abpp/battles/al006.htm|" class="external text" title="http://www2.cr.nps.gov/abpp/battles/al006.htm|" rel="nofollow">this site</a>] inculdes the casualties resulting from the main attack on April 9. In the battle box i only put these cassulites(the ones from april 9, mainly becuase that was the only real attack).

<p>Thanks, Brian, for your message back from a month ago... I learned only today how to communicate with others at Wikipedia, and I don't check in all that often. You had asked me to "fix your statements" ... but I didn't write those statements. I actually have done <b>very little</b> on that page, as there are many "crazies" on this topic, and I didn't feel it fair to go in and perform the revamp the page needs. (Some pro-genocide zealots have done exactly that, feeling free to make extensive changes.) This is why there have been conflicting statements throughout.</p>
<p>I believe someone has made a change already, putting in "between 1.3 and 1.7 million Armenians." In actuality, the range by most "neutral" observers fell between 1 million and 1.5 million. I believe there were 1.5 million, myself.</p>
<p>Thanks for your concern; I can see from this page you are involved in matters of history, and my appreciation goes to those who give priority to the truth, instead of their passions... the same way I'm sure you are as appreciative.</p>

<p>I can't be arsed re-working it mate. I've heard people like Innes, Cleavland, Booth and Barry Took referred to as the 7th Python at some stage.

<p>What's with the mass editing to remove usage of "perforated"? I'm assuming this is a British vs American usage difference.</p>
<p>In any case, using "perforated" as an adjective is perfectly acceptable according to numerous dictionaries, and these sorts of edits aren't generally welcome, and are usually pedantry. Please see <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_%28Keep_in_mind%29_4ca8.html#U.S._English_vs._British_English" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial (Keep in mind)">Wikipedia:Tutorial_(Keep_in_mind)#U.S._English_vs._British_English</a>, for example. -- <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKaszeta_0108.html" title="User:Kaszeta">Kaszeta</a> 16:59, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You asked which dictionary I used, claiming that dictionary.com list perforate as the only adjective. I hereby present <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=perforated" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=perforated" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which defines "perforated" as "adj. Having been perforated."</dd>

<dd>I strongly agree. Princeton's Wordnet also lists "perforated" and cites as an example "a perforated balloon." Likewise, as a common usage example, Google finds 765 hits for "a perforate [x]" and 155,000 hits for "a perforated [x]," implying that the web prefers "perforated" as an adjective 200 to 1. It may be a British vs American usage difference, as Kaszeta suggests above, but articles written in US English, such as <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espresso.html" title="Espresso">Espresso</a>, should remain consistant throughout the article.

<p>Note <a href="http://www.m-w.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.m-w.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/</a> agrees that perforate is a verb. You made these changes a bit mechanically... at <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postage_Stamp_8c74.html" title="Postage Stamp">Postage Stamp</a> the word "perforated" was used as a verb, not as an adjective, so your modification couldn't possibly have been correct. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 19:34, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you can see from the above, in U. S. usage "perforated" is a perfectly good adjective. Your statement that "perforate is the correct adjective, never perforated" is just plain incorrect. Furthermore, in the U. S. the adjective <i>perforated</i> is so much more common than the adjective <i>perforate</i> that to use the latter invites puzzlement and misunderstanding. The adjective <i>perforate</i> is used, but only in limited scientific, medical, and technical contexts. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:59, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. S. Before going off and making this kind of wholesale change you should have discussed this somewhere, reached consensus, and included a link to the discussion in your edit comments. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:03, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. P. S. It's puzzling to me that under the entry <i>perforate,</i> AHD3 indicates <i>perforate</i> (and only <i>perforate</i>) as the -adj form, and then lists the adjective <i>perforated</i> as a separate entry, without comment or discussion. I wonder whether by any chance you could have consulted a dictionary that did the same thing? Still, I don't see how the definition for "perforated" could possibly be clearer. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:09, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know that it's worth complaining about or fixing, but your thorough capitalization of military ranks does not conform to regular English usage or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.
