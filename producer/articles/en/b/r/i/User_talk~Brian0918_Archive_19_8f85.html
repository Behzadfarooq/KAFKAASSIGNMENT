<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have, at the RfA, asked you to account for the striking of my first vote, by you, in an edit marked minor. While it is true my reasons were per Blackcap (and he struck his vote later), I provided an additional sentence to justify my vote. At the least, such a questionable striking warranted notice to me. Instead, I happened to wander by, and wonder if I hadn't voted before. I voted anew, and then (on fully reading the record of the vote) saw I had been stricken. I object very strongly, and am most upset. I think the silent, minor marked, striking was an attempt to "game the vote", to be frank, because I can see no other compelling reason to strike my vote (which had an independent reason) without at least notice to me. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:58, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me be clearer: I did provide an alternate rationale in my first vote. Your strike was a grave mistake (grave considering it supported your own side in the debate, and can rightly be called an act of bias.) I expect two remedies: an apology (not yet received), and a promise from you that you will not strike another vote of mine, because we now have a history of conflict (if I should cast an obviously invalid one, find someone else to do it.) If these two things are not forthcoming, I will be forced to regard your every edit to RfAs with suspicion, and revert any strikes you make myself. Please do the honorable thing, so we can put this behind us. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:20, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Apology accepted. I would consider excluding "per X", however, I feel that doing so would be less than honest in cases where another user's rationale convinced me. I urge you not to strike <i>any</i> votes on this account, unless "per X" are the only two words in the following vote. In any case, I will assume that you will abide by my suggestion above, and leave my votes for someone else to strike. While I am content to leave this matter settled, any other questionable strike by you to me (or vice versa, actually) would be a very, very bad thing.

<p>Incidentally, regarding the discussion we were having at the Norton RfA, I dispute the notion that my analogy is false. An admin who blocks, or cleans articles, without ever having posted to the Administrator's Noticeboard, any Wikiproject, or AfD is not likely to know what he's doing. Even if you are one of those who feel AfD is broken, admins should at least have experience <i>in the mouth of the beast</i> as it were, so that they are prepared to nagivate the Wiki effectively.

He keeps citing the 2 objections that were made on the talk page (his objection and that of one other user), but ignores the fact that the consensus outvoted him on the template's talk page. So what gives? Perhaps you should change it again citing the consensus on the talk page. The approvals outnumber the objections.

<p>G'day Brian,</p>
<p>I see you've deleted {{Help Wikiboxes}}, and thereby done your little part in keeping a <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_war.html" title="Wheel war">wheel war</a> going. Congratulations. Don't do it again. Wheel warring — even deliberately taking on a tiny rôle in same — is disruptive, and lowers the level of trust the community has in its administrators. You command a great deal of respect on Wikipedia, and you should know better.

<dd>Fair enough. In the interests of fairness, after leaving a rather harsh warning on <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">User:DESiegel</a>'s talkpage, I thought it best to leave blanket warnings on everyone else's talkpages, too.

<p>For the sake of skimmers, date bots, and other nice and gentle folks - please don't change the timestamp format (as you do in your sig). It slows down the reading of talk page comments quite a lot, and is unnecessarily confusing.

<p>How can you rollback without any notice to me or explanation?

<dl>
<dd>Its intent is solely to be a timesaving shortcut for reverting mass vandalism... No one should ever be in an edit war, sysops in particular should be aware that that's not cool, so there's no need to think about whether or not 'rollback' should be used in an edit war. It shouldn't, because we shouldn't be in that position in the first place.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what's the deal? If you're acusing me of vandalism, out with it! If not, then what are you doing rolling me back? <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedernst_685a.html" title="User talk:Tedernst">talk</a> 03:11, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You're quoting a page that isn't even a guideline as if it was policy. I tend to restrict my rollbacks to vandalism, but it was just easier to undo the unfounded redirecting of templates and deletion of categories. And I did leave you a message on your talk page. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-2 03:18</small>
<ul>
<li>You left me a message that didn't say you were going to revert dozens of edits in one fell swoop. Personally, I feel that requires a bit more explanation than that. This smacks of abuse of admin power to me. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedernst_685a.html" title="User talk:Tedernst">talk</a> 04:43, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Anyone can make their own rollback button. It is not restricted to admins in any way. And, I didn't revert "dozens" of your edits, just those that basically undid hundreds/thousands of other people's edits (by redirecting all the disambig templates to the same generic one, and deleting specific disambig categories from articles). — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-2 04:44</small></li>

<p>I didn't revert anybody. I made edits in good faith. Don't you believe you have a responsibility to communicate when reverting? Especially when mass reverting? <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedernst_2c24.html" title="User:Tedernst">Tedernst</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedernst_685a.html" title="User talk:Tedernst">talk</a> 08:43, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I also think you need to have quite a consensus to be able to undo hundreds/thousands of other people's edits. You simply proposed the idea, waited for someone who agreed with you to reply, and then went forward with it. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-2 16:01</small></li>

<p>I'm not questioning you reverting me. I'm questioning your mass-reverting me without notifying me (or the relevant talk pages) that you had done so.

<ul>
<li>I replied on your talk page right when I reverted the edits you made. I don't need to notify you specifically about my reversion of your edits, since the templates/categories don't belong to you, but I notified you of the reasons for the reversion. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-6 04:57</small></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course they don't belong to me. I'm not trying to assert any kind of ownership or different status than any other editor. When reverting, I believe it customary to explain, either in the edit summary of the reverting edit itself, or on a relevant talk page. Your note on my talk page didn't even tell me what you were talking about. I didn't realize what you meant until I saw the discussion at MoS:DP. As a reminder, here's what you wrote:</p>

<dd>Before undoing hundreds or thousands of edits, you may want to discuss this first.

<p>Hi, I was wondering if I gave you a list of names- if you could email me the full text articles from Britannica - for the sake of comparison. I'd galdly repay the favor if you need articles, my Uni library doesn't waste the $$ on a Britannica subscription.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 08:55, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm after Ernst Mayr, G. Ledyard Stebbins, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Theodosius Dobzhansky and George Gaylord Simpson. My email is holmespeta at yahoo dot com. Thanks heaps.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 12:35, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, they all made it. I wanted them specifically to fact check the Britannica versions, and will probably report the errors on the talk pages of the relevant articles as I work on our versions.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 09:27, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am in one of my first big disputes regarding the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Antietam_e90e.html" title="Battle of Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> and whether it is POV. Would you mind looking at the Talk page and give me your opinion of whether I am handling this correctly?

<dd>I haven't looked at the dispute thoroughly, but if it's simply based on whether the battle is considered a victory/loss for the North/South, the only thing you can do is to see what the most reputable sources have to say. Don't try to find sources that agree with the original version, or that disagree with the proposed version. Simply check as many sources as possible. If they disagree in some way, then just explain that in the article. The one-word summary is not that important. Explaining what the sources have to say is more important. — 0918BRIAN • 2006-01-5 23:10</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks. well, the problem is that I do not know of any credible sources that argue that Antietam was not a strategic victory and this guy does not seem amenable to providing such sources, only complaining about the way I am treating him. Frankly, I believe the problem may stem from his misunderstanding of what the word "strategic" means, and I do not believe it is justified to rewrite the article to include such an explanation. Maybe he will come up with something more tangible when he cools down. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 23:30, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You removed the link, and I understand your reason for the change. Yes, I click off the checkbox too. But over the past weeks I have seen at least three RFAs of users misusing minor edits. Essentially, the option is there, but not explained. Would you rather a separate link saying "<small>(<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">what are they?</a>)</small>"?

<dd>I'd rather something like (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">?</a>) or (<a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">help</a>) to a little asterisk. As for your other comment: A lot is expected of users running for adminship. There are a lot of policies, and "minor edits" may seem intuitive to some when their intuition is simply incorrect (I had thought that a minor edit was anything not a <i>major</i> edit, and had marked so until a week before my RFA). Hence users will not look it up unless there is a guide to do so. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 04:46, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There's currently a controversy at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">Cold fusion</a> that I would appreciate it if you could look at. The article is about to fail a Featrued Article Removal Candidate <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote.html" title="Vote">vote</a>. There are at least 3 fairly different versions in play: one based on the original Featured Article dating back to 2004-08-20 and tossing out all edits between now and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33905552" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33905552" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> ("FA version"), one which was the current version up until that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33645188" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion&amp;oldid=33645188" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> ("current version"), and a proposed new draft written originally by Edmund Storms (a retired Los Alamos scientist) and edited by me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion/tmp&amp;oldid=33876153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cold_fusion/tmp&amp;oldid=33876153" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> ("Storms version"). At the moment the article is being rather agressively edited by a few people who support the version from a year ago, and if this stands, a lot of good material will be lost. Frankly, I can't entirely support any of the versions; the article just needs more work and more different perspectives. Hence this invitation. I hope you can help.</p>
<p>I'm posting this to you because I've seen you on various physics-related pages, and/or because you've worked on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">Cold fusion</a> page before. Thank you for your time.</p>

<li>No, pointless now anyway, but thanks. I'd council you to <i>not</i> continue to replace your neutral votes. While it's a bit iffy to make up a rule and then enforce it (just realised that I have not yet confirmed that my memoery matches the diffs, must check after this) there is no way that putting them back is going to stand. Regardless of anything else, NS has done enough work on this that he'll have support, not to mention it makes sense. You're pushing it uphill for little return on investment. People see when the link to the talk page is blue, they'll pop over to look.<br />

<p>Hi! There <i>was</i> consensus for this, I'm afraid. The rules were that only support and oppose votes were allowed, and that extensive commentary was <i>not</i> allowed. Neutral votes are, per definition, neither support nor oppose, and only serve to comment; therefore, they will be moved to the talk page. Please cease obstructing the janitors' work in enforcing the rules of election.

<ul>
<li>A neutral is just as much an opinion as a support or oppose. Just because people have decided it shouldn't count doesn't mean it should be ignored. In any case, the rules (before you unilaterally changed them) provided for neutral votes by saying that they counted as abstention. — <small><sub><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#444444">0918</font></a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left:-24px; margin-right:-24px;"><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="#222222">BRIAN</font></b></a></span></sup> • 2006-01-9 17:56</small>

<p>I dunno, maybe you should ask for some more opninos but I don't really find myself jumping to the thought that it is worthy of FP. At full res it's not that sharp and a little blotchy. But hey, its just me, but if you still want to nominate it, it might be an idea to what a little while as after Diliff's latast ultrapanoramas I think people maybe a little less likely to support. It's a good image, and that kind of "stock" image with a white bckgrnd I fell is the best kind of photo for an article; and a photo like that should at one stage get featured, but I'm not sure this is the one.

<p>As with all broad prescriptions, Brian, there are going to be exceptions. Vandals and trolls are <i>mostly</i> minor annoyances, but I don't mean by that that there are none that ever cause a problem. I'm rather criticising the view that they are <i>the</i> problem. If you can think of a better formulation though, you're welcome to edit the page.

<p>My school's IP, 65.43.196.54, has been blocked because of repeated vandalism. I use Wikipedia a lot at school, and edit/fix articles when I have nothing else to do. This IP is from an organization that provides internet access for about 50 schools, so the vandalism probably didn't come from my school. Could you unblock this IP so I can edit, or is there some way everyone but registered users can be blocked from editing from this IP?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I notice the drop-down menu doesn't say "More special characters" at the top, as it did. I strongly recommend that this text be replaced. "Wiki" doesn't make sense to anyone, even me, and does not attract anyone to select this menu for more characters; just causes confusion. The text (in tiny font) on the far right of the previous line "See menu for more" does not help much to direct people in the right direction either, as it doesn't say which menu, what type of menu, where the menu is, or for more "what." Thanks; your keeping this as easy as possible to use for everyone, along every step of the way, is greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 19:49, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you; I did do that, and now it says "More characters." It did say that over the past day or so, but not today before I F5ed. Before doing the F5, I carefully checked the menu several times and the very top selection was "Wiki," not "More characters." So how does this help the (thousands of?) people who didn't know to perform this arcane computer trick? Shouldn't it be set so that one doesn't have to do the F5 trick? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 20:17, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Brian, thanks for your edits to <a href="../../../c/i/t/MediaWiki%7ECite_text_9fe4.html" title="MediaWiki:Cite text">MediaWiki:Cite text</a>. I'd like you to consider not changing the bullet point "Author: Wikipedia contributors" to "Authors: <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/counter/?hide_minor=on&amp;page=User_talk:Brian0918/Archive_19" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tim/counter/?hide_minor=on&amp;page=User_talk:Brian0918/Archive_19" rel="nofollow">View the list of Wikipedia contributors</a>" -- everything in this list is designed to be easily copy-and-pasted to be assembled into a complete citation, in case the provided styles don't meet the user's needs. The "author" they should be using in their citations is "Wikipedia contributors.</p>
<p>I do think the link you added is very helpful, and should definitely remain as a separate "Primary contributors" bullet point (perhaps indented under "Author"); I just don't think the two items should be merged.</p>
<p>Note there's another tool for listing page contributors that provides somewhat more detailed information: <a href="http://vs.aka-online.de/cgi-bin/wppagehiststat.pl" class="external free" title="http://vs.aka-online.de/cgi-bin/wppagehiststat.pl" rel="nofollow">http://vs.aka-online.de/cgi-bin/wppagehiststat.pl</a> . The TDS tool you linked probably provides sufficient detail for most would-be citers, though, and I'm not sure the AKA tool can accept input on the desired article from a link.</p>

<p>Thank you for changing it back. Actually a lot of people are looking at the page, as we are linked to from the Main Page's talk page, with a notice right at the top of that page. And this project may actually replace the main page some day, which will make the use of the code universal. If there is a way to accomplish what you are trying, Wikipedia's javascript experts should be able to help. One user who is pretty adept at this stuff is <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarb_039a.html" title="User:Cesarb">User:cesarb</a>. Perhaps he could answer your questions on whether or not what you were trying can be made to work.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../z/o/r/Image%7EZorkmidfront.jpg_4bbd.html" title="Image:Zorkmidfront.jpg">Image:Zorkmidfront.jpg</a></b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the image qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other images, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brian0918_Archive_19_c69e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brian0918/Archive 19">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the link! As for my edits, I checked that each school had an article for that school in that city before deleting it. I would have left links in the edit summary, but it was too long. There were some schools listed twice in different cities - in those cases, I checked to make sure two different schools existed. In some cases, people would list a school under a city and a community, so I removed the community reference and left the other link with the city. If you have any questions about a particular chnage, just ask me and I'll tell you my rationale.

<p>Okay, you're looking to create a flexible diaphragm and a wire going around a pulley, right?</p>
<p>I'm going to assume you've worked out the basics of getting things to animate in 3D studio - if you need more detail, drop me a message.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the flexible diaphragm I suggest <b>Plane Object</b> from the Objects toolbar.</li>
<li>Right-click on it and select <b>Convert to editable mesh</b>.</li>
<li>On the panel to the right of the 3ds window, select the one-but-leftmost tab, <b>modify</b>.</li>
<li>In the scrolly bit that makes up the bottom two thirds of the right-hand panel, just below the 'selection' box there should be 5 little red icon button bits. The leftmost should have 3 red dots on it, tooltip <b>vertex</b>. Click this button.</li>
<li>All the points ('vertexes') of the plane object should be marked with blue dots.</li>
<li>Select the <b>select and move tool</b> on the Main toolbar and <b>try moving the blue dots</b> around.</li>
<li>When you're used to moving vertexes around, <b>redo the instructions above</b> so you have a new plane object.</li>
<li>In the 'modify' tab of the right-hand panel thing, find the <b>soft selection</b> section. You might have to click it to expand it.</li>
<li>Tick <b>use soft selection</b></li>
<li>Click a vertex in the middle of your plane object.</li>
<li>It should go <b>red</b>. Depending on how big your plane object is, <b>other vertexes might change colour</b>.</li>
<li>Mess around with the <b>falloff</b> property of 'soft selection' until you get a nice range of colours</li>
<li>Now try moving vertexes around, like earlier.</li>
<li>You should find you can distort the plane in a drum-like manner.</li>
<li><b>Animate</b> it doing that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have things to do now so I'll try to come back on thursday or something and detail how to do the second thing you asked about. I'll probably forget, so drop me a PM to remind me.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<hr />
<p>To make a circular plane:</p>
<p>After you create the plane but before you do 'convert to editable mesh' do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put a <b>Cylinder Object</b> on top of the plane - i.e. so the plane passes through the cylinder</li>
<li><b>Select</b> your new cylinder</li>
<li>In the <b>compound</b> toolbar select the one-but-rightmost button, <b>Boolean compound object</b>.</li>
<li>In the right-hand toolbar thingy select the leftmost tab, 'create'</li>
<li>In the scrolley bit, under <b>parameters</b>, subsection <b>operation</b> select <b>Intersection</b></li>
<li>Above that in the scrolley bit, under 'pick boolean' press the <b>Pick operand B</b> button.</li>
<li>Click on your plane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically this will take your two objects and construct a third object, based on places where the two objects intersect. In this case, the intersection of your plane and your cylinder should be a circular plane.</p>

<p>Precise positioning tips:</p>
<p>There are two things that I know of that might help.</p>
<p>The first is the three text boxes containing numbers, at the center bottom of the screen. Try selecting an object with the 'select and move' tool then change those numbers. You should be able to slide bits around quite precisely.</p>
<p>The other is the 'align' tool. Create two things - cubes, maybe - and select one of them. The 'align' tool is on the main toolbar, about 1/5th of the way from rightmost. The symbol is two coloured squares aligned to a red diagonal line. (If you have a small monitor, it's possible for the very right hand buttons to go off the edge of the screen, in which case choose 'align' from the 'tools' drop-down menu). If you then click the other cube you created, it should give you a window. Play around with the window and see what the results are.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hello Brian - I am not happy about the merge of these two places. Both are separate <b>villages</b>, within the <b>civil parish</b> of East Malling and Larkfield. I am at the moment trawling through all the civil parish articles in Kent, and have been setting them out so that there is - as should be in the case of this one - an article for the civil parish, which can quite often include many other settlements and is a larger area than one particular village; and one for each village. As is obvious from this article, and from personal knowledge, the two places are quite different. Larkfield is pretty much a suburb of Maidstone, whereas East Malling is still a village. They also have different histories and occupy different kinds of location. I think we owe it to readers to point up the fact that a civil parish is the third tier of government, and not mix the ideas like this. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Shearan_04a2.html" title="User:Peter Shearan">Peter Shearan</a> 06:53, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Currently, the special characters part of MediaWiki:Edittools has 18 kilobytes after being parsed. This is more than half of the size of an edit page's interface (without considering the size of the wikitext to be edited). I'm proposing replacing it by an empty box filled dynamically via a script.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:7dayscast.jpg</b>. The image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to indicate why we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the image qualifies under Wikipedia's fair use guidelines, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>I must disagree with you. Merriam-Webster (m-w.com) offers the following definition for "alumnus:"<br />
<br />
alumnus<br />
<br />
One entry found for alumnus.<br />
Main Entry: alum·nus<br />
Pronunciation: &amp;-'l&amp;m-n&amp;s<br />
Function: noun<br />
Inflected Form(s): plural alum·ni /-"nI/<br />
Etymology: Latin, foster son, pupil, from alere to nourish -- more at OLD<br />
1&#160;: one who has attended or has graduated from a particular school, college, or university<br />
2&#160;: one who is a former member, employee, contributor, or inmate<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The vast majority of that definition deals with a subject matter not implying graduation but rather former attendance (75% of the definition). Melville clearly satisfies *both* definitions and by clarifying him as a "non-graduate" is inconsistent with other school articles. Using that line of reasoning, it would be appropriate to further delve into the activities of each alumnus (e.g. "(captain of soccer team)" or "(student council president)") Reverting the page would be more accurate, and would conform to the ways to which he is referred on other sites (see the Wikipedia Article <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany%2C_NY_99a9.html" title="Albany, NY">Albany, NY</a>) and by the school itself.<br />
<br />
Those who believe that "alumnus" automatically means "graduate" are ignorant, and it is not the job of Wikipedia to dumb down its articles by restating what words mean. It is called a dictionary- something Wikipedia is not.<br />
<br />
I am going to "be bold" and revert back to its original version: the way it has been for almost the entire life of the article. If you really believe in your position, let's talk it out on the discussion page and achieve consensus.<br />
<br />
I want to thank you for your vigilance when it has come to vandalism on this page in the past.<br />

All the entries were updated at the same time - their date of creation is immaterial once they are updated; they are in a particular order for some reason - bio followed by a non-bio followed by a bio followed by..., so that it is interesting. I don't see a need to edit the template in the edit you have done.

<p>Hi, I am Northmeister and relatively new to wikipedia. I've edited one article mostly and had plans to offer contributions to others but attention has been diverted because of something that is happening here at wikipedia. There seems to be a long running dispute over 'LaRouche' editors and material that has resulted in arbcom cases. Certain administrators have used these decisions to label new editors they suspect of being somehow connected to that group. They did this to me. The history can be seen on the American System (economics) page with a user Will Beback, whom you may know. I attempted to help two new editors on the 'political views of Lyndon LaRouche' page (since I was called a supporter I had to know what I was being called), who were being harassed and treated badly by Sean, SlimVirgin, Cberlet and others. I asked for civility to no avail. Being new I don't have familiarity with all the rules of engagement so I am sure I got to wordy (like I am now) and to passionate at points, I admit guilt here. What resulted was my attempt to mediate the whole mess. I requested mediation at that page for the tactics used against me and others, name-calling, labeling, constant reverts, disruption to make a point etc., and SlimVirgin refused outright mediation. The mediator Twrigley then gave his verdict. SlimVirgin responded in kind by reverting an article he had worked on for 'day's' back to what it was before his work. This man is a cordial and civil man (the reason why he was a mediator) and was overwhelmed by the before said editors tactics. I stepped in and reverted the page back and made a plea for SlimVirgin not to disrupt a page to make a point. She reverted right back. What is happening is wrong. This mediator tried to help and he has been harassed for trying. He was a third party to the dispute originally and I am not sure what to do. He had chosen to leave wikipedia because of SlimVirgins tactics, the same tactics that were the complaint of my mediation. What do I do? I have tried to discuss but to no avail. Every attempt I make was not responded to on her talk page and deleted or put in archives. Are new editors always treated like this if they run up against what seems like McCarthism over certain issues? I am at a lost and need an objective look at this page. I have contacted all the original editors for comment. Thanks, sorry for the long statement. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 04:36, 9 March 2006 (UTC) The page in question is <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogism.html" title="Syllogism">Syllogism</a>.</p>
<p>Brian, thank you for taking a look at the page in question and for your objective revert. Twrigely had decided to leave and requested I no longer involve myself. I was there to defend his honor, so I will abide by his wishes. Best wishes...--<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 22:43, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was a discussion in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia_db25.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia</a> about the location of small icon located at the top of each article that has a spoken version or an audio version (the icon is added along with <a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoken_Wikipedia_34ad.html" title="Template:Spoken Wikipedia">Template:Spoken Wikipedia</a>, see <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> for an example). Some have argued that the icon should be at the title level, just next to the <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured article</a> icon and not below it, unfortunatly it clashes with the words soliciting donations from users who aren't logged in <a href="../../../a/n/o/MediaWiki%7EAnonnotice_ab21.html" title="MediaWiki:Anonnotice">MediaWiki:Anonnotice</a>. Could you fix this problem, in a way that the area at the right of the title become a repository of icons, with of courses no software or display problem?

<p>I grant you that my addition is unsourced, but I hardly consider it unnecessary. First of all, please reflect that the "bullet" that I edited is ENTIRELY unsourced, so deleting just my addition as unsourced hardly seems to make sense. Secondly, the entire rationale of that bullet is questionable, as the "theory" that "pwn" is an attempt to subvert "own" filters strikes me as specious. P is not a standard subsitution for O when attempting to evade filters. When filter evasion is the stated goal (rather than "leetness" as a goal in and of itself), attention is paid to make the substituted forms as near as possible to the original. Hence, people type "sh!t, sh|t, sh1t, SHlT" or some other variant. You do NOT typically get 54I7.... which would be a "leet" version of "shit". I'd reference the game <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunbound.html" title="Gunbound">Gunbound</a> as an example of people using substitions (not really ciphers) in an attempt to evade language filters. "O" is almost exclusively replaced by "0" in that context, and other areas (say IRC channels) are, I believe, in line with that evidence. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 01:16, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is applied a little differently within tightly knit enough circles like come IRC rooms and specific game servers. It is easily understandable to the people within the group, for various possible reasons, and from there it expands. plus, p looks enough like a small o with a tail on it, so it works well on that level too. Your "shit" analogy is incorrect as well, well sortof. Pwn is not really the leet equivalent of own per your analogy the way 5417 is shit (which on an unrelated note would more likely be 5|-|17 since 4 is more exclusively used for "a". Pwn would be more like sh!t or $hit. Gunbound is also not the best example to use for the history of word usage. Its quite young. MUCH younger than the word.--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 15:53, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, aside from the fact that this isn't the proper forum for this discussion... I know Gunbound is newer (by a great deal) than "pwn", I was just using it as an example of a language filter. The best examples would be older online games (such as certain MUSHs) or chatrooms (such as AOL chat or IRC). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDante_Alighieri_2b5c.html" title="User:Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDante_Alighieri_3f7c.html" title="User talk:Dante Alighieri">Talk</a> 16:01, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like you were the source of the extra edit buttons on <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Editing_tools_9af4.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Editing tools">Wikipedia:Tools/Editing_tools</a> in mid Jan. There has been a bit of a problem with the quote marks which means the code displayed on the article page can't be just cut and paste to the user's monobook.js. I was thinking of putting the code on a subpage (probably under my ID) so that users could just refer to it rather than having to cut and paste. As the code came from yourself would you be happy with this (I would add a credit to yourself) or do you have a better idea of how to get it working. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkS_5f13.html" title="User:MarkS">MarkS</a> 14:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
