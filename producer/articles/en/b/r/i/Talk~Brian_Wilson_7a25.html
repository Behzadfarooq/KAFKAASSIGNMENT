<p>Re: my most recent edit. Wilson's song produced by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Spector_77a0.html" title="Phil Spector">Phil Spector</a> *was* for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blossoms_649d.html" title="The Blossoms">The Blossoms</a>. The song in question, Things Are Changing For The Better, was a rewrite of the earlier song Don't Hurt My Little Sister. Spector produced the backing track, and lyricist Jerry Riopelle produced the Blossoms' vocal for Philles, Spector's record label. Both Jay And The Americans and The Supremes did also record versions shortly thereafter for the same equal opportunity campaign, using the same backing track, but The Blossoms' version was the first, and the only one with the active involvement of any of the songwriters or Philles records.

<p>Most pages about pop artists have their articles organized by phase of their life to enhance readability. Can we do this? Also near the end of the article there is a reference to a "beautiful" song that was released for Katrina releif -- seems that "beautiful" violates neutrality as it is a subjective opinion - was it criticly acclaimed? was it popular? Did anybody endorse it? If we have those, then we can mention that instead of calling it beautiful. Thomasdelbert 14:25, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Question: It the opening paragraphs it states that Brian only collide with Spector on that one song. What about the song/s "then I kissed her"/"then he kissed me?"

<p>I am not sure this is the correct diagnosis. Even in the Larry King interview both Brian and his wife talk about it being schizoaffective disorder which is a psychotic disorder that has a lot in common with schizophrenia. It would be nice to see the article reflect this, since it is qualatatively a different mental illness than jsut bipolar disorder.</p>

<p>In the South Park movie, there was a line about the Canadian government "apologizing" for Brian Wilson. Since Wilson is not Canadian, this does not make much sense. Does anyone know what they were talking about? Or was it just a random stupid joke?

<p>I know this isn't the best place to be asking for something like this, but I am desperate. I am looking for a picture of Brian Wilson with him sitting in front of a piano like he is playing it but he is facing the camera (off to the side). I am doing a presentation on him and this picture is perfect for a visual aid. I have a small version of the picture in the Pet Sounds 40th Anniversary CD set, but it is much too small to use. The picture is on the back of the inserted booklet (in the upper left hand corner). If anyone knows where I can find a copy of this picture online and could let me know, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks - Blake Edwards (b_edwards1015@yahoo.com)</p>

<p>Anybody have any citation for this claim: "he is now acknowledged as one of the most significant and innovative musicians and composers of 20th century popular music." 207.34.120.71 16:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well I think it's pretty clear that he is. Just look at all the musicians that admire and respect him for what he has done. Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Elvis Costello, Leonard Bernstein, Burt Bacharach, Stevie Wonder, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Pete Townsend, Tom Petty, John Cale, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Linda Ronstadt, Jimmy Webb, Lindsey Buckingham, Sir George Martin and the list goes on. If you can't understand why he's "one of the most significant and innovative musicians and composers of 20th century popular music" then you should try and read more about him. He not only wrote and sung on most of The Beach Boys songs, but he arranged and produced the songs too. And not only was he producing and writing Beach Boys songs, he was also writing many songs for outside artists too, like Jan And Dean, Ron Wilson, The Honeys, American Spring, Glenn Campbell etc... Add to the fact that he wrote, arranged, produced and sung on many of the Beach Boys hit songs including "Good Vibrations", "Wouldn't It Be Nice", "I Get Around", "Help Me, Rhonda", "Do It Again", "Surfin Safari", "Surfin USA", "Surfer Girl", "California Girls", "God Only Knows", "Sloop John B", "Little Deuce Coupe", "Fun Fun Fun", "Dance Dance Dance", "Dont Worry Baby", "When I Grow Up To Be A Man", "Wendy" etc.. etc.. Surely you can see that he's one of the most important composers/musicians of 20th century popular music. I mean after all, in popular music is there many bigger bands than The Beach Boys? Quite frankly, no (You could argue one or two - ie: The Beatles - but thats about it) And Brian did do the majority of The Beach Boys work when they were at their most popular and also, try and name one other person whos been just as or more successful than Brian Wilson in popular music and they do all the writing, arranging, producing, singing and playing on many songs including over 30 top 20 singles. And he has been involved on over 25 Beach Boys albums, and now hes released over 10 of his own solo albums. So frankly I dont believe that that claim needs a citation. --220.236.172.60 16:08, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have filed a report at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">the administrator notice board</a> over the recent problems with this article <i>vis-a-vis</i> the anon user with the drifting IP address in the range 12.216.*.* I have requested that this page be semiprotected and that a range block be issued for the user in question in the interest of stoping the problems associated with this page. If you have any comments, either in support of or in opposition to either of these two proposals, please go to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:22, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Please note that is user has now registered as User:Dudesurf69, and therefore needs to be checked for continuous vandalism, which he has already done to my own page. It would be helpful if this user obtained some form of intelligence to realise that this has nothing to with 'jealousy'. It's very hard to be jealous of people who are this obnoxious. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardylane_023b.html" title="User:Hardylane">Hardylane</a> 14:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It looks like the same guy is back blanking sections of this talk page. I have requested semiprotection at this page to stop this.

<dd>But I think that the AIV people will tell you that the frequency and rate of vandalism figures in, and that this nuisance is just that.
