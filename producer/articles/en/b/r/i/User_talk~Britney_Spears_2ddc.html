<p>Thanks for contributing to wikipedia. It looks like an article you contributed in the past was a dictionary-style definition. Most likely, your page was deleted or moved to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>, the open-source dictionary. If you'd like to contribute definitions, use the Wiktionary link to start writing.

<p>I realize this but someone put a link to the word nonpareil in an entry and I couldn't understand why. It means that someone is the best at something. It shouldn't be something to link to. But I wanted to show the person who added the link that it was a REAL word before they deleted it or assumed I had mispelled another word. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritney_Spears_b273.html" title="User:Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> 06:55, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good work creating new articles and contributing to exisiting ones. When you make contributions, be careful that you don't include copyrighted material. Copyright rules are complicated, so take some time to review <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>. A good general rule is that most things on the internet are already copyrighted by someone else, so they <b>cannot be</b> contributed to wikipedia. Again, content from webpages is usually copyrighted and cannot be added to wiki. Keep up the good work, and feel free to contact me with questions. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a></p>
<p>Every image I have contributed has been under the fair use category. I read the Copyright rules. You really NEED TO SITE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE when you accuse someone of something against a rule. That is the only way to address something logically. Otherwise I don't know what you talking about. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritney_Spears_b273.html" title="User:Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> 06:50, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Britney.</p>
<p>Let’s see if we can take this in order. First of all, the notion that there is no mention of superhuman strength in my version is false, an indication that you obviously didn’t read carefully. It’s archived, so look for the paragraph that begins with “Additionally, some readers believe that Wolverine's strength, agility, and reflexes are enhanced…” If you read that paragraph, you’ll see that I mentioned the very examples that were mentioned as possibly indicating superhuman strength on Wolvie’s part. So what if I didn’t mention every single detail, like those Stat Gauges? The point is, I addressed the debate by mentioning material that both sides point to. If you felt that the Stat Gauges were too important to be omitted, why not simply add that in? Isn’t that the whole point of Wikipedia? That each person contributes a little bit, so that the entry presents a more and more detailed picture? Instead, you simply go back and revert to the old version, which doesn’t contain ‘’any’’ of the material on that issue. I have restored my version, and have added the points about the Stat Gauges.</p>
<p>Second, you claim that the lack of such a mention, if true, would cause a “flame war”. How do figure this? If two contributors disagree on the content of an entry, they should ‘’discuss’’ it, not engage in a flame war. Simply because you respond to any disagreement with accusations of “lying,” ‘’vandalism,’’ and intending to “antagonize” people—as if you somehow have been able to divine my intentions, exclude less nefarious motives on my part (like perhaps a sincere belief on my part that my contributions are valid)—while simultaneously admonishing others to be more careful with ‘’their’’ language—does not mean that others are so cynical, and that they possess the intentions you ascribe to them. If the only response you see to such a disagreement is pejorative language, accusations, and flame wars, then that says far more about your own character than it does about the content of my contributions. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> Sat; 6.25.05.; 12:30am EST.</p>
<p>The premise of your argument concerning this matter isn't sound, your argument isn't consistant or logical, and you don't seem to have enough integrity to admit when someone else has a point. As I said in the past, there really isn't any point in trying to reason with you. I have explained in great detail what my premise is and what its basis is. And you keep referring to an old version of the OHOTMU that was written by mostly one editor, Peter Sanderson, before the advent of email or the world wide web. What you don't seem to understand is that the Universe was never a defenitive or authoritative guide from a writers point of view. It was a fun book that sold a lot of copies but the information in it was very inconsistant and Sanderson was not even able to check what he wrote against the ideas of the creators of the characters. He had neither the time nor the option to communicate with the likes of Claremont, Miller, or Byrne. The Master Edition was a better guide as it had more characters and the editors actually were (because of the advent of email and the internet) able to communicate directly with the creators of the characters. In the Masters Edition WOlverine is listed as enhanced human. In the appendix of issue 2 it explains what enhanced human is. Its heightened normal human level strength (low superhuman strength). I do take your ommission of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition and the strength levels for Wolverine that have been on 3 different profiles for him in 3 of the new Universes and on the website as antagonisitic and dishonest. Looking at your contributions to wiki that looks like most of what you do. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritney_Spears_b273.html" title="User:Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> 23:28, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
