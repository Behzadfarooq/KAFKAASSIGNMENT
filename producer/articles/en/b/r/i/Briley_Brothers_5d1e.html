<p>The brothers were born to a stable home with two parents on the Northeast side of Richmond. With their younger sibling Anthony they were regarded by older neighbors as people who would help neighbors fix cars or mow lawns.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surreal</a> and dark world existed inside their house on Fourth Avenue. The three boys collected deadly pets, such as <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarantula.html" title="Tarantula">tarantulas</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piranha.html" title="Piranha">piranhas</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/b/Doberman.html" title="Doberman">Dobermans</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boa_constrictor.html" title="Boa constrictor">boa constrictors</a>. The boys gleefully fed live mice to their boa constrictor. Their father, James Sr. was unnerved enough by their behavior that he kept his bedroom door padlocked from the inside overnight. James Sr was the only one the brothers feared</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Briley_Brothers_5d1e.html" title="Edit section: First Murders">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Murders</span></h2>
<p>In 1971, the first killing was committed by the then 16 year old Linwood. While alone at home one day, he took aim with a <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifle</a> from his bedroom window and fatally shot Orline Christian, an elderly next door neighbor, as she passed by her window sill. The crime almost went undetected, however her grieving relatives noticed a small bloody mark on her back at the viewing and asked the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral_director.html" title="Funeral director">funeral director</a> to reexamine the body. Upon a second examination, the director found a small caliber bullet wound in her back. Police investigators were contacted and they sought to find the source of the gunshot. Standing at the open window in her home where Mrs. Christian was killed, a detective used a sheet of plywood to represent her body, with a hole cut out to represent the bullet wound. He soon determined that the bullet could have only come from the Briley home next door. There, the murder weapon was found and Linwood admitted to the crime with indifference, "I heard she had heart problems, she would have died soon anyway."</p>
<p>Linwood was sent to <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_school.html" title="Reform school">reform school</a> to serve a one-year sentence for the killing. His young brother, James or 'J.B.' followed in his path at the same age having been sentenced to time in <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_detention_center.html" title="Youth detention center">juvenile hall</a> for having pulled a gun and fired upon a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officer.html" title="Police officer">police officer</a> during a pursuit.</p>

<p>Their first attack came on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, when Linwood knocked on the door of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrico_County_9f67.html" title="Henrico County">Henrico County</a> couple William and Virginia Bucher. Claiming that he had car trouble and needed to use their phone, Linwood was allowed into their home. At this point, he pulled a gun on the couple and waved his brother Anthony inside. The two Brileys tied up the couple and looted the house, dousing each room with <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> after picking it clean of valuables.</p>
<p>As they left, a lit match was tossed on the fuel. The two hurriedly packed their stolen loot - a television, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizens%27_band_radio.html" title="Citizens' band radio">cb radio</a> and jewelry into their trunk and sped off. They were not around when Mr. Bucher managed to miraculously free himself and his wife from their restraints and escape just before the house became engulfed in flames. They would be the only survivors of the rampage.</p>

<p>Seventeen year old Christopher Philips was spotted hanging around Linwood Briley's parked car on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a> by the gang members. Suspecting that he might have been trying to break into the vehicle, the gang surrounded him and dragged him into a nearby backyard. There he was pinned to the ground by three members.

<p>Gallaher was jumped by Linwood and then manhandled into the trunk of his own <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Continental_c26a.html" title="Lincoln Continental">Lincoln Continental</a>.

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">September 30</a>, sixty-two year old private nurse Mary Wilfong, was followed home to her Richmond apartment.

<p>Several days later on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, just two blocks from the Briley home on 4th Avenue in Richmond, 79 year old Blanche Page and her 59 year old boarder Charles Garner were both brutally murdered by the gang members. Page was bludgeoned to death while Garner was fatally assaulted with a variety of weapons, which included a baseball bat, five knives, a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scissors.html" title="Scissors">pair of scissors</a> and a fork.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Briley_Brothers_5d1e.html" title="Edit section: Harvey Wilkerson">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Harvey Wilkerson</span></h3>
<p>The final crime of the spree occurred against a long time neighborhood friend of the brothers, Harvey Wilkerson. On the morning of <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">October 19</a>, having promised a judge earlier that day that he was staying out of trouble while out on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parole.html" title="Parole">parole</a> for a 1973 robbery and malicious wounding conviction, J.B. led the gang on the prowl for yet another victim that night.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the gang's presence down the street, Wilkerson, who lived with his 23 year old wife Judy Barton (who was five months pregnant at the time) and her five year old son Harvey, instinctively closed and locked his door. This action was noticed by the gang, which then walked over to Wilkerson's front door and knocked. Terrified by their response if he refused them entry, Wilkerson allowed them in. Carnage ensued.</p>
<p>Both adults in the home were overpowered, bound and gagged with <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duct_tape.html" title="Duct tape">duct tape</a>. Linwood Briley then manhandled Judy Barton into the kitchen, where she was raped within hearing distance of the others. Fellow gang member Duncan Meekins continued the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_assault.html" title="Sexual assault">sexual assault</a>, after which Linwood dragged Barton back into the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Living_room.html" title="Living room">living room</a>, briefly rummaged the premises for valuables and then left the house.</p>
<p>The three remaining gang members covered their victims with sheets. J.B. told Meekins, "you've got to get one", at which point Meekins took a pistol and fatally shot the adult Harvey Wilkerson in the head. J.B. then shot Barton and the five year old boy to death.</p>
<p>Police happened to be in the general vicinity of the neighborhood, heard the shots and later saw the gang members running down the street at high speed. They didn't know where the shots had been fired. The bodies were not discovered until three days following the crime, but the gang members were soon rounded up afterwards.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Briley_Brothers_5d1e.html" title="Edit section: Capture and incarceration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Capture and incarceration</span></h2>
<p>During interrogation by police, Duncan Meekins was offered a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea agreement</a> in return for turning <a href="../../../s/t/a/State%27s_evidence.html" title="State's evidence">state's evidence</a> against the Brileys. He took up the offer and offered a full detailing of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_Spree_2b45.html" title="Crime Spree">crime spree</a>. As a result, he escaped the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">death penalty</a> and was briefly incarcerated at a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> prison away from any of the Briley brothers.</p>
<p>A single <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_imprisonment.html" title="Life imprisonment">life sentence</a>, with parole eligibility was handed down to Anthony Briley, youngest brother of the trio, due to his limited involvement in the killings.</p>
<p>Because of Virginia's 'triggerman' statute, both J.B. and Linwood received numerous life sentences for murders committed during the spree, but faced capital charges only in cases where they had physically committed the actual killing of the victim.</p>
<p>Linwood was sentenced to death for the abduction and murder of John Gallaher, while J.B. received two death sentences, one each of the murders of Judy Barton and her son Harvey.</p>
<p>A Richmond judge presiding at one of the trials summed up the case following the verdict, "this was the vilest rampage of rape, murder and robbery that the court has seen in thirty years."</p>
<p>Both were sent to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Row_2a2e.html" title="Death Row">death row</a> at <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecklenburg_Correctional_Center_a6b9.html" title="Mecklenburg Correctional Center">Mecklenburg Correctional Center</a> near Boydton in early 1980. There, they were disruptive inmates, who used their guile and physical prowess to threaten fellow inmate and guard alike. A flourishing drug and weapon trade operated at the prison under their command.</p>

<p>Linwood and J.B. Briley were the ringleaders in the six inmate escape from Virginia's death row at <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecklenburg_Correctional_Center_a6b9.html" title="Mecklenburg Correctional Center">Mecklenburg Correctional Center</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. During the early moments of the escape, in which a coordinated effort resulted in inmates taking over the death row unit, both Brileys expressed strong interest in killing the officers that they had taken hostage. They went so far as to douse captive guards in <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighter_fluid.html" title="Lighter fluid">lighter fluid</a> and were prepared to toss in a lit match to complete the action. Willie Lloyd Turner, another death row inmate, stepped in the way of James Briley and forbade him from doing so. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria%2C_Virginia_fe7e.html" title="Alexandria, Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Cop_Killer_7fe4.html" title="Cop Killer">cop killer</a> Wilbert Evans prevented Linwood Briley from raping a female nurse who had been taken hostage while <i>en route</i> to delivering medication to inmates in the unit.</p>
<p>Splitting off from their two remaining free escapees at Philadelphia, the Brileys went to live with their uncle in the north of the city. They were captured on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_19.html" title="June 19">June 19</a> by a heavily armed group of <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> agents and police.

<p>In short order, the remaining appeals (heard by some 70 different appellate judges) ran out for both brothers. They were executed in the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_chair.html" title="Electric chair">electric chair</a> at the Virginia State Penitentiary. Linwood was put to death in Virginia's electric chair on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>.</p>
<p>James Briley was executed in the same manner on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a> of the following year. At no point did either Briley admit responsibility or express remorse for their horrific crimes. Rather, they seemed embarrassed only that they had been captured upon making their escape from Mecklenburg.</p>
<p>Their younger brother Anthony remains incarcerated in Virginia's corrections system and comes up for parole consideration every few years. To date, his applications for parole have been denied by the state <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parole_Board_c510.html" title="Parole Board">parole board</a>.</p>
