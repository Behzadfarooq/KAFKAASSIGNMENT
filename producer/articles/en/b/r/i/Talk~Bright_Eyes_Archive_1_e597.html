<h2><span class="mw-headline">The name "Bright Eyes"</span></h2>
<p>'The name "Bright Eyes" came from a film Oberst was watching, where the male protagonist affectionately used the term to describe the female protagonist.'

<dd>Does anyone know if this is/is not from F. Scott Fitzgerald's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gatsby_0702.html" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>? In chapter one, Nick (the narrator) describes Daisy (his cousin) as having a face that was "sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth..." There have been at least two film adaptations of this, so that would account for the reference currently on the page. Tunnie 18:35, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Merging Conor Oberst with Bright Eyes</span></h2>
<p><b>In favor.</b> I think this should be done. The main article should be called Conor Oberst, with a large section on 'Bright Eyes.' It is important to note that although Conor tours and records with many other artists, he is in his own an independant artist. Bright Eyes is a pen name of sorts of which he uses to call his music. darkestshining</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, in all fairness, there already is an article called <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conor_Oberst_18b9.html" title="Conor Oberst">Conor Oberst</a>. I was thinking that should be the more comprehensive piece and having this one focus mainly the accomplishments of Bright Eyes as its own entity. Most people who wish to learn about Bright Eyes on Wikipedia won't want to be immediately bombarded by a rundown of every CO project that isn't Bright Eyes. Sadly, that's the current state of this article, but I was hoping to change that real soon.</dd>
<dd>However, I can see how it would be beneficial to merge the articles, so I'm not opposed to it. Go ahead and apply the merge template and we'll see what developes. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 20:50, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><b>Opposed.</b> I'm in opposition to a merge. the Conor Oberst article is about the personhood of Conor Oberst. The Bright Eyes article, though it <i>is</i> lacking, is specifically about his musical endeavours with Bright Eyes. Keep it seperate, in my opinion.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGhostChild_0866.html" title="User:TheGhostChild">TheGhostChild</a> 17:33, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Opposed.</b> I'm against it. The article <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conor_Oberst_18b9.html" title="Conor Oberst">Conor Oberst</a> Should be a summery of his life, giving overviews of the different bands he's in. <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright_Eyes_4429.html" title="Bright Eyes">Bright Eyes</a> should be a indepth artical about The band.Dlime16 19:56, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Somebody took the liberty of merging the articles before we could even reach a 2:1 vote, much less consensus. Therefore, I'm unmerging until we can get this sorted out. Please don't merge it back until then.

<dd><b>Opposed.</b> Bright Eyes is Conor Oberst, MIKE MOGIS (this guy deserves more credit), <b>and friends.</b> -a regular. 15:25 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree with the statement about Mike Mogis. Mike has contribute to at least 90% of all Bright Eyes recordings (although I would estimate even more than that) and has played on every tour, including the Bright Eyes/Jimmy James/Matt Ward tour. I don't think he has never not been a member of Bright Eyes. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 23:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>thank you! high-five. i believe mike mogis started right after he heard "water." and since then... well, he's been a member of almost every band incestuously linked to omaha. -the regular again. 00:29 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>In favor.</b> Wrong. I will find countless interviews and articles alike that prove 'Bright Eyes' is the pen name he uses to work with his music. He himself cannot be bright eyes because he can't be the songs he makes, but he writes his own songs and gets his friends {AND MIKE MOGIS, OMG} to play with him. a lot of i'm wide awake it's morning was solo work [ie&gt;LUA] so anyone who is opposed, suck it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One song does not make up "a lot" of an album. Anyways, by all means, if you can find countless interviews, or at least one or two, that back up what you're saying, please do so. I've actually come across an interview where Conor says that the reason the line up changes so often is because everybody he gets to play with him has projects of their own, which is a pretty reasonable explanation. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 19:24, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Oppose</b><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECooldoug111_858f.html" title="User:Cooldoug111">Mac Domhnaill</a></p>
<p><b>Oppose</b> Bright Eyes is NOT Conor's band alone. As stated above, Mike has been part of the band from the just about the beginning. Bright Eyes is not a "traditional", four-peice band (Beatles, Rolling Stones, et al.), as most of the members are fluid, but it's not like Conor plays all of the instruments or tells the other musicians in the band what to play. Bright Eyes is a band-just a slightly different type than most people are used to. I am opposed to the suggested merger. jopari</p>
<p><b>Oppose</b> It is a band, and he is a person. Bright Eyes is not merely Oberst's stage name. Rufusgriffin 20:44, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Oppose</b> Oberst has denied in interviews that it is just his name. It is a band, albeit with a changeable line-up; Oberst is a person with other projects. A merge would be wrong. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 21:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been working on the discography for a couple weeks now and it's looking pretty good. Today I just added a list of original compilation appearences. I also organized everything with wikitables, which might be overkill. If anybody thinks the discography is unnecessarily detailed, please let me know and I can trim it down a little bit. My own problem with the tables is that their a little inconsistent with each other, but it's a work in progress. Also, if anybody has anything to add to the discography but is unconfortable with the table, just dump the information anywhere and I'll sqeeze it in there myself. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 19:56, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What are we going to do with this article, guys?</span></h2>
<p>I'm planning on contributing heavily to this article in the recent future, but I have no idea what direction you guys are trying to take it. At first glance (and second) it seems more like a Conor Oberst article than a Bright Eyes article, which is fair enough I suppose. But if Bright Eyes <i>IS</i> Conor Oberst, then I why not merge this article with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conor_Oberst_18b9.html" title="Conor Oberst">Conor Oberst</a>? Seeing as I doubt anybody wants that any more than I do, I suggest we keep this article focused specifically on the history or Bright Eyes in particular, and copy and paste related information in their own articles. I believe that Bright Eyes is one of the most important bands of this decade, and it shame that this article is such a mess. No offense, but <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Stefani_f1e7.html" title="Gwen Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a> has a better article. With some direction, I believe we can make this a featured article in no time. So who's with me? <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvrum_8214.html" title="User:Elvrum">Elvrum</a> 02:12, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should we mention at all that Oberst gets so drunk by the end of most concerts that he forgets words stumbles around etc? Obviously we would have to find an official source, but just about anyone thats been to a concert of his (within the last year for sure) can verify&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you would really like to include it, you could probably check out some concert reviews for a source.

<p>I've just beefed up the Clear Channel stuff a little, and wondered whether there might be an argument for seperating out things that could broadly be termed as "protest" activities, which would include Clear Channel, MoveOn.org tour, "When The President Talks To God", etc. That "Recent Years" section is just starting to look a little cluttered. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWastekiller_2a55.html" title="User:Wastekiller">Wastekiller</a> 02:29, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
