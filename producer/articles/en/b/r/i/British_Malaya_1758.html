<p>At the same time, the sultan was facing multiple external threats that could challenge the sultan's power in Kedah. <a href="../../../s/i/a/Siam.html" title="Siam">Siam</a>, which was at war with <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a> and saw Kedah as its vassal state, frequently demanded Kedah to send reinforcements. Kedah in many cases was a reluctant ally to Siam.</p>
<p>Through negotiation between the sultan and Light, the sultan agreed to allow the firm to build a trading post and operate in Kedah if the British agree to protect Kedah from external pressure. Light conveyed the message to his superior in India. The British however decided against the proposal.</p>
<p>Two years later, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa died and was replaced by Sultan Abdullah Mahrum Shah. The sultan was getting desperate and offered Light, who became a British representative, the island of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penang.html" title="Penang">Penang</a> in return for military assistance for Kedah. Light informed the British East India company of the sultan's offer. The Company however ordered Light to take over Penang and gave him no guarantee of the military aid the sultan had asked earlier. Light later took over Penang and assured the sultan of military assistance despite the Company's position. Soon, the Company made up its mind and told Light that they would not give any military aid to Kedah. In June 1788, Light informed the sultan of the Company's decision. Felt cheated, the sultan ordered Light to move out of Penang but Light refused.</p>
<p>Light's refusal made the sultan to strengthen Kedah military and fortified <a href="../../../s/e/b/Seberang_Prai_7041.html" title="Seberang Prai">Prai</a>. Prai is a stretch of beach opposite to Penang. Recognizing the threat, the British moved in and razed the fort in Prai. With the defeat, the British forced the sultan to sign an agreement that legally allowed the British to occupy Penang. In return, the sultan received an annual rent of 6,000 Spanish peso. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1791.html" title="1791">1791</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Jack_ed30.html" title="Union Jack">Union Jack</a> was officially raised in Penang for the first time. In 1800, Kedah ceded Prai to the British and the sultan received further 4,000 peso as an annual rent. Penang was named Prince of Wales Island while <a href="../../../s/e/b/Seberang_Perai_97fc.html" title="Seberang Perai">Perai</a> was renamed <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_Wellesley_03bd.html" title="Province Wellesley">Province Wellesley</a>.</p>
<p>In 1821, Siam invaded Kedah, sacked the capital <a href="../../../a/l/o/Alor_Star_baec.html" title="Alor Star">Alor Star</a> and occupied the state until 1842.</p>

<p>From the 17th to the early 19th century, Malacca was a <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> colony. During the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, between 1811 and 1815, Malacca as with other Dutch holdings in <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, was under the care of British. This was done in order to prevent the French from claiming Dutch processions in there. When the war ended in 1815, Malacca was returned to the Dutch.

<p>Modern Singapore was founded by Sir <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamford_Raffles_176a.html" title="Stamford Raffles">Stamford Raffles</a> with a great deal of help from Major Farquhar. Before establishing Singapore, Raffles was the Lieutenant Governor of Java from 1811 till 1815. In 1818, he was appointed as of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bencoolen.html" title="Bencoolen">Bencoolen</a>. Realizing how the Dutch was monopolizing trade in the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_Archipelago_0f23.html" title="Malay Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a>, he was convinced that the British needed a new trading colony to counter Dutch trade power. Months worth of research brought him to Singapore, an island at the tip of the Malay Peninsula. The island was ruled by a <i><a href="../../../t/e/m/Temenggung.html" title="Temenggung">temenggung</a></i>.</p>
<p>Singapore was then under the control of <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tengku_Abdul_Rahman_3b73.html" title="Tengku Abdul Rahman">Tengku Abdul Rahman</a>, the Sultan of the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate (otherwise known as the Johor Sultanate), in turn under the influence of the Dutch and the Bugis. Hence, he would never agree to a British base in Singapore. However, Tengku Abdul Rahman had become a sultan only because his older brother, <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor_8d02.html" title="Hussein Shah of Johor">Tengku Hussein</a> or Tengku Long, had been away getting married in Penang when their father, the previous sultan died in 1812. According to Malay culture, a person has to be by the dying sultan in order to be considered as a new ruler. Tengku Abdul Rahman was present when their father died. The older brother was not happy with the development while the temenggung that was in charge of Singapore preferred Tengku Hussein to the younger brother.</p>
<p>The British had first acknowledged Tengku Abdul Rahman at the time of their first presence in Malacca. The situation however had changed. In 1818, Farquhar visited Tengku Hussein in the little island of Penyengat, off the cost of <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bintan.html" title="Bintan">Bintan</a>, the capital of the Riau Archipelago. There, new plans were drawn and in 1819, Raffles made a deal with Tengku Hussein. The agreement stated that the British would acknowledge Tengku Hussein as the legitimate ruler of Singapore if he allowed them to establish a trading post there. Furthermore, Tengku Hussein and the temenggung would receive yearly stipend from the British. The treaty was ratified on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/1/1819.html" title="1819">1819</a>. With the Temenggung's help, Hussein left Penyengat pretending that he was 'going fishing', and reached Singapore where he was quickly installed as Sultan.</p>
<p>The Dutch were extremely displeased with Raffles' action. However, with the signing of Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, the Dutch receded its opposition to the British presence in Singapore. The treaty also divided the Sultanate of Johor into modern Johor and the new Sultanate of Riau.</p>

<p>After the British secured Singapore from the Dutch through the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824_0f46.html" title="Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824">Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824</a>, the British aimed to centralize the administration of Penang, Malacca and Singapore. As such, in 1826, a framework known as the Straits Settlements was established with Penang as its capital. Later in 1832, the capital was moved to Singapore. While the three holdings formed the backbone of the Settlements, throughout the years <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Island_0f78.html" title="Christmas Island">Christmas Island</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocos_Islands_80ed.html" title="Cocos Islands">Cocos Islands</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labuan.html" title="Labuan">Labuan</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinding.html" title="Dinding">Dinding</a> of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perak.html" title="Perak">Perak</a> were placed under the authority of the Straits Settlements.</p>
<p>Until 1867, the Settlements were answerable to the British administrator of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>. The Settlements' administrators were unsatisfied with how Calcutta was handling their affairs and they complained to London. The Company even tried to annul Singapore's <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_port.html" title="Free port">free port</a> status in 1856.</p>
<p>The Company however was dissolved in 1858 and India was made into a crown colony. With Calcutta's waning power and intense lobbying by the Settlements' administrators, in 1867 the colony was placed directly under the power of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Office_6483.html" title="Colonial Office">Colonial Office</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and was declared as a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_colony.html" title="Crown colony">crown colony</a>.

<p>In 1946 after the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, the colony was dissolved and was absord into the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayan_Union_efe8.html" title="Malayan Union">Malayan Union</a> while Singapore was separated from the Union and formed a new crown colony.

<p>Prior to the late 19th century, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> was only interested in trading and tried as much as possible to stay away from Malay politics. However, Siam influence in northern <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_states.html" title="Malay states">Malay states</a>, especially <a href="../../../k/e/d/Kedah.html" title="Kedah">Kedah</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terengganu.html" title="Terengganu">Terengganu</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelantan.html" title="Kelantan">Kelantan</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pattani_kingdom.html" title="Pattani kingdom">Pattani</a> was preventing the Company from trading in peace. Therefore, in 1826, the British through the Company signed a secret treaty known today as the Burney Treaty with the king of Siam. The four Malay states were not present during the signing of the agreement. In that treaty, British acknowledged Siamese sovereignty over all those states. In return, Siam accepted British ownership of Penang and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_Wellesley_03bd.html" title="Province Wellesley">Province Wellesley</a> and allowed the Company to trade in Terengganu and Kelantan unimpeded.</p>
<p>Almost a hundred years later, a new treaty now known as Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 or Bangkok Treaty of 1909 was signed between the two powers. In the new agreement, Siam agreed to give up claim over <a href="../../../k/e/d/Kedah.html" title="Kedah">Kedah</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perlis.html" title="Perlis">Perlis</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terengganu.html" title="Terengganu">Terengganu</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelantan.html" title="Kelantan">Kelantan</a> while Pattani remains as Siamese territory. Perlis was previously part of Kedah but during Siamese reign, Perlis was separated from Kedah. Kedah's district of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satun_Province_0e08.html" title="Satun Province">Satun</a> however was annexed by Siam in the same agreement. Pattani on the other hand was dissected into <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pattani_Province_c50c.html" title="Pattani Province">Pattani</a> proper, <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yala_Province_7359.html" title="Yala Province">Yala</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narathiwat_Province_e557.html" title="Narathiwat Province">Narathiwat</a> after the signing of the treaty.</p>
<p>Though the Siamese King <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chulalongkorn.html" title="Chulalongkorn">Chulalongkorn</a> was reluctant to sign the treaty, increasing <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> pressure on the Siamese eastern border forced Siam to cooperate with the British. As with Rama IV, Chulalongkorn hoped that the British would leave Siam alone if he acceded to the British demands. Earlier in 1893, Siam had lost Shan region of north-eastern <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a> to the British. This demarcation as stated in the agreement remains today as <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia-Thailand_Border_6f18.html" title="Malaysia-Thailand Border">Malaysia-Thailand Border</a>.</p>
<p>Malay rulers did not acknowledge the agreement. Regardless, the rulers were too weak to resist British influence. In Kedah after the Bangkok Treaty, George Maxwell was posted by the British in Kedah as the sultan's advisor. The British effectively took over economics planning and execution. Rail line was built to connect Kedah with Siam in 1912 while land reformed was introduced in 1914. It was only in 1923 did the ruler of Kedah, Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Syah accepted a British advisor.</p>
<p>Perlis had similar experience. The ruler did not recognize the 1909 treaty but the British was de facto administrator of the state. It was only in 1930 the ruler, Raja Syed Alwi recognized British presence in Perlis by admitting Meadows Frost as the first British Advisor in Perlis.</p>

<p>Perak is a state on the western shore of the Malay Peninsula and in the 18th and 19th century, it was discovered the state was rich in <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin.html" title="Tin">tin</a>. In fact, Perak had the richest alluvial deposits of tin in the world. <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> at the same time was undergoing an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_revolution.html" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> and this created a huge demand for tin. The British as well as the Dutch were active in the states, each seeking to monopolize production of tin and other lesser commodities. However, political atmosphere in Perak was sufficiently volatile to raise the cost of tin mining operations. For instance, in 1818, Siam ordered Kedah to attack Perak. The lack of security in Perak forced to British to protect Perak in 1826.</p>
<p>As Perak continued to increase its mining operations, it suffered a shortage of labor. Looking to solve the problem, Malay administrator Long Jaafar invited the Chinese in Penang to work in Perak; particularly at <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larut.html" title="Larut">Larut</a>. By the 1840s, Perak's Chinese population exploded. The new immigrants more often than not were members of Chinese secret societies. Two of the largest were <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghee_Hin_Kongsi_1496.html" title="Ghee Hin Kongsi">Ghee Hin</a> and Hai San.

<p>Raja Abdullah was furious and refused to accept the news kindly. He then sought and gathered political supports from various channels, including several Perak's local chief and several British personnel that he had done business with in the past with the secret societies becoming their proxies in the fight for the throne. Among those British individuals was British trader W.H.M. Read. Furthermore, he promised to accept a British advisor if the British recognized him as the legitimate ruler of Perak.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Raja Abdullah, the Straits Settlements governor at that time was Sir <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Ord_230a.html" title="Harry Ord">Harry Ord</a> and the governor was a friend of Ngah Ibrahim, of whom had unresolved issues with Raja Abdullah. With Ord's aid, Ngah Ibrahim sent sepoy troops from India to prevent Raja Abdullah from actively claiming the throne and to some extending control over the Chinese secret societies.</p>
<p>By 1873, the Colonial Office in London came to perceive Ord as incompetent. He was soon replaced by Sir <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Clarke_%28administrator%29_ae30.html" title="Andrew Clarke (administrator)">Andrew Clarke</a> and Clarke was ordered to get a complete picture of what was happening in the Malay states and recommend how to streamline British administration in Malaya. The reason is, London was increasingly aware that the Straits Settlements were increasingly dependent on the economy of the Malay states, including Perak. Upon Clarke arrival in Singapore, many British traders including Read became close to the governor. Through Read, Clarke learned of Raja Abdullah's problem and willingness to accept a British representative in his court if the British assisted once apparent heir.</p>
<p>Clarke seized the opportunity to expand British influence. Firstly, he called all Chinese secret societies and demanded these groups to a permanent truce. Later, through the signing of Pangkor Treaty on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_20.html" title="January 20">January 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, Clarke acknowledged Raja Abdullah as the legitimate sultan of Perak. Immediately, <a href="../../../j/2E/w/J.W.W._Birch_1a47.html" title="J.W.W. Birch">J.W.W. Birch</a> was appointed as a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resident_%28title%29.html" title="Resident (title)">British resident</a> in Perak. Raja Ismail on the other hand while not a party to the agreement, was forced to abdicate due to intense external pressure applied by Clarke.</p>

Around 1840, under the leadership of Raja Jumaat from Riau, tin mining turned into a huge enterprise. His effort soon was rewarded by Sultan Muhammad of Selangor; Raja Jumaat was appointed as Lukut's administrator in 1846 Raja Jumaat. By the 1850s, the area emerged as one of the most modern settlements on the Malay Peninsula if the Straits Settlements were discounted. At one point, there were no less than 20,000 labors of which most of them were enthic Chinese imported from China. He died in 1864 and his death created a leadership vacuum. Slowly, Lukut slided backward and was forgotten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hulu Klang enjoyed unprecedented due to tin mining. Between 1849 and 1850, Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar, Raja Jumaat's cousin, was appointed by the sultan as Klang's administrator. As Lukut economic importance was slowly degrading, Hulu Klang was rising up to the top. This attracted many labors, especially Chinese immigrants that had worked in Lukut to relocate here. One person that was responsible in persuading the Chinese to move from Lukut to Hulu Klang was a person named Sutan Puasa from <a href="../../../a/m/p/Ampang.html" title="Ampang">Ampang</a>. He supplied the mining colonies in Hulu Klang with goods ranging from <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a> to <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a>.

<p>As occurred in Perak, these rapid development attracted tremendous interest from the British in the Straits Settlements. The economy of Selangor became too important to the prosperity of the Straits Settlements that any disturbance in that state would hurt the Straits Settlement itself. Therefore, the British felt it needed to have a say in Selangor politics. The one major disturbance, amounted to a <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil war</a>, was the <a href="../../../k/l/a/Klang_War_b689.html" title="Klang War">Klang War</a> that begun in 1867.</p>

The flag of Negeri Sembilan.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/g/Negeri_Sembilan_86b0.html" title="Negeri Sembilan">Negeri Sembilan</a> was another major producer of tin in Malaya. In 1869, a power struggle between Tengku Antah and Tengku Ahmad Tunggal happened as both aspired to become the next ruler of Negeri Sembilan, the <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamtuan_Besar_a7b4.html" title="Yamtuan Besar">Yamtuan Besar</a>. This conflict between the two princes divided the confederation and threatened the reliability of tin supply from Negeri Sembilan.</p>
<p>Sungai Ujong, a state within the confederation in particular was the site of many locally important mines and it was ruled by Dato' Kelana Sendeng. However, another local chieftain named Dato' Bandar Kulop Tunggal had more influence than Dato' Kelana. Dato' Bandar received great support from the locals and even the Chinese immigrants that worked at the mines of Sungai Ujong. Dato' Kelana limited popularity forced him to be dependent on another chieftain named Sayid Abdul Rahman, of whom was the confederation's <i>Laksamana Raja Laut</i> (roughly royal sea admiral). The strained relationship between Dato' Bandar and Dato' Kelana caused frequent disturbances in Sungai Ujong.</p>
<p>The years before 1873 however were the years of relative calm as Dato' Kelana had to give extra attention to Sungai Linggi as <a href="../../../r/e/m/Rembau.html" title="Rembau">Rembau</a>, another state within the confederation tried to wrestle Sungai Linggi from Sungai Ujong's control. Negeri Sembilan back then was connected to Malacca via Sungai Linggi and high volume of trade passed through Sungai Linggi daily. A person that controlled Sungai Linggi would gain wealth through simply taxes.</p>
<p>Later in that year, Dato' Kelana Sendeng died. In early 1873, Sayid Abdul Rahman rose up to the former's place, hence becoming the new Dato' Kelana. The death however did not repair the relationship between Dato' Kelana and Dato' Bandar. On the contrary, it deteriorated. The new Dato' Kelana was extremely concerned with Dato' Bandar's unchecked influence and sought ways to counter his adversary's power.</p>
<p>When the British changed their non-inteventionist policy in 1873 by replacing Sir Harry Ord with Sir Andrew Clarke as the new governor of the Straits Settlements, Dato' Kelana immediately realized how the British could strengthen his position in Sungai Ujong. Dato' Kelana wasted no time to contact and lobby the British in Malacca to support him. In April 1874, Sir Clarke seized Dato' Kelana's request as a mean to build British presence in Sungai Ujong and Negeri Sembilan in general. Sir Clarke acknowledged Dato' Kelana as the legitimate chief of Sungai Ujong. The British and Dato' Kelana signed a treaty that insisted Dato' Kelana to rule Sungai Ujong justly, protect traders and prevent any anti-British action there. Dato' Bandar was not invited to sign the agreement and hence asserted that he was not bounded to the agreement. Moreover, Dato' Bandar and the locals disapproved the British presence in Sungai Ujong. This further made Dato' Kelana unpopular there.</p>
<p>Soon, a company led by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Pickering_%28Singapore%29_38a7.html" title="William Pickering (Singapore)">William A. Pickering</a> — of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Protectorate_9f5d.html" title="Chinese Protectorate">Chinese Protectorate</a> from the Straits Settlements — was sent to Sungai Ujong to assess the situation on behalf of the Straits Settlements. He soon found out that the predicament Dato' Kelana in and reported back to the Straits Settlements. This forced the British to send 160 soldiers to Sungai Ujong to aid Pickering to defeat Dato' Bandar. At the end of 1874, Dato' Bandar fled to Kepayang. Despite defeat, The British paid him pension and granted asylum in Singapore.</p>
<p>As the year progressed, British influence increased to the point that an assistant resident was placed there to advise and assist Dato' Kelana with the governance of Sungai Ujong.</p>

<p>To streamline the administration of the Malay states and especially to protect and further develop the lucrative trade of tin-mining and rubber, Britain sought to consolidate and centralize control by federating the four states of Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang into the Federated Malay States (FMS). With Kuala Lumpur as the capital, the Residents-General administered the federation but compromised by allowing the Sultans to have powers limited only to the role as authority on Islam and Malay customs. Modern legislation was introduced to the Malay states with the creation of the Federal Council. Although the Sultans had less power than their counterparts in the Unfederated Malay States, the FMS enjoyed a much higher degree of modernization. Federalization also brought benefit through cooperative economic development, as evident in the earlier period, where Pahang was developed using funds from the revenue of Selangor and Perak.</p>
<p>The Unfederated Malay States on the other hand maintained their quasi-independence, had more autonomony and instead of having a Resident they were only required to accept a British Advisor, though in reality, they were still bound by treaty to accept the advice. Economic exploitation by the British were much less as the emphasis was more on keeping these states in line. Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were surrendered by Siam after the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Siamese_Treaty_of_1909_211c.html" title="Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909">Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909</a>. Independent Johor meanwhile, had to surrender Singapore to the British earlier on and despite the Sultan's political effort was forced to accept an advisor in 1914, becoming the last Malay state to lose her sovereignty.</p>
<p>This period of slow consolidation of power to a centralized government and compromise (the Sultans retain their reign but not rule in their states) would have a great impact later on the road to nationhood. It effectively marked the transition of the idea of Malay states as a collective of lands governed by feudal rulers to a more <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_system.html" title="Westminster system">Westminster</a>-type federal constitutional monarchy. This was to become the acceptable model for the future Federation of Malaya and ultimately Malaysia, a government type unique in the region where other countries adopted a stricter, heavily centralized administration.</p>
