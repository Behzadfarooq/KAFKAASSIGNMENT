<p><b>Brigham Young University</b> (<b>BYU</b>), located in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provo%2C_Utah_a20a.html" title="Provo, Utah">Provo, Utah</a>, is the flagship <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS or Mormon Church). About 98% of the students at BYU are members of this church<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and, as a condition of admission to the university, they commit to obey an <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor_code.html" title="Honor code">honor code</a> prohibiting alcohol and extramarital sexual relations.</p>
<p>Almost all male BYU students take a two-year hiatus from their studies after their freshman years to be <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_missionaries.html" title="Mormon missionaries">Mormon missionaries</a>. A smaller percentage of female students become Mormon missionaries sometime after the age of 21. Many BYU students have a level of foreign language proficiency as a result of their missionary tours.</p>
<p>BYU has relatively low tuition for a private university of its caliber.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Student tuition is partially underwritten by <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tithing.html" title="Tithing">tithing</a> donations to the Church.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">LDS Church</a> also operates four-year schools in <a href="../../../l/%C4%81/27/L%C4%81%27ie%2C_Hawai%27i_8a4f.html" title="Lā'ie, Hawai'i">Lā'ie, Hawai'i</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University-Hawaii_f80f.html" title="Brigham Young University-Hawaii">Brigham Young University-Hawaii</a>), and <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rexburg%2C_Idaho_4a20.html" title="Rexburg, Idaho">Rexburg, Idaho</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University-Idaho_541b.html" title="Brigham Young University-Idaho">Brigham Young University-Idaho</a>) as well as the <a href="../../../l/d/s/LDS_Business_College_53ad.html" title="LDS Business College">LDS Business College</a>, a two-year school in downtown Salt Lake City. These schools are institutionally independent from BYU in Provo, with their own administrations and accreditation.</p>
<p>BYU is affiliated with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_Jerusalem_Center_dc86.html" title="Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center">BYU Jerusalem Center</a> (a study center in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>) and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_Salt_Lake_Center_aac2.html" title="Brigham Young University Salt Lake Center">BYU Salt Lake Center</a> (a satellite learning center).</p>

<p>BYU's origin can be traced back to 1862. In that year, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_N._Dusenberry_ab5a.html" title="Warren N. Dusenberry">Warren Dusenberry</a> started a school in a prominent Provo adobe building called Cluff Hall located at 200 East and 200 North (northeastern corner). Dusenberry paid $50 a month in rent and manufactured the desks for the school himself. In 1865, he left his school to enter into private business and to serve a mission for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. In 1869, he started another school in Provo with his brother, this time in a different building. This school flourished, so they relocated to a building called the Lewis Building on Center and 300 West.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> When the student body of the Dusenberry brothers' school hit 300, the school became a part of the University of Deseret, based in Salt Lake City. The school in Provo was called the Timpanogos branch.<sup id="_ref-dusenberry_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dusenberry" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>On October 16, 1875, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a>, the president of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, personally purchased the Lewis Building. This is the commonly held founding date of BYU.<sup id="_ref-history_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[6]</a></sup> Young broke the school off from the University of Deseret and christened it "<b>Brigham Young Academy</b>."<sup id="_ref-dusenberry_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dusenberry" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brigham Young told one of his sons:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;"><sup id="_ref-dusenberry_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dusenberry" title="">[5]</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Classes at the new Brigham Young Academy commenced on the 3rd of January, 1876. <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reed_Smoot_8a84.html" title="Reed Smoot">Reed Smoot</a> was the first of 29 students to register for classes on that day, although he did not graduate from the Academy. Warren Dusenberry served as interim principal of the school for several months until April of 1876, when Brigham Young's choice for principal arrived, a German immigrant named <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_G._Maeser_09e2.html" title="Karl G. Maeser">Karl Maeser</a>.<sup id="_ref-history_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January of 1884, a fire started in a chemistry lab and destroyed the Lewis Building. Students then temporarily held class in three separate locations before relocating to a warehouse on University Avenue. The students attended class in the ZCMI warehouse until January 1892, when an elaborate brick and sandstone building called the "BY Academy Building" was completed.<sup id="_ref-history_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Brigham Young Academy was more like a present-day high school than a university. Some Academy students were at the elementary level and they received tutoring from older students.<sup id="_ref-history_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[6]</a></sup> High school students outnumbered the university students for a long time; in 1910, for example, there were about 200 students at the university level, but more than 800 at the high school level. The high school class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant "Y" that is to this day <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Monogram_0acc.html" title="Mountain Monogram">embedded on a mountain</a> near campus.<sup id="_ref-byhigh_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-byhigh" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The school was privately supported by members of the community, and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896. In 1903, Brigham Young Academy was dissolved, and was replaced by two institutions: Brigham Young High School, and Brigham Young University.<sup id="_ref-byhigh_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-byhigh" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1904, BYU bought 17 acres of land from Provo.<sup id="_ref-byhigh_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-byhigh" title="">[7]</a></sup> This land was called "Temple Hill," and many people had presumed that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> would build a temple on this property. Because of this expectation, some people were opposed to BYU buying the land. But thanks to the leadership of a BYU student named Byron Owen Colton, the opposition to the land purchase was assuaged and the deal was consummated.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[8]</a></sup> It was on this Temple Hill land, north of the BY Academy Building, that present-day BYU was begun.</p>
<p>In 1909, construction began on the first building on the current campus,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> the Karl G. Maeser Memorial.</p>
<p>BYU was once the largest private university in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, but has since been surpassed by the nationwide <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Phoenix_d5c6.html" title="University of Phoenix">University of Phoenix</a> (240,000), which has campuses around the world, and by <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a> (50,000, although fewer than 20,000 are undergraduates); it remains one of the world's largest church-affiliated universities, with an enrollment of 30,847 undergraduates and 3,279 graduate students during the 2005-2006 school year.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The selection of Vice President <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> as the graduate commencement speaker in 2007 has generated considerable controversy, with numerous calls to remove him.

<p>BYU also has an extension campus, the <a href="http://ce.byu.edu/sl/" class="external text" title="http://ce.byu.edu/sl/" rel="nofollow">BYU Salt Lake Center</a> in Salt Lake City. Admitted BYU students may register for classes the same way as with any class on the main Provo campus. Also, with proper clearance, non-admitted students may also register for classes. Because of this, fewer of the Salt Lake Center's students are college-age compared to Provo. However, while these credits can be applied at BYU or transferred to other universities, registration does not constitute admittance to BYU. The Salt Lake Center, with its tendency toward smaller class sizes than the main campus, is a more relaxed atmosphere, and BYU has capitalized on this fact in advertising.</p>

<p>One unique aspect of BYU is its abundance of foreign language study.</p>
<p>Over three quarters of the student body have some proficiency in a second language (numbering 107 languages in total). This is partially due to the fact that 82% of the men and 13% of the women at BYU have been <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_missionary.html" title="Mormon missionary">missionaries</a> for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, and many of them learned a foreign language as part of their mission assignment.</p>
<p>The church's largest <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missionary_Training_Center_9a9e.html" title="Missionary Training Center">Missionary Training Center</a> (MTC) is adjacent to the main BYU campus, and is known for its intensive language-training program for new missionaries. Most of the language instructors at the MTC are BYU students who recently returned from missions themselves.</p>
<p>As an extension of the Linguistics and English Language department's <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language_learning_and_teaching.html" title="English language learning and teaching">TESOL</a> (Teaching English to Speaker's of Other Languages) program, BYU operates the <a href="http://www.elc.byu.edu" class="external text" title="http://www.elc.byu.edu" rel="nofollow">English Language Center</a> (ELC). The ELC exists as a <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratory_school.html" title="Laboratory school">laboratory school</a> primarily for graduate students in TESOL who are seeking teaching experience as a component to their course work and research. The Center typically has between 200-300 international students each semester who hail from numerous countries in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. ELC students are primarily taught English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in preparation for study at English-speaking universities.</p>
<p>During any given semester, about one-third of the student body is enrolled in foreign language classes, a rate nearly four times the national average. BYU offers courses in over 70 different languages, many with advanced courses that are seldom offered elsewhere. Several of its language programs, including Welsh, are the largest of their kind in the nation.</p>
<p>BYU also offers an intensive foreign language living experience, the Foreign Language Student Residence (FLSR). The FLSR is an on-campus apartment complex where students commit to speak a foreign language while in their apartments. Administrators mandate a native-level speaker for each apartment, enabling students to get native-level exposure to their languages. Approximately 10 languages are usually offered through FLSR, occupying a total of 25 apartments.<a href="http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/residence_halls/flsr.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/residence_halls/flsr.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> On occasion, additional languages are offered Spring term.</p>
<p>BYU's <a href="http://ic.byu.edu/" class="external text" title="http://ic.byu.edu/" rel="nofollow">International Cinema</a> is the largest and longest-running foreign film program in the country, showing 20 screenings per week to roughly 1,000 people. Its main purpose is to supplement the curriculum of the College of Humanities and the Honors Program with culturally and linguistically diverse films.</p>

<p>Like many other religious schools, BYU is often at the center of controversies regarding <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_freedom.html" title="Academic freedom">academic freedom</a>. In 1992, the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[23]</a></sup> After receiving comment from faculty and others, the document was implemented by BYU administrators on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. This document specified that: "Because the gospel encompasses all truth and affirms the full range of human modes of knowing, the scope of integration for LDS scholars is, in principle, as wide as truth itself." However, citing BYU's role as a religious institution, the document allowed limitations to be placed upon "expression with students or in public that:</p>
<ol>
<li>contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy;</li>
<li>deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or</li>
<li>violates the Honor Code because the expression is dishonest, illegal, unchaste, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others.</li>
</ol>
<p>"...The ultimate responsibility to determine harm to the University mission or the church, however, remains vested in the University's governing bodies—including the University president and central administration and, finally, the board of Trustees."</p>
<p>Also in 1992, the university began including a clause in its faculty contracts requiring LDS faculty to "accept the spiritual and temporal expectations of wholehearted Church membership".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In 1993, contracts further required LDS faculty to "accept as a condition of employment the standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges" (referring to entry into <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Mormonism%29_097c.html" title="Temple (Mormonism)">LDS temples</a>, for which one must meet standards of activity and behavior in the LDS Church). In 1996, LDS faculty were required, as a condition of employment, to obtain the yearly endorsement of their local ecclesiastical leaders certifying that the faculty were temple-worthy.</p>
<p>Soon after adopting the statement in 1992, BYU took actions which some have viewed as related to the implementation of the new academic freedom policy. For example, in late 1992, the university's board of trustees vetoed without comment a BYU proposal to invite <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> winner and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> professor <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurel_Thatcher_Ulrich_380b.html" title="Laurel Thatcher Ulrich">Laurel Thatcher Ulrich</a>, an active feminist, to address the annual BYU Women's Conference. Since then, the university has also dismissed, denied continuing status, or censured faculty members who have taken critical positions relating to official church policy or leadership.</p>
<p>For example, in 1993, BYU denied continuing status to Cecilia Konchar Farr, who had publicly advocated a pro-choice position on abortion, she was hired as an English instructor and some felt her positions of pro-choice were irrelevant to her assignment with the school. And to David Knowlton, who had discussed the church's missionary system at an independent Mormon forum. In 1996, BYU dismissed Gail T. Houston, a feminist who advocated prayer to a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavenly_Mother_4261.html" title="Heavenly Mother">Heavenly Mother</a>, despite positive votes from her English Department and the College Committee.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Also in 1996, professor <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Evenson_78bd.html" title="Brian Evenson">Brian Evenson</a> resigned in protest after receiving a warning from BYU administration over some violent images in one of his short stories. Most recently, in 2006, part-time faculty instructor <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Nielsen_9e8b.html" title="Jeffrey Nielsen">Jeffrey Nielsen</a>'s contract was not renewed<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[24]</a></sup> after he wrote an op-ed piece in the <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a> <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_Tribune_db37.html" title="Salt Lake Tribune">Salt Lake Tribune</a> which criticized and opposed the Mormon Church's stance on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">same-sex marriage</a>.</p>
<p>Officially, BYU spokespeople generally framed the actions in the cases of Farr, Knowlton, and Houston as relating to the quality of the professors' scholarship, and sometimes to unspecified misbehavior, rather than the controversial content of the affected professor's academic activities.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[25]</a></sup> Nevertheless, some critics viewed these dismissals as a kind of "purge." In 1997, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_of_University_Professors_b8e1.html" title="American Association of University Professors">American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) issued a <a href="http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/Institutions/archives/1997/Brigham.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.aaup.org/Com-a/Institutions/archives/1997/Brigham.pdf" rel="nofollow">report</a> documenting the cases of Houston, Farr, Knowlton, Evenson, Epperson, and others, concluding "that infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor".</p>
<p>The AAUP report also contained, as an appendix, a response authored by the BYU administration, which argued that BYU had the right to limit academic freedom in order to preserve the religious character of the school, a right implied by a 1940 AAUP statement and generally followed until 1970. In particular, BYU compared itself to Gonzaga University, a Jesuit institution which prohibited "open espousal of viewpoints which contradict explicit principles of Catholic faith and morals." In 1965, however, the AAUP had stated that "satisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure now prevail at Gonzaga".<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>BYU's arguments, however, failed to persuade the AAUP, which had changed its views since 1940. In 1970, the AAUP had adopted a statement of <i>Interpretive Comments</i> in which the AAUP had stated, "Most church-related institutions no longer need or desire the departure from the principle of academic freedom implied in the 1940 <i>Statement</i>, and we do not endorse such a departure".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Nor was the AAUP persuaded by BYU's response to criticisms that the academic freedom process lacked transparency and objectivity. Thus, in 1998, the AAUP voted to enter BYU on its list of censured organizations, on which it remains to the present, together with 42 other institutions.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[27]</a></sup> The president of BYU at the time of the investigation and censure, Merrill J. Bateman, left the university in 2003; the AAUP subsequently sent the new president a description of the steps needed to have the censure removed.</p>
<p>BYU's academic freedom controversy has not always been limited to religious matters. In October 2006 BYU <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> professor <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_E._Jones_96d2.html" title="Steven E. Jones">Steven E.

<p>The BYU men's basketball team is ranked in the top 25 NCAA programs all-time for total victories. As of 2006, BYU had racked up 82 winning seasons, 26 conference titles, 21 NCAA tournament invites, 10 NIT invites and 2 NIT titles (1951 and 1966). In 2005 the program was ranked 36th in Street &amp; Smiths "100 greatest College Basketball Programs of All Time" based on NCAA tournament success, NIT success, national championships, conference regular-season and tournament titles, all-time win-loss percentage, graduation percentage, NCAA infractions, NBA first round draft picks and mascot ferocity.</p>
<p>While much of the team's success, including its two NIT titles, came in the 1950s and 1960s, the team began a resurgence in the late 1970s. Led by star point guard, Danny Ainge, the cougars easily captured WAC titles in 1979 and 1980. In 1981, despite placing third in conference play below co-champions Wyoming and Utah the cougars managed to defeat Notre Dame in the NCAA tournament and advance to the "Elite Eight", where they were knocked off by Virginia. The cougars finished the season 25-7 and ranked 16th in the nation. In this, his final season, Ainge was named All-American and was awarded the Eastman and John Wooden awards as college basketball's outstanding player.</p>
<p>Other highlights for the Cougars include opening 17-0 in the 1987-88 season and being ranked as high as 2nd in the nation before falling to UAB in Birmingham. The cougars finished the season 26-6 overall and ranked in the top 20. The following year, Coach Roger Reid took over for the Cougars. During his seven-year tenure, he led the Cougars to six 20-win seasons, 6 post-season tournaments (5 NCAA and 1 NIT), 3 WAC titles and 2 WAC tournament titles, racking up a 152-77 record (0.664) the highest winning percentage ever for a BYU coach. However, he was dismissed in his seventh season amid a recruiting controversy after a 0-7 start. The cougars went on to complete their worst-ever season with a meager 1-25 record.</p>
<p>Following Reid's departure, Steve Cleaveland took the helm leading the cougars to 2 additional MWC championships and 3 NCAA tournament invitations before leaving in 2005.</p>
<p>Dave Rose took over as head coach upon Cleveland's departure to Fresno State. He helped the cougars to a 20 win season in the 2005-2006 season. In the 2006-2007 season, the cougars became nationally ranked for the first time since 1994 and won the Mountain West Conference regular season championship outright.</p>

<p>Students from every state in the US and from many foreign countries attend BYU (in 2001, 110 different countries were represented by more than 1,600 BYU students).</p>
<p>Slightly more than 98% of these students are active members of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[32]</a></sup> Those who have never been members of the church are permitted to attend, while former members are excluded from consideration for admittance unless they are reinstated to full church fellowship.

<p>BYU mandates that its students be religiously active. Students and faculty who are LDS are required to submit an affidavit stating that they are active participants in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">LDS</a> Church. The affidavit must be signed by LDS church leaders, and it must be resubmitted annually.</p>
<p>Non-LDS students are asked to provide a similar endorsement from an ecclesiastic (religious) leader of their choice with their application for admittance, as well as an annual review similar to the one LDS students undergo. See <a href="http://honorcode.byu.edu/Ecclesiastical_Endorsement.htm" class="external free" title="http://honorcode.byu.edu/Ecclesiastical_Endorsement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://honorcode.byu.edu/Ecclesiastical_Endorsement.htm</a></p>
<p>LDS BYU students can choose to affiliate with the local congregation (ward) where they reside or the corresponding student ward. Most single LDS BYU students are members of student wards, which typically have around 150 members. Some married students also choose to be affiliated with married student wards, although this is less common than among single students. These specialized church units relieve some of the leadership and administrative burden that the student population would otherwise have on local church units. In addition, student wards and stakes typically have programs designed to meet the specific needs of a younger, more transient population.</p>
<p>Most male students and some female students take a hiatus from their undergraduate studies to serve as <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_missionary.html" title="Mormon missionary">LDS missionaries</a>. Male students typically go on their missions shortly after turning 19 years old. This often occurs during or at the end of their freshman year. Female students may begin their missionary service anytime after turning 21. For males, a full-time mission is two years long, and for females it lasts 18 months.</p>

<p>All students and faculty, regardless of religion, voluntarily agree to adhere to an <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor_code.html" title="Honor code">honor code</a>. When first implemented in the late 1940s, the code dealt mainly with academic issues, such as cheating and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a>. It has since expanded (especially during the 1960s and 1970s) to become one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching honor codes at any college or university. There was some dissent from both students and teachers as the code was expanded, but by and large, the changes have held over the decades.</p>
<p>The BYU honor code governs not only academic behavior, but morality, and dress and grooming standards of students and faculty, with the aim of providing an atmosphere consistent with LDS principles. The Honor Code requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstinence from <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreational_drug.html" title="Recreational drug">illicit drugs</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcohol</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea.html" title="Tea">tea</a> (substances forbidden by the LDS <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_of_Wisdom_6e64.html" title="Word of Wisdom">Word of Wisdom</a>)</li>

<li>No inappropriate sexual activity (no sexual relationships outside of marriage)</li>
<li>No homosexual behavior or advocacy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obedience to the law</li>
<li>Active participation in Church services (according to whatever religion one is a member)</li>

<p>Students have the option of living in on-campus housing, with family members who reside in the local area, or in off-campus housing which must pass a school inspection for health and safety, as well as satisfactory separation of gender quarters and compliance with other standards.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_University_4ac9.html" title="Edit section: Culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h3>
<p>BYU's social and cultural atmosphere is unique. The high rate of enrollment at the university by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints results in an amplification of LDS cultural norms which are often caricatured.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of BYU most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a "marriage culture". Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints highly value marriage and family, as well as marriage within the faith. Consequently, the enormous population of LDS single adults in and around Provo makes it a mecca for singles in the church, irrespective of their affiliation with BYU. BYU's reputation as a place to court potential mates is well known both within and without the BYU community, and is encouraged to some extent by the school's administrators and ecclesiastical leaders, who publicly highlight "successful" <a href="http://saas.byu.edu/depts/graduation/statistics.aspx" class="external text" title="http://saas.byu.edu/depts/graduation/statistics.aspx" rel="nofollow">marriage statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Most BYU students are acutely aware of the marriage stereotype, and some female students contribute to it by dropping out before graduation due to marriage and subsequent pregnancy. 56.3% of the men and 42.4% of the women in BYU's class of 2004 were married (the average age at graduation being 24.3). An earlier study ending in 1990 showed that 65% of matriculated male students ended up graduating, while the rate among matriculated female students was only 35%. Marriage statistics for the state of Utah as a whole indicate that BYU's marriage rate falls well within that of the state in general, with the median age at marriage in Utah being 23 for men, and 21 for women. It should be noted, however, that the percentage of married students at BYU is much higher than at most other universities, and the median age of marriage in Utah is significantly lower than in the United States as a whole. In regard to marriage, BYU is thus best described as a reflection of the cultural practices of the LDS population as a whole, rather than as an outlier.</p>
<p>BYU's large body of students who have served as missionaries for the LDS Church significantly shapes the institution's culture. Young men are strongly encouraged to serve full-time two-year <a href="../../../l/d/s/LDS_missionary_abdb.html" title="LDS missionary">missions</a> for the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">LDS Church</a> after turning 19. Consequently, men typically attend BYU for their <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freshman.html" title="Freshman">freshman</a> year and then take a two year break from school to serve a mission. Thus, the average male <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophomore.html" title="Sophomore">sophomore</a> at BYU is 21 years old. Although LDS women can also serve full-time missions, the church does not press them to do so. Additionally, missions for LDS females are only 18 months in duration, and females may not serve full-time missions until after reaching 21, so women more often graduate before serving a mission.</p>
<p>Off-campus housing must be certified by BYU before its students can live in it. The bathroom and the bedrooms are off limits for members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>BYU does not permit <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternities_and_sororities.html" title="Fraternities and sororities">fraternities or sororities</a>.</p>
<p>BYU's Winter semester ends in April, earlier than most universities, and as such BYU has no <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_break.html" title="Spring break">Spring break</a>.</p>

<p>Many visitors to BYU, and Utah Valley as a whole, report being surprised by the culturally conservative environment. Brigham Young University's Honor Code, which all BYU students agree to as a condition of studying at BYU, prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, etc. The <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Review_c6c9.html" title="Princeton Review">Princeton Review</a> has rated BYU the "#1 stone cold sober school" for several years running, an honor on which LDS Church president <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_B._Hinckley_9d10.html" title="Gordon B. Hinckley">Gordon B. Hinckley</a> has often commented with pride. The school's strait-laced reputation is a major selling point in athletic recruiting: as non-LDS players (particularly African-Americans from <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_cities.html" title="Inner cities">inner cities</a>) have become ever more important to the school's teams, BYU's wholesomeness is often attractive for prospective students who prefer an academic or social environment without alcohol, illegal drug abuse, and violent crime. According to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Crime_Reports_81a2.html" title="Uniform Crime Reports">Uniform Crime Reports</a>, incidents of crime in Provo are lower than the national average with the exception of rape. Murder is rare, and robberies are about 1/10th the national average.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

The original, physical BYU 100 Hour Board. Today the Board is entirely online.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One unique aspect of Brigham Young University is the presence of the 100 Hour Board (also called "The Board"). The 100 Hour Board is a question and answer forum located online and hosted by BYU NewsNet. While its primary readership is comprised of BYU students, the 100 Hour Board also services alumni, faculty and staff, prospective students, family members of students, and other interested parties. Participants can submit questions of any sort and receive an answer 100 hours later. Topics range from science to relationships to LDS Church doctrine to current events. The 100 Hour Board is staffed by volunteer 31 student writers and editors, according to the Fall 2006 issue of the BYU alumni magazine.</p>
<p>The Board began in 1995 as a student forum through which the Student Advisory Council (SAC) could communicate with the student body. The Board initially existed simply as a physical entity in the now-removed step-down lounge of the Ernest L. Wilkinson Student Center. Gradually, though, it morphed into its current form of a general Q&amp;A form that is entirely web-based today.</p>
