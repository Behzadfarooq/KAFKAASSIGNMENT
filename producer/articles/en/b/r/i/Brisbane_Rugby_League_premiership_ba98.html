	    <p>The <b>Brisbane Rugby League premiership</b> was a <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> competition held in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. Until the 1980s it was the premier sporting competition in Brisbane, attracting large crowds and broad media coverage.

<p>The <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland_Rugby_League_0867.html" title="Queensland Rugby League">Queensland Rugby League</a> was formed in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> by seven <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland_Rugby_Union_613c.html" title="Queensland Rugby Union">Queensland Rugby Union</a> (QRU). The new organisation was attacked by both the local press and the QRU for introducing professionalism, which they claimed would destroy the sport. The "founding fathers" of the QRL included John Fihelly, an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a> Member of Parliament who became Minister for Railways and Deputy Premier.</p>
<p>The first official club competition kicked off in Brisbane on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>. Matches were played under the auspices of the Queensland Rugby Football League (QRFL, later QRL). The foundation clubs were:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Brisbane</li>
<li>Toombul</li>
<li>Valley</li>
<li>South Brisbane</li>
<li>Milton</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Rugby_League_premiership_ba98.html" title="Edit section: Schism: establishment of the Brisbane Rugby League">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Schism: establishment of the Brisbane Rugby League</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> the Brisbane Rugby Football League (BRFL, later BRL) was formed out of dissatisfaction with the way the QRFL ran the game. Those involved took particular exception to the salary being earned by Harry Sunderland as secretary of the QRL. The BRFL took control of the local competition. Competing in the BRFL competition that year were Brothers, Carltons, Coorparoo, University, Valley and Grammars. Although the QRL attempted to regain control of the BRL competition in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, the BRL remained steadfast and the dispute simmered into the next decade. During this time the QRL continued to hold its own Brisbane competition.</p>
<p>Until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Exhibition_Ground_5dd0.html" title="Brisbane Exhibition Ground">Brisbane Exhibition Ground</a> was the home of rugby league in the city. The complicated arrangement between the BRL, QRL and Royal National Association (who administered the Exhibition Ground) led to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Cricket_Ground_dd74.html" title="Brisbane Cricket Ground">The Gabba</a> being used for rugby league matches.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> district football was introduced to provide community support and player equalisation. This meant that players had to live within a certain distance of their club. Accordingly Brisbane was divided into <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easts_Tigers_4c93.html" title="Easts Tigers">Eastern Suburbs</a> (incorporating Cooparoo and Wynnum), <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souths_Magpies_028c.html" title="Souths Magpies">Southern Suburbs</a> (incorporating Carltons), <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wests_Panthers_ad51.html" title="Wests Panthers">Western Suburbs</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norths_Devils_d1da.html" title="Norths Devils">Northern Suburbs</a> (incorporating Grammers), <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortitude_Valley_Diehards_ae8c.html" title="Fortitude Valley Diehards">Fortitude Valley</a> and Past Brothers (whose players had to prove that they had attended a Christian Brothers school). In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> University returned to <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>.</p>
<p>The dispute was finally ended in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> when the BRL and QRL administrations were finally united. Former BRL chairman and QRL secretary <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_McAullife_31bb.html" title="Ron McAullife">Ron McAullife</a> secured the use of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lang_Park_3452.html" title="Lang Park">Lang Park</a> as a permanent home for rugby league in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>. Teams that joined the BRL competition around this time were South Coast (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>), <a href="../../../w/y/n/Wynnum_Seagulls_088b.html" title="Wynnum Seagulls">Wynnum-Manly</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>) and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redcliffe_Dolphins_dd71.html" title="Redcliffe Dolphins">Redcliffe</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Decline" id="Decline"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Rugby_League_premiership_ba98.html" title="Edit section: Decline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> the QRL removed the residential qualifications for player in BRL clubs, meaning that players did not have to reside in their certain suburbs to play for their teams. This reduced community support for teams, and club decisions began to be made on a more commercial basis.</p>
<p>This coincided with the commencement of television telecasts of BRL games in the same year. The money made from jersey sponsorships and advertising hoardings at ground was not able to compete with poker machine money available to clubs in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Rugby_League_f16a.html" title="New South Wales Rugby League">New South Wales Rugby League</a> and an increasing number of players left the BRL. This also effected the popularity of the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulimba_Cup_%28rugby_league_competition%29_fab5.html" title="Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)">Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)</a> that had been held between Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba since the 1930s.</p>
<p>The effect of television coverage on attendances became pronounced by the mid-1970s and crowds began to desert the BRL competition. Clubs found themselves in financial hardship, and the public began to support the Sydney competition that was now broadcast in Queensland.</p>
<p>The QRL commissioned Eric White Associates to investigate the administrative structure of the game in Queensland in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. One of the recommendations was the creation of a state-wide competition. The Winfield State League was created in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. The State League competition ran in parallel to the BRL competition from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. The <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland_Cup_%28rugby_league_competition%29_8426.html" title="Queensland Cup (rugby league competition)">Queensland Cup (rugby league competition)</a> would eventually replace both it and the BRL competition in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, two further teams were added to the BRL competition: <a href="../../../i/p/s/Ipswich_Jets_559e.html" title="Ipswich Jets">Ipswich</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>) and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logan_Scorpians_d8d6.html" title="Logan Scorpians">Logan</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> the New South Wales Rugby League decided to allow a team from Brisbane to enter the Sydney competition. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Broncos_73ce.html" title="Brisbane Broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a> debuted in the NSWRL in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. As the Broncos began to represent Brisbane at rugby league in the public eye the BRL competition entered the terminal phase of its decline. The BRL premiership was supersceded by the Queensland Cup competition in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. Redcliffe won the last BRL Grand Final in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> defeating Easts 18-16.</p>

<li>"Well that is a tragedy, to be honest with you. There's no club identity at all now. If you don't follow the Broncos well who do you follow? That means you've got to follow a New South Wales side. I think I'm sure that's what McAuliffe didn't want to happen. But when they brought in the Queensland side into the NRL that was the end of the BRL, as far as that was concerned. It should never have happened because as it turned out, if we did lose players from Queensland to go to New South Wales we had the State of Origin. We've been winning the State of Origin, and you can imagine if we were keeping our players, the club competition would be just as good as what it was when I was playing. But that is a tragedy as far as I'm concerned is that the people miss that club identity." <i>-<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Muir_fd73.html" title="Barry Muir">Barry Muir</a> on the decline of the BRL and the rise of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rugby_League_51b9.html" title="National Rugby League">National Rugby League</a>.</i></li>
<li>"Yeah well the crowd was great, they supported you wholeheartedly, they came along but it wasn't only down here on the football field it was on the streets up there. People would come up and talk to you, they'd stop you in the street and get your autograph and have a talk to you and wish you all the best and really support you in what you were doing and lifting the Club. There was four or five players here that were top-line footballers and we used to go up on the terrace and sell raffles in front of McCarthy's Jewellers store on the terrace and we'd do an hour there and then pop down to the Manly Hotel and do an hour there and then we'd pop down to Fishers (pub) and do an hour there. The players were prepared to do it because they were getting the support from this area and they would give it back on the playing field and however they could meet the people on the streets. I don't think anyone turned away from you, it was just one big happy family. We used to have like a barbecue after the game and there'd be 100 or 200 people that would turn up for the barbecue, we had it at various areas." <i>-Lionel Morgan on the support of the BRL in the Wynnum-Manly district.</i></li>
