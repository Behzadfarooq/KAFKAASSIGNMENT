<dd>The Blue Ranger! That's <i>really</i> weird if there actually are people writing Billy fan fiction. Do they have "<a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash.html" title="Slash">slash</a>" with him and the other Rangers? (I really don't want to know . . . . ) Nice original research all through that article, by the way. I, sadly, do not have a doppleganger notable enough for Wikipedia.

<p>Hey there. I'm pleased to let you know that, consensus being reached, you are now an <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator</a>! You've volunteered to do housekeeping duties that normal users sadly cannot participate in. Sysops can't do a lot of stuff: They can't delete pages just like that (except patent nonsense like "aojt9085yu8;3ou"), and they can't protect pages in an edit war they are involved in. But they can delete random junk, ban anonymous vandals, delete pages listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> (provided there's a consensus) for more than one week, protect pages when asked to, and keep the few <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_page_6ebc.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected page">protected pages</a> that exist on Wikipedia up to date.</p>
Almost anything you can do can be undone, but please take a look at <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_how-to_guide_237e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide">The Administrators' how-to guide</a></b> and the <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">Administrators' reading list</a></b> before you get started (although you <i>should</i> have read that during your candidacy ;). Take a look before experimenting with your <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">powers</a>. Also, please add <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">Administrators' noticeboard</a> to your watchlist, as there are always discussions/requests for admins there. If you have any questions drop me a message at <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp">My talk page</a>.

<p>There is still no proof of any of his TV shows in half-hour reruns, and also new shows for December I don't doubt if Channel 4, 5 or any other television station is still airing "Charlie the etc. Dog" (mostly about dancing) (Saturday Mornings at 10:30, e.g.) I don't watch television on Saturday mornings. That does not make any sense, when the show is non-existent, is being banned by parents? No, I am in my 20's. What in the world are some parents talking about this about banning him on the screen? Oh, shut up. I think nobody wants to discuss this at all. His past of the 40's and 50's seems to be ignored. There are wild rumors about himself appearing in several TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s, who tries to sell himself. I had enough.</p>

<dd>Wood [nÃ©e Vining], Matilda Charlotte [known as Mrs John Wood] (bap. 1831, d. 1915), actress and theatre manager, was baptized on 28 November 1831 at St Peter's Church, Liverpool, the second daughter of the actors Henry Vining and Amelia Vining, nÃ©e Quantrell (1803/4â1874) [see Vining family]. Despite going on the stage when she was ten, Matilda Vining, whose âforte was low comedyâ (ILN, 28 Feb 1885), came to prominence in England only in the late 1860s after gaining a reputation in America, principally in burlesque, and reached the height of her success in the 1880s in farces by Pinero. Her first stage appearance was in 1841 in Brighton.</dd>

Nonsense. The problem clearly is with Pietro... As anyone can see from what he wrote below. You seem to think thay you own the Flip the Frog article along with some others.... You tell him not to any images yet you add more yourself. Sorry to point this out to you but you do not "own" any of the articles on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Vitaphone,</p>
<p>I appeciate your contributions, but please do not add any more images to the Flip the Frog article, as more images just clutter everything up. The same applies to the Willie Whopper and ComiColor Cartoons articles. I do hope you understand. Also, when uploading images be sure to give them a proper copyright tag first and if you obtained an image from a website to ask the owner of that site for permission before using it. I'm not trying to sound patronizing or condescending; it's not intended to be. I look forward to your further contributions here on Wikipedia. :) - <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietro_Shakarian_5943.html" title="User:Pietro Shakarian">Pietro Shakarian</a> 03:07, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think Pietro is claiming to own any article. He is simply arguing for the images he believes the most appropriate. I urge you to make a case on the appropriate talk pages for the images <i>you</i> prefer. Wikipedia is supposed to work on the concept of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>; no one is supposed to unilaterally change something with which others disagree.</dd>
<dd>You should also heed Pietro's advice about copyright and contacting the owners of the sites from which you took the images. <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Wikipedia policy</a> is very clear on this. Without this information, your images are prime candidates for deletion, and all of your work will have been for nothing. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 03:51, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This argument about the unknown character has gone too far. Because anyone tells me to shut up about him, is that (you know who) is all going to do?! Despite, others got tried of the discussion, looks like they didn't care. But except for one thing, that Jeff Schiller claimed Charlie harrased other people. I did not know Charlie had three legs, I think this is probably the same character, which he is now on PBS. I guess that wraps it up.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikifying dates</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I saw you reverted wikifying the dates in the [[George Washington Dixon]] article. It is very handy to have it linked though. This way readers see the dates according to their preferences. Americans see May 14 and Europeans see 14 may. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing] [[User:Garion1000|Garion1000]] [[User_talk:Garion1000|(talk)]] 15:41, 23 December 2005 (UTC) : What you say I agree with, however you didn't mentioned anything on what I said here before. I won't revert the article again, but I don't agree. I think it's handy to have the dates linked so that it shows december 14 or 14 december depending on the reader. NOT for the link itself. That indeed is pointless. See also the article on [[Rosa Parks]]. A featured article, where also all the dates are linked. Even in the notes. [[User:Garion1000|Garion1000]] [[User_talk:Garion1000|(talk)]] 23:02, 23 December 2005 (UTC) :: Glad we we understand each other now. I don't like useless links either. Just in this case I think it's handy. I noticed one time two anonymous editors reverting eachother because they prefer 1 april instead of april 1. So pointless, linking (IMO) is than better. Anyway, Happy Holidays and good luck with the FAC. It's a very good article. [[User:Garion1000|Garion1000]] [[User_talk:Garion1000|(talk)]] 23:24, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I think it needs a longer block than usual, say perhaps a week. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 15:38, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

There is some sort of craziness going on in which some website specifically asked Wikipedia to stop using their content, but the above user has been inserting their images into articles and userspace.

<dd>Hmmm... I suppose that's not an <i>insane</i> stance to take. I don't agree with you, but don't see it as an emergancy or anything. I'll put the ArbCom back on my watch list and wait.

<p>Re featured comments about the notes, do you know about ref label and note label? My newest favorite thing, and should help you, I believe, compact the notes to some degree. See <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJengod_485b.html#How_to_use_ref_label_and_note_label" title="User:Jengod">User:Jengod#How_to_use_ref_label_and_note_label</a> or knock around <a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffron.html" title="Saffron">Saffron</a> if you prefer to learn by example. I also have them on an article I would someday (a long time from now) like to see featured: <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dingbat_%28building%29.html" title="Dingbat (building)">Dingbat (building)</a>. I think this might soothe the savage FAC beast. :) <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJengod_485b.html" title="User:Jengod">jengod</a> 18:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, I think I may switch to that system or else the new mediawiki one. Hopefully that will shave on bytes. Still, I find it funny that people are complaining that an article has too <i>many</i> notes! :) â <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 21:50, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
