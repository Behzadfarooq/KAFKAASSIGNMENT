<p>The robbers included <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gilbert_67f5.html" title="David Gilbert">David Gilbert</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Brown_5563.html" title="Samuel Brown">Samuel Brown</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Alice_Clark_b017.html" title="Judith Alice Clark">Judith Alice Clark</a>, and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Boudin_5200.html" title="Kathy Boudin">Kathy Boudin</a>. The robbery began with Boudin dropping her infant son, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesa_Boudin_28b0.html" title="Chesa Boudin">Chesa Boudin</a>, at a baby sitter's before picking up the getaway vehicle, a U-Haul truck. She waited in a nearby parking lot as her heavily armed accomplices took another vehicle to a local mall where a Brinks truck was making a delivery. They confronted the guards and shot Joe Trombino, wounding him, and killed his co-worker, Peter Paige. The four criminals then took $1.6 million in cash and rendezvoused with Boudin.</p>

<p>An alert high-school student called the police after spotting the heavily armed crew abandoning the getaway vehicle and entering the <a href="../../../u/-/h/U-Haul_1b71.html" title="U-Haul">U-Haul</a> in a disused shopping mall parking lot. A police officer spotted and pulled over the U-Haul, but they could only see Boudin in the drivers seat. Boudin then got out of the cab, and raised her hands.</p>

<p>Boudin and David Gilbert, a Weatherman radical and the father of Boudin's infant son, deliberately acted as decoys as well as getaway drivers--police were then searching for African-American suspects (all members of the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Liberation_Army_34bf.html" title="Black Liberation Army">Black Liberation Army</a>) who drove a red car.</p>
<p>The police officers who caught them testified that Boudin, feigning innocence, pleaded with them to put down their guns and convinced them to drop their guard; Boudin said she remained silent, that the officers relaxed spontaneously. After the police did lower their weapons, six of the men in the back of the truck, who were armed with <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatic_weapon.html" title="Automatic weapon">automatic weapons</a>, surprised the four police officers by emerging and opening fire. A police officer, Waverly Brown, was killed instantly.</p>
<p>Officer Edward O'Grady lived long enough to empty his <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a>, but as he reloaded, he was shot several times with an <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_%28rifle%29.html" title="M16 (rifle)">M16</a>. Ninety minutes later, he died on a hospital operating table. The other two officers escaped with only minor injuries. The occupants of the U-Haul scattered, some climbing into another getaway car, others <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carjacking.html" title="Carjacking">carjacking</a> a nearby motorist while Boudin attempted to flee on foot. An off-duty corrections officer apprehended her shortly after the shoot out. When she was arrested, Boudin gave her name as Barbara Edson.</p>

<p>Three other <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Liberation_Army_34bf.html" title="Black Liberation Army">Black Liberation Army</a> members failed to escape. Weathermen <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gilbert_67f5.html" title="David Gilbert">David Gilbert</a>, Samuel Brown, and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judith_Alice_Clark_b017.html" title="Judith Alice Clark">Judith Alice Clark</a> crashed their own car while making a sharp turn, and were arrested by police. Two days later, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Smith_5dd1.html" title="Samuel Smith">Samuel Smith</a> and Nathaniel Burns were spotted in a car in New York. After a gunfight with police that left Smith dead, Burns was captured. Three more participants were arrested several months later, including <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwasi_Balagoon_563b.html" title="Kuwasi Balagoon">Kuwasi Balagoon</a>.</p>
<p>The investigation for the participants in the robbery would continue for years. Marilyn Buck, who provided the robbers with a safe house and weapons, was arrested in 1985. The last person to be arrested in connection with it was Jeral Williams, the alleged ringleader of the robbery, in 1986.</p>

<p>The majority of the defendants received three consecutive twenty-five year-to-life sentences, making them eligible for <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parole.html" title="Parole">parole</a> in the year <a href="../../../2/0/5/2058.html" title="2058">2058</a>. Boudin hired <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Weinglass_7d71.html" title="Leonard Weinglass">Leonard Weinglass</a> to defend her. Weinglass, a law partner of Boudin's father, arranged for a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> and Boudin pled guilty to one count of felony murder and robbery, in exchange for a single twenty year-to-life sentence. She was paroled in 2003.</p>
