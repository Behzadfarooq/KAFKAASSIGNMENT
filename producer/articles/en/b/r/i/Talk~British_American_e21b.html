	    <p>Two points: "In an historical context, that terminology would be correct." I don't think it would be wise to call one usage "correct", implying that other possibilities are incorrect. For example, I consider myself a British-American even though my British ancestors left England over four hundred years ago; I don't see a clear-cut line where you can say "well, those people have been living somewhere else for exactly 367.58 years, so they're no longer British-Americans but just Americans." Just because my British ancestors left Britain earlier than some other people's doesn't make me any less British, genetically speaking.</p>
<p>Secondly, "Our society tends to believe in hyphenated-Americanism, despite the fact that one's ancestry may date back to the foundations of this nation." This isn't a very Wikipedia-esque sentence for a few reasons. It refers to "our society", meaning "American society", when Wikipedia is a collaborative and <i>international</i> project, so "our society" should not refer to anything but human society as a whole. It would be even better to avoid first and second person pronouns altogether, since their usage depends largely on who is speaking and who is spoken to, things which change all the time as different people read and write articles. I have changed this to read "American society" instead of "our society", but have made no other changes.</p>
<p>I would like to get others' input before deciding how to fix up the rather POV-sounding second paragraph, as I'm not sure how to convert it into more neutral sentences. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Livajo</a> 21:21, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"<i>Today's English population doesn't consider themselves to be German because their ancestors were Anglo-Saxons from Germany."</i></p>
<p>Being English (whatever that is) doesn't necesarilly mean being descended from Angles, Saxons, Jutes, or any of the German tribes who descended on these shores. Many northern English are just as likely to have Viking ancestry, many more have Roman and ancient British (sometimes referred to as Celtic) bloodlines.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you missed the point, or were just eager to inject some more trivia. They could just as easily have said "do modern day english consider themselves viking-english, celtic-english or german-english etc, but it doesn't flow nearly as well. It was an example case to make a point. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastyCakes_4007.html" title="User:TastyCakes">TastyCakes</a> 17:53, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I will object for one. This is not an article about Canada. It is an article about people of British heritage in the United States. Perhaps you want <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Canadian_decb.html" title="French Canadian">French Canadian</a> article or want to start the the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_American_7e70.html" title="Canadian American">Canadian American</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_American_3c30.html" title="French American">French American</a>, or British Canadian article. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 13:57, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're needlessly or confusingly objecting. I was commenting on a presence of French in British identity, yet you seemingly have ignored everything but the last sentence! Please, I deal with education, not ignorance! You sound trollish. ScapegoatVandal 14:41, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is an article about British heritage in the United States of America, not about French heritage in the United Kingdom which I am certain is discussed elsewhere. French Canadian heritage in the United States would be discussed in its own article perhaps but also in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_American_7e70.html" title="Canadian American">Canadian American</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_American_3c30.html" title="French American">French American</a>. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 15:01, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The two are not mutually exclusive; British and French. That's what my whole paragraph is about! Really and truly, what is your valid argument? Read over the paragraph to find out how you are wrong and not even having a background about Anglo-French relations of any place, whether in Europe or colonies. ScapegoatVandal 15:19, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, we could write an encyclopdia with one article called "Everything" but it would hardly by useful or reflective of the usages of the world. I wonder at your jumping to the conclusion that I am unversed in British/French/American/Canadian history and relations merely because I disagree with you. This is hardly an appropriate response. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 16:30, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps you can refute my paragraph, instead of mock it? ScapegoatVandal 16:43, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, let me try and get this straight.. you're complaining because the article doesn't count French people as British? Please. If you want to point out that the article doesn't mention large scale mixing of Europeans in the new world, which makes it hard to categorize people as "British-American", fine. But you seem to just want to discuss your own convoluted genetic background. Yes at one point the lines between the states of England and France were more blurred than they are now. But most of that was centuries before significant migration and much of it before Britain and France were even the states they are today. It's pretty obvious French people are not a subset of British people. You seem to be trying to waste people's time with a pointless little monologue about your background and I would urge you to stop. End of discussion?</dd>
<dd>However, on a related note, it says the "overwhelming majority" of Canadians in the US are british. A look at Canadian census data will show you this isn't likely to be true, about a quarter are French (as scapegoatvandal was apparently trying to point out..) and I would assume make up a large part of Canadian-Americans thanks to the Acadians in New Orleans and large scale migration into the North East. Canadians from other parts of Europe exist in large numbers, and non-europeans are I think around 10%. A similar argument can be made against "the overwhelming majority" of people marking "American" being British. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastyCakes_4007.html" title="User:TastyCakes">TastyCakes</a> 17:48, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These lines seem contradictory:</p>
<p>'British-Americans are the largest ethnic group of Americans, as there are 57.6 million British-Americans and more than 100 million Americans with significant British ancestry.'</p>
<p>'These figures make British Americans one of the largest "ethnic" groups in the U.S. when counted collectively (although the Census Bureau does not count them collectively, as each of the above is a separate ethnic group, that is English or Scottish or Welsh or Scots-Irish; nor does the Bureau include a separate group for Northern Irish people). The Germans and Hispanic are the largest self-reported ethnic groups in the nation.'</p>
<p>Can someone explain how this works? Which is the biggest ethnic group? <a href="../../../k/o/h/User%7EKohran_9311.html" title="User:Kohran">Kohran</a> 16:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is interesting.</dd>
<dd>The first paragraph could be taken that 57.6 million Americans identify as British or one of the derivative ethnic groups, with 100 million Americans not identifying as British but recognising that they have some British heritage. So, I would say that this works.</dd>
<dd>The second needs to be rewritten. It says that the British are an ethnic group, but are not an ethnic group as the US census counts Welsh, English, Scottish and Scots-Irish separately. But, it says that the Germans are an ethnic group, and that includes Germans, Danes, Dutch and several others, which are far more distinct from each other than the forementioned British peoples! As for Hispanics, this grouping is made up of people even MORE distinct amongst themselves. <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzedbrit_6d4b.html" title="User:Enzedbrit">Enzedbrit</a> 23:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
