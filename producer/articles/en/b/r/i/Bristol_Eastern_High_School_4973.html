<p>While generally speaking the school has been praised, as with the Blue Ribbon award, it has been fixated locally as a center of controversy since the 1970s. From 1971 to 1984 no valedictorian at the school was named. The current statement from the school about this gap of time was that the records were not kept. However, c. 1972-78, there was turmoil at Bristol Eastern as there was in many high schools across the country; a large movement of teenage insubordination was sweeping the nation. It seems, though, that Bristol Eastern was unusually overrun and surprisingly unmanned during this period. A major central issue of the time was smoking on the grounds, whose eventual solution would lead to many other problems. The problem was rampant and the school lacked the proper authority to stop it. Several methods were tried unsuccessfully such as allowing smoking at the entrance ways, or in the courtyards. But when these designated areas became swamped, this colliding with several other problems such as excessive intimate contact, drug usage, violence, and protest, the administration decided to experiment with open campus. The period of time under which this took place is c. 1974-1977. The experiment was a catastrophic failure. The idea was that the students would feel more respected as adults and choose the "right" behavior. However, it turned out the problem was that students were apathetic to having or not having a teacher's respect; the general philosophy was that school was just a burden to be avoided, this coupled with the movements nationwide sweeping high schools about not submitting to authority. The students were utterly out of the control of the teachers and the only participation occurred by those students who wanted to. Such reports broke out like open use of drugs in the classroom, frequent sexual activity in the classroom and bathrooms, and possibly worst, bad tutoring. Many teachers were reported to have simply stopped teaching, some involved in sexual allegations, drug use, and other behavior typical of the students. One report speaks of a teacher lighting another child's shoes on fire. Since the open campus status left few records, many events live on in only memory, but the level which the unruliness leapt vastly outdid many and most high schools the same size or style. The proceedings were unprecedented.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Eastern_High_School_4973.html" title="Edit section: 2000s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2000s</span></h2>
<p>Until recently, the school has been able to maintain a level of little to no criminal activity, and has even reached Blue Ribbon Accreditation. But now, new reports are once again tarnishing the school's reputation. Most controversial is the installation of security cameras around the school. They cover every corridor and main entrance way, and thusly the problem is not what isn't being seen. The cameras have prevented nearly no events, nor helped catch a wrongdoer, nor do anything security cameras are expected to do. One incident led to the expulsion of a student, caught entirely on camera, but solved completely without its aid. And the level of bad behavior in the school has not ceased. Also is a corner near the school the students have aptly nicknamed "Smoker's Corner", where underage students smoke right off campus. The school however does not have the authority to stop this because the smoking occurs off of school grounds. This section contains many seemingly unsourced statements. However, as the school refuses to release any numbers for these and other pertinent matters, this information is based off independent unbiased studies and research, and since this is the only official source of contrarian information, it is urgent it is posted.</p>
