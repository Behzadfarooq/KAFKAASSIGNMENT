<p><b>British American Racing</b> was a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_One_17d2.html" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> constructor that competed in the sport from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. BAR began by acquiring <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrrell_Racing_7c4b.html" title="Tyrrell Racing">Tyrrell</a>, and used <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supertec.html" title="Supertec">Supertec</a> engines for their first year. Subsequently they formed a partnership with <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda_Racing_F1_387e.html" title="Honda Racing F1">Honda</a> which lasted for the next six years.</p>
<p>The team was named after the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_American_Tobacco_55ee.html" title="British American Tobacco">British American Tobacco</a> Company (BAT), which owned and sponsored it in order to display its <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Strike_12c8.html" title="Lucky Strike">Lucky Strike</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Express_555_a230.html" title="State Express 555">555</a> brands. In mid-November 2004 <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> purchased 45% of the team, and in September 2005 purchased the remaining 55% share to become the sole owner. Consequently BAR Honda became the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda_Racing_F1_387e.html" title="Honda Racing F1">Honda</a> team for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Formula_One_season_83c9.html" title="2006 Formula One season">2006 Formula One season</a>.

<p>British American Tobacco (BAT) had been involved in Formula One for many years, with several of its brands being displayed on F1 cars run by various teams. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> the corporation was convinced by <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Pollock_fdd1.html" title="Craig Pollock">Craig Pollock</a> to purchase a Formula One team. This team was Tyrrell; BAR and Pollock used £30,000,000 (approximately $47 million U.S.) to acquire the team during the offseason of that year. The team was still officially known as <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrrell_Racing_7c4b.html" title="Tyrrell Racing">Tyrrell</a> in 1998, before it became BAR the following year.</p>

<p>Pollock bacame the team principal and was able to lure World Champion <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Villeneuve_89b4.html" title="Jacques Villeneuve">Jacques Villeneuve</a> away from <a href="../../../w/i/l/WilliamsF1_6543.html" title="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> with a lucrative contract for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_Formula_One_season_191d.html" title="1999 Formula One season">1999 season</a>. Pollock had managed Villeneuve throughout his racing career, so perhaps it was only natural that he signed on. Villeneuve was joined by F1 <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rookie.html" title="Rookie">rookie</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Zonta_91b7.html" title="Ricardo Zonta">Ricardo Zonta</a>. The car's chassis was built with the help of <a href="../../../r/e/y/Reynard_Motorsport_e798.html" title="Reynard Motorsport">Reynard Motorsport</a> and the car was powered by <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supertec.html" title="Supertec">Supertec</a> (rebadged <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_F1_f7b3.html" title="Renault F1">Renault</a>) engines. Pollock bragged about how successful the team would be in its maiden year.</p>
<p>However, BAR failed to score even a single point in the Constructors' Championship. Even perennial minnows <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minardi.html" title="Minardi">Minardi</a> were able to finish above the newcomers. Villeneuve started the year with 11 straight retirements, and failed to finish a race until the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_Belgian_Grand_Prix_61b5.html" title="1999 Belgian Grand Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> that August; Zonta missed three races due to an injury and managed only a best finish of 8th. Adding insult to injury <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mika_Salo_b088.html" title="Mika Salo">Mika Salo</a>, who filled in for Zonta while he was hurt, provided the team with its best finish of 7th.</p>
<p>Even off the track BAR had a terrible year. The team's plan to run its cars with two separate liveries (to enable BAT to advertise two different cigarette brands) was highly controversial, and the <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/d/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile_9d29.html" title="Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile">FIA</a> deemed it to be illegal. To get around this BAR ran "dual livery" cars, with one side of the car painted in the white and red of BAT's <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Strike_12c8.html" title="Lucky Strike">Lucky Strike</a> brand, and the other side of the car painted in blue and yellow to advertise <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Express_555_a230.html" title="State Express 555">555</a>. Critics derided the cars for being ugly and the scheme was a failure. BAR reverted to a more traditional style of livery for <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_Formula_One_season_89b0.html" title="2000 Formula One season">2000</a> onwards.</p>

<p>Despite the disastrous season in 1999, BAR still managed to persuade <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> to supply them with engines in 2000. It was the first time Honda had been directly involved in Formula One since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>. BAR did not have exclusive use of Honda engines, though, as <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_Grand_Prix_cfc4.html" title="Jordan Grand Prix">Jordan Grand Prix</a> were using <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mugen_Honda_7ead.html" title="Mugen Honda">Mugen Honda</a> units. The following year Jordan were given factory Honda engines, but the engine manufacturers could not supply two teams forever. This prompted a battle between BAR and Jordan for the use of Honda engines in the long term.</p>
<p>In 2000 the new Honda-driven BAR did show improvement. It proved to be more reliable and slightly more competitive, but the team still only had a best finish of 4th. While it was a marked advance on its first year, with the team finishing tied for 4th in the points, it was still not the kind of year envisioned by ambitious team owners. Villeneuve reached the podium twice in 2001 for BAR, but neither his nor new teammate <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olivier_Panis_3a01.html" title="Olivier Panis">Olivier Panis</a>'s results were enough, and it led to the sacking of Craig Pollock.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Richards_1d09.html" title="David Richards">David Richards</a> took over as principal of the team but the story line continued for BAR, with Villeneuve still struggling to score points and Panis also failing to reach expectations. However, BAR had won the battle against Jordan, whose performances had become worse. From <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> BAR had exclusive use of the Honda engines, and were able to work more closely with its engine partners.</p>
<p>BAR brought in <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenson_Button_7a86.html" title="Jenson Button">Jenson Button</a> to replace Panis for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Formula_One_season_7146.html" title="2003 Formula One season">2003 Formula One season</a>. Villeneuve's failure to produce winning drives eventually led to him being replaced, before the end of the season, by <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> driver <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takuma_Sato_f218.html" title="Takuma Sato">Takuma Sato</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> has traditionally liked its teams to field Japanese drivers as it leads to publicity in the car manufacturer's home country. Despite Villeneuve's lack of performance, BAR as a whole was on the upswing. Jenson Button led a for the first time (albeit briefly) at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_United_States_Grand_Prix_017b.html" title="2003 United States Grand Prix">2003 United States Grand Prix</a>. The 2003 chassis was considered to be one of the best in the field, but the team struggled due to its use of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgestone.html" title="Bridgestone">Bridgestone</a> tyres. In the off-season they changed to rival company <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelin.html" title="Michelin">Michelin</a>, in the hope of releasing the potential of their car.</p>

<p>Early in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Formula_One_season_870a.html" title="2004 Formula One season">2004</a>, the team saw a further upswing in its fortunes, Button scored many podium finishes. He also took their first <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pole_position.html" title="Pole position">pole position</a>, at <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_San_Marino_Grand_Prix_4ac3.html" title="2004 San Marino Grand Prix">San Marino</a>. The Honda RA004E engine was reputed to produce slightly over 960bhp in <i>Suzuka Special</i> form, and was certainly one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful engine in pitlane. BAR finished the season in 2nd place in the Constructors' Championship, beating every team except for <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuderia_Ferrari_ae22.html" title="Scuderia Ferrari">Ferrari</a>. Despite this, BAR's first win still eluded them.</p>
<p>During the course of the 2004 season a dispute with <a href="../../../w/i/l/WilliamsF1_6543.html" title="WilliamsF1">WilliamsF1</a> threatened to overshadow BAR's on-track performance. Both teams believed they had a valid contract for Jenson Button in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Formula_One_season_1c4f.html" title="2005 Formula One season">2005</a>. However, both the team and Button showed professionalism by putting these matters behind them when they were racing. The issue finally went to the Contract Recognition Board, which found in favour of BAR. Button was to drive for BAR in 2005, but signed a contract to join Williams for 2006.</p>
<p>With increasing restrictions being placed upon tobacco companies' opportunities to advertise in Formula One, rumours suggested that <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_American_Tobacco_55ee.html" title="British American Tobacco">BAT</a> would try to sell the team. In mid-November <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, BAR announced that <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> had purchased 45% and, as part of the deal, David Richards left to be replaced by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Fry_9f89.html" title="Nick Fry">Nick Fry</a> as team principal.</p>

<p>The start of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Formula_One_season_1c4f.html" title="2005 Formula One season">2005 season</a> didn't go according to plan for BAR, as they struggled in the "flyaway" races at the start of the season. Just as they became competitive, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_San_Marino_Grand_Prix_1180.html" title="2005 San Marino Grand Prix">San Marino</a>, BAR Honda was disqualified for running with illegal cars. The allegation was that the cars were able to race with their total weight below 605 kg (1323 lb), the minimum weight required for a Formula 1 car. BAR disputed this, saying that the engine required a minimum of 6 kg of fuel to work, thus keeping them above the minimum weight. Their interpretation of the rules was that this limit applies only during the race, not during the post-race scrutineering. The FIA, and later the court, disagreed. In addition to the disqualification, the team was banned for two races, a period which included the lucrative <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monaco_Grand_Prix_b9fa.html" title="Monaco Grand Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. The team initially indicated that they planned to fight the decision before a regular civil court but later decided to accept the verdict. <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Mosley_9d34.html" title="Max Mosley">Max Mosley</a>, the president of the FIA, saw the sanction as very lenient; they had wanted the team to be banned for the remainder of the season. However, they were unable to prove deliberate intent to cheat. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When BAR returned at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_European_Grand_Prix_d5eb.html" title="2005 European Grand Prix">European Grand Prix</a> the team struggled to find its feet. In stark contrast to the previous season, BAR failed to score a single point until the midway point, at the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_French_Grand_Prix_f719.html" title="2005 French Grand Prix">2005 French Grand Prix</a>. Takuma Sato had a particularly poor season, scoring just one point, and was consequently sacked from the team at the end of the season. Sato was replaced in the new Honda team by former <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scuderia_Ferrari_ae22.html" title="Scuderia Ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubens_Barrichello_bb48.html" title="Rubens Barrichello">Rubens Barrichello</a>. Still, the team showed its grit by steadily developing the car, allowing Button to score in each of the last 10 races of the season, culminating in 2 podium positions. Confirmation of this improvement was shown in a skillful pass made by Jenson Button, overtaking Jacques Villeneuve at the fast Pouhon corner at <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps_db91.html" title="Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps">Spa-Francorchamps</a>, in the rain, and around the outside.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> obtained 100% ownership of BAR from <a href="../../../b/a/t/BAT_7ac0.html" title="BAT">BAT</a>, completing their ambition to become a full F1 manufacturer team. In addition, Jenson Button's Williams contract was bought out for US$30 million, and Button signed a multi-year contract with Honda.</p>

<p>BAR tested a modified BAR-Honda 007 car which they intended to use in an attempt to set the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_speed_record.html" title="Land speed record">land speed record</a> for a car meeting FIA Formula One regulations. The team aimed for 400 km/h (249 mph), and were planning to attempt the record at <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonneville_Salt_Flats_499b.html" title="Bonneville Salt Flats">Bonneville Salt Flats</a>.<sup id="_ref-bonneville_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bonneville" title="">[2]</a></sup> The driver for this project was <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_van_der_Merwe_50d0.html" title="Alan van der Merwe">Alan van der Merwe</a> . The modified chassis performed a shakedown test on the 10,000ft-long runway at <a href="../../../m/o/j/Mojave_Airport_0c5e.html" title="Mojave Airport">Mojave Airport</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, on 5th November 2005, under the supervision of safety co-ordinator executive, Jamie Hardwick. The four published times recorded in this test were 393, 405, 410 and 413 km/h. However, these tests did not constitute the record attempt itself and waterlogging of the salt flats resulted in the attempt being postponed. The chassis was used by BAR's successor, Honda, to set a new record the following year.</p>
