	    <p>A higher incidence of weapon-carrying, and guns in particular, among youths has been identified as a key factor in the recent increase in youth violence. Weapon-carrying increases risk of death and serious injury to both the carrier and others. In recent years a number of studies have investigated the accessibility of weapons and the extent to which youth carry them.</p>
<p>According to the 1990 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 1 in 20 senior high school students carried a firearm, usually a handgun, and 1 in 5 carried a weapon of some type during the 30 days preceding the survey (Centers for Disease Control, 1991). A survey of 10 inner-city high schools in four states found that 35% of male and 11% of female students reported carrying a gun (Sheley, McGee, &amp; Wright, 1992). A study of rural school students in southeast Texas found that 6% of male students had taken guns to school, and almost 2% reported that they did so almost every day. In addition, 42.3% of those surveyed said they could get a gun if they wanted one (Kissell, 1993). More than one-third (34%) of urban high school students in Seattle reported having easy access to handguns, while 11.4% of males and 1.5% of females reported owning a handgun. One-third of those who owned handguns reported that they had fired at someone. Further, almost 10% of female students reported a firearm homicide or suicide among family members or close friends (Callahan &amp; Rivara, 1992). Another study from the southeast U.S. found that 9% of urban and suburban youth owned a handgun (Larson, 1994).</p>
<p>A poll of students in grades six through twelve conducted by Louis Harris for the Harvard School of Public Health in 1993 found that 59% said they could get a handgun if they wanted one, and 21% said they could get one within the hour. More than 60% of urban youth reported that they could get a handgun, and 58% of suburban youth also claimed that they could (Larson, 1994). Fifteen percent of students reported carrying a handgun in the past month, 11% said that they had been shot at, 9% said that they had fired a gun at someone, and 4% said they had carried a gun to school in the past year (Drevitch, 1994; Hull, 1993).</p>
<p>In a study of two public inner-city junior high schools in Washington, D.C., 47% of males reported having ever carried knives, and 25% reported having ever carried guns for protection or to use in case they got into a fight; 37% of females reported having carried a knife for these purposes. Both schools are located in high-crime areas (Webster, Gainer, &amp; Champion, 1993).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Why do young people carry weapons?</b></p>
<p>A common reason given by young people for carrying weapons is for protection against being "jumped" (Price, Desmond, &amp; Smith, 1991). However, research has shown that weapon-carrying among youth appears to be more closely associated with criminal activity, delinquency, and aggressiveness than to purely defensive behavior (Sheley, McGee, &amp; Wright, 1992; Webster, Gainer, &amp; Champion, 1993). Handgun ownership by inner-city high school youth has been associated with gang membership, selling drugs, interpersonal violence, being convicted of crimes, and either suspension or expulsion from school (Callahan &amp; Rivara, 1992). Gun-carrying among junior high students is also strongly linked with indicators of serious delinquency, such as having been arrested (Webster, Gainer, &amp; Champion, 1993). These studies have the following implications for the prevention of gun-carrying among youth (Webster, Gainer, &amp; Champion, 1993):</p>
<p>If gun carrying stems largely from antisocial attitudes and behaviors rather than from purely defensive motives of otherwise nonviolent youths, interventions designed to prevent delinquency may be more effective than those that focus only on educating youths about the risks associated with carrying a gun. The latter may, however, be able to deter less hardened youths from carrying weapons in the future. Intensive and comprehensive interventions directed at high-risk children could possibly "inoculate" children against the many social factors that foster criminal deviance and the most violent behavior patterns.</p>
<p><br />
<b>How are firearms obtained?</b> Adult criminals and youth involved in illegal activities have reported that guns are not difficult to obtain. Illegal or unregulated transactions are the primary sources of guns used in violent acts; stealing, borrowing from friends or acquaintances, and illegal purchasing of guns are the most common. Less than 1 in 5 guns used for illegal activities were purchased from licensed dealers. The most commonly cited reason for acquiring a gun is "self-defense" (Roth, 1994).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Firearms and violence</b></p>
<p>Every day in the United States there are 733 shootings (Cotton, 1992). It is estimated that 66.7 million handguns and 200 million firearms of all kinds are in circulation (Larson, 1994). About one-half of all households own at least one firearm and one-quarter own a handgun (Reiss &amp; Roth, 1993). Experts assert that greater availability of guns increases the rates of murder and felony gun use. However, the greater availability of guns does not appear to affect levels of violence in general (Roth, 1994).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Firearm-Related Deaths</b> Gun-related homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings account for approximately 38,000 deaths a year in the United States (Buchsbaum, 1994); approximately 60% of all homicide victims in the United States are killed with firearms. Handguns account for 80% of homicides committed with firearms, although they comprise only about one-third of all firearms owned (Roth, 1994). For the first time in many decades, the number of firearm-related deaths surpassed that of motor vehicle-related deaths in seven states (California, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Texas, and Virginia) and the District of Columbia (Centers for Disease Control, 1994). If recent trends continue, firearms will displace motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury death nationally within a few years (Fingerhut, Jones, &amp; Makuc, 1994). Firearm injuries primarily affect young people, resulting in greater loss of potential life years than cancer and heart disease combined.</p>
<p>Larson (1994) noted:</p>
<p><br />
Over the last two years firearms killed almost 70,000 Americans, more than the total of U.S. soldiers killed in the entire Vietnam War. Every year handguns alone account for 22,000 deaths. In Los Angeles County, 8,050 people were killed or wounded in 1991, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times--thirteen times the number of U.S. forces killed in the Persian Gulf War. Every day, the handguns of America kill sixty-four people: twenty-five of the dead are victims of homicide; most of the rest shoot themselves. Handguns are used to terrorize countless others; over the next twenty-four hours, handgun-wielding assailants will rape 33 women, rob 575 people, and assault another 1,116.</p>
<p><br />
Firearms and Health Care Costs Each year, firearm attacks injure 70,000 victims in the United States, some of whom are left permanently disabled. The cost of firearm shootings, through violent attacks, accidents, or intentional self-infliction, is estimated at $19 billion nationwide for medical care, long-term disability, and premature death (New York Academy of Medicine, 1994). The average cost per firearm fatality is $373,000, and 40% of spinal injuries in inner-city areas are the result of gunshot injuries (Cotton, 1992). A study of one urban area hospital revealed that 86% of the costs of firearm injuries are paid by taxes (Cotton, 1992).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Firearm violence and youth</b></p>
<p>Among teenagers 15-19 years of age and young adults 20-24 years of age, 1 of every 4 deaths is by a firearm. One of every 8 deaths in children 10- 14 is by a firearm. For those 15-19 there are substantial variations by race and sex in the percentage of deaths due to firearms. Among African-American teenage males, 60% of deaths result from firearm injury compared with 23% of white teenage males. Among African-American teenage females it is 22% compared with 10% of white female teenagers (Fingerhut, 1993). The number of African-American males aged 15-19 who died from gunshot wounds in 1990 was nearly five times higher than the number who died from AIDS, sickle-cell disease, and all other natural causes combined (Fingerhut, 1993; Kellerman, 1994).</p>
<p>In 1990, 82% of all homicide victims aged 15-19 (91% and 77% African-American and white males, respectively) and 76% of victims aged 20-24 (87% and 71% among African-American and white males, respectively) were killed with guns. Firearm homicide for African-American males 15-19 years of age was 11 times the rate among white males, 105.3 compared with 9.7 per 100,000 population. The rate for African-American females was five times the rate for white females, 10.4 compared with 2.0 per 100,000 population (Fingerhut, 1993).</p>
<p>In 1990, 67.3% of all suicides among teenagers aged 15-19 were the result of firearms. Since 1985 the overall rate of suicide for teenagers by firearms increased from 6.0 to 7.5 per 100,000. The group of teenagers with the largest percent increase was African-American males; however, white male teenagers (13.5 per 100,000) had a higher firearm suicide rate in 1990 compared with African-American males (8.8 per 100,000). During this same time period, the rate of suicide not involving firearms decreased for both African-American and white males and females (Fingerhut, 1993).</p>
<p><br />
<b>Controlling the carrying of weapons in schools</b></p>
<p>Schools are grappling with the problem of protecting children and school staff from the violence surrounding them. Episodes of violence, particularly gun violence, are increasing in schools (Nordland, 1992) and violent attacks involving even elementary school children appear to be on the increase. Thus, gun violence has become a major concern for schools across the nation--a concern that is no longer limited to large cities, but extends to smaller cities and rural areas (Morganthau, 1992).</p>
<p>School security and law enforcement officials estimate that four of every five firearms that are carried into schools come from the students' homes; they bring one of their parents' firearms for "show and tell" with friends. Law enforcement officials also note that firearms are easily accessible by other means. They are readily borrowed from friends, bought by proxy, stolen, or even rented. On the street, guns can be purchased for as little as $25.</p>
<p>The following position paper of the National Association of Secondary School Principals Board on Weapons in Schools outlines the need to control weapons and offers several ways in which educators can work toward that end (Kressly, 1994):</p>
<p><br />
Whereas, students have a right to attend school without a fear of weapons' violence to themselves or others;</p>
<p><br />
Whereas, safe schools enhance the learning environment, necessary to quality schools, which are essential to a successful democracy;</p>
<p><br />
Whereas, the causes of violence are multiple: chronic poverty, the lack of jobs and role models, the disintegration of families, the loss of moral values, and a popular culture that seems to glorify violence at every turn;</p>
<p><br />
Whereas, a major 1993 Louis Harris poll about guns among American youth reports that 1 in 25 students takes a handgun to school in a single month, and 59% know where to get a handgun if they need one;</p>
<p><br />
Whereas, violence is exacerbated with the increase of weapons in our schools, resulting in some 31 deaths from guns during the 1992-93 school year; be it therefore known that the National Association of Secondary School Principals:</p>
<p><br />
supports passage of the Brady Bill, which requires a waiting period and background check before legal purchase of a handgun; urges full enforcement of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990; calls on Congress to pass the Safe Schools Act of 1993, with an amendment that will ban the purchase of a handgun and semi-automatic guns for any person under the age of 21; urges schools to provide staff training for weapons situations arising in school, and to implement student awareness programs which challenge youths' falsely held beliefs that they are invincible; challenges schools to implement apprehension, prevention, intervention, and counseling programs to combat possession of weapons and violent acts; encourages school-based parent involvement programs to include violence prevention strategies that emphasize the issue of easy access to handguns; exhorts school districts to establish violence prevention curriculum, grades K-12, and promote articulation among levels to ensure continuity in policies and practices; challenges Schools of Education to add conflict resolution and violence coping skills to their teacher preparation programs.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Weapon-security measures</b></p>
<p>When weapons are carried into schools, especially guns, the potential for a violent episode is heightened and, in recent years, there have been far too many violent episodes involving weapons on school campuses that have led to tragedy (Morganthau, 1992). Preventing violence calls for school policies that provide for school environments that are free from violence for students, staff, and others on school premises (Friedlander, 1993). For some school systems this may mean providing such controls as locker searches, weapons searches, hiring police to patrol school premises, allowing students to wear only see-through backpacks, and possibly providing metal detectors upon entry. Some school systems have even created separate alternative schools for young people with a history of violent and abusive behavior. While this option is attracting attention, it is also controversial (Harrington-Lueker, 1992).</p>
<p>A study by the American School Board revealed that 50% of school districts conduct locker searches, 36% conduct search and seizure activities, 36% maintain security personnel in schools, 31% have gun-free school zones, and 15% have metal detectors (Natale, 1994). Approximately one-fourth of large urban school districts in the United States use metal detectors to help reduce weapon-carrying in schools (Centers for Disease Control, 1993). According to the Centers for Disease Control, these detectors may help reduce, but do not eliminate, weapon-carrying in schools and to and from schools. Students who attended schools with metal detector programs were as likely as those attending schools without metal detectors to carry weapons elsewhere, but were less likely to have carried a weapon inside the school building (7.8% versus 13.6%) or going to and from school (7.7% versus 15.2%). Decreases in school-related weapon-carrying were due to decreases in the carrying of both knives and handguns. The presence of metal detectors had no apparent effect on the prevalence of threats and physical fights inside the school, to and from school, or anywhere else (Centers for Disease Control, 1993).</p>
<p>Security measures and equipment are expensive; walk-through metal detectors can cost up to $10,000 each and X-ray equipment designed to detect weapons in book bags can cost as much as $17,000. Hiring security personnel is also expensive. Despite these measures, students are known to have successfully carried weapons into schools, usually by sneaking them through windows or unguarded entrances, much to the frustration of many school administrators. Some school districts are reluctant to implement new security measures, particularly metal detectors, because they fear it may open them up to lawsuits (Glazer, 1992).</p>
<p><br />
<b>The need for cooperative action</b></p>
<p>It is obvious that schools alone cannot be totally effective in controlling availability of weapons. Controlling access will require the cooperation of many individuals and institutions. The New York Academy of Medicine (1994) has proposed the following:</p>
<p><br />
Implementing a national licensure system for firearm possession; Limiting the manufacture, sale, and distribution of military-style assault weapons; Increasing the tax on firearms and ammunition; Tightening federal licensing requirements for gun dealers; Limiting the number of guns an individual can buy; Implementing a gun return program; Implementing a firearm fatality and injury reporting system; and Educating the public to the dangers of guns and the need for national regulation.</p>
