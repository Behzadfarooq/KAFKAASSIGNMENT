<dd>What's the correct style for alluding to the fact that her cheese is finally slipping off her cracker? Her recent actions have been... disturbing. Darkmind1970 15:21, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>'Britney has recently been slammed by critics and fans alike for her erratic behavior. Celebrity journalists on Sky News were in a split argument about whether she is trying to gain publicity while her career is inactive or she was stressed by her divorce with dancer and wannabe-rapper K-Fed, a.k.a Kevin Federline. Most agreed that Britney is officially over-for now. 'Chances of her going back to the bubblegum,innocent girl in a school uniform. Um, zero.' quoted a fan. That' just my take on it. Of course, it isn't the most serious ever, but hey.The photo of Britters bald has scarred me for life, seriously. 212.139.222.62

<p>Please don't assume that it is in "an effort to preserve" my "personal view." My view on Britney Spears is very neautral. If I keep reverting your edits it is because I find all that <b>extra</b> information unnecessary. We really don't need</p>

<li>The name of the hair salon and the owner, by the way the hair is no longer on ebay but on an independant site which I added a reliable (in a better format might I add) source for.</li>
<li>Details on what tattoos, where she got them, and that it started a whole trend is incredibly unnecessary</li>
<li>Her pounding of an SUV with an umbrella</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe you need to read this part a bit more carefully:</p>
<p>"If an allegation or incident is <b>notable, relevant, and well-documented</b> by reliable published sources"</p>

<dd>On reliability -Please look again, the reference is the New York Daily News which is a six time pulitizer winning newspaper and so there is no question that they are a reliable source on this information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On auctions - The first editor to note that the saloon had set up there own site to sell the hair was me and you deleted that information. You keep reverting back in the dated information about the Red Bull and bic lighters, but that stuff has been yanked by the people at Ebay so its not actually there. There are still people selling hair on ebay cliaming it was hers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On details - Most of the major media is mentioning exactly what tatoos she got, and where she got her hair cut and her tatoos at, so there is little question if that is worthy of inclusion in the article. All the details you keep deleting have been found worthy of inclusion in stories by many professional editors so it makes no sense for you to continually delete them.</dd>

<p>It doesn't matter if the New York Daily news solved world hunger, they got their source from OK! Magazine which to me is very questionable. Still if that is to be included, the only ref for that would be OK! Magazine since they originally posted that story about Federline threatining to drug test her hair</p>
<p>This is what the sentence states "The hair has been put on sale by the owner of the salon, along with a half-drunk can of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_c089.html" title="Red Bull">Red Bull</a>, a <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bic.html" title="Bic">Bic</a> lighter and the clippers that were used to shave her head" No where does it say that all that was put or taken off from eBay. Who cares that it was on eBay, if anything about that matters now is that it was all put on an independant site. I'm sure over the years hundreds of Britney's personal belongings such as a chewed piece of gum have been put on sale on eBay but should we include every single one of those?</p>
<p>We are not a major media outlet, this is also not a tabloid journal it is an encyclopedia. Details on her tattoos are completley irrelevant and unnecessary to this whole story. By the way, who are these professional editors you speak of? And when did they find those details "worthy of inclusion"? To me it is still not justified why the inclusion of all these girls visiting that parlor and requesting Britney's tattoos is important. It looks more like a personal advertisement for that parlor. What makes no sense is for an encyopledic article to state that "she got a pair of pink lips."</p>
<p>Citing the pictures in x17 as a source for her attack on that SUV is not reliable even if hundreds of media outlets have picked them up, what's reliable would be an article or news report stating why they are so important. Every ref still states that even they "believe" or speculate that Britney was not allowed to see her children and as a result beat up that SUV, and as a result of that ended up back in rehab. The incidents from that night are still uncomfirmed, the only thing we know is that Federline requested an emergency hearing that for some reason or another was cancelled the next day, and that day Spears re-entered rehab.</p>
<p>If you keep adding so much detail that section will be as big as the entire article by the end of 2007.</p>

<p>Wikipedia's concern is using reliable sources, the <i>New York Daily News</i> fits into the criteria that Wikipedia has supplied on such sources. These sources have professional editors who look out for the papers intrest so they don't get sued for liable. Wikipedia is not privy to how they gather or test there information. One of our main concerns in demanding reliable sources is to sheild us against liable charges. As sources like the <i>New York Daily News</i> have cited this information us citing them removes any legal stigma on Wikipedia. The fact that the national media is running the magazine's statements is obviously noteworthy in Spear's life, so it merits inclusion. If you think otherwise feel free to contact the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_Noticeboard_e3c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard</a> which enforces all the standards on articles about living persons.</p>
<p>I fail to understand why you think describing what tatoos she got is unwarranted. This information is all in one sentence. An encyopledic article can state that "she got a pair of pink lips" if that's what happened and that is what actually happened. The inclusion of the information about the frenzy of people getting the same tatoos as her matches the frenzy over buying her hair. This type of information shows how much sway she has in the culture even if she is in a distressed state. One such editorial staff that included the information on her tatoos is the <i>Fox News</i> article that sympathetically said rehab false starts are not uncommon (the ref is cited in the article and is at <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,253419,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,253419,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,253419,00.html</a> ).

<p>I am not citing the X17 photos as a source, I am saying that's where the copy-righted photos are if a reader wants to see them. The source of the timeline of the information is in several places in that segment including right after the sentence with the link to those photos - its the New York Daily News. If you like, I could also put in all the references I included in my last comment on this thread that speak of the same event.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the citation about the bic and Red Bull, I see that your source <i>Access Hollywood</i> is saying that the shop is selling this. I hadn't seen that information in any of the pulitizer prize winning papers that your questioning me for using but I have no reason to doubt it. I'll go ahead and fix the paragraph as per your comments.</p>
<p>Questions of length are not a problem for Wikipedia see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a>. If notable events continue to occur and the page goes over 60kb then segments are moved to their own subpage and linked to from here, the main-page.</p>

<p>According to the history page, a separate editor reported that he was having problems with the link to the X17 site, so he dropped it. That's fine with me then, if people can't get there then the inclusion of the link is pointless and its rightfully deleted.--<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 23:45, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you are just having a case of recent-scandalities. You fail to see the bigger picture which is many more events will happen in the girls life this year alone and if we document everything with such serious detail as you do we will have an enormous article. Summary of style recommends that articles should be kept at around 30 kbs, this article is well into 70kbs. Not that there is anything wrong with that but if we hope to get the article to FA status they might see this as a problem. Someone suggested that an article noting all of Britney's controversies should be started, I think you've shown you are passionate enough to start it up. I'm sure in there you could include as many details and sources as you want.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> reads the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers should be handled with caution, and, if <b>derogatory</b>, should not be used at all. Not all widely read newspapers and magazines are equally reliable. There are some magazines and newspapers that print gossip much of which is false. While such information may be titillating, that does not mean it has a place here. Before repeating such gossip, <b>ask yourself if the information is presented as being true, if the source is reliable, and if the information, even if true, is relevant to an encyclopaedic article on that subject.</b> When these magazines print information they suspect is untrue, they often include weasel phrases. Look out for these. If the magazine doesn't think the story is true, then why should we?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On regards to her shaving her head after Federline's threat, and the confrontation at his home Is Ok! Magazine reliable at all? Even if other media outlets reported it, no one that was with Federline or Britney has made a statement about what happened. Anything else is speculation and un-reliable.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm questioning the title of the article "Brit freaks again as train wreck rolls on." I think this shows that the publication has some sort of agenda towards Spears.</p>

<p>I didn't cite <i>OK! Magazine</i> I cited national media who risk there companies reputation and finances if they reprint libel - its not notable that the magazine is making this claim its notable that the national media has reviewed the claim and is repeating it. These are not "partisan websites" or "obscure newspapers".</p>
<p>I don't understand why you think the phrase "multiple tattoos" is preferable to the description of the two tattoos. With your phrase it leaves it open to how many and where they are. With "multiple tattoos" she could have had five, six, ten, who knows. With "multiple tattoos" she could have had one on her head like Sinead O'Conner, a whole back panel, a bunch up and down her arms and legs, ones on her chest and groin, etc.</p>
<p>The information about the umbrella and the car is notable because it could be cited in court and she could lose any custody of her kids which would permanently significant. Tattoos are also permanent so it would seem one sentence describing them is not outrageous.</p>
<p>Many of the headlines chosen do seem to be geared towards selling newspapers, but it is the content of the stories that matters. Do you detect some bias in the main body of the story?</p>
<p>If this segment gets too big it could move to its own sub-page, but it is just as likely that she could stay in rehab, fix her difficulties and the segment could be closed by an additional sentence or two.</p>

<dd>To some people, she is as important as the President... Frankly, this article has bloated itself back to "B" status (or just a very large "start"). There is tremendous over-emphasis on her daily trivial actions and too much breathless coverage of her 2007 rehab stints. One should just be bold and ruthlessly trim the article of all un-encycopedic information.

Please exercise some judgment of the stuff you put in the page. In the long run (in an encyclopedia), does it matter that she was seen driving around with her kid on the lap one day? Or that some bozo is selling her hair clippings? It may be well sourced on a Reuters entertainment page but in the end its just well sourced tabloid cruft that has no place in Wikipedia.

<p>First of all, of course it is trivial. The stuff about her current public image can be summed up in about one paragraph. Maybe something like: In early 2007, Spears filed to divorce Federline, checked into rehab at least three times, shaved her head and was videotaped smashing a van with an umbrella.</p>
<p>This article goes into such depth it is embarressing. Just look at this paragraph:</p>
<p>"Spears announced her pregnancy via her official website in April 2005. That month she was rushed to a hospital in Destin, Florida, where she spent forty-eight hours under a doctor's surveillance.[30] On September 14, 2005, 6 lb. 11oz. baby boy Sean Preston Federline was born in the Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, by a scheduled caesarean section. Two days later, Spears and her son were released from the hospital.[31]"</p>
<p>Wouldn't it just be better to say: On September 14, 2005, Spears gave birth to her frist child in Santa Monica, California by caesarean section. ... It no longer matters that she was released two days later -- that's standard for women who undergo c-sections -- and it's also irrelevant that she was put under surveillance before giving birth, which is also common. Just my opinion. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowTapedR_013f.html" title="User:YellowTapedR">YellowTapedR</a> 17:08, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Spears <i>is</i> a tabloid personality, and so I think that events reported widely in tabloids about her are important. Moreover, to claim that events that are widely reported in tabloids are somehow "trash" or "unencyclopedic" is a totally biased and POV judgment. Why are you more qualified to decide what has value than readers of tabloids? May I remind the editors that Spears has not released any new music in several years and is more famous than ever not because if her "work" but because of the tabloid headlines she continues to garner. Tabloid-reported events are thus absolutely legitimate for inclusion.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 16:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Eqdoktor, you are 100% WRONG. It is written in non-POV and everything that has been reported in the media. Not rumors. We have spent countless time to ensure that the section contains fact, and not rumored material, such as tabloid. This is what the public has seen, it is what has been reported and shown. If you are picking up that Spears seems stupid, sluttish, and drug addled, then perhaps that's what you've picked up from her behavior. That's your POV. This is all true, period.

<dd>I have no problem admitting that I am a fan of Spears, but even I'll admit that she is known just as much for personal scandalous antics than she is for her career. Unfortunetley over the past few years she hasn't had the best of luck. Her baby incidents along with her public flashing are things I would consider to be relevant as it was much covered in the major media. People will probably refer to these incidents for years to come. Even though they don't put her in the best of light, they should be documented. It is no way to put her in a negative light. - <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 17:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problems whatsoever with unflattering entries especially with unimpeachable citations. What I find troubling is the indiscriminate additions of the her daily reported activities without any <i>relevance</i> (Britney cries after stalkerazis chase her? How is that important enough to be in an encyclopedia article?). Another troubling thing I see is the usage of clearly labelled "GOSSIP" editorials (completely biased POV meant to titilate) as cite sources - <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">bad sources</a>. For example the Paris Hilton/flashing item (you may need to check the history revisions - the source cited for that item WAS A GOSSIP PAGE (albeit on a news channel - BUT CLEARLY LABELED GOSSIP). As for the kid on the car lap/kid fall of chair article - it may be well documented but it gives undue weight on isolated incidents. The authorites and child welfare found nothing to follow up on and listing it here implies an <i>unbalanced emphasis</i> on innocent mistakes due to her celebrity status. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 18:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The public image section is gone. I'm telling you though, what you are going to find is massive amounts of rubbish. This was the reason for the section. Tons of celebrities have criticism sections. The pictures of her driving down the highway with her child on her lap, which is against the law, will be forever tattooed in the public's mind, as well as the numerous pictures of her flashing her vagina, and her also commenting on the incident herself. You don't seem to understand the tarnishing of a person's image. It's just like Michael Jackson. Now when people are looking for information as to what led up to her stint in rehab, they'll have absolutely no idea what happened. Don't come crying to me on the edit wars, name-calling, and the page getting locked and/or spammed again. As I stated, we made that section for a reason, but since you are so insistent on creating a fan page, you will now have to see the consequences. Downdown723 18:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why was all of that removed anyway? Things like the umbrella, the suicide attempts, and other events seems reasonable, to me, to put it. After all, they are solid facts that are relevant to the situation. A suicide attempt is a personal struggle. If anything, removing such facts seems like fans not wanting negative events posted, which is a bias POV. All of those are relevant, and encyclopedic. Why shouldn't they be put? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Kat_2996.html" title="User:Black Kat">Black Kat</a> 1:57, 5 March, 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is the previous information overload paragraph which even I was willing to accept, but as a previous editor pointed out, and I agree with him/her, it just to much trivial, unnecessary and un-encylopedic material.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 26, 2007, she lost her aunt, Sandra Bridges Covington, to ovarian cancer.[47] On February 16, after weeks of publicity surrounding her late night partying[48] and alcohol use, Spears entered an off-shore drug rehabilitation facility. She stayed, however, for less than twenty-four hours.[49] The following night, Spears went to a haircutting studio in Tarzana, California. The salon was already closed but opened up at Spears's request and she subsequently shaved [50]her own hair off with clippers. The hair has been put on sale by the owner of the salon, along with a half-drunk can of Red Bull, a Bic lighter and the clippers that were used to shave her head.[51] After leaving the salon, she visited a tattoo parlor and got two tattoos. Commenting on the incident, Spears told a tattoo parlor employee, "I don't want anyone touching me. I'm tired of everybody touching me."[52][53] OK! Magazine originally reported that the incident came after Spears and her ex-husband had a confrontation. “They had a huge argument. Kevin threatened Britney that he was going to have people test her hair to find out exactly what she’s been up to. She was so scared. That was what made her have her head shaved.” This is unconfirmed by both parties.[54] On February 20, 2007, Britney re-admitted herself to a California treatment facility. A statement by her manager read, "We ask that the media respect her privacy as well as those of her family and friends at this time."[55] Spears again checked out of the facility less than twenty-four hours later. On February 21, 2007, Federline ordered an emergency hearing regarding the custody of his children with Spears. That same night, after travelling to Federline’s apartment, Spears "lashed out at an empty car, beating the doors and windows with a furled umbrella", all of which was caught on film by a photographer. [56] Spears returned to the rehab facility in Malibu this same night.[57] On February 22, 2007, Federline's lawyer called the bailiff of Los Angeles Superior Court and told them that his client asked to cancel the court appearance on custody. No further explanation was given.[58] On February 27 TMZ has learned Britney Spears' troubles may have little to do with substance abuse. Sources say doctors at her rehab facility think the underlying reason for her trouble may be post-partum depression. Sources tell TMZ that Britney's doctors have two operating theories -- either that she suffers from post-partum depression or bipolar disorder.

<li>Why are the tattoos important? Sure they occured during the incident, but is there a way to prove that they are directly connected to what happened?</li>
<li>The hair being put on sale on ebay and then it's own site, what relevance does this have to Britney's situation? Yes it is her hair, but so far being put on sale hasn't impacted her life in any notable way.</li>
<li>The whole Ok! Magazine thing is still unproven and seems more like a fabrication from some bogus source the tabloid picked up. From the whole drug testing to an argument between Spears and Federline, like I said before, I don't care if the New York Times reports it, as long as they are citing Ok! Magazine as do the majority of references you posted, it isn't very credible.</li>
<li>Same thing for the suicide/anti-christ thing, in fact, Britney's biggest stalkers (&lt;---- now that is POV) had the following to say...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over the weekend, some news outlets started picking up on rumors of Britney Spears attempting suicide at the Promises rehab facility in Malibu. The rumors are believed to have taken root after an ambulance showed up at the facility last week on Wednesday (above pix). X17 did not report on the paramedics' visit because we didn't want to create questions or concerns where none were warranted. If you read most articles on the supposed attempted suicide, most are written with unnamed sources and with direct quotes attributed to no one. We saw Britney later in the evening on the 28th, the same day we saw the ambulance, attending her first AA meeting outside of rehab. She was looking good and healthy -- far from what you'd expect someone who'd just attempted suicide to look like! She was out again the next evening for a Thursday night AA meeting, where X17 caught up with Brit exclusively. She gave us a sweet wave and a smile -- she looked great! So all-in-all, I'm not so sure I believe this story ..."</p>

<p>Although not as dramatic, this is how the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> article handled her massively-tabloidecized break down, melt down whatever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After receiving Billboard's "Artist of the Decade" Award and the World Music Award for "Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium",[2] Carey parted from Columbia and signed a contract with EMI's Virgin Records worth a reported US$80 million. She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She had left messages on her website complaining of being overworked,[38] and her relationship with Luis Miguel was ending. In an interview the following year, she said, "I was with people who didn't really know me, and I had no personal assistant. I'd be doing interviews all day long, getting two hours of sleep a night, if that."[39] During an appearance on MTV's Total Request Live, Carey handed out popsicles to the audience and began what was later described as a "strip tease",[40] removing a large, baggy t-shirt to reveal a halter top and Daisy Dukes. By the month's end, she had checked into a hospital, and her publicist announced that she would be taking a break from public appearances.[41]</p>

<p>That would be a better way of where to take the section. I would agree right now it is short and doesn't provide enough information, but in no way POV. If you are going to play that "fan's don't want her lookin' bad" game, then I could easily say you're trying to implement your negative POV by adding all this trivial information and distracting from the important info. - <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 02:24, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

As the inclusions I have sought to make are taken from national and international media sources and deemed important enough for publication in their media, it seems odd that you claim that there is some conspiracy a foot to make Spears look bad. The full length of additions that I attempted to make are at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles</a> I invite any interested reader to please take a look there to determine if any of that information merits inclusion. In an attempt to form consensus I did not argue for inclusion of ever fact presented there but this massive redaction that exists now is just ridiculous.</p>

It can be "well sourced" (see my thoughts below) but if it is of ZERO relevance to an encyclopedic article on subject matter - it can and should be removed. The loss of GA status of this article is directly attributable to the indiscriminate inclusion of irrelevant tabloid "news" into an encyclopedic article. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 08:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the previously deleted section of the 2007 incident - you had people linking TMZ items citing doctors that describe Spears condition as "post partum depression". What tabloid trash - unless you are specifically interviewing Spear's actual doctor, what these "experts" are indulging is <b>100% pure speculation</b> disguised as "expertise". It doesn't take a medical degree to dispense simplistic pop answers. Tabloid voyeurism. BTW, the link used in the above example is just a general www.tmz.com , nothing more specific - it badly sourced to start with. A lot of claims of "well sourced" when looked into - indicates otherwise. Just biased "hand waving" in a lot of cases - the links do not reflect whats written up in the article.</dd>

<dd>While we are at it, having an online pointer linking to a "news" website parroting tabloid material is NOT considered well-sourced. Gossip sections (relaxed journalistic standards of verification) and entertainment blogs (no verification needed) are NOT a good reference sources for encyclopedias. Even if you DO have a source like AP and Reuters (bah - as "entertainment news", god help the global media) reporting Spears hitting a car with an umbrella or not wearing underwear, some restraint is needed in putting that sort of stuff in the Wikipedia. Please remember the first 2 principles in <a href="../../../5/_/_/WP%7E5_d6bd.html" title="WP:5">the 5 pillars of Wikipedia</a> - Its an encyclopedia (<i>not a diary or a celebrity newspaper</i>) and its got to be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>. Some of these "sources" used as ref links are actually thinly disguised attack pages of celebrities disguised as "news" (I can post an example or 2 if required). One has to be terribly naive to think everything found online labeled as "news" (worst still is when we use websites clearly labeled as GOSSIP) is suitable as sources for Wikipedia.

Your critique of TMZ doesn’t make sense in this thread as the only place were that is used as a source is in a different segment about her divorce or driving with her child or her lap. Your critique of someone else citing post-partum depression is bizarre as I never included that information which you would know if you bothered to click on the link that I provided above and repeat here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles</a></p>
<p>If you want to attack someone else’s use of TMZ as a source please do so in a different thread as no one in this thread has advocated that. Again, please review the link at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Britney_Spears&amp;oldid=110698341#2007:_Personal_struggles</a> for the information that I am actually calling for reconsideration for inclusion.</p>
<p>Your link to the Wikipedia standard “Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought” which you characterize as saying “Wikipedia is NOT a celebrity newspaper or scandal-sheet or soapbox” actually talks against using Primary (original) research, Original inventions, Personal essays, and Discussion forums – none of which am I advocating. The Wikipedia definition of Soapbox is Propaganda or advocacy of any kind, Self-promotion, or Advertising. The inclusion of the information is not designed to motivate any action at all but merely to inform, so it fails to violate the prohibition against soapboxes.

It is not the place of Wikipedia to serve up simplistic pop explanations and to satisfy "the public's" salacious curiosity about Spear's problems.

<p>All of this behavior centers around custody of her children. This behavior will be presented before a judge in California state court. The only reason that this hasn't already happened is because Federline requested his lawyers not pursue this as long as she stays in rehab (a fact that has been deleted off the page). This information is factual, well documented, and seen by the majority of people as erratic. Had Spears not engaged in this behavior its hard to imagine the court taking her kids from their mother who has a superior income. The <i>OK! Magazine</i> article says that she cut her hair because Federline was going to have the custody court call for a drug test. The umbrella incident happened as a direct result of her frustration to visit her children at Federline's and her being prevented from doing so. The longterm notability of these events concern whether she will have any custody rights over the children she gave birth to.<a href="../../../w/o/w/User%7EWowaconia_eb5e.html" title="User:Wowaconia">Wowaconia</a> 12:45, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please review the references cited, all of this is presented with mentions of custody and/or the children, legal proceedings have been mentioned numerous times in these articles. Custody decisions are a normal part of divorce proceedings.</li>
<li>The facts are simply that this stuff happened and is being reported in national and international media. I know User:Myrockstar that you have done a great deal of work on this article and any cursory glance at the history page makes that more than clear, but this page belongs to Wikipedia. Every time that I've tried to add information you've reverted it out because you decided that it was "unnecessary info". To me this seems like an arbitrary personal decision on your part so that's why I tagged the segment as POV and began this discussion. User:Xaxafrad has already called for the Wikipedia Noticeboard to weigh in on the situation and I am perfectly content to get their imput. Please note that the article still stands with the lack of details and I am not engaged in an edit war with you. Please remain civil this is a discussion about the POV tag, I haven't inserted the information back in that you find objectionable I am calling for discussion towards consensus.</li>

<dd>I have reviewed your references and as I have stated multiple times, it doesn't matter in what context they occured, the fact remains that to this day there is yet to be any court case that is notable enough to be mentioned other than Federeline's request for a custody hearing which was cancelled without any <b>offical</b> explanation. You have yet to prove how if at all tattoos and the umbrella attack had anything to do with it. Any arguments, threats or ultimatums are still uncomfirmed and unproven. I don't think I've excercised my "fandom" on any part of the article including that section because to this day the only facts we know is that she shaved her head and she's in rehab, as more things come out that are factual I'll be perfectly content to have them included as bad as they are but for now anything else could compromise the article as a whole. You seem to be doing all this because of your frustration towards not getting it done your way. I've given my side and I stand firm that you're edit just contained to many details and unnecassary information. Just what exactly will it take for you to remove that POV tag?

<p>If I was, as you claim, frustrated towards not getting it done my way, I'd be in an edit war not a discussion. I am not asking for everything I wrote to be included, but the meager data in the segment as it stands now is uninformative. I'm not reverting in my edits, so I fail to see why you write as if I have some sinister intent for disputing your opinion on what is and is not "too much information". Instead I am discussing the matter and awaiting the Wikipedia Biographies of living persons Noticeboard to settle the issue.</p>

<p>Sorry to break it to you, Myrockstar, but I don't say it to be negative. Actually, I feel bad for her and that she's going through this. Yet, at the same time, it is encyclopedic because an encyclopedia article talks about her, her life, and her career. This is a HUGE event in her life, so it is definitely valid. Something like her seen smashing a window and that was it then it would be nothing, but the fact that she's having a break down, and these are issues that have occured from it, they are relevant. Things like the umbrella, head shaving, and tattoos are events happening from her break down, and that isn't trivia. Trivia would be that her hair had been brunette before shaving it, or what exact type of tattoos she had put onto her skin. Anything that is gossip isn't encyclopedic. Anything that is big and notable in her life, that is encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Kat_2996.html" title="User:Black Kat">Black Kat</a> 13:30, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't have to explain to me what the purpose of an encyclopedia is, I'm aware of what it is. The only "HUGE" event in her life going on is that she is in rehab, and before that she shaved her head. Two facts that are presented in the section. Although she most likely suffered a break down, we don't know the facts because nobody has officially sad anything. The same applies to the tattoos and the umbrella incident, we do not know if they are at all connected to her shaving, or to Federline not letting her see her children. As of now it all still remains speculation and gossip, and like you said gossip isn't encyclopedic. We have to find a way to connect the umbrella incident to her situation, we can't just say "Spears entered rehab on XX, before that she was photographed bashing an SUV with an umbrella" because then it either becomes trivial, or it gives the impression that her bashing an SUV has something to do with entering rehab, which we do not know. - <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrockstar_6c2c.html" title="User:Myrockstar">Myrockstar</a> 15:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Explain to me, how is anything of the above anywhere near encyclopedic that needs to be in Wikipedia? At best, <i>its salacious voyeurism, at worst - its an invasion of privacy</i>. I believe in the interest of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> such details can and should be left out UNTIL they are notable and relevant in the subject's life (in this case, if they are covered by RELIABLE (non-gossip, blog, tabloid) media in a court case). <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> indicates that we should err on the side of caution. What need is there for Wikipedia to parrot tabloid style reporting immediately? Your assertion that it is: <i>This information is factual, well documented, and <b>seen by the majority of people</b> as erratic</i> is <b>pure weasel wording</b> (the majority of who? = <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>) and <i>erratic</i> is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> biased language. Your passing judgement on something you have absolutely no privy to. <i>"The umbrella incident happened as a direct result of her frustration to visit her children at Federline's and her being prevented from doing so."</i> - unless you turn out to be Spear's personal physician/psychiatrist (breaking doctor/patient priveleges) that is YOUR OWN POP CULTURE <b>amateur speculation</b> that has <i>ZERO PLACE</i> in Wikipedia. Ditto with OK! Magazine's trash coverage of her behavior - pseudo speculation has no place in an encyclopedia. I'm afraid your explanation just about exposes the bias that is behind the thinking for the inclusion of such "facts" (not well sourced and speculative)</p>
<p>This is where the immediate nature of Wikipedia fails it - it can be updated so fast without the test of time to determine relevancy. Not only do we have to ensure <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, we need to exercise caution over the willy nilly inclusion of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">biased</a> speculation like the above. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 13:40, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please review the paragraph you claim contains weasel words. As my previous sentences were worded "All of <b>this behavior</b> centers around custody of her children. <b>This behavior</b> will be presented before a judge in California state court..." The sentence "This information is factual, well documented, and seen by the majority of people as erratic" is to be read with the subject understood to be "this behavior" so it should be read as "This information [about this behavior] is factual, well documented, and seen by the majority of people as erratic." I apologize if this was unclear.</li>
<li>I don't see how calling her behavior "erratic" is weaselly; compared to the rest of her life her new behavior is "liable to sudden unpredictable change" which is the defintion of erratic. "The majority" would be the majority of people who have expressed any opinion on this in any form of media. Are you saying you know a lot of people who do not see these events as a sudden unpredictable change?</li>
<li>It was not me who stated that the umbrella incident was a result of not being able to see her children but the news sources that are referenced.</li>

<dd>Firstly your putting a lot of your own conjecturing in these reports. Your claiming relevance on issues you have absolutely no idea about - to wit, your saying its all relevant because of <i>centers around the custody</i> of the children. Unless your Spears, Federline, their lawyer(s) and immediate family - you are <b>speculating</b>. The Gossip media (yes - NY Daily news is one of them - their Pulitzer prizes are for exposing city/police corruption and other stuff - not for celebrity coverage) are THEMSELVES speculating about <i>future</i> court battles that HAVE NOT HAPPENED. This speculation is pretty much <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">biased</a>. The bare facts as presented now is the best and most neutral way to present the situation in Wikipedia. Anything else would be wild conjecture and biased speculation. The <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">irony</a> here is that the non-NPOV warning tag is asking to insert biased POV material.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel</a> wording, the use of the term "the majority of people" is a classic case of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html#Generalization_using_weasel_words" title="Weasel words">Weasel_words#Generalization_using_weasel_words</a>. I can not hope to claim to represent the views of "the majority" of people - and neither can any of us. <i>Generalization by means of grammatical quantifiers (few, many, people, etc.), as well as the passive voice ("it has been decided") are also part of weasel wording. <b>Generalization in this way helps speakers or writers disappear in the crowd and thus disown responsibility for what they have said</b>.</i> As for the use of the word "erratic" - its a throw away line used in the NY Daily news source - a judgmental non-neutral POV biased description on the reporters part, which brings us back to my assertion of editors unquestioning use of media reports <i>without filtering out the original reporters bias and speculations</i>. It may be <i>"sourced"</i> but it sure as heck isn't reliable or relevant.</dd>

<li>Please clam down and reflect where this discussion is taking place. While I disagree that I'm using weasel words in this discussion, this is a talk-page and not the article itself. If you go back and read the guideline that you keep citing you'll see by the constant use of the words "articles" and "article" that this guideline is about them. I haven't put anything in the article except the POV tag for the entirety of this thread and the one above. I fully understand that you think inclusion of details in the article is POV, I disagree and await the Biographies of living persons Noticeboard to weigh in.</li>

<p>The Feb. 5, 2007 claims for the marking 666 on her head has so far been made by only one magazine which Wikipedia has deemed a tabloid the story is at <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz1.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz1.shtml</a></p>
<p>So far <i>The Rolling Stone</i> and an Arizona newspaper are the only wiki-standard reliable sources reprinting the claim that I could find online: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/03/05/britney-needs-to-be-institutionalized-in-actual-institution/" class="external free" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/03/05/britney-needs-to-be-institutionalized-in-actual-institution/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/03/05/britney-needs-to-be-institutionalized-in-actual-institution/</a> <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb//articles/0305spears-CR.html" class="external free" title="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb//articles/0305spears-CR.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb//articles/0305spears-CR.html</a></p>
<p>I personally remain unconvinced of the verifiability of these claims, but certainly <i>The Rolling Stone</i> repeating the claims could have a large impact on her career. As this just began to be reported I think it is prudent to wait for more sources. If someone wants to cite it placing emphasis on Rolling Stone's involvement it would be hard to argue against inclusion. If someone else chooses to do so I remind them that any citation of this information must include references in the main article or it will be deleted as per Wiki-Standards.</p>

<dd>The two websites linked above uses the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i> tabloid trash as the source of the "666" info. The <i>News of the world</i> tabloid is useless as a reference. Also note that:
<ul>
<li>Rolling stone link is an entertainment blog. Nothing journalistic about that. It references an Australian newspaper that in turn uses the <i>News of the world</i> tabloid source.</li>
<li>Azcentral link is an entertainment gossip site (relaxed journalistic ethics if any) that acknowledges it used <i>News of the World</i> as a source for the 666 allegation.</li>

Please note that I stated “I personally remain unconvinced of the verifiability of these claims… I think it is prudent to wait for more sources”. Currently the only new information on this topic was at X17 (which doesn’t qualify as a reliable source by wikistandards), who have come out against the claims at: <a href="http://x17online.com/celebrities/britney_spears/britneys_suicide_attempt_rumors_false.php" class="external free" title="http://x17online.com/celebrities/britney_spears/britneys_suicide_attempt_rumors_false.php" rel="nofollow">http://x17online.com/celebrities/britney_spears/britneys_suicide_attempt_rumors_false.php</a> As this appears to be an issue of dueling tabloids, I would again advise that inclusion of these claims on her wikipage is not warranted due to the scarcity of reliable sources.</p>

<dd>I'm opposed to this suggestion. There's nothing wrong with <i>People</i>, but Wikipedia should not be endorsing/advertising commercial sites, nor should we welcome suggestions to use Wikipedia in such a manner. How does Wikipedia benefit from this? If we link Britney then we could link virtually any celebrity article (the same question is raised at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAngelina_Jolie_928c.html" title="Talk:Angelina Jolie">Talk:Angelina Jolie</a>) and before we know it Wikipedia becomes a vehicle by which <i>People</i> is advertised. Then, we'd have to fairly link to any other rival sites... I think it would be a huge mistake, and I also think it would contradict <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Links_to_be_avoided" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#Links to be avoided</a> - numbers 3 and 4, and also <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Advertising_and_conflicts_of_interest" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#Advertising and conflicts of interest</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 14:26, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OTOH, virtually every <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> Wikipedia uses is in some manner commercial, including news networks, books, magazines, etc. Artists' own sites are often commercial in nature.

<dd><a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> makes a clear distinction. Using a site as a source is one thing, but providing a link under "external links" without necessarily using the link as a source is entirely different - it's blatant advertising. The original post reads as a request to link, rather than an invitation and it doesn't offer anything to benefit WP which would be the main focus of the message if it came from a savvy marketer. I doubt its authenticity. A company like <i>People</i> has a highly professional, highly effective marketing department, and placing a couple of messages on some random talk pages doesn't exactly spell "professionalism" to me. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 21:50, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The reason a lot of people like to put spam links into Wikipedia is that they think a link from a high traffic site like this will drive up their search engine rankings (eg: Google). The higher the search engine rankings, the higher they can charge for advertising on the website. I'd like to point out that putting links in Wikipedia articles will not affect search engine rankings: <i>Since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, <b>external links do not alter search engine rankings</b>.</i> So putting a <i>People</i> link here (or any other commercial link) in Wikipedia will not benefit the linked party.--<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 03:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. She is now out of rehab. So her "time in rehab" was only a part of the year. Was there any reason it was changed to begin with?--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 12:56, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Someone just changed it to "Personal issues," which I think is vague to the point of meaninglessness. Children, marriages and divorce count as "personal issues" too.

<p>Again a user has changed this headng to "2007: Life after rehab," which misleadingly suggests that she must have gone to rehab before 2007. I am reverting this edit and encouraging all users to bring the discussion here before unilaterally editing.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 13:38, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Personal struggles is improper cause we don't know WHY she went to rehab and can't say shaving off your hair is indefinitely "struggling". Many women shave their heads off! She has since been doing better so you can't say that all of 2007 was bad to her!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Now I have no interest in representing Spears as any more "struggling" than she is. But going to rehab is definitely a way of trying to deal with personal problems. People go to rehab <i>only</i> because they are struggling in some way with some personal problem(s). I think once we have some evidence that she has moved beyond these struggles in some way, i.e. that her career begins moving along again, or she keeps a low and/or stable profile for several months, I think that it would make sense to change the heading to "Rehab and recovery", or something along those lines. But as of now, the section is merely documenting her stint in rehab and the events leading up to it, and so the only justified title I can think of would be "personal struggles." Furthermore, I don't see why you think this title even reflects badly on Spears in the first place. A struggle implies an active process of trying to change something that is wrong, which is exactly the point of rehab. I would say "struggle" is adequate to both the reasons for her going to rehab and her actual time there. Other users seem to agree with this assessment.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 20:59, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the following was unnecessary and pov. It seems to be here just to show that she has no political opinion... It could maybe belong in a real, argumented section about Spears's political opinion, if one deems it necessary (which I am not sure it is).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a September 2003 interview with Tucker Carlson of CNN, on the subject of the 2003 Iraq War, Spears said, "Honestly, I think we should just trust our president in every decision he makes and should just support that, you know, and be faithful in what happens."[39] The footage of this quote later appeared in Michael Moore's documentary Fahrenheit 9/11.</p>

<dd>I disagree. This statement is quite well-known, and it is important that it be included in the article with a verifiable source and date. She is a notable person, and her political statements are therefore also notable. I also disagree with your characterization that the statement attests to her political apathy; it represents, rather, a full-fledged endorsement of George W. Bush and his foreign policies. Given Spears' fame, such endorsments can be very powerful and influential with respect to voters. Consequently, until such time as greater consensus is reached with other editors I am reverting back to the article as it was.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 23:39, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I could agree with the fact the her opinion, as a notable person, matters; It seems to me though that this is out of place in the current section which talks about her musical carreer. Why not creating a subsection about her political opinion? That would make more sense to me, rather than dropping this in the middle of an unrelated section. Hellgi 20:41, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The quote is in a chronological section of her biography. It just so happens that c. 2003 she was still enjoying a successful career. Because the quote is also from that time, it is included in that section. Personally I think its fine as it is.--<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgnaramasi_6d6f.html" title="User:Agnaramasi">Agnaramasi</a> 21:07, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
