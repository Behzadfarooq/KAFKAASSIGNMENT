<p>Offices of state grew up in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and later the United Kingdom, piecemeal. Initially, as in other countries, they were little more than <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretariat.html" title="Secretariat">secretariats</a> for their leaders, who held positions at <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_court.html" title="Royal court">Court</a>. In the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a>, in response to empire and economic change, institutions such as the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Works_25ef.html" title="Office of Works">Office of Works</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy_Board_1d4d.html" title="Navy Board">Navy Board</a> grew large. Each had its own system, and staff were appointed by purchase or patronage. By the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were not working.</p>
<p>In 1806, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_East_India_Company_534d.html" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> established a college in London for training administrators based on the recommendation of officials in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> who had seen the Chinese examination system. The civil service based on examination similar to the Chinese system was advocated by a number of Englishmen over the next several decades. (Bodde 2005)</p>
<p>A permanent, unified and politically neutral civil service, in which appointments were made on merit, was introduced on the recommendations of the Northcote-Trevelyan report of <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, which also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine (“mechanical”) work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an “administrative” class. The report was well-timed, since bureaucratic chaos in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimean_War_40b1.html" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a> promptly caused a clamour for the change. A <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Service_Commission_0ee9.html" title="Civil Service Commission">Civil Service Commission</a> was accordingly set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other Northcote-Trevelyan recommendations implemented over some years. This system was broadly endorsed by Commissions chaired by Playfair (1874), Ridley (1886), MacDonnell (1914), Tomlin (1931) and Priestley (1955).</p>
<p>The Northcote-Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change.</p>
<p><a name="Lord_Fulton.27s_committee_report" id="Lord_Fulton.27s_committee_report"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Civil_Service_7079.html" title="Edit section: Lord Fulton's committee report">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lord Fulton's committee report</span></h2>
<p>Following the Second World War, however, demands for change again grew. There was a concern (illustrated in <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._P._Snow_6642.html" title="C. P. Snow">C. P. Snow</a>’s <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangers_and_Brothers_5d82.html" title="Strangers and Brothers">Strangers and Brothers</a></i> series of novels) that technical and scientific expertise was mushrooming, to a point at which the “good all-rounder” culture of the administrative civil servant with a classics or other arts degree could no longer properly engage with it: as late as 1963, for example, the Treasury had just 19 trained economists. The times were, moreover, ones of keen respect for technocracy, with the mass mobilisation of war having worked effectively, and the French National Plan apparently delivering economic success. And there was also a feeling which would not go away, following the war and the radical social reforms of the 1945 Labour government, that the so-called “<a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_%28bureaucrat%29.html" title="Mandarin (bureaucrat)">mandarins</a>” of the higher civil service were too remote from the people. Indeed, between <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> only 3% of the recruits to the administrative class came from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_classes.html" title="Working classes">working classes</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> more than half of the administrators at <a href="../../../u/n/d/Under-secretary.html" title="Under-secretary">under-secretary</a> level and above had been privately educated.</p>
<p>Lord Fulton’s committee reported in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. He found that administrators were not professional enough, and in particular lacked management skills; that the position of technical and scientific experts needed to be rationalised and enhanced; and that the service was indeed too remote. His 158 recommendations included the introduction of a unified grading system for all categories of staff, a Civil Service College, and a central policy planning unit. He also said that control of the service should be taken from the Treasury, and given to a new Department, and that the “fast stream” recruitment process for accessing the upper echelons should be made more flexible, to encourage candidates from less privileged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Into <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Heath_fd9a.html" title="Edward Heath">Heath</a>’s <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downing_Street_d755.html" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a> came the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS), and they were in particular given charge of a series of Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) studies of policy efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>But, whether through lack of political will, or through passive resistance by a mandarinate which the report had suggested were “amateurs”, Fulton failed. The Civil Service College equipped generalists with additional skills, but did not turn them into qualified professionals as <a href="../../../%C3%A9/c/o/%C3%89cole_Nationale_d%27Administration_46bf.html" title="École Nationale d'Administration">ENA</a> did in France. Recruits to the fast stream self-selected, with the universities of <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> still producing a large plural majority of successful candidates, since the system continued to favour the tutorial system at <a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a>. The younger mandarins found excuses to avoid managerial jobs in favour of the more prestigious policy postings. The generalists remained on top, and the specialists on tap.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> came to office in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> determined to prefer the market to the state: government should be small but active. Many of her ministers were suspicious of the civil service, following the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Right_36d7.html" title="New Right">New Right</a> doctrine that public servants always seek to increase their own power and budgets.</p>
<p>She immediately set about reducing the size of the civil service, cutting numbers from 732,000 to 594,000 over her first seven years in office. The Wardale Report in April <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> launched a 'bonfire' of senior civil service posts and functions were privatised. Derek Rayner, head of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marks_and_Spencer_8469.html" title="Marks and Spencer">Marks and Spencer</a>, was brought in to set up first a small Policy Unit in No. 10, and then an Efficiency Unit in the Cabinet Office: this ran a programme of efficiency scrutinies, which by <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> had saved £750m. Meanwhile <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Heseltine_7c96.html" title="Michael Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a> had introduced a comprehensive system of corporate and business planning (known as MINIS) first in the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_the_Environment_3cad.html" title="Department of the Environment">Department of the Environment</a> and then in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Defence_%28United_Kingdom%29_f84c.html" title="Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Defence</a>.</p>
<p>A <i>Financial Management Initiative</i> was launched in September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> (<i>Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service</i> (Cmnd 8616)) as an umbrella for the efficiency scrutiny programme and with a wider focus on corporate planning, efficiency and objective-setting. But by the mid 1980s, although cuts had been made, transformation had not happened. In February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> Robin Ibbs, recruited from <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Chemical_Industries_df64.html" title="Imperial Chemical Industries">ICI</a> in July 1983 to run the Efficiency Unit (now in No. 10), published his report <i>Improving Management in Government: The Next Steps</i>. This envisaged a new approach to delivery featuring clear targets and personal responsibility. Without any statutory change, the managerial functions of Ministries would be hived off into <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_Agency_e6f0.html" title="Executive Agency">Executive Agencies</a>, with clear Framework Documents setting out their objectives, and whose <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive.html" title="Chief executive">chief executives</a> would be made accountable directly (in some cases to Parliament) for performance. Agencies were to, as far as possible, take a commercial approach to their tasks. However, the Government conceded that agency staff would remain civil servants, which diluted the radicalism of the reform. The approach seems somewhat similar to the Swedish model, though no influence from Sweden has ever been acknowledged.</p>
<p>The Next Steps Initiative took some years to get off the ground, and progress was patchy. Significant change was achieved, although agencies never really achieved the level of autonomy envisaged at the start. Meanwhile, the accountability of the remaining civil servants began to be improved. MINIS-style business planning became standard, and delegated budgets were introduced, so that individual managers were for the first time held fully accountable for meeting objectives, and for the resources they used to do so. The Priestley Commission principle of pay comparability with the private sector had been abandoned in February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance-related_pay.html" title="Performance-related pay">Performance-related pay</a> began in December <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, was built on thereafter, and continues to this day.</p>
<p>Next Steps may always have had the ultimate goal of privatisation. Certainly, the focus on smaller, more accountable, units revived the keenness of Ministerial interest in the perceived efficiencies of the private sector. Already in the late 1980s, some common services once set up in the expectation of economies of scale, such as the Property Services Agency or the Crown Suppliers, were being dismantled or sold off. Next, shortly after Thatcher left office, in July <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, a new programme of market-testing of central government services began, with the White Paper <i>Competing for Quality</i> (Cm 1730). Five-yearly or three-yearly policy and finance reviews of all agencies and other public bodies were instituted, where the first question to be answered (the “prior options exercise") was why the function should not be abolished or privatised. Strategic contracting-out also took place, where the Government did not wait to examine whether a private sector solution would be more efficient, but went ahead with it on the principle that the private sector was always more efficient and more responsive. This has led in particular to most IT services within the UK Government being managed by private companies; the US firm <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Data_Systems_5bf6.html" title="Electronic Data Systems">EDS</a> now has a large proportion of the total, which some have suggested gives it the capacity to manipulate pricing, or even be a strategic threat to UK interests. In November 1991 the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Finance_Initiative_ad78.html" title="Private Finance Initiative">Private Finance Initiative</a> was launched, and by November 1994 the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_78e8.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> had referred to it as ‘the funding mechanism of choice for most public sector projects’. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> the decision was taken to privatise the Chessington Computer Centre, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMSO_1aa1.html" title="HMSO">HMSO</a>, the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Agency and Recruitment &amp; Assessment Services.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Civil_Service_7079.html" title="Edit section: The Citizen’s Charter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Citizen’s Charter</span></h2>
<p>It was believed with the Thatcher reforms that efficiency was improving. But there was still a perception of carelessness and lack of responsiveness in the quality of public services. The government of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a> sought to tackle this with a Citizen’s Charter programme. This sought to empower the service user, by setting out rights to standards in each service area, and arrangements for compensation when these were not met. An Office of Public Service and Science was set up in 1992, to see that the Charter policy was implemented across government.</p>
<p>By 1998, 42 Charters had been published, and they included services provided by public service industries such as the health service and the railways, as well as by the civil service. The programme was also expanded to apply to other organisations such as local government or housing associations, through a scheme of “Chartermark” awards. The programme was greeted with some derision, and it is true that the compensation sometimes hardly seemed worth the effort of claiming, and that the service standards were rarely set with much consumer input. But the initiative did have a significant effect in changing cultures, and paradoxically the spin-off Chartermark initiative may have had more impact on local organisations uncertain about what standards to aim for, than the parent Citizen’s Charter programme itself.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Civil_Service_7079.html" title="Edit section: Political neutrality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political neutrality</span></h2>
<p>An underpinning principle of the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_politics_f257.html" title="UK politics">British political landscape</a> is the permanent and politically neutral character of the civil service.</p>
<p>This contrasts with other traditions where senior public offices may be dependent on elected <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politicians</a> for appointment. For example, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> the top several layers of government departments are political appointees who change with different administrations. By contrast, political appointees within the British ministries consist only the Ministers themselves and their political advisers, generally known as Special Advisers.</p>
<p>However, in the last decades of the 20th century, some political observers have claimed that the British civil service has started to become increasingly politicised. The main complaint relates to an increase in the number of Special Advisers, particularly in the 1990s under the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Labour_party_6278.html" title="British Labour party">Labour</a> Government (when there was also a wholesale turnover of Press Officers). Defenders of the Blair Government on this point acknowledge the upward trend in the number of Special Advisers, but argue that this began before the arrival of the Labour Government, and that the total number still amounts to no more than three or four individuals in each Ministry.</p>
<p>Critics also point to instances of conflict between Special Advisers and members of the civil service. There has been one well-publicised incident — the tensions between <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Sixsmith_87e7.html" title="Martin Sixsmith">Martin Sixsmith</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Moore_4214.html" title="Jo Moore">Jo Moore</a>, who both worked for <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Byers_f312.html" title="Stephen Byers">Stephen Byers</a> when he was <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Secretary_93d7.html" title="Transport Secretary">Transport Secretary</a>. Both resigned following a scandal relating to an email sent by <a href="../../../j/o/_/Jo_Moore_4214.html" title="Jo Moore">Jo Moore</a> on the day of the terrorist attacks on <a href="../../../1/1/_/11_September_2001_a10d.html" title="11 September 2001">11 September 2001</a>, which was widely felt to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>A second complaint relates to the involvement of ministers in the appointment of senior civil servants. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Prime_Minister_265e.html" title="British Prime Minister">Prime Ministers</a> have final say over very senior appointments such as <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permanent_Secretary_dbb2.html" title="Permanent Secretary">Permanent Secretaries</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_Secretary_4770.html" title="Cabinet Secretary">Cabinet Secretary</a>, but are supposed to choose from a handful of shortlisted candidates purely on the basis of merit without political consideration. Some observers claim that recent Prime Ministers, particularly <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, exercised these powers of patronage to appoint Permanent Secretaries which were sympathetic to her government's aims.</p>

<p>A new civil service code was launched on 6 June <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> to outline the core values and standards expected of civil servants. The core values are defined as <i>integrity</i>, <i>honesty</i>, <i>objectivity</i>, and <i>impartiality</i>.

<p>The grading schemes used in the civil service have changed many times, and it is common for old and new systems to be used side-by-side. All grades from SCS Band 1 and above (see table) are part of the "Senior Civil Service", which is overseen by the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet_Office_e70d.html" title="Cabinet Office">Cabinet Office</a> on behalf of the civil service as a whole. Below the Senior Civil Service, each individual department can put in place its own grading and pay arrangements, and job titles may differ from the generic ones shown here.</p>
