<p>With the development of the modern <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> in the 20th century, the single Imperial status of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_subject.html" title="British subject">British subject</a> was increasingly inadequate to deal with the realities of a Commonwealth with independent member states. In 1948, the Commonwealth <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_government.html" title="Head of government">Heads of Government</a> agreed that each member would adopt a national citizenship, but that the existing status of British subject would continue to be a common status held by all <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_citizen.html" title="Commonwealth citizen">Commonwealth citizens</a>.</p>
<p>The British Nationality Act 1948 established the status of <i>Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies</i> (CUKC), the national citizenship of the United Kingdom and those places that were still British <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_colony.html" title="Crown colony">colonies</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>, when the 1948 Act came into force. However, until the early 1960s there was little difference, if any, in United Kingdom law between the rights of CUKCs and other British subjects, all of whom had the right at any time to enter and live in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Between 1962 and 1971, as a result of fears about increasing immigration by Commonwealth citizens from <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the United Kingdom gradually tightened controls on immigration by British subjects from other parts of the Commonwealth. The <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_Act_1971_68b1.html" title="Immigration Act 1971">Immigration Act 1971</a> introduced the concept of <i>patriality</i>, by which only British subjects with sufficiently strong links to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Islands_949e.html" title="British Islands">British Islands</a> (i.e. the United Kingdom, the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_7556.html" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>) had <i>right of abode</i>, the right to live and work in the United Kingdom and Islands.</p>
<p>Although there have been several amendments to the 1971 Act in the intervening years, the principal British nationality law today is the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Nationality_Act_1981_99be.html" title="British Nationality Act 1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>, which established the current system of multiple categories of British nationality, viz. <i>British citizens</i>, <i>British Overseas Territories citizens</i>, <i>British Overseas citizens</i>, <i>British Nationals (Overseas)</i>, <i>British subjects</i> and <i>British protected persons</i>. Only British citizenship includes the automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The 1981 Act also ceased to recognise Commonwealth citizens as British subjects. There remain only two categories of people who are still British subjects: some people (formerly known as British subjects without citizenship) who originally acquired British nationality through a connection with former British India, and also a number of people connected with the Republic of Ireland before 1949 who have made a declaration to retain British nationality. Those British subjects connected with former British India <i>lose</i> British nationality if they acquire any other.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Overseas_Territories_citizen_2422.html" title="British Overseas Territories citizen">British Overseas Territories citizens</a> (formerly British Dependent Territories citizenship) (BOTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>BOTC (formerly BDTC) is the form of British nationality held by connection with an existing <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_colony.html" title="Crown colony">overseas territory</a>. Nearly all are now also British citizens as a result of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. It is possible to hold BOTC and British citizenship simultaneously.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Overseas_citizen_f6fe.html" title="British Overseas citizen">British Overseas citizens</a> (BOC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>BOCs are those former CUKCs who did not qualify for either British citizenship or British Dependent Territories citizenship. Most of these derived their status as CUKCs from former colonies, such as <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>British subjects (as defined in the 1981 Act) are those British subjects who were not CUKCs or citizens of any other Commonwealth country. Most of these derived their status as British subjects from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">British India</a> or the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> as they existed before 1949.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The status of BNO did not originally exist under the 1981 scheme, but was created by the Hong Kong Act 1985 and the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Order 1986. BNOs are those former <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> BDTCs who applied for the status of BNO prior to the handover of Hong Kong to the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>. Hong Kong BDTCs who did not apply to become BNOs, and who did not gain <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_nationality_law.html" title="Chinese nationality law">PRC nationality</a> after the handover, became BOCs if they did not have any other nationality.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_protected_person.html" title="British protected person">British protected persons</a> (BPP)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>BPPs derive from those parts of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> which were not officially part of the Crown's dominions, but were instead <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectorate.html" title="Protectorate">protectorates</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protected_state.html" title="Protected state">protected states</a> with nominally independent rulers under the "protection" of the British Crown. The status of BPP is <i><a href="../../../s/u/i/Sui_generis.html" title="Sui generis">sui generis</a></i> - BPPs are not Commonwealth citizens (British subjects, in the old sense) and were not traditionally considered to be British nationals, but are not aliens either.</dd>

<p>Of the various classes of British nationality and BPP status, all except British citizenship and British Overseas Territories citizenship are residual categories. This means that they will become extinct with the passage of time, as they can only be passed down to the national's children in exceptional circumstances, e.g. if the child would otherwise be <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stateless_person.html" title="Stateless person">stateless</a>. There is, consequently, little provision for the acquisition of these classes of nationality by people who do not already have them.</p>

<ol>
<li><i><a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_soli.html" title="Lex soli">lex soli</a></i>: By birth in the United Kingdom to a parent who is a British citizen at the time of the birth, or to a parent who is settled in the United Kingdom</li>

<li>By adoption</li>
</ol>

<p>Persons acquiring citizenship by method (2) are called citizens by descent, while citizens acquiring citizenship by methods (1), (3) or (5) are called citizens otherwise than by descent. British citizens by registration, method (4), may be either, depending on the circumstances. Only citizens otherwise than by descent can pass on their citizenship to their children born outside the UK automatically; citizens by descent can only pass on citizenship to their non-UK born children by registering them.</p>

<p>Under the law in effect from 1 January 1983, a child born in the UK to a parent who is a British citizen or 'settled' in the UK is automatically a British citizen by birth</p>
<ul>
<li>only <i>one</i> parent must meet this requirement, either the father or the mother.</li>
<li>"settled" status usually means the parent is resident in the United Kingdom and holds <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indefinite_Leave_to_Remain_5fac.html" title="Indefinite Leave to Remain">Indefinite Leave to Remain</a> (ILR) or Right of Abode. Irish citizens are automatically deemed to hold ILR.</li>
<li>Special rules exist for cases where a parent of a child is a citizen of a <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> or <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Area_0625.html" title="European Economic Area">European Economic Area</a> member state, or <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The law in this respect was changed on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> and again on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_30.html" title="April 30">30 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html#Citizens_of_EEA_States_and_Switzerland" title="British nationality law">Details</a></li>
<li>For children born before 1 July 2006, if only the father meets this requirement, the parents must be married. Marriage subsequent to the birth is normally enough to confer British citizenship from that point.</li>
<li>where the father is not married to the mother, the Home Office will usually register the child as British provided an application is made and the child would have been British otherwise. The child must be aged under 18 on the date of application.</li>
<li>where a parent subsequently acquires British citizenship or "settled" status the child can be registered as British provided he or she is still aged under 18</li>
<li>if the child lives in the UK until age 10 there is a lifetime entitlement to register as a British citizen. The immigration status of the child and its parents is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Special provisions may apply for the child to acquire British citizenship if a parent is a British Overseas citizen or British subject, or if the child is stateless.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before 1983, birth in the UK was sufficient <i>in itself</i> to confer British nationality irrespective of the status of parents, with an exception only for children of diplomats and enemy aliens. This exception did not apply to most visiting forces, so, in general, children born in the UK before 1983 to visiting military personnel (eg US forces stationed in the UK) are British citizens by birth.</p>

<ul>
<li>only <i>one</i> parent needs to be British <i>otherwise than by descent</i> - either the father or the mother.</li>
<li>an unmarried father cannot pass on British citizenship automatically in the case of children born before 1 July 2006. Although if the parents marry subsequent to the birth the child normally will become a British citizen at that point if <i>legitimated</i> by the marriage and the father was eligible to pass on British citizenship</li>
<li>failing the above the child can be registered as British if it would have been British if parents were married and application is made before the child is 18.</li>
<li>where the parent is a British citizen <i>by descent</i> additional requirements apply. In the most common scenario, normally the parent is expected to have lived in the UK for three years and apply for the child to be registered as a British citizen within 12 months of the birth.</li>
<li>For British nationality purposes the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_7556.html" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> are treated as though they were part of the UK.</li>

<li>Children born overseas to parents on <i>Crown Service</i> are normally granted British citizenship <i>otherwise than by descent</i>. In other words, their status is the same as it would have been had they been born in the UK.</li>
<li>In exceptional cases, the Home Secretary may register a child of parents who are British <i>by descent</i> as a British citizen under discretionary provisions, for example if the child is stateless.</li>

<p>Prior to 1983, as a general rule British nationality could only be transmitted from the father through one generation only, and parents were required to be married.

<p>A child adopted by a British citizen only acquires British citizenship <i>automatically</i> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the adoption order is made by a court in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Isle of Man or Falkland Islands on or after <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, or in another British Overseas Territory on or after <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">21 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>; or</li>

</ul>
<p>In both cases, at least one adoptive parent must be a British citizen on the date of the adoption.</p>
<p>In all other cases, an application for registration of the child as a British citizen must be made before the child is age 18. Usually this will be granted provided the Secretary of State accepts the adoption is <i>bona fide</i> and the child would have been a British citizen if the natural child of the adopters. Usually the adoption must have taken place under the law of a 'designated country' (most developed nations along with some others are 'designated' for this purpose) and be recognised in the UK. This is the standard method for children adopted by British citizens permanently resident overseas to acquire British citizenship.</p>
<p>The cancellation or annulment of an adoption order does not cause loss of British citizenship acquired by that adoption.</p>
<p>British children adopted by non-British nationals do not lose British nationality, even if they acquire a foreign nationality as a result of the adoption.</p>

<p>The requirements for naturalisation as a British citizen depend on whether one is married to a British citizen or not.</p>
<p>For those married to a British citizen the applicant must:</p>
<ul>
<li>hold indefinite leave to remain in the UK (or an equivalent such as Right of Abode or Irish citizenship)</li>
<li>have lived legally in the UK for three years</li>
<li>show sufficient knowledge of life in the UK, either by passing the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_in_the_United_Kingdom_test_09c6.html" title="Life in the United Kingdom test">Life in the United Kingdom test</a> or by attending combined English language and citizenship classes. Proof of this must be supplied with one's application for naturalisation. Exemption for this and the language requirement (see below) is normally granted for those aged 65 or over, and may be granted to those aged between 60 and 65.</li>
<li>meet specified <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_language.html" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_language_83df.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish Gaelic language</a> competence standards. Those who pass the <i>Life in the UK test</i> are deemed to meet English language requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those not married to a British citizen the requirements are</p>
<ul>
<li>five years legal residence in the UK</li>
<li>indefinite leave to remain or equivalent must have been held for 12 months</li>
<li>the applicant must intend to continue to live in the UK or work overseas for the UK government or a British corporation or association.</li>
<li>the same language and knowledge of life in the UK standards apply as for those married to British citizens</li>
</ul>
<p>All applicants for naturalisation must be of "good character". Naturalisation is at the discretion of the relevant authority but is normally granted if the requirements are met.</p>
<p>Those applying for British citizenship in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man (where the application is mainly based on residence in the Crown Dependencies rather than the UK itself) do not have to sit the Life in the UK Test under policies in effect as of August 2006. In due course, it is expected that Regulations will be introduced to that effect in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. The provisions for proving knowledge of English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic remain unchanged until that date for applicants in the Crown Dependencies. In the rare cases where an applicant is able to apply for naturalisation from outside the United Kingdom, a paper based version of the <i>Life in the UK Test</i> may be available at a British diplomatic mission. <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/nichapter18/ch18annexe?view=Binary" class="external text" title="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/nichapter18/ch18annexe?view=Binary" rel="nofollow">Details (pdf)</a></p>

<p>Renunciations made to other authorities are invalid: e.g., a general renunciation made upon taking up U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>There are provisions for the resumption of British citizenship or British overseas territories citizenship renounced for the purpose of gaining or retaining another citizenship.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_nationality_law.html" title="Edit section: Dual nationality and dual citizenship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dual nationality and dual citizenship</span></h2>
<p>Since the British Nationality Act of 1948, there is in general no restriction, in United Kingdom law, on a British national being a citizen of another country as well. So, if a British national acquires another nationality, they will not automatically lose British nationality. Similarly, a person does not need to give up any other nationality when they become British.</p>
<p>Different rules apply in the cases of British protected persons and certain British subjects. A person who is a British subject otherwise than by connection with the Republic of Ireland will lose that status on acquiring any other nationality or citizenship. Similarly, a British protected person will no longer be a British protected person on acquiring any other nationality or citizenship. Although British Overseas citizens are not subject to loss of citizenship, a British Overseas citizen may lose an entitlement to register as a British citizen under s4B of the 1981 Act if he acquires any other citizenship.</p>
<p>Many other countries, however, do not allow dual nationality (<i>see <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_citizenship.html" title="Multiple citizenship">Multiple citizenship</a></i>). If you have British nationality, and are also a national of a country which does not allow dual nationality, the authorities of that country may either regard you as having lost that nationality or may refuse to recognise your British nationality. If you are a British national, and you acquire the nationality of a country which does not allow dual nationality, you may be required by the other country to renounce (give up) your British nationality in order to retain the other citizenship.</p>
<p>Under international law, a State may not give diplomatic protection to one of its nationals in a country whose citizenship that person also holds. For example, if you are British and have another nationality, for example, American, and are visiting the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, a British <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consul.html" title="Consul">Consul</a> in the United States cannot give you diplomatic help.</p>
<p>A British person who acquired foreign citizenship by naturalisation before 1949 may have lost British nationality at the time. No specific provisions were made in the 1948 legislation for such former British subjects to acquire or otherwise resume British nationality, and hence such a person would not be a British citizen today. However women who lost British nationality on marriage to a foreign man before 1949 were deemed to have re-acquired British subject status immediately before the coming into force of the 1948 Act.</p>
