<p>Wikipedia is a big project, and naturally has a great many policies, guidelines and conventions.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>You are <b>not</b> expected to learn them before you start editing.</i></li>
<li>You <i>are</i> allowed to edit Wikipedia without creating an account (but most experienced Wikipedias will strongly <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_create_an_account__49b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Why create an account?">recommend</a> creating one).</li>
<li>You will <i>not</i> be banned if you make a mistake. (One of the core ideas behind Wikipedia is that editors will fix each other's mistakes. Experienced Wikipedians should politely <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">help inexperienced editors</a> to learn the ropes — <i>which works much better if you have an account</i>).</li>
<li>Everyone else is free to "mercilessly" edit what <i>you</i> write.</li>
<li>We <i>strongly</i> <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">encourage</a> you to <b>"sign" your comments</b> in discussion pages by typing 4 tildes in a row ("~~~~") at the end. (You can use "Show preview" to test this effect.)</li>
<li>Wikipedia has an ongoing problem with vandalism. Most vandals edit anonymously, but someone has created an account named "Brianleiter" and vandalised this page and the article itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest you read the <b><a href="../../../w/e/l/WP%7EWELCOME_0c24.html" title="WP:WELCOME">Welcome for newcomers</a></b> page, which has lots of useful links, but you are quite free to edit Wikipedia without reading those links or even the page itself.</p>

<dd>Thanks for this suggestion. Wikipedia does not have hard and fast rules for biography articles, but it does have "<a href="../../../b/i/o/Template%7EBiography_b518.html" title="Template:Biography">Template:Biography</a>" (a suggested outline) and "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_010f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)</a>". A lot of biographies on Wikipedia have a "Controversies and Criticisms" section. Do we have enough material concerning BL's work in Law and Philosophy to justify such a section, or is it only his blogging that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notably</a> controversial? If the latter, I believe that a few links to blog posts with <i>brief</i> descriptions would be better than a text paragraph. (Unfortunately, I incline to verbosity.) —<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Chittleborough_4a64.html" title="User:Chris Chittleborough">Chris Chittleborough</a> 12:54, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Brian may not be terribly controversial in his law school ratings or his philosophy school evaluations, but he is very influential in those areas and well worth reading. My guess is that long after this conflict dies down, most people coming to Wiki for information are probably going to come from one of those sources. In addition, he has some ssrn articles that are quite good and worth reading.</dd>

<p>User:70.178.85.72 added a good link to a blog posting by Steve Burton, who got a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Michigan at the same as as BL did. The post is an over-the-top attack on BL; at the end, Burton reveals that "nearly all of [the attack was] cut and pasted from Leiter's blog, minimally altered to fit the present case", then suggests that BL should tone down his habitual superciliousness. In the first comment on the post, BL <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outing.html" title="Outing">outs</a> Burton. A vigorous exchange between Burton, BL and other commenters ensues, including a (qualified) apology from BL (timestamped "July 12, 2005 07:35 PM").</p>
<p>Why is this a good link?</p>
<ol>
<li>The post itself criticizes BL's writing style, not BL himself. (I'm sure we could find lots of attacks on Leiter and/or his politics; this is much more relevant to our article.) Moreover, Burton used BL's own words to make his point.</li>
<li>BL participated in the discussion, writing several comments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need to work out how to describe it in the article. Here's the last few descriptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A conservative blogger attacks Leiter.</li>
<li>A libertarian blogger mocks and criticizes Leiter's aggressive style; in response, Leiter outs him and declares their friendship over.</li>
<li>A libertarian blogger attkcs Leiter and Leiter responds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burton is libertarian, not conservative.</li>
<li>That the linked post attacks BL's writing rather than BL himself is important.</li>
<li>When replacing #2 (my wording) above with #3, User:70.112.222.175 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Leiter&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=44344283" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Leiter&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=44344283" rel="nofollow">said</a> "obviously not NPOV to adopt Burton's characterization of Leiter's response". (I had assumed from that apology that BL had accepted that characterization. What do other people think?)</li>
<li>I see it as important to mention that Leiter participates in the comments.</li>
<li>I don't see why Burton's political orientation is relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have therefore changed the description to</p>
<dl>
<dd>A blogger mocks and criticizes Leiter's hostile style and Leiter strikes back (in the comments).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not real happy with "strikes back". Can someone else do better? (<b>Please discuss your edits here.</b> Also, please use "~~~~" as discussed above.)</p>

<p>Chris C. is very biased against Prof. Leiter and should stop editing this thread. Chris, you are not a lawyer, not a law student, not a philosopher, or philosophy student. You are a right wing blogger which seems to be your main source of interest and which would explain your bias. One sign of bias is that you at one point took seriously Krazy Keith's blog, which no one in their right mind does, no matter how often Krazy Keith pretends people are writing to thank him. (Some people are reading for sure--it's like having a window into a psych ward. But notice he has no counter on the site. You can guess why.) I give you credit, though, for coming around on that subject. But your bias shines through again with regard to the Burton attack on Leiter. You basically accept all of Burton's claims, like his attack on Leiter was just "cut and pasted from Leiter's blog" and that Leiter "outed" Burton. I have read Leiter's blog for a long time, and while some words sound familiar from stuff on Leiter, the context is totally different. And Leiter and others posting comments deny there was any outing. Here's what one wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>You guys think you caught him in some type of 'blunder' but you haven't. YOU are the ones equating an offhand mention of his ex's name, from which one could infer that he's gay, with using the writer's sexual orientation against him. Please understand that most of us do not see homosexuality as a sinful secret, and it wouldn't even occur to us to "use" it against someone. You may consider pointing out that someone is gay to be an insult. Normal people do not.</dd>
<dd>By the way, the fact that a gay man is posting on a right-wing website IS a notable fact in and of itself, considering the right's tendency to inflame anti-gay bigotry. I don't know about you, but I'd find it notable if a black man joined the Klan, too.</dd>

<p>So your reasons for saying this is a "good link" just reflect your bias against Leiter and that you have adopted this nasty guy Burton's interpretation of the whole event. (You even insist that libertarians aren't conservatives, and apparently know Burton well enough to know which he is.) None of this is worthy of Wiki. The only justification for mentioning blogging was the line that you or someone else removed, and which I'm restoring. It's all right wing bloggers, like Burton and you, who attack Leiter, and that line should be in there.</p>
<p>But really Chris, I think you should stop editing this entry. You are biased against Leiter and apparently want to smear him. That's not NPOV and not what Wiki is about--a UT law student.</p>

<dd>Whether a Wikipedia <i>editor</i> is biased about the subject of an article is not of prime importance; what <i>is</i> important is that the <b>article</b> must <i>not</i> be biased (<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> — one of only <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">four key policies</a> at Wikipedia). Otherwise, how could we have an article about (say) <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> (warning: disturbing material). But I don't think I'm "very biased against Prof. Leiter", and I certainly do not want to smear him. What I want is for Wikipedia to have a good article about Prof. Leiter, and I intend to keep editing this article to that end.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I think this article is fairly good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Leiter&amp;diff=47978268&amp;oldid=47879342" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Leiter&amp;diff=47978268&amp;oldid=47879342" rel="nofollow">as it stands</a> ("douchebag"?). In connection with blogging, the key link is <a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/on_rhetoric_civ.html" class="external text" title="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/on_rhetoric_civ.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. It raises some interesting and important questions. For example, should one (try to) be civil about <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_deniers.html" title="Holocaust deniers">Holocaust deniers</a>? How about when talking to them? If there are people beyond the bounds of civility, where should you draw that boundary? Does civility have intrinsic value, or is only a means to the end of winning debates? (And so on.) If provoking thought in readers is the measure of a blog item, that's a very good one.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I should probably respond on some other points. I disagree that Leiter denies outing Steve Burton; in fact, I intrepret the comment timestamped "July 12, 2005 07:35 PM" as an apology to SB. You're right that I did blindly accept SB's claim that he "cut and pasted from Leiter's blog", and I'm afraid I'm not going to work up the energy to check that claim. I think that my 2 reasons for calling this a "good link" still stand. More importantly, as many conservatives have found out the hard way, many libertarians will be <i>very</i> offended if you call them conservative; some of them can get quite energetic on the topic. (Luckily for us, Burton <a href="http://rightreason.ektopos.com/burton.html" class="external text" title="http://rightreason.ektopos.com/burton.html" rel="nofollow">describes himself as "conservative/libertarian"</a>. Whew!) The current description of this link is not very informative, but has the decided advantage of being short.</dd>

<p><br />
<b>YES, Should reference that page</b>: Leiter is largely notable for his online presence. His back and forth with xoxohth.com is a well know episone that has helped define that presence. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 20:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Chittleborough. Most of what you posted is factually inaccurate (I searched Leiter's blog, he did not say the site was anti-semitic; also no evidence that fans of Leiter coordinated any campaign, you've just made this up) and irrelevant (comments by some anonymous college and high school students in an obscure chat room not encyclopedic). There was also no "back and forth," and the episode is not well-known (I am longtime reader of Leiter's blog, had never heard of this discussion board), though you are trying to make it well-known. Stop defacing this article, which thanks mostly to Chris's efforts is now fairly good--a philosophy student</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have provided a reference for that statement. <a href="http://www.autoadmit.com/leiter.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.autoadmit.com/leiter.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>Adding information that is perhaps somewhat unflattering to Leiter is not "defacing" the article. --a law student. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 20:42, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But the dispute between Leiter and xoxohth is real and was a source of major publicity -- why don't you just take out the statements you think are untrue (i think his statements do amount to acusing the site of being anti-semitic, by the way)?

<dd>It appears to have happened over a year ago, if that's what you mean by real. And perhaps students on this board thought this was "major publicity." But this discussion board seems to have had its own Wiki entry deleted. Not everything that happened is encyclopedic. The entry already includes a link to a critique of leiter's blogging, which is more relevant to the entry.
<dl>
<dd>Yet there is very limited informatin in this article about Brian Leiter's law school ranking activities, which is perhaps the activity for which he is best known (in terms of quantity of people). If the very controversy for which Leiter is best known is non-notable, then maybe in fact Leiter himself is non-notable (not all profs are notable). Alas, since "[n]ot everything that happened is encyclopedic", perhaps this article itself should be nominated for AFD. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 21:23, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't much about his law school rankings, though I sometimes read his law school blog. But Interestingstuffadder is not adding anything about the law school ranking, but a link to some pretty sick discussion board. It's totally silly to say that Leiter's "law school ranking is perhaps the activity for which he is best known." What is the evidence? Some prelaw students maybe know mainly about that, but he is much better known probably for his philosophy rankings (which have been in the New York Times and other major publications), for his blog, and for some of his books, like The Future of Philosophy, which was reviewed in The Economist not long ago. By the way, his philosophy rankings have their own entry on Wiki.

It seems extremely reasonable to believe that way more Americans care about law school rankings than the nuances of hgih-end philosophical thought or rankings of philosophy graduate programs. Moreover, I am more than OK with you modifying the reference to this discussion board -- as I have said repeatedly, you are free to edit this seciton as long as something about Leiter's law school ranking activities and some detail about the controversy they have generated remains. If you look at my comments, unregistered user, I have repeatedly sought compromise on this issue and have sought to be reasonable.

<dd>OK, I'll bite (even though I didn't delete the Right Reason item, but I kind of agree with some of those anons who did). You "claim" it is a "substantive critique"? How so? What is the substance of the critique?
<dl>
<dd>I see the post as an attempt to demonstrate that Prof. L's "incivility" is counter-productive, because it "succeeds <i>only</i> in making one look like a supercilious jerk" (emphasis added). Burton says the BL would be more persuasive if he relied on well-constructed arguments instead of snappy ad-homs, with the additional benefit of not leaving himself open to similar attacks (and charges of hypocrisy, I guess) when he (as is practically inevitable for such a prolific writer) makes the kind of mistakes he criticises others for.</dd>
<dd>(As you probably can tell, I'm <del>interested in</del> <i>fascinated by</i> the meta-discourse about how to conduct political discussions.

I've seen plenty of righties chasing "traitors" away from internet forums and plenty of left-wingers making good arguments, but the aphorism does seem to have <i>some</i> validity. You can see some of the same dynamics at play within the U.S. Democrat party. There are lots of interesting and important questions. Is BL's no-bullshit approach more effective than being "civil"? Should we decide between these approaches on the basis of utility, or is civility good in itself? Etc, Etc.)</dd>

<dd>I am with earlier editors, this Right Reason link doesn't illuminate issue you raise above. BL has arguments about when and why persuasion is effective, and nothing in Burton tirade is responsive to any of that. It's just a long list of insults. The comments illuminate nothing of substance, as it appears to be a personal dispute between former friends. It really isn't encyclopedic to include this kind of personal dispute in the entry. Kerr's response is substantive, so I vote with the others in favor of that against Burton. Chris, I also see others have raised before issue of your bias against BL.

<dd>First you said on July 6 that the Right Reason link should be removed if someone could find another link. Someone found another (much more) substantive link (to Kerr), which is an actual critique of BL's blogging style. Now you insist that there should be two critiques of Leiter's blogging, including the Right Reason link which several editors have found irrelevant or obscure. What does it "illuminate"? It reads like a smear, which supports the worry expressed early on about your bias. Since BL's post on blogging indicates he does not aim to persuade, how could a blog entry which argues he'd be more persuasive if he adopted a different rhetorical style even be relevant? And what do the comments on the RR post illuminate? That Burton hurt BL's feelings? That two old friends made the bad decision to have a quarrel on a blog site? How could that be relevant. Third, the earlier version of this link made no mention of the comments, and Burton was correctly described as a right-wing Blogger. You've now removed all that (as you did with Kerr) to make it look like this is some kind of neutral critique, which it is not, and that BL is responding to the critique, which he is not.</dd>

<dd>Looking at Wiki entries on other prominent law bloggers (Volokh, Reynolds) I see no links to critiques of them at all in their entries, even though there are many such critiques on blogs. The only difference is they are on the right, and BL is on the left. This again suggests you really just have it in for BL. (I notice you edited the Reynolds entry. Why didn't you add critiques of Reynolds?) What is your interest in BL? What is your connection to law or philosophy? I join with an earlier editor on this page who said you seem to lack a NPV. But whether you are committed to neutrality or not, you have failed to respond to the arguments against the Right Reason link given, and you must stop re-inserting it again and again, especially now that someone met your earlier request to find a substantive critique. BL's blogging style is not a very interesting topic, even if it is interesting to you.</dd>
