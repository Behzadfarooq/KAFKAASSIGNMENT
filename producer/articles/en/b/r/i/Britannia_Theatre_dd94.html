<p>Samuel Haycraft Lane was born in <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lympstone.html" title="Lympstone">Lympstone</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon.html" title="Devon">Devon</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1803.html" title="1803">1803</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/2/1821.html" title="1821">1821</a> he decided to escape the life of a fisherman and walk to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. After living hand to mouth and educating himself, with the help of a friend, William Brian, he encountered a troupe of actors who he had previously met on his journey. He helped the leader of the troupe, Jack Adams, to find premises for performance at the Union Tavern in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoreditch.html" title="Shoreditch">Shoreditch</a>. This hall catered for 500 seated and a similar number standing. Jack Adam's company performed a successful programme of drama, song, dance and acrobatics. Sam married Jack's daughter Mary, in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1835.html" title="1835">1835</a>.</p>
<p>The troupe always had ambitions to perform serious drama, and in <a href="../../../1/8/3/1839.html" title="1839">1839</a>, the company performed <a href="../../../o/t/h/Othello.html" title="Othello">Othello</a>, breaking the law on theatrical performance, as they were not a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_theatre.html" title="Patent theatre">Patent theatre</a>. Lane lost his licence and paid a substantial fine.<sup id="_ref-making_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[3]</a></sup> With the increase in London's population, and the increasing popularity of live entertainment, the law was finally changed with the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatres_Act_1843_344b.html" title="Theatres Act 1843">Theatres Act 1843</a>.</p>
<p>In 1840, Lane and his colleagues thought they had identified a loophole whereby performances could be offered without charge, with profits made from the sale of programmes, food and drink. The Britannia Tavern in Hoxton was identified as suitable premises. This was the former <i>Pimlico</i> tea gardens, an <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_era.html" title="Elizabethan era">Elizabethan</a> tavern and had a large hall attached. The <i>Royal Britannia Saloon and Brittania Tavern</i> was opened on <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Monday_c76d.html" title="Easter Monday">Easter Monday</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a> by Sam Lane. The theatre was a success. Sadly, private life was more difficult, Mary became pregnant, and slipped and fell at a rehearsal, both she and the baby died.<sup id="_ref-making_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-making" title="">[3]</a></sup> By <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a> having purchased the leases of surrounding properties, the theatre was rebuilt in larger form, with 3000 seats, designed by Finch Hill.</p>
<p>The Britannia had a resident dramatist, C.H. Hazlewood, who wrote many melodramatic spectacles for the theatre, often based on successful novels of the time, including an adaptation of <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Audley%27s_Secret_7fef.html" title="Lady Audley's Secret">Lady Audley's Secret</a> (1863).</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> was a frequent visitor to the theatre, and noted in the <i>Commercial Traveller</i> (<a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Magnificently lighted by a firmament of sparkling chandeliers, the building was ventilated to perfection. The air of this theatre was fresh, cool and wholesome. It has been constructed from the ground to the roof, with a careful reference to sight and sound in every corner, the result is that its form is beautiful and that the appearance of the audience as seen from the proscenium with every face in it commanding the stage and the whole is so admirably raked and turned to that centre, and is highly remarkable in its union of vastness and compactness. The stage itself and all its appurtenances of machinery, cellarage, height and breadth are on a scale more like the Scala at Milan or the Grand Opera at Paris than any notion a stranger would be likely to form of the Britannia Theatre at Hoxton, a mile north of St Luke’s Hospital in the Old Street Road. “The Forty Thieves” might be played here and every thief ride his real horse; and the disguised captain bring in his oil jars on a train of real camels and nobody be put out of the way. This really extraordinary place is an achievement of one man’s enterprise and was erected on the ruins of an inconvenient old building in less than five months at a round cost of five and twenty thousand pounds</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>A review of <i>King Doo-Dah</i>, the Christmas pantomime, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, at the Britannia Theatre, appeared in the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Biggest, brightest best, and jolliest pantomime ever produced at "The Brit," is the Hoxtonian verdict upon Mr. Crauford's latest Christmas production, King Doo-Dah. Indeed, the fourteen scenes that are utilised in telling the story are so full of good things that it would be quite impossible to do justice to them in the space at our command. The ever-popular Albert and Edmunds troupe, assisted by Mr. Fred Lawrence and the Montrose Bros., very clever and humorous acrobats, keep the fun at boiling point from start to finish. Mr. H.G. Sharplin made an imposing figure as Cerberus, his magnificent voice delighting the vast audience. Miss Josephine Henley looked a dapper little Prince, and Miss Emmie Ames a charming Princess. Her first song, "Matilda," in which she introduces several mechanical toys with excellent effect, brought down the house. Miss Lily Sharplin's imitations of Marie Collins, Bessie Wentworth, and Billie Barlow, were the best we have seen. The same young lady also fetched the audience with a clever descriptive song, "The Language London Talks." The Imperial Russian Troupe of Singers and Dancers are an innovation in pantomime. Their singing and dancing were so excellent that they scored one of the greatest successes of the evening. Miss Emma Chambers, as a high-class domestic, was quaint and humorous, and Miss Kate Sharplin sang sweetly as Titania. In fact, there was not a mediocre character in the whole show. The flying ballet, concluding with a shower of gold, was really magnificent, as was the grand transformation scene. The pantomime does the greatest credit to the talents of the Britannia's popular stage manager, Mr. Bigwood, and is a distinct score for Mr. Crauford.</i><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Britannia theatre was unique amongst theatres of the time, for a number of reasons. Entry to the entertainment was always cheap, the income was made from sales of food and drink. There was an extra-ordinary continuity of management, the theatre was in the hands of the same family throughout its lifetime. The theatre also nurtured talent, many of the regular artistes were taken on at an early stage in their careers and remained with the theatre until retirement.</p>

<p>The Lupinos were a theatrical family whose scion arrived in England in 1620, as a penniless refugee. George William Lupino was a puppetter and the family continued to earn a theatrical living. One of his descendants, George Hook Lupino (1820–1902) was associated with the Britannia, performing in leading roles and taking the role of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlequin.html" title="Harlequin">Harlequin</a> in pantomine. A prolific man, reputed to have had 16 children, many became singers, dancers and actors, receiving their first experience in the company. The eldest son, George (1853–1932) became both a clown and a prominent actor, amongst his grandchildren was the Hollywood actress Ida Lupino. <a href="../../../l/u/p/Lupino_Lane_fab4.html" title="Lupino Lane">Lupino Lane</a> was the son of Harry Charles Lupino (1825–1925), a favourite of Sarah Lane and pursued a career in films.<sup id="_ref-Craxford_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Craxford" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
