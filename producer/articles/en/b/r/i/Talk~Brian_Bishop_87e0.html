<p>I don't want to be rude, but this seems to read more like a memorial than an encyclopedic article. I don't think this case has the prominence in history that, for example, the Yvonne Fletcher shooting has, so I am questioning the value of its inclusion. I'm not saying that this article should necessarily be deleted, but in its current form it comprises of mainly unremarkable information. I also have a major problem with this line:</p>
<p>"The aim of the trust is to erect memorials to police officers killed in the line of duty, on the spot where they met their death, thereby acting as a permanent reminder – to the public they serve – of their sacrifice"</p>
<p>This language is too emotive - specifically the last bit. It is inappropriate in the context of a wikipedia article. Will be editing this. 194.202.43.43 16:07, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is about Brian Bishop. The following sentence:</p>
<p>'The trust's objective is to erect memorials to British police officers killed in the line of duty, on the spot where they met their death, thereby acting as a permanent reminder – to the public they served – of the sacrifice they made.'</p>
<p>is about the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_Memorial_Trust_d75a.html" title="Police Memorial Trust">Police Memorial Trust</a>. It is also, more or less, copied straight from the PMT's page. In the interests clarity and quality, and also to save wikipedia's server space, articles should not lose focus of their subjects, and should not repeat information from other pages. The use of an internal link should suffice in this case.</p>
<p>Further to this, I still believe the language is not well chosen. Words like 'sacrifice' and references to 'serving the public', are emotive and POV.</p>
<p>And finally, it is not a very well constructed sentence. It is clunky, and flows badly. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeerathon_3766.html" title="User:Beerathon">Beerathon</a> 12:42, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I concur with the opinion - with all due respect to a man serving the community, the only noteworthy part left is PMT monument. The rest applies to all people bearing the burden of being a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officer.html" title="Police officer">police officer</a>.

<dd>I'm undecided about the current proposal to merge the Brian Bishop article with the PMT article.

<dd>I've been through Yvonne Fletcher's article before making this proposal but to me it seems like apples to oranges. Her murder is the first policewoman down on duty, got much more publicity, contributed to tensions between two governments, and is even subject to controversy. I cannot understand "many murder victims" part - someone being just murdered does not become automatically notable. Unfortunately too many citizens across the globe are murdered every single day, and the goal of Wikipedia (as far as I understand it) is not to keep information about all of them. Certainly I cannot agree to put all of them under a common denominator. It seems that I am failing to convince you, and you still haven't changed my opinion. -- <a href="../../../b/g/g/User%7EBggoldie_f821.html" title="User:Bggoldie">Goldie</a> <a href="../../../b/g/g/User_talk%7EBggoldie_cb8a.html" title="User talk:Bggoldie">(tell me)</a> 18:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK <a href="../../../b/g/g/User%7EBggoldie_f821.html" title="User:Bggoldie">Goldie</a> you've made a good point about Yvonne Fletcher. I don't understand what you meant by <i>not</i> agreeing "to put all of them under a common denominator", however. Surely, that's exactly what your merger proposal is designed to achieve. But what about my idea of merging the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Police_Memorial_28b2.html" title="National Police Memorial">National Police Memorial</a> into the PMT article, if the merger of Brian Bishop goes ahead?<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhase4_5fdb.html" title="User:Phase4">Phase4</a> 19:21, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"common denominator" was aimed against "many victims". For me the latter was just a shot in the universe. Everyone's murder is different, and here we see the difference between Yvonne Fletcher and Brian Bishop for example. Some victims are notable, others are less notable, while many unfortunately just fill the statistics. Sorry, I missed your merger suggestion as I haven't read the PMT talk but do agree. There is no problem in putting more than one {{mergefrom}} template in an article. I'll copy my objections against Yvonne Fletcher's merger there. -- <a href="../../../b/g/g/User%7EBggoldie_f821.html" title="User:Bggoldie">Goldie</a> <a href="../../../b/g/g/User_talk%7EBggoldie_cb8a.html" title="User talk:Bggoldie">(tell me)</a> 20:40, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Believe me, a police officer being murdered is big news in Britain. It's a very rare occurence. Most domestic murder victims probably don't deserve their own pages, but murdered police officers certainly do. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I truly believe you but I've tried to point out that the only fame for Mr. Bishop comes from the murder alone. Inclusion is a list of murdered policemen/women might be a solution. If it is rare indeed, the list ought to be short. Anyway I would try to reiterate that <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a memorial</a>, and if there is nothing more besides being a public servant and rare murder victim Mr. Bishop cannot fit in my understanding of notability. -- <a href="../../../b/g/g/User%7EBggoldie_f821.html" title="User:Bggoldie">Goldie</a> <a href="../../../b/g/g/User_talk%7EBggoldie_cb8a.html" title="User talk:Bggoldie">(tell me)</a> 21:11, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I fear we must agree to disagree. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. If you remove Bishop then you must surely, for consistency's sake, remove all other murder victims unless they were notable as and of themselves. That's quite a few articles! All <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>'s victims for a start - they certainly were only notable for being murdered. Are you brave enough to propose that as well? Normally, I would say that murder victims should redirect to the article about the murderer. However, in this case, the victim is better known than the killer, so the article should be kept. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 23:08, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Fully agree on both points - obviously we are lacking consensus, and all other murder victims should be evaluated against their real notability. Certainly all Jack the Ripper's victims fail on this subject and their encyclopaedic value is just in the list. I have no time for a crusade against all murder victims articles but would support any similar merger nomination. -- <a href="../../../b/g/g/User%7EBggoldie_f821.html" title="User:Bggoldie">Goldie</a> <a href="../../../b/g/g/User_talk%7EBggoldie_cb8a.html" title="User talk:Bggoldie">(tell me)</a> 18:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
