<p>I added a section on the Catholic themes of the novel. The previous version of the page was a bit unbalanced. The main theme seems to be Catholicism, yet the page only had 2 sentences to about this. On the other hand, it had 900 words under Gay Themes, which is a minor theme of the book. I got the content from this audio of a Catholic TV network: <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/vondemand/audio/seriessearchprog.asp?seriesID=6602&amp;T1=" class="external free" title="http://www.ewtn.com/vondemand/audio/seriessearchprog.asp?seriesID=6602&amp;T1=" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/vondemand/audio/seriessearchprog.asp?seriesID=6602&amp;T1=</a> --<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENino_Gonzales_a8be.html" title="User:Nino Gonzales">Nino Gonzales</a> 09:48, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The most important section I think is missing: a discussion of Brideshead Revisited as a novel. I think this should be the longest section (it's supposed to be a literary masterpiece). Maybe followed by one or two sentences on the Catholic angle and a line or two on the gay controversy. --<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENino_Gonzales_a8be.html" title="User:Nino Gonzales">Nino Gonzales</a> 08:38, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I rewrote the gay section. Here are some data that I deleted. They sound interesting but don’t seem to be pertinent to the article. Many of them seem to try to explain the general view of homosexuality at the time of the writing of the novel. I think these details make the article unbalanced. The relationship between Charles and Sebastian is after all a minor theme. (But even with these deletions, it is still one of the longest sections of the article). Maybe these would be useful for an article on how homosexuality was viewed in the early 20th century in England.</p>
<ul>
<li>Waugh's own brother Alec Waugh had caused considerable controversy by writing of homosexual conduct between English public school boys in in his autobiographical work The Loom of Youth</li>
<li>some later editions of the book (written between 1940 and 1943) published postwar excise passages making mention of eugenics or degeneracy as taboo in the wake of Hitler's Final Solution.</li>
<li>Lord Marchmain's character was based upon the Earl Beauchamp, who was outed as a homosexual to George VI by his cousin, the Duke of Westminster.</li>
<li>One theory that seems to find some degree of concurrence is that Sebastian is driven to drink at least in part by uncertainty regarding his sexuality and possibly (though this view is far less widely-agreed) out of despair at Charles' increasing attachment to his family, which indeed he specifically foreshadows early in the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>I retained most of the original data. However, all of them do not have sources. To whoever wrote them: it would be great if you could cite your sources&#160;:) --<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENino_Gonzales_a8be.html" title="User:Nino Gonzales">Nino Gonzales</a> 08:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really think the fact that "Lord Marchmain's character was based upon the Earl Beauchamp, &amp; was outed as a homosexual to George VI by his cousin, the Duke of Westminster" should have stayed, and information on the novel being mentioned in cartoons and situation comedies on American television should go. Like Lord Marchmain, Earl Beauchamp (Who was the man about whom the King, horrified, said ("I thought men like that shot themselves) went into exile on the Continent. After Beauchamp's daughter Sibell Rowley died in October 2005, many things previously unsaid were at last uttered: this was the family that inspired Brideshead Revisited; the 3rd daugther was an alcoholic; the younger Dorothy had an unfortunate late marriage to Robert Heber "Mad Boy" Percy, former boyfriend of Lord Berners. The daughters were aware of their father's nocturnal prowlings, and would warn their boyfriends to lock their bedroom doors. Problems became more serious, involving incidents with footmen; the campaign mounted by the Duke of Westminster drove Beauchamp into exile.(Though it is not clear the Duke ever made his wife, the Earls sister, understand the actual problem: "Bendor says that Beauchamp is a bugler" [sic] , she once said.) - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 06:04, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- The gay section still is longer than any other. Sebastian's character is absent for much of the book, after all, noone has really written about Julia, Rex or Lord Brideshead yet.</p>
<p>-- What on earth is the problem with you people? It was a romantic friendship between men (rather intensely romantic, but still). It's very simple. It doesn't have any connection with sexual behaviour between men. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 10:36, August 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- Have just reduced the length of this section, which was rather poorly composed, without effecting the content. Agree with above that this is better contextualised in terms of early 20th Century British attitudes towards homosexuality, rather hope someone will do this. If not, I'll give it a go.

<p>This is a pretty good little article. Well balanced, covers everything, not too long nor tooshort. Personally I think BR is rather like a pavlova - pretty and sweet and ultimately not very nutritious - but nevertheless let's recognise the merit of this addition to Wikidom.</p>

<p>I added a picture of the dust jacket, and a sentence or two to the opening about what Waugh felt the book was about. Going straight to information about the TV adaptation seems to overlook that it is primarily a novel. thewikiman</p>

<p>The section header itself seems to be POV. Could anyone think of a header that captures what seems to be the nostalgia for England's age of nobility? It seems the Marchmain family represents the last of a dying breed.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENino_Gonzales_a8be.html" title="User:Nino Gonzales">Nino Gonzales</a> 02:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone agree that Charle's Sturrage's TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited deserves a seperate article of its own? I know it's widely considered one of the high watermarks of independent British TV and I personally think it would be good to have a more through article on it. I'd create one myself but unfortunately my capabilities on Wikipedia are somewhat limited, but if anyone agrees and could create the article I'd be happy to flesh it out.</p>

<p>I wikified the categories in the article. As of March 15 2007, they were broken. I'm not sure whether all of these categories should be retained, but I'll leave it to y'all to make a decision on that. Cheers! --82.207.201.138 17:00, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just for completeness: In my edit, I also removed the following text which stood forlornly at the end of the article (after the links), without any proper purpose, as I feel.</dd>
