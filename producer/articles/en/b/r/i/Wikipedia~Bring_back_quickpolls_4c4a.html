<li>I was in favor of quickpolls before and I still am. They are far from perfect, but the idea behind them is basically sound: a simple way to determine community opinion about behavior. It is a lot harder to protest a block that has community consensus than it is to protest one done on the basis of a single sysop's opinion or interpretation. In short they are a reasonable and fair way to clarify ambiguities of circumstance where policy does not yet suffice. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:31, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If I become an admin and I've just blocked someone, then someone else tries to start a block war, I'll block everyone involved, then unblock myself, then start a quickpoll. A consensus needs to be reached if block wars are to be avoided. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Gall_cc1f.html" title="User:Scott Gall">Scott Gall</a> 09:44, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd support trying quickpolls again, although it doesn't look like it'll happen. The main problem before, IMO, was that virtually all of them were for 3RR violations, with the intent of imposing slap-on-the-hand blocks. I think they would useful as a way of showing quick consensus in the face of a user who is clearly being an ass. One of the problems with Wikipedia now is that if you come across someone being unreasonable, it's hard to say "look, you need to stop" because it's just you against them. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 16:35, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> I don't like to be influenced by people in the oppose section. I will vote for I believe to be the best solution. All the people from the Abtri. Commitee are not suprisingly voting in the oppose section, and that was expected. I believe that a quickpoll will: 1) Give a better say from different groups of Wikipedians regardless of ethical background, ages, intellect etc. (The current group in the Attri. commitee are all whites, not to be racist or anything). 2) Provide consistentcy with the way the Wikipedians votes for things such as RFA, VFD. 3) The role of Attri. Commitee is for last resort disputes, Quickpolls is a lower level and will ease the burden. 4) RFC is usually long, and there are lots of comments and arguments and will take much longer to make a decision then that of a concise and get-to-the-point quickpoll. 5) RFC is probably for article disputes and not the actions of a Wikipedian, these two should be seperated from each other, as they are different - just like the way we seperate Article and Wikipedia/User namespace. 6) Some accuse quickpolls of failing, there is somethings that should be given another go, and this is it.. 7) Certain members of the ArbCom would be biased and prone to say that there is nothing wrong with the current system... but there is something broken (too long, too much wikipolitics, long time to answer) thats why we need to fix it. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquash_39ff.html" title="User:Squash">Squash</a> 23:11, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../n/s/h/User%7ENsh_1e42.html" title="User:Nsh">nsh</a> - "For every problem there is a solution that is simple, easy and wrong". Quickpolls may be intended as a way of settling disputes without resorting to abritation, but they will be (have been?) used to avoid making the effort to reach consensus in the first place. If everyone plays the game and puts the work in, consensus can be achieved most of the time. Let's not give more excuses for people not to. <a href="../../../n/s/h/User%7ENsh_1e42.html" title="User:Nsh">nsh</a> 04:33, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quickpolls generally worked horribly. It mostly resulted in uneven treatment, popularity contests, and witchhunts. I firmly oppose reinstatement of quickpolls. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:30, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quickpolls were a stopgap solution that failed dismally. In times when an arbitration case takes an average of ten days (and brings a permanent, rather than temporary, action with it), they're particularly unnecessary. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 05:49, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Quickpolls were tried as an experiment. The experiment failed in the eyes of many and was not continued. Bringing quickpolls back without modification will undoubtedly fail again. Even modified, bringing them back under the same name would probably be enough to doom a new experiment. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 05:55, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>These were before my time, but looking at the archived polls, the whole process seems to have devolved into tit-for-tat retaliation amongst a small group of combatants. Concentrating on the punitive measures was the problem, not the open comment-gathering. So I guess I prefer RfC, et al. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 06:54, 2005 Mar 11 (UTC)</li>
<li>In my opinion Arbcom seems to do a good job, and if you don't want worry them, you can use RfC. It is not limited to the article disputes. --<a href="../../../a/p/h/User%7EAphaia_616a.html" title="User:Aphaia"><font color="midnightblue">Aphaea</font></a><a href="../../../a/p/h/User_talk%7EAphaia_0eb7.html" title="User talk:Aphaia"><font color="gold">*</font></a> 08:27, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weakly opposed. I quite liked quickpolls at the time, but I think things have changed since: the 3RR is now (fairly) well enforced; the arbcomm process is quite rapid; RFCs exist for both user and content disputes. Its not really clear to me what lack Quickpolls are filling (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 14:09, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)).</li>
<li>Wikipedia would need a process to solve disputes on texts, not disputes between "individuals". Besides, this proposal is far too vague to be supported. --<a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrjung_40b8.html" title="User:Ruhrjung">Ruhrjung</a> 15:05, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, they produce more chaos than they're worth are likely to harden attitudes and encourage groupthink. A RFC is more wikilike, and since admins now have power to enforce the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> and deal with <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">simple vandalism</a>, I don't see any reason to introduce yet another mechanism that would take effort from RFC's. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:29, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe that reintroducing quick polls would lead to more problems than they would solve. The dispute resolution process could probably be tweaked a bit, but it seems to be working well. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 15:52, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I fail to see any serious problems with the current way of doing things, and while I wasn't involved in policy back when Quickpolls were happening, I have some doubts that the mechanism as described, or any simple variation on it, would be a good thing. With the current setup, we at least have good trust that blocking follows policy. I doubt quickpolls would ensure that consistency as well as the current way of doing things. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 18:30, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, let's have another method of backbiting and avoiding working to build consensus. It's also already practically impossible for a minority to be heard.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:28, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I wasn't around when the quickpolls were in use, but judging from the quickpoll history, and common sense, I think that these could be used to harass and block unpopular, but law-abiding users. Also, I think the rules for de-sysopping are too lax, and could be used to start a "witchhunt" for admins. Conclusion: Quickpolls have the potential to be dangerous to the Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche">Bratsche</a> <sup><font color="orange"><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche">(talk)</a></font></sup> 04:42, Mar 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think ArbCom are doing a fine job at the moment. I think quick polls, from what I understand of them, will be highjacked to continue conflicts and hound out unpopular users, they're more trouble than they're worth.

<li>I'd agree with <a href="../../../c/g/r/User%7ECgranade_5621.html" title="User:Cgranade">Cgranade</a> for now. I saw some of the quickpolls and what went on with them. A lot of the problems occured with people just teaming up on others, and there were also problems with individuals that would participate without much previous knowledge. On the other hand, they were useful at points, and they did have their benefits. I guess the system needs more work, but the time needed to fix everything might not warrant the other benefits to the situation. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyApocalypse_073f.html" title="User:HolyApocalypse">HolyApocalypse</a> | <a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHolyApocalypse_5698.html" title="User talk:HolyApocalypse">talk</a> | 02:51, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's an intriguing idea. However, as is greatly acknowledged above, the origninal quick polls did have severe flaws. On the other hand a reformed version of quick polls could supplement the ArbCom and bring more minds together for a solution. It is important to strick a balace. We don't want mob rule but we don't want elitism either, and as long as we have the current arbitrators, eletism won't be a problem; but they won't be around forever. -<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 06:57, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see this as a <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolution.html" title="Devolution">devolution</a>-of-power/tyranny of the majority issue.

<dd>The old quickpoll was sloppy and the process was ill-defined. Before a quickpoll is set up, there should be designated abstaining users to check against trolls and sockpuppets. Quickpolls are not meant for long-term problems which, in all logic, <i>should</i> be referred to the ArbCom. As long as the policies for quickpolls remain stringent, the populace should, in theory, not be able to commandeer the vote. Besides, quickpoll access was limited to users who had been registered for a specific amount of time. This should be extant. About bad faith, that is not something that people outside the voter's head can determine without clear indication of bias toward the parties. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian"><font color="green"><big>R</big>yan!</font></a> | <a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian"><font color="orange">Talk</font></a> 05:03, Mar 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
