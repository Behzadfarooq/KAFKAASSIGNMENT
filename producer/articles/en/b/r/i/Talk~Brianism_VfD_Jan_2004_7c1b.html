<li>Brianism - nonsense, exists only in this article and on the website cited. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 18:48, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)

<li>No vote, FYI: Our <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">God</a> says 92 hits for "Brianism". A number of these hits come from Wikipedia and sites that use Wikipedia as a source. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">Optim</a> 20:39, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. I know a bunch of Brianists and my brother claims to be one. As a Christian I think it is not to be encouraged, but it seems to exist and there was a film about it. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 11:50, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That film (if you're thinking of Python) is NOT linked with the Brianism discussed in this article. BTW, the Brianists are essentially the only religion I find I can agree with that actually holds beliefs (unlike the Unitarians or Taoists, who really have none) <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">.</a> 05:25, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)

<li>The real Taoists are very advanced mystics and are respected. However, most people who label themselves Taoists are just stupid and have no idea on what Tao is and how to work with it. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">Optim</a> 06:19, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. I am a Brianist and Skeptic. We do exist you know! I'm not that interested in Wikipedia. It's main claim to fame as far as I am concerned is that it appears at the top in Google when you search Brianism. It would not be a problem for me if Brianism did not appear in Wikipedia at all. Much of what you have about Brianism (and other subjects) is not particularly accurate anyway, and Wikipedia is not nearly as important as you seem to think it is.

</li>
<li>and so on... I would also note that two sock-puppets are voting in favour of this page, a strong sign of a spoof.

<li>Just a thought. How do we know these are sock puppets and not just users who created accounts for the first time to make their feelings known? And didn't Christian Soldier vote <i>against</i>? The only sure way would be to know the IP numbers. Can a sysop retrieve these please?

<li>If this anon contrib'r is not another sock puppet (who already knows the IPs are carefully dispersed), they should now retroactively sign that comment, indicating the time stamp to make it easy to verify. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a> 20:07, 2004 Jan 12 (UTC)</li>
<li>It was me. Sorry, forgot to sign. What do you mean by "IPs are carefully dispersed"? How would one set about doing that? I would be interested to know if they all had the same IP, the same ISP, or perhaps were in different countries completely? A sock puppet must ahve a hand in it and I see no evidence of said hand. <a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 20:22, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. The apparent sockpuppetism and mischief not withstanding, Brianism certainly exists and has many followers. Whether or not it is popular enough to merit an article in WP is a judgment call. I think it does. I can verify that I have been a Brianist for many years and know many other Brianists, in many countries. There is a regular electronic magazine. The main church has offices in Britain in the Empire House building in Mayfair, London. (Any Wikipedians living near there may like to visit and confirm.) I understand that the church also owns other property in the UK and elsewhere. Brianism is represented - very unfairly - as a New Age Cult in the film Bubble Boy. At least this is recognition. The "cult" is grouped for ridicule along with Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism. (Islam escapes mention. Probably they did not dare.) The WBF publishes accounts and had a turnover in the millions last year. The WBF runs its own server farm, together with its own name servers. The WBF provides free hosting to skeptic websites "as a service to humanity" and free e-mail addresses to skeptics and Brianists. The WBF claims 18,000 followers. Personally I think this is a bit high. It may have been true 10 years ago. For some years, Brianists have been lobbying the skeptic movement to adopt the term <i>bright</i> instead of <i>skeptic</i> or <i>debunker</i>. ("Bright and Shiny" is the first sentence in the "Book of Brian".) This has been accepted to some degree by noted skeptics including James Randi and Michael Shermer <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=skeptic+brights&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=skeptic+brights&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Here is a link to a very well respected website <a href="http://www.skeptic-links.org/brianism.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skeptic-links.org/brianism.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I'll find some more when I get a moment. Contrary to received WP wisdom, not everything is in Google! All of of the above can easily be verified with a little research - or you can take my word for it based upon my previous behavior and ethical conduct at WP. In conclusion, this harmless little article on an admittedly small movement is accurate and does no harm. It seems an inappropriate target for VfD when so many nonsensical and minority articles are tolerated in WP. Do the right thing people. <a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 17:32, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ah. That would be the domain with the apprently false domain registration information then, unless the admin and tech contacts are really called "Rex Mundi" and "Gloria Mundi"? Note that the "very well respected website" you are citing, <a href="http://www.skeptic-links.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.skeptic-links.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skeptic-links.org/</a>, is hosted at the same IP address as <a href="http://www.brianism.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.brianism.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brianism.org/</a>, apparently by the "WBF". Rather than running their own server farm, they appear to be customers of Affinity Dedicated, according to RIPE. The address and telephone number given is of a "business centre" (<a href="http://www.mayfairoffice.com/contact.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mayfairoffice.com/contact.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayfairoffice.com/contact.html</a>) which offers mail redirection as one of its services. Please let me know if this has become a temple, so I can go there in person and check it out. For a "cyber religion", Brianism is remarkably absent from Usenet or mailing lists. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 18:02, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I stand corrected on the London office. Certainly that is the address we use. I did not know it was a business center, but the use of such is surely evidence Brianism exists, rather than that it does not? Affinity Dedicated owns the IP addresses, which is not surprising, since they own the data center where the servers are located. Don't confuse network IP ownership with hardware or domain ownership please. Since WBF offers free hosting to skeptic websites, why would you be surprised to find one hosted there? I know the persons Rex and Gloria Mundi. Rex was my mentor when I joined the movement. I must admit these names are aliases, but then so are Anjouli and The Anome. You do not address the other matters, which I find telling. Perhaps you think they are also spurious? Please check them out and tell me what you find. There is a regular mailing list, but it is not public - and Usenet is for nerds and perverts. There are likely many Brianists who would rush to the cause to defend the movement, but no doubt they would be dismissed as sock-puppets unless they were already long-standing editors. If we are judging by numbers, how many of the world's many millions of Muslims got involved in the Mecca/Makkah argument? Perhaps three or four? I'm amazed so many (apparent) Brianists have already jumped in to this argument. It does not particularly matter if WP deletes Brianism whilst retaining many trivial and nonsensical articles - Brianism will carry in as before - but it would be a great shame.<a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 18:49, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. Wikipedia exists to document things that already exist, not to advertise things that somebody hopes would exist.

<li>This is a reasoned viewpoint. It may well be that Brianism is too obscure to merit a WP article and that is a view I would reluctantly accept if held by the majority. However it is not "Inconsequential nonsense", nor do I accept the forcing of a viewpoint by proactive and unilateral deletion of the material under discussion before the prescribed time period has elapsed. I am sickened by the lack of support for this point of view. I would have thought even those who felt the article should be deleted would have supported me in this. Is this what passes for reasoned discussion in WP? I seriously consider whether I want to have further involvement withthis project.<a href="../../../a/n/j/User%7EAnjouli_71d8.html" title="User:Anjouli">Anjouli</a> 20:38, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<hr />
<p>Anjouli, I'm just seeking evidence, as any good skeptic would.</p>
<ul>
<li>Point one: "For some years, Brianists have been lobbying the skeptic movement to adopt the term bright instead of skeptic or debunker." You appear to be claiming that the "Brianist movement" is behind the use of the term "Brights"? Evidence please?</li>
<li>Point two: the "Book of Brian" is not available online, as far as I can see. Not on the "brianism" website. Not anywhere on the web (based on searching for "book of Brian" and the text published as a "sura" from the "book". Not on Usenet. This is pretty strange, for an organization that claims to be promoting this world-view, "claims 18,000 followers" and claims that the electronic text is the primary text. Most belief systems seek to publish their works widely. Can you show evidence of this, or explain why this is not the case?</li>
<li>Point three: the site says "Each month we publish a verse from the book of Brian, together with a commentary on its meaning". Not according to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which finds the same text cited for February 20 2003, June 21 2003, and today. For a worldwide organization with thousands of members, there's apparently not much activity on their website. Can you explain this?</li>
<li>Point four: You state that the Brianism organization is ten years old, i.e. dates back to 1994. That's strange, because the domain name <i>brianism.org</i> was only registered in 2000, according to the .ORG registrar. Evidence please?</li>
<li>Can you explain what kind of legal entity the "World Brianism Association", cited in the registration for <i>brianism.org</i>, is? Is is a company, a trust, a charity, a limited partnership, or what? Does it exist at all under UK law? What about U.S. law?

<p>Why bother, since you are clearly going to delete it anyway? But just for the hell of it 1) I have heard this said and it seems a bit of a coincidence if it is not true. I would be interested to hear if you have any alternative theories on the origin of "Bright". Or don't you think that is a real term either? Suggest you <i>ask</i> somebody. If you don't know any skeptics, e-mail a skeptic group. Oh, but not anybody using skeptic-links, because you you don't trust them either do you? 2) The answer to that is on the website. Did you even look at it? There is a clear procedure for releasing verses and you have to move up the tree. 3) WBA is a load of crap anyway. Most serious Brianists have nothing to do with it. Like skepticism (or Christianity) Brianism is not something you <i>join</i>. It is about what you believe. 4) For a long time there WERE no websites. The first one was a Yahoo group, but it dried up after getting a lot of attacks from "Christians" and "Muslims". 5) Don't know and don't care. I have nothing to do with them. I am a skeptic. I believe in transhumanism. I believe in space exploration and the advancement of the human race. I have nothing but contempt for conventional religion, pseudoscience, bigotry, terrorism and nationalism. The label I and others use for that is a Brianist. It's got nothing to do with websites, links and petty bickering over Wikipedia articles. Who cares about Wikipedia? It's full of inconsequential nonsense anyway, and far to unstable to be used for any real research or reference. BrianGuidesUs 12:34, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet.html" title="Sock puppet">sock puppet</a> is in this context. I assume it means somebody pretending to be somebody else to get a double vote. I assure you I am an individual. I have been browsing Wikipedia for a long time, even doing the odd edit. This is the first time I have felt the need to create an account, since it is not possible to vote on VfD without one. I am a Brianist. I have nothing to hide.

<p>you can help me by answering some of my questions above. In particular, the article claims that the "The First Testament of the 'Book of Brian' consists of 6 books of 6 chapters of 6 verses. Each verse is of 4 sentences containing 3, 7, 10 and 18 words" Can you point me to an online copy, or post one here, containing all 216 verses. It shouldn't take long, as you surely have a machine-readable copy, since the <i>brianism.org</i> says that "An interesting attribute of the Book of Brian is that it exists primarily in electronic form. Printed copies of the Book of Brian are considered secondary representations." It's time to show the evidence. Please reply ASAP to dispel any suspicions that you have written the document subsequent to this request. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 12:22, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a clear procedure for the revelation of verses. But just to shut you up I will break a few rules:</p>
<p>Bright and shiny. Out of our chrysalis into the world. We must transcend our past and move forwards into tomorrow. We are the noble vanguard who by our efforts and example will save the universe for the righteous.</p>

<p>Ah. I see: you claim to have evidence to prove your assertions, but you can't show it to anyone because <i>it's a secret</i>. At the same time, no mainstream information source, or Web search demonstrates any proof of the widespread movement as claimed to exist on the website: indeed, the most common Web-based information is this article, a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Unfortunately, this puts "Brianism" in the class of idiosyncratic, non-encylopedic information that does not belong in Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> for more information on this. -- 217.37.214.121 13:02, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have nothing much to add to the above. Most of what I would say has already been said by others. I'm quite prepared to accept the deletion of Brianism if the majority view is that it is not well-known enough.

<p>If you really take Wikipedia seriously then you should delete Brianism. I have analysed all references to Brianism in Google and Yahoo Search, and have arrived at these figures of individual websites referring to B. are:</p>
<p>Websites referring to and acknowledging Brianism.org: 3</p>
<p>Websites referring to and acknowledging Wikipedia: 10</p>
<p>Websites which are jokey (not by any means satirical or skeptical as such but that have pseudo encyclopedias referring to Briangrad capital and Brianism as main religion, or about art events in the 10th millennium, or even discussing various isms such as sandalism, brianism and one-bare-footism and pseudo discussions about brianism in relation to dress: 4</p>
<p>Website totally irrelevant (sex page): 1</p>
<p>Websites of or about people called Brian or O'Brian: 8</p>
<p>Website about anti-Brianism: 1</p>
<p>Website which is commercial, that of a broker quoting one of Brianism's alleged sayings: 1</p>
<p>Frankly, as a Brianist, I'd be a bit embarrassed in the company of some of these people who also call themselves Brianists.</p>
<p>I am sorry but I can't see how Brianism can do Wikipedia any good.<br />

<p>Delete. Dude! What a row. I'm changing my vote to delete because I can see which way the wind's blowing. I'm a newbie and don't want to get a rep as a trouble maker. All the "What's your house" nonsense sounds just like my brother and his stupid friends. If we believe the people here who say they are Brianists that makes BrianGuidesUs (who can count words and type pretty fast if he's making that up as he goes) , Anjouli, Jethro, BMills, 62.3.32.34 and I expect R and M Mundi who own the domain name. My brother and his 3 mates make another 4 I know about. That's ten Brianists. If there are only ten of them, then that's 17,990 missing! My brother says I should join if I want to find out, so I have signed up on the Brianist site this morning but no reply from them yet. (So I guess that's only 17,989 missing!) It's not a bad idea and seems to be about being against pseudoscience, the supernatural and religion and in favour of preserving intelligent life and scientific progress. There is nothing they say that I would not support, but I think they make a mistake in trying to be funny and "cultlike". Might get more support if they were more serious. Hey, Im a Brianist!

I have tried searching Google with some of the text on this site but got no hits, <i>not even this site</i>. My point is how do we know there are not hundreds of sites like this? Any Brianists watching would do well to list them here and somebody could also e-mail the owner of the site that the above page is under (seems to be a pet club in Belgium). Also did anybody watch the film Bubble Boy <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22bubble+boy%22+%22bright+and+shiny%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22bubble+boy%22+%22bright+and+shiny%22" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>?

<li>Re Brianism, I just don't want things to be lost sight of, Del, and the whole page has become so large mainly because of pretty irrelevant and inconsequential items and chat among some members of this group. We are not here as a mouthpiece for a new movement, worthy or otherwise, as an encyclopedia we should be describing what has been created elsewhere and is already in existence as a solid theme independently observed by other people. We should not be assisting the creation of it. That way lies POV and an <i>unfree</i> encyclopedia --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 01:31, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

<p>Anome has now undeleted this. I suggest it be left on VfD for a longer period so that people may change their votes in light of the letter if they want to. Regarding the count - it should be noted that BrianGuidesUs, Jethro and ChristianSoldier had not made any edits previously, and the suggestions that they are sock puppets would lead me to want to discount these from the vote count anyway. Reddi hasn't given any reason for wanting to keep this. Simple keep/delete opinions without reasons aren't very helpful when the aim is to come to some sort of consensus on whether to delete it. This reduces the delete votes to 4. My comment that it violates the verifiability policy should also be taken as a vote to delete, which does bring the % to delete above 66%, though any consensus is still lacking, so I think the vote needs to be left longer than five days. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 23:15, Jan 16, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would be interested to know how I can prove I am not a sock puppet. I have done everything short of post my street-address address and a blood sample.

<p>Go to your homepage at user:BrianGuidesUs. Tell us your real name. Upload a photo of yourself so we know what you look like. Scan your library card or student card or similar, and upload that. Tell us your email address - a proper one, not some disposable yahoo address. If you have a homepage on any other online communities, or a blog, or whatever, link to that place, and edit it to link back to user:BrianGuidesUs. Tell us your snail mail address - work address or home address, either's fine.</p>
<p>You don't have to do that, of course - but if you don't you forfeit your right to complain about being regarded as a sock puppet. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 16:30, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only thing somebody who posts his picture, e-mail address, street address and scans of his personal documents on a public website will be proving is that he is a complete idiot!

<p>*Ahem*, I don't mean to suggest that someone does <i>all</i> of that - it's just options. Telling someone your email address doesn't breach your security. I don't know about yours, but my library card has nothing remotely personal on it, not even a signature, so that's no security risk either. I've never heard of any risk from posting a self-photo, unless you have something specific in mind. A street address is perfectly harmless if it's a care-of address, and even most home addresses are fairly low-risk, depending on your personal circumstances.</p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that it's trivially easy to prove who you are online, by any of a hundred different methods. While BrianGuidesUs apparently <i>won't</i> tell us who sie is, we shouldn't be fooled into thinking that this is because sie <i>can't</i>. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 18:47, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, you wanted to know how you could prove that you weren't a sock puppet. I've told you how. You can sit here and debate the underlying nature of "proof" and the theoretical ease with which one can create an entire virtual life out of whole cloth... or you can prove that you're not a sock puppet. Doesn't bother me either way, but again, if you don't put the effort in to make yourself appear as a real person, don't be surprised if people don't treat you as a real person. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 15:37, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>BrianGuidesUs - Being a puppet isn't the issue. As per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html#Voting_Policy" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_Policy#Voting_Policy</a>, the rules for voting are that you have to have a minimum of 25 non-minor edits before voting, and that you have been a registered user for at least a week. You don't meet that criteria, so your vote doesn't count. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 17:13, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A more informal reading of the policy would actually imply that any votes/comments made in good faith would be taken into consideration. The 25 edits rules was implemented as a way of trying to weed out obvious sock puppets who are clearly not voting in good faith, but there's more to making a deletion decision than a simple vote count. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 17:18, Jan 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Angela on what should be done - but a rigid interpretation of the wording agrees more with what UtherSRG says. Perhaps the policy needs re-wording? Do we really count how many edits each user has to determine if a vote is valid?

<p>I have my own suspicions Angela. Some statements follow. Those marked FACT can be independently verified. Those marked DEDUCTION are my deductions based on the facts. Many people here will object to the deductions. I expect that some will also deny the facts. That is human nature. These are my honest opinions and observations given as a Wikipedia outsider. If you disagree, then I hope you will discuss things in a calm and intellectual manner, and not avoid the issue by calling me a troll or sock-puppet, or by simply deleting them because you are embarrassed that others may see them. I leave you to discuss these things between yourselves as I feel Wiki is a lost cause.</p>
<p>FACT A. Wikipedia has a clear policy on votes for deletion. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html#Voting_Policy" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_Policy#Voting_Policy</a>.</p>
<p>FACT B. Martin claims on this page this is just a "proposed change".</p>
<p>FACT C. It did not <i>say</i> that. It does now, but that is just because Martin changed the policy yesterday <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>DEDUCTION: The Wikipedia elite change the policy as they wish to force their own opinions.</p>
<p>FACT D. Quote: "At the end of five days, if 2/3 majority vote to delete, the page will be removed. Otherwise the page remains." The article Brianism has been on Votes for Deletion for over 5 days and has never reached the 2/3 majority vote, whether "sock-puppets" are counted or not. Certainly if only votes that <i>very strictly</i> meet the criteria are counted (and I have counted everybody's edits) it is well short of 2/3.</p>
<p>FACT E. Instead of removing the article from Votes for Deletion, the voting period has been extended. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion</a></p>
<p>FACT F. The above is a violation of Wikipedia policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&amp;oldid=2175002#Voting_Policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&amp;oldid=2175002#Voting_Policy" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>DEDUCTION: The Wikipedia power elite plan to extend the period as long as requied in the hope that the required 2/3 majority is reached. The moment this happens, they will immediately delete the article before the vote swings the other way again.</p>
<p>FACT G. The person who extended the voting period was Angela. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>FACT H. Angela has also voted to delete the page. (This page)</p>
<p>DEDUCTION: Angela is not impartial and has done this to support her own point of view rather than to reach a fair result.</p>
<p>FACT I. Anjouli has questioned Angela on her user page about her disregarding votes because people did not give a reason. Anjouli said there was no policy on this. <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Angela#Voting_on_VfD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Angela#Voting_on_VfD" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>FACT J. Instead of backing-down, the power elite just changed the rules by adding <i>or vote on</i> to the policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>DEDUCTION: The Wikipedia elite change the policy as they wish to force their own opinions.</p>
<p>FACT K. Angela has said on this page that "there's more to making a deletion decision than a simple vote count" which obviously means that the deletion decision will not be based on a 2/3 majority of votes.</p>
<p>FACT L. Policy states otherwise: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&amp;oldid=2175002#Voting_Policy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_policy&amp;oldid=2175002#Voting_Policy" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>
<p>DEDUCTION: Angela advocates the violation of policy.</p>
<p>DEDUCTION: If the decision is not based upon the number of people voting each way, then it can only be that the some votes are given more importance than others. For instance The Anome's vote may count for more than UtherSRG's. Or vice-a-versa, which I doubt since The Anome is a member of the power elite and UtherSRG Is not.</p>
<p>DEDUCTION: This is manifestly undemocratic and unfair. The Wikipedia elite change the policy as they wish to force their own opinions.</p>
<p>FACT M: Both Angela and Martin have both voted against the article on this page and, as referenced above, changed policy that might bias the outcome towards their opinions.</p>
<p>DEDUCTION: This is at best a major conflict of interest and worst a manipulation of policy to suit personal opinion.</p>
<p>SUSPICION: Who will be the person who tallies the votes and decides on the outcome? One of those involved above, or one of their close friends? I expect so.</p>
<p>FINALLY: I believe that a small Wikipedia power elite of some half-dozen users (some of whom I strongly suspect are single person with multiple long standing identities) will delete this article whatever the vote. If policy says it should be kept, as seems to be the case at the moment, they will either disregard or change the policy. I may be proven wrong, but I will be very surprised.</p>
<p>Decision making on Wikipedia has all the integrity of a Zimbabwean election.</p>
<p>I put it to you that my opinion will have prevailed if the above posting is simply deleted to hide it, or an attack is mounted on me personally, rather than on the facts and deductions.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia has a structured policy and if talk pages are for dispassionate intellectual discussion of facts, you can now demonstrate that. I do not expect that to happen. I now leave Wikipedia for good. Based on this discussion, it is a lost cause as an intellectual achievement. Have fun kids. BrianGuidesUs 07:03, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I've known Angela, particularly, for several months, and I don't think she's emotionally involved with this article at all. There is no wikipedia "power elite". There's a group of over a hundred "sysops" who have the <i>power</i> to do a few things, but <b>no</b> additional <i>authority</i>. I'm one of them. I happen to like Brianism as a philosophy. Angela may or may not. This is not a factor when we decide which articles to keep - and no one person decides this. This is also NOT the first time in WP history that a deletion discussion has been continued beyond the usual week. <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPakaran_a4a0.html" title="User:Pakaran">Pakaran</a><a href="../../../p/a/k/User_talk%7EPakaran_4352.html" title="User talk:Pakaran">.</a> 07:46, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Pakaran. Is that a vote to keep? This BrianGuidesus is one rude dude but I must say that it confuses me when the rules keep changing or when the rules ppl follow seem to be different from whats written. Can anybody change rules? Can I change them? If not, who is allowed? Why not just kept brianism like he says? I don't really understand that. Not a problem for me because more people see to be voting to keep it as time passes. Angela is cool by the way, but I can see she is in an exposed position if she votes and then counts votes. Sure she is honest like you say, but it cvan give a bad impression. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 08:01, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Brianism should be deleted because: 1) World Brianism Foundation doesn't seem to want this article; 2) There is no "Brianist" <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. They clearly state that they are just a group of skeptics who make some fun; 3) The word "Brianism" does not really exist outside the World Brianism Foundation and Monty Python's film and EOW role playing game, AFAIK; 4) They are not important/famous. For these reasons an article Brianism is not good. However an article World Brianism Foundation would be OK, but only if they have enough publicity or if they are important enough. When they become important we will certainly include them in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptim_ff75.html" title="User:Optim">Optim</a> 08:36, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nothing I have said on Angela’s talk page or elsewhere should be construed as an attack on her integrity or used to support an attack on her integrity.

<p>That's 7 days gone and it is only 8 out of 16 to delete. Needs 11 out of 16 to reach 2/3. Do we keep it now or what? I really do not understand how this works. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 09:09, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a quick note on how to count votes: Abtentions don't count. '2/3 majority to pass' means that at least twice as many votes must be in favor of an issue (deletion here) as there are votes opposed. With 7 keep votes, there must be 14 delete votes in order to delete the article (or 2 keeps switch to delete, or 3 keeps drop support).

<dd>Oh sorry. Think I got it now. Thanks! But think we need to rewrite the rule a bit to make it clear that "abstain" votes are not counted towards the total of which we must reach 2/3.

<p>I am so tempted to move this talk page to <a href="../../../b/a/d/Wikipedia%7EBad_jokes_and_other_deleted_nonsense_9356.html" title="Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense">Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense</a>. But, let's waste some time instead...</p>
<p>I dispute fact B (see <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy</a>) – this should no longer be regarded as merely a proposal and no one has opposed that yet. Martin's right about fact C. The first deduction is nonsense as there is no elite, and a change of policy only means anything if the community accept that change. Fact D does not apply. This is not part of the policy, only the proposal. See the talk page. When citing facts E, F and your 2nd deduction, you fail to take into account the fact the letter that was sent. Such extenuating circumstances need to be taken into consideration as it is quite possible people's views will change as a result of this. Regarding facts G and H and your 3rd deduction, I only suggested it be extended. Anyone is free to edit VfD and say it hasn't been, but then anyone is free to re-list it on VfD. How is fact I relevant to anything? That issue was aboyt RickK being silly, not about deletion policy or this page. Fact J is unrelated to this and was made to clarify the policy which has not previously been expressed clearly in the wording on VfD. It was not a change of policy. Hence, your 4th deduction is a non sequitur. Fact K is my personal opinion and does not mean that a deletion decision will not be based on votes. Fact L is part of the proposed policy, not the accepted part. See the talk page. Hence, your 5th deduction is also wrong. I don't see how your next 2 deductions follow this. Fact M is clearly untrue. No policy has been changed, so your next deduction is also flawed. Your suspicions of some elite are adequately refuted above by Pakaran et al.</p>
<p>I do not regard myself as emotionally involved with this article. If I was that against it, I would have listed it for deletion months ago when I first saw it and asked Anjouli to provide further references to verify the existence of Brianism (see the first revision of her talk page).</p>
<p>To clarify, no one is changing any policies. I believe that the discussion period should be extended to take account of the letter. If someone disagrees, they can remove the listing from VfD if they feel that is justifiable.</p>

<dd>This is a very nice reply and I agree with it. I would only say that if you need to read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy</a> to understand deletion policy, then maybe <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> needs a bit of an edit. I certainly thought it was just off the list after 5 straight days without 2/3 valid votes to remove and I was confused when that did not happen. But I (think) I understand the policy better now. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 05:36, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will not have anything said against Angela either. She is one of the hardest working people you can find on Wikipedia and uses pretty sound judgement. It is becoming high time that we should be deleting Brianism now, instead of letting it spin out into all eternity, because it doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere. The only sources discussing Brianism are the Brianism. com site and the various pages in Wikipedia, and as far as independent observers are concerned, they do not exist. So, are we going to be seen as totally partial to a new movement and spread their word, or are we going to present a Neutral Point of View and let the world have a look at this movement and its new philosophy? The idea of a new movement is always that they write their own books and articles and expose their views to independent observers and reviewers who then will offer critique and discourse, and that encyclopedias take it from there and describe the various points of view impartially. --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 01:54, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela says "If someone disagrees, they can remove the listing from VfD if they feel that is justifiable."</p>
<p>I did not know I could <i>do</i> that. I though it had to be an admin.</p>
<p>As a newbie with only 500 edits, I'm not quite brave enough to do that without some feedback. This is the plan:</p>
<p>i) I think it should go off VfD because the article has been listed over 5 days without 2/3 consensus to delete, and because it was extended 8 days over the letter, again without a 2/3 consensus to delete - in fact it has moved the other way after the letter and is now 50/50. I don't see why the letter writer gets a vote. He is not a Wikipedian. We would not remove a NPOV article about a racist site because they said so.</p>
<p>You might also say the VAST size of this page and the various deletions of the article and its links by one user and reversions of the article and links by multiple users easily show that there is no consensus to delete.</p>
<p>ii) I will remove from the VfD list and remove the VfD notice.</p>
<p>iii) Remove the stuff from the article the letter says is not true.</p>
<p>Is this okay to do?</p>
<p>NB. I am not asking if you <i>agree</i> with keeping the article or not. Even if you want rid of it, please tell me if what I am doing is an acceptable action from someone who has a different opinion from you. I am still <i>very</i> confused about what is normal friendly discussion and action between people who respect each other but have different views and what is vandalism or trolling. I don't want to get walked over, but I don't want to break the rules either. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellBott_96d8.html" title="User:SpellBott">SpellBott</a> 05:59, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why so negative? That doesn't seem very Brianist. As a fellow Brianist, I think you have a severely misguided understanding of how Wikipedia works. There is no power elite: we do work by consensus. Do you understand what consensus is? A decision made by any group of us is as real a decision as any decision made by the power elite in any other setting. Decisions made are generally left alone until they prove to be untenable. I think SpellBott's got the right idea on what to do next, and the time is right for it to be done. If he has't already done it by tonight, I'll go ahead and implement his plan. - <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> 17:09, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To SpellBott: Given that opinion is split 50/50, I feel that the article should currently be retained, with a <a href="../../../i/n/c/Wikipedia%7EInclusion_dispute_e0ad.html" title="Wikipedia:Inclusion dispute">wikipedia:inclusion dispute</a> on it. It may well be that by careful editing you can convince others that it deserves a place in the encyclopedia, and at such a point the notice of dispute may be removed. If opinions go the other way, perhaps we could move this into your user: space, so that you can republish it on another site at your leisure. If you republished it elsewhere, we might still wish to link to it from one or another Wikipeia article. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 18:29, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
