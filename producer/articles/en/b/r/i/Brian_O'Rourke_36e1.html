<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_O%27Rourke_36e1.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>O'Rourke claimed descent from one of the ancient kings of Ireland, and was remarked upon as a handsome and unusually learned <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gael.html" title="Gael">Gaelic</a> chieftain. He assumed leadership of his family in the mid-1560s, having assassinated his elder brothers, but his territory of west Breifne on the border of <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a> soon came under the administration of the newly created Presidency of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connacht.html" title="Connacht">Connaught</a>.</p>
<p>In time, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> officials became unsettled by O'Rourke. The lord deputy, Sir <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Sidney_dde2.html" title="Henry Sidney">Henry Sidney</a>, described him in 1575 as the proudest man he had dealt with in Ireland. Similarly, the president of Connaught, Sir Nicholas Malby, put him down as, "<i>the proudest man this day living on the earth</i>". A decade later Sir Edward Waterhouse thought of him as, "<i>being somewhat learned but of an insolent and proud nature and no further obedient than is constrained by her Majesty's forces</i>".</p>
<p><a name="Connaught" id="Connaught"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_O%27Rourke_36e1.html" title="Edit section: Connaught">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Connaught</span></h2>
<p>O'Rourke was willing to deal with the government, and in an agreement concluded with Malby in 1577 he recognised the sovereignty of the Irish crown under <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a>. But his allegiance was called in question within two years, during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Desmond_Rebellion_935e.html" title="Second Desmond Rebellion">Second Desmond Rebellion</a> in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster.html" title="Munster">Munster</a>, when he rose out in defiance of the Connaught presidency. It was suspected his actions were induced by an involvement with the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_English_fee1.html" title="Old English">Old English</a> family of the <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dillon.html" title="Dillon">Dillons</a> in adjacent west <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meath.html" title="Meath">Meath</a>, who were engaged in an effort to spread their influence and possessions in the northern midlands, rather than by outright collusion in the rebel <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraldine.html" title="Geraldine">Geraldine</a> cause.</p>
<p>Sir <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bingham_aba2.html" title="Richard Bingham">Richard Bingham</a> took up the presidency of Connaught in 1584, when Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Perrot_3c18.html" title="John Perrot">John Perrot</a> was appointed lord deputy of Ireland. O'Rourke immediately complained of harassment by the new president in the spring and summer of that year, and in September Bingham was ordered by his superior in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_Castle_56ed.html" title="Dublin Castle">Dublin Castle</a> to temporise and refrain from making expeditions into Breifne. Although part of the province of Connaught, the territory was not subject to a crown sheriff, and O'Rourke was happy to preserve his freedom of action. He did maintain relations with the <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> government by his attendance at the opening of parliament in 1585, where he was noted to have dressed all in black in the company of his strikingly beautiful wife.</p>
<p>In preparation for the Composition of Connaught, whereby the lords of that province were to enter an agreement with the government to regularise their standing, O'Rourke surrendered his lordship in 1585. He was thus due to receive a regrant of his lands by knights service in return for a chief horse and an engraved gold token to be presented to the lord deputy each year at midsummer. It seemed a balanced compromise, but O'Rourke declined to accept the letters patent and never regarded his terms as binding.</p>
<p>By May 1586 the tension with the president had mounted, and O'Rourke brought charges against him before the council at Dublin, which were dismissed as vexatious. Bingham believed that Perrot had been behind this attempt on his authority, but there was little he could do before his recall to England for service in the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowlands.html" title="Lowlands">Lowlands</a> in 1587; upon the president's departure (he was to return within a year), Perrot slashed O'Rourke's annual composition dues and, while permitting him to levy certain illegal exactions, appointed the Lord of West Breifne sheriff of Leitrim for a term of two years.</p>
<p><a name="Rebellion" id="Rebellion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_O%27Rourke_36e1.html" title="Edit section: Rebellion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rebellion</span></h2>
<p>O'Rourke remained unhappy with interference in his territories, and he was content also to be described as a leading Catholic lord. In 1588, after Perrot's departure, he assisted at least eighty survivors of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Armada_a625.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> - including <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_de_Cuellar_7d72.html" title="Francisco de Cuellar">Francisco de Cuellar</a> - to depart the country, and was regarded as friendly to future receptions of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> forces. Although not proclaimed as a rebel, he put up a forcible resistance to the presidency - again under Binghams's command - and would not be bridled.</p>
<p>O'Rourke's demands grew along with the violence on the borders of west Breifne. In peace talks in 1589, he did accept the terms of a crown tribute that had been agreed by his grandfather, but resisted the composition agreed in 1585 and refused to allow the formation of a crown administration in the newly formed County Leitrim. Instead, he sought appointment as <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneschal.html" title="Seneschal">seneschal</a> under the direct authority of the Dublin government, leaving him independent of Bingham. He also sought safe possession of his lands within and without the county, a safe-conduct for life, and a guarantee of freedom from harassment by the president's forces of any merchants entering his territory. In return, the only pledge he was willing to give was his sword. A member of the Dublin council, Robert Dillon of the west Meath family, advised him to stay out - intimating that he would be taken into custody if he came in and submitted to crown authority - and accordingly O'Rourke declined an offer from the government of safe-conduct.</p>
<p><a name="Flight_and_Extradition" id="Flight_and_Extradition"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_O%27Rourke_36e1.html" title="Edit section: Flight and Extradition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flight and Extradition</span></h2>
<p>Under the government of Perrot's successor as lord deputy, Sir <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_FitzWilliam_%28Lord_Deputy%29_f014.html" title="William FitzWilliam (Lord Deputy)">William Fitzwilliam</a>, pressure was increased on the territories bordering the province of <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>. Thus, in the spring of 1590, Bingham's forces occupied west Breifne and O'Rourke fled; later that year the adjacent territory of <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Monaghan_0533.html" title="County Monaghan">Monaghan</a> was seized by the crown after the execution at law of the resident lord, Hugh Roe MacMahon.</p>
<p>O'Rourke fetched up in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in February 1591, with "<i>six fair Irish hobbies and four great dogs to be presented to the king</i>". He was seeking not only asylum but also the opportunity to recruit <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallowglass.html" title="Gallowglass">mercenaries</a> to contest the occupation of his territories. In consultation with the English ambassador, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_VI_fff6.html" title="King James VI">King James VI</a> denied him an audience, and Queen Elizabeth (relying among other things on the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Berwick_%281586%29_9a15.html" title="Treaty of Berwick (1586)">Treaty of Berwick</a> 1586) made a strong request for his delivery into her custody. The matter was put to the Scottish privy council, which readily ordered - in the face of some objections - the arrest and delivery to English crown forces of the rebel Irish lord. Elizabeth's councillors had explicitly held out the prospect of clemency for O'Rourke, and certain Scots councillors agreed to the extradition, in the supposed expectation that his life would be spared. The expectation was to be disappointed, an experience the king himself suffered in the years afterward, when reciprocal extraditions of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Stewart%2C_1st_Earl_of_Bothwell_2535.html" title="Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell">Bothwellites</a> were denied by the English.</p>
<p>O'Rourke was arrested in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, where the chief traffic was with Ireland. The townsmen sought a stay on his delivery into custody, fearing for their Irish trade, and meeting no sympathy cursed the king's officers as knights of Elizabeth and cried out that the king had been bought with English angels (a reference to the pension the king received from England). Several of O'Rourke's creditors feared that his debts would never be paid, but the English ambassador later made a contribution of £47. O'Rourke was removed from <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> in the afternoon of April 3 1591 in the midst of a riot. Two ships on the west coast were looted, and, after some crews had been killed by Irishmen in protest at O'Rourke's treatment, guards had to be mounted on all vessels sailing to Ireland.</p>
<p><a name="Trial_and_Execution" id="Trial_and_Execution"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_O%27Rourke_36e1.html" title="Edit section: Trial and Execution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trial and Execution</span></h2>
<p>O'Rourke was transferred to the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_London_bcf4.html" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, where he was kept in close custody as legal argument began. Although <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> trials in the Tudor period had more to do with political theatre than the administration of justice, the matter was not a foregone conclusion: there was a serious question over whether O'Rourke could be tried in England for treason committed in Ireland. The judges delivered a mixed, preliminary opinion, that the trial could go ahead under a treason statute enacted under King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, articles had been framed at <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> against O'Rourke with the reluctant aid of Bingham (curiously, he complained of being bullied into his testimony), and there was also an indictment laid by a jury in <a href="../../../s/l/i/Sligo.html" title="Sligo">Sligo</a>. These matters were transferred to England, where the grand jury of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesex.html" title="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> found evidence of various offences of treason, the most substantial of which concerned the assistance given to Armada survivors, the attempt to raise mercenaries in Scotland, and various armed raids made by O'Rourke into <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Sligo_dbcf.html" title="County Sligo">Sligo</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Roscommon_377b.html" title="County Roscommon">Roscommon</a>. There was one further charge that related to an odd incident in 1589, when a representation of the Queen (whether a wood-carving or painting is not known) was said to have been tied to a horse's tail at O'Rourke's command and dragged in the mud; this was referred to as the <i>treason of the image</i>, but it has been suggested that it was merely an ancient new year's ritual, deliberately misconstrued for the benefit of the indictment process.</p>
<p>O'Rourke was <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arraign.html" title="Arraign">arraigned</a> on the 28th of October 1591 and the indictment was translated for him into <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish</a> by a native speaker. One observer said he declined to plead, but the record states that a plea of not guilty was entered (probably at the direction of the court). The defendant was asked how he wished to be tried and answered that he would submit to trial by jury if he were given a week to examine the evidence, then allowed a good legal advocate, and only if the Queen herself sat in judgment. The judge declined these requests and explained that the jury would try him anyway. O'Rourke responded, "<i>If they thought good, let it be so</i>". The trial proceeded and O'Rourke was convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of November 1591, O'Rourke was drawn to <a href="../../../t/y/b/Tyburn%2C_London_9b54.html" title="Tyburn, London">Tyburn</a>. On the scaffold <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miler_Magrath_7a37.html" title="Miler Magrath">Miler Magrath</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Cashel_1339.html" title="Archbishop of Cashel">Archbishop of Cashel</a>, sought the repentance of the condemned man's sins. In response, he was abused by O'Rourke with jibes over his uncertain faith and credit and dismissed as a man of depraved life who had broken his vow by abjuring the rule of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscans.html" title="Franciscans">Franciscans</a>. O'Rourke then suffered execution of sentence by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging%2C_drawing_and_quartering.html" title="Hanging, drawing and quartering">hanging and quartering</a>.</p>
<p>In his essay on <i>Customs</i>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bacon_d51b.html" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> refers to an Irish rebel hanged at London, who requested that the sentence be carried out, not with a rope halter, but with a willow withe - a common instrument amongst the Irish: it is probable that O'Rourke was the rebel referred to.</p>

<p>O'Rourke's experience as a rebel Irish lord is not remarkable in itself. What is remarkable is the combination used in his downfall: first, the campaign conducted under Fitzwilliam to bring pressure to bear on the borders of Ulster; and then the co-operation of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Scotland_915a.html" title="King of Scotland">Scots king</a> with the English, resulting in the first <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extradition.html" title="Extradition">extradition</a> within <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> and a trial for treason committed "<i>beyond the seas</i>". Evidence of his treason was used in the trial of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Perrot_3c18.html" title="John Perrot">Perrot</a> later in the year, which also resulted in conviction, and the subsequent pursuit of an aggressive policy against the lords of Ulster led to the outbreak of the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Years_War_%28Ireland%29_f111.html" title="Nine Years War (Ireland)">Nine Years War</a>. In the end, O'Rourke had fallen prey to forces that were moving to establish a new polity in Britain, of which James VI became the first monarch little more than a decade later.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_O%27Rourke_36e1.html" title="Edit section: Family">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family</span></h2>
<p>O'Rourke married Lady Burke, and then Elenora, daughter of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_FitzGerald%2C_15th_Earl_of_Desmond_5f8b.html" title="Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond">Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond</a>. Among his children were two sons, Brian Óg (his tanist) and Teig, who succeeded him. The former was instrumental in the Irish victory at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Curlew_Pass_61d7.html" title="Battle of Curlew Pass">Battle of Curlew Pass</a> during the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Years_War_%28Ireland%29_f111.html" title="Nine Years War (Ireland)">Nine Years War</a>. O'Rourke's seignory was confiscated and later given to Teig in the next reign, but in principle Leitrim remained part of the Connaught composition - at Bingham's insistence - and did not suffer as radical a land settlement as Monaghan.</p>
