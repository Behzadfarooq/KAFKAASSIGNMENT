<p>Are there any campaigns to raise the age that you are allowed to join the armed forces? Personally, I think you shouldn't be allowed to go on active service in a war zone until you are 21 atleast. You can't drink in some states until 21, so why should you be allowed to murder 'the enemy' at 16? Ethoen 18:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sure theres a campaign somewhere by someone to raise the joining age, but its definitely not in the public eye. You cant drink in some <b>US</b> states until 21, I think here in the UK its 18 everywhere, and IIRC you aren't sent into a war zone until you are 18. The youngest British soldier killed in Iraq so far has been 18, so I guess that might be true. See <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2932958.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2932958.stm" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="../../../r/h/b/User%7ERHB_fa8a.html" title="User:RHB">RHB</a> 19:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had always believed that the British Army had no 'Royal' prefix as it has fought against the King in the English civil war? SGoat 05:46, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a fallacy, although a very common one. There wasn't a standing army until Parliament created the New Model Army, so the army didn't have a chance to fight against the King, since it didn't actually exist at the time. Several of the regiments descended from the New Model Army do have the "Royal" prefix. Added to which, the Royal Navy <i>did</i> mostly fight for Parliament, and that kept its "Royal" prefix. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 21:02, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know the history section is supposed to be concise and directs to a main article, but giving the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War less than two lines hardly seems proportionate considering their significance in the British Army's history. Also the Boer War doesn't even get a mention.</p>

<p>Is this section really necessary? It's incredibly subjective. All units are notable to those who served in them. The Black Watch, for instance, is actually no more or less notable than any other infantry regiment. It just happens to have been in the news recently. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 21:36, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you'd asked two years back, you'd probably still have got told the Black Watch... quite why is debatable, but there you go. "Famous" may be more appropriate than "notable", mind you. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 15:53, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>"Famous" is still a pretty subjective term. I suspect the Black Watch are known firstly because they have an unusual name and secondly because they're currently one of the few unamalgamated regiments. Why the RWF or the KRRC? They're no better known than any other regiment. I don't really think a list like this adds anything to the article, any more than the equally subjective list of Famous members of the British Army underneath it. It's basically just a list of people's favourite units or people. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:54, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Without the word "Notable", won't this grow to be a list of all British Army units past or present? There have been quite a few. Cjrother 16:51, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There seems to be some confusion here with regard to the history of the English army rather than the British army. The Bill of Rights is English statute passed by the English Parliament and had no bearing in Scotland at that time. The English &amp; Scottish Parliaments ceased to exist in 1707 and the new British parliament took control of the army in England and Scotland i.e. the British Army.</p>

<dd>British soldiers are not only allowed to have tattoos, there are few British soldiers who do not have tattoos (by the time they've been in a while anyway). The TV series <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier_Soldier_b16f.html" title="Soldier Soldier">Soldier Soldier</a></i> actually employed a makeup artist just to apply tattoos to the actors every day! There have been rumbles about excessive tattoos from on high (there was once a proposal to ban tattoos, but it was ridiculed by everybody and never got anywhere), and tattooing above the collar would be out, but generally tattoos are standard in all the British Armed Forces (even Edward VII and George V got tattoos done when they were princes serving in the Royal Navy). What are the rules on tattoos in the US military then? Were there restrictions? Tattoos can be more of an issue in the British police, incidentally, particularly since many police officers are ex-military, but as long as they're not offensive and not above the collar they're tolerated. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 16:52, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Currently, the equpiment section is a mess. It includes old equipment that is no longer in service, duplicates that are already described in the article on Modern Equipment and is missing some important stuff (NBC related equipment for example).</p>
<p>I propose that this page include only links to primary equipment such as the Challenger 2, the Warrior APC, the SA80, GPMG, LSW etc. and links to the Modern Equipment page and a Historic Equipment page.</p>
<p>It might also be worth displaying the equipment links in tables to reduce the length of the page. I've created an example <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_cowie_test_layout_d2c9.html" title="User:Rob cowie/test layout">here</a>.

<p>Private 4th class doesnt exist. pay goes up in tandem with length service and/or promotion, so it is possible that one private could be paid more than another, but OR-1 and OR-2 are the same rank. I'm correcting this. Lots of Love, Tim</p>

<dd>As an addition, the rank table is rather off.

Additionally a company commander in the British army is normally a major rather than a captain, this does significantly alter what the ranks mean in practical terms.

<p>I'm no historian, but is it correct to refer to William and Mary as "usurping" the English throne? According to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_and_Mary_edbe.html" title="William and Mary">William and Mary</a> page, "they were called to the throne by Parliament, replacing James II, who was 'deemed to have fled' the country in the Glorious Revolution of 1688." To use the word "usurp" implies that they seized power without legal authority.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Gulf War - For starters this appears to refer to GRANBY, ie the liberation of Kuwait (leaving aside how we number the UKs involvement out there over time), that needs to be clear, it was only 15 years ago but thats ancient history to some readers who don't realise that TELIC was just the latest instalment. The section also doesn't really talk much about it, the majority is related to Options for Change and the corresponding force reduction, it needs to talk more about the Op in more detail as a summary of the corresponding article, and should probably link there.</li>
<li>Balkans - I appreciate that the article is about the Army, but the RN and the RAF were deployed there as well, indeed as I recall the RN were first out there dealing with the refugee situation in the Adriatic.</li>
<li>Afghanistan - At the moment most of this talks about the RM component not the Army contribution. Also wasn't the deployment as 16 Air Assault rather than 1 Para as Spearhead Battalion? If it was a spearhead deployment then that should be mentioned, plus the follow on force.</li>
<li>Iraq (current) - The section shouldn't really discuss the political issues associated with the legality of the intervention, that's discussed at length elsewhere, and could be linked to as appropriate. Also isn't the UK actually Commander MND(SW) rather than just the majority presence? Surely this should be mentioned.</li>
<li>Sierra Leone - The section talks mainly about the SAS! This section should discuss Op PALLISER which was initially a Spearhead intervention with one of the Para Battalions, I can't remember which one. There was also an Amphibious Task Group involved. The SF activity was just one small part of the whole operation.</li>
<li>NI - The section lacks focus or effectiveness as a summary of the situation.ALR 13:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's an overstatement.

<p>Hi, in several articels about different units you can see a Tactical Recognition Flash, but there is no article about what it mean or what it is good for. would be nice to read something about it. cu <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAssetBurned_71bd.html" title="User:AssetBurned">AssetBurned</a> 22:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why this article just talk about the military victories of UK and not their losses.</p>
<p>Surely the Troop numbers in Iraq need amending- they are currently around 5000 and due to fall to 3500 at the end of this year. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob77_3d2c.html" title="User:Rob77">Rob</a> 11:31, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
