<p>Sorry for taking so long to get back to you - I have fever and a temperature of 39 degrees. My favourite out of your pics is the Valle Grande Dome. It might just get through. Good luck! When did you get the D70? It's a pretty nice camera! --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 06:57, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_Archive_08_90fe.html" title="Edit section: Auftragsarbeiten">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Auftragsarbeiten</span></h2>
<p><b>Auftragsarbeiten</b> is a compound word (Auf|trags|arbeiten) which literally means <b>out-cary-work</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>tragen means to cary or wear (as cloths), and <b>Auftragen</b> means to cary out.</li>
<li><i>Auftrag</i> seems like it may have additional idiomatic meaning. I looked it up, and it means <i>order</i> (as in to order a pizza, or give an order to a subordinate).</li>
<li><i>Arbeit</i> (work) in the de.wikipedia help usually parallels <i>contribution</i> in en.wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <b>contribution to orders</b> or <b>contribution through orders</b> is the best translation I can come up with.</p>
<p>The page is written in somewhat technical language, so I would need to look up many words. This is complicated by the fact that my dictionary is about 100 years old and written in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraktur.html" title="Fraktur">fraktur</a>. I would ordinarily accept the challenge and translate the page, except that I'm moving this Friday and I have little free time. Plus the dewpoint is 21°&#160;C here, so it is hard to think. -<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasito_3c90.html" title="User:Casito">Casito</a>⇝<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasito_0bf9.html" title="User talk:Casito">Talk</a></p>

<p>Regarding your message on my talk page, Auftragsarbeiten doesn't have a direct one-word English meaning that I know of, but the closest would probably be "<i>work assignments</i>". It's a plural of Auftragsarbeit, which refers to assigned work (or, more literally, ordered work, work given by an order). It can also sometimes mean freelance work given on a per-job basis. "Work assignments" is probably what you're looking for. I'll try to whip up a translation of the other page header you were interested in too. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:19, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, here's my stab at it. You didn't really specify whether you were interested in a word-for-word transcript, or a total rewrite into completely natural English. As a result, this is somewhere in the middle... <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:02, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedia:Work Assignments from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>(the line that was here said that the article had been discussed after a previous deletion discussion. this line should be left out if attempting to bring this into the English Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Wikipedia Work Assignments are a system of rewards, in which bonuses are assigned for working on Wikipedia articles. The bonuses are not wasted: the time and knowledge of Wikipedia users is valuable, and can be used to strengthen topics to become Featured Articles or similar. Non-monetary gifts can also be offered, the nature of which are limited only by the imagination.</p>
<p>In setting guidelines for these work assignment requests, obsviously the basic standards of Wikipedia remain in place: the requested tasks must advance our goal of producing an encyclopedia, the resulting articles are "free" (here meaning GDFL-licensed), and must be presented with a neutral point of view. Inappropriate or controversial work offers may be removed after discussion or voting on the talk page. Work offers are not guaranteed, and the decision whether to pay (and to whom) is decided by the user who requested the work. The user who requested the work can also hand this decision over to the Wikipedia community, which is recommended in close or controversial cases. The final decision whether to pay rests with the user who requested thw work, though the Wikipedia community will ultimately determine the article content.</p>
<p>An example: A bonus can be offered for a certain article type. One possibility would be a bonus for the next featured article about a cemetary, or for five good articles about a topic such as genetics. Also, a bonus could be offered for expanding a list of stubs, taking photographs, translating articles, writing software, etc. There are no limits to what can be added to Wikipedia through the use of assignments and bonuses. The sky is the limit!</p>
<p>Old assignments are moved to the archive. Payment can be discussed there as well.</p>

<p>Not sure why this goes here instead of on <a href="../../../c/r/e/Talk%7ECreation_science_a4d4.html" title="Talk:Creation science">Talk:Creation science</a>, but sure. I don't have a problem with the opening paragraph. Personally, I like it. I have a problem with edit wars, and it looks to me like there's been one going on. I thought that avoiding use of "pseudoscience" in the opening paragraph might calm things down. I could easily be wrong; I'm sure the fighting's been going on much longer than the last couple days that I've been reading. Maybe it's the optimistic newbie in me talking, but I think that avoiding the apparently inflammatory word is worth trying. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 23:23, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I might as well continue replying here. I can see why that talk page is so overgrown, it's ridiculous. I don't think either side is communicating with the other. I happen to agree with you: saying it's not science or saying it's pseudoscience amount to the same basic thing. You and I both know that. However we're trying to avoid drawing the attention of those rabid CS'ists who will revert "pseudoscience". I'm trying to be strictly practical here: I think the article is likely to be more correct, for a longer time, if we avoid that word. This is just one editor's opinion, for whatever it's worth. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 23:31, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm fine with the current opening paragraph too. Unfortunately, I am also fairly sure that people who don't know what the word pseudoscience means, don't know what it means for something to be a science, or are simply easily offended by negative connotations will get all worked up about this. As I said on the talk page, I'd like it if the point could be clearly established in language that wouldn't cause people like kdbuffalo to become alarmed, but I'm not sure if that's possible. If it is, I don't know how to manage it, at any rate. <a href="../../../s/v/i/User%7ESVI_bd58.html" title="User:SVI">SVI</a> 23:52, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>As it is established by the scientific community to be unscientific, it can be considered pseudoscience and a misnomer.</i></p>
<p>This is telling the reader that whether or not something is scientific depends on what the scientific community establishes.

<p>Hi, just noticed your vote and the subsequent votes that voted oppose as per your vote. I totally understand the reluctance to vote for someone as new as I am, however in regards to my userspace edits a number of those edits are reversions of vandalism on other users' pages.

At any rate, the list in question is extremely comprehensive, a good bit of research it looks like, but I can't imagine anyone having a use for it. So I'm undecided. But the situation on lists and the transwiki war is something I'd really rather not get involved in. I hung out at the edit war an <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> for a while and found I really would rather just write articles.

<p>Geez, I'm sorry man. I'll support you on Commons but it looks like they are pretty solidly against it. On the bright side, it doesn't look like its getting deleted from Source anytime soon since you managed to get all your Wikipedia supporters to vote to keep it. Either way I'm sure we will figure out the proper place for it. I don't think source people are rabid deletionists... they just don't want non source material. The lists will probably be left on source until a better place can be found for them. After reading the VfDs on Commons, it seems pretty clear that the lists are going to have to go back on Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/User:CSN" class="extiw" title="wikisource:User:CSN">CSN</a> 04:30, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="http://sep11.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributes_to_individuals" class="extiw" title="sep11:Tributes_to_individuals">That list</a> isn't on Wikipedia. It's on a separate wiki, which was created before the existence of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, and long before any <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/New_project_policy" class="extiw" title="m:New_project_policy">policy</a> on the creation of new wikis existed. I would rather it were closed down now since the only edits to it are vandalism, trolling, and spam, but I'm not convinced there would be enough support for that yet. However, having one inappropriate project doesn't mean that lists of non-notable people should be included in any other project if that doesn't meet the project's goals.

<p>Putting up those big, bold objections to various people's objections at the GNAA FAC is probably not helping much. Especially not when they're aimed at objections that actually are reasonable, including mine.
