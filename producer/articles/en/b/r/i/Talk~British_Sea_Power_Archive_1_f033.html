Along with the rest of the Brighton-based quartet, Noble enjoys birdwatching during tours as a way to relax and even arranged a concert on the Scilly Isles, purely as an excuse to go birdwatching there.

<dd>Read the guideline links I posted below. Wikipedia doesn't view claims of insider knowledge by you (or me, or any other individual user) as admissible information. This shouldn't need repeating, except that so many people don't 'get' how it works: verifiability in reputable sources is the criterion. If a lot of newspapers generally viewed as reliable say X is a fact, it goes in. If you can find similar sources supporting your claim that the birdwatching is just a PR gimmick, cite them. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 15:32, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can we not keep "The band have built up an eccentric persona in interviews and press releases; some based on fact, other times merely whimsical building of outward personas. These include giving journalists grid references with which to meet them, supposed obsessions with Bernard Montgomery and birdwatching." (by user Me677) as a compromise? This is a non-subjective view which pleases both parties (ie those of us that know that it is not true, and those that believe it is true because they read it in some newspapers) while giving a reader with no/little knowledge on the subject the choice to make their own minds up based on the evidence here and elsewhere. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyWater_d609.html" title="User:SaltyWater">SaltyWater</a> 16:28, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. I hope this isn't going to turn into another bit of bogus evidence for the Pigsonthewing witch-hunt. The situation here is clearly an anonymous fan trying to force the article to fit his personal view. As with anyone using a stage name - see <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting_%28musician%29.html" title="Sting (musician)">Sting (musician)</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_%28artist%29.html" title="Prince (artist)">Prince (artist)</a> - the full names are fair game to mention in an encyclopedia (I think they should be mentioned alongside the stage names, rather than opting for one or the other). <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 01:44, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>Give them all a break, lad.</p>
<p>Now my bit on birdwatching: it's fair to say that BSP are fairly eccentric people. But they've also played it up to it a massive amount to fit the ideal created by Roy Wilkinson. As such: yes, they like reading, czech stuff and outdoor things. But (and the only source myself and sui have is that we both go to a lot of their gigs and *namedrop* speak to the band quite a lot) Noble is the only one that likes birdwatching. The others just like the great outdoors. For example Neil (sorry, "Hamilton Wilkinson") walked the 200 miles from Leeds to Cumbria a week before xmas 2004 after a gig, sleeping outdoors. But he couldn't care about the woodpeckers he saw on the way.</p>
<p>Oh, and the band really do hate that photo. Whether it matters or not. Saltywater knows his stuff I'm whether we want him to or not...</p>

<dd>Of course, it's well possible, as with any band, that anything they say is part of a manufactured persona. But, on the other hand, if such details are reported at face value in multiple mainstream sources , that information has to be taken as valid. <i>Even if you know better from personal experience</i>, that experience counts as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and isn't admissible material. Likewise, see the guidelines on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. The part about <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Personal_websites_as_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Personal websites as secondary sources</a> makes it especially clear that fan sites are not to be viewed as credible sources. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 10:58, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
