<p>I don't mean to cause Offence here, but the flag is a complete piss-take. There isn't a single (respectable) white person within the UK (at least, those who were born in the UK) that wouldn't phsyically throw up at the first sign of that flag. Whoever put that flag up desperately needs psychological help. I personally feel that, when the death penalty is re-introduced into the UK, that particular individual should be put higher up on the list than even the most murderous serial killer.</p>
<p>Like I said, no offence, but the truth hurts - doesn't it? Don't be such self-hating fools, you cause more offence with the flag that I have caused here.</p>

<p>I've been expanding this article on the basis that the term Afro-Caribbean is referred to in it's original context - meaning Caribbean people of African origin in Britain. This term was used to distinguish between Hispanic Caribbeans in places like Cuba, Dominican republic etc. However the term now also means Black British people in general, including people of Nigeria or Ghanaian origin etc. There are three articles, Black British - British Caribbean - and British Afro-Caribbean community. So there may need to be a reformatting of articles, titles and info. --Zleitzen 06:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Disagree</b>: not all <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean_British_659a.html" title="Caribbean British">Caribbean British</a> people are of African origin, as many are of Asian descent, notably those whose parents and grandparents came from <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinidad_and_Tobago_6d19.html" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guyana.html" title="Guyana">Guyana</a>.

<dd>I see what you mean, particuarily in relation to Guyana where you're right, many citizens are of Asian origin also.

<p>Interesting enough and obviously the product of some effort. I just don't see the topic as defined enough or consistent with a stand-alone encyclopedia entry. It belongs as part of something larger Hoya1 06:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article has much merit, although perhaps the whole question of terminology and 'afro-caribbean' 'british-african' 'african' 'west-indian' 'black-british' needs its own article and links - primarily because the history of the terminology reflects changing social attitudes. I also think the article could do with some statistical/demographic information which could be gleaned from the British cenus. For example, when referring to differential outcomes of the community's relationship with certain state bureauocracies such as police, prison and schools it would be useful to use figures from official sources. Hopefully I will be able to add something of use at some stage. <a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckees_8ee3.html" title="User:Ackees">Ackees</a> 23:34, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Ackees. There is a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_British_b172.html" title="Black British">Black British</a> page which needs a lot of work and someone made a start on <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_British_11d7.html" title="African British">African British</a> with little success it seems. You're right that some organisation needs to be put in place concerning the terminology. Because Afro-Caribbean (or African-Caribbean in line with <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a>) is now used interchangeably with a broader definition of Black Britons. In respect to wikipedia, I relate the term with <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Latin_American_507e.html" title="Afro-Latin American">Afro-Latin American</a> and/or <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Cuban_dcdf.html" title="Afro-Cuban">Afro-Cuban</a> etc. I'll give this some thought.</dd>
<dd>I've tried to relate this page specifically to the Caribbean community and people of Caribbean origin. I believe the percentage within Black Britons is around 70%, but the only stat I've seen is from a Birmingham info site and refers to that area alone, which may or may not be typical. I'm not sure how easy it is to glean specific demographic info concerning this. Anyway, at least I've managed to put some detail into this subject, which is poorly represented on wikipedia. I hope that we can expand this and get it right for readers, because it is also an area poorly represented in wider academia and society. Given Wikipedia's growing role as a key tool for seekers of information, it would be a worthwhile achievement.--<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 00:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you can see, I have added a 'statistics' section based on the 2001 British census and the culture section has been hugely expanded. I have also added a few details here and there - I got a note telling me the article was too long! I find that hard to believe, but perhaps I am not expert enough to properly organise things.</p>
<p>The culture section could also do with a bit about fashion and beauty, mentioning afros, dreadlocks, sneakers and, of course, the lovely Naomi Campbell.</p>
<p>There also ought to be a (small) section on politics, mentioning (or at least linking to) prominent MPs, campaigns and issues.--<a href="../../../a/c/k/User%7EAckees_8ee3.html" title="User:Ackees">Ackees</a> 14:28, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's great work Ackees. Don't worry about the article size at is a knee-jerk guideline rather than a policy, but it's actually opened up the future possibility of the culture section being a seperate page which is a major step forward. On this page we'd have a heading and a brief synopsis - accompanied by a clear link of

<dd><i>See Main Article <b>British African-Caribbean culture</b></i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I still haven't brought the history section up to the present, and it needs a paragraph on the last 15 years or so. There are a number of points I'd like to bring in,</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>the varying and changing relationship between the community and other communties - notably Asian and African - the most verifiable material on the net seems to stem from Darcus Howe commentary.</li>
<li>the perceived "Yardie" problem and broader guncrime issues. I'm loathe to delve to deeply into this, if you check the <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yardie.html" title="Yardie">Yardie</a> page there are some comments I've made, and I've radically chopped away at that article also. I have my own opinions on the usefulness of the term and the representations by the police and media.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't like to see this page get dragged down by endless negative stereotypical views, though the guncrime issue would need to be addressed in some fashion. Rather, I see this page as an opportunity to reveal lesser known and more informative cultural/historical facets of the community. --<a href="../../../z/l/e/User%7EZleitzen_3fe5.html" title="User:Zleitzen">Zleitzen</a> 14:49, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that "African-Caribbean" is not universal usage in the UK. "Caribbean", "West Indian" and "Afro-Caribbean" are more common in general speech while "Black Caribbean" is the Census term to distinguish West Indians with Asian or European heritage. While some people may want to mimic "African-American" while being specific to those with a personal Caribbean origin or heritage, many British people will assume that "African-Caribbean" means Black African and Black Caribbean together. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 11:07, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, this was a very, very interesting read; comprehensive and informative. But I noticed that (except for sport), almost all the exemplars in the different categories of notable or groundbreaking Afro-Caribbean-Brits are male. Where possible, I think more balanced gender representation is preferable; if good female examples don't exist, I think the reasons why should be addressed.

<p>Great article, but I'm not sure how the subsection of this article made it past FA review. The subsection subheadings don't appear to have any logical order to them and there are overlaps. Why is "Carnival" the first item if "Music" is the last? Why is film and television a separate item from media (which includes not just newspapers but tv newscasters and radio stations)? What is the rationale for the current sequencing? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:18, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page was moved by a cut and past move on June 16 last year. I have moved the page back and merged the history. It is very important that the history of edits to Wikipedia articles stays with the article, because if anyone else claims copyright (usually an over zealous Wikipedia editor who notices that the page exists on some mirror which does not credit Wikipedia) that the history of the edits before the version on the mirror are available to make sure that it is not a copy from that mirror.</p>
<p>Further I have left the page at "Afro-Caribbean", because that is the name used in the two dictionaries (one English and one American) that are cited. I think that if anyone wishes to move it back to "African-Caribbean" then they should put in a request at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> so that the issue can be fully discussed before a move is made. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
