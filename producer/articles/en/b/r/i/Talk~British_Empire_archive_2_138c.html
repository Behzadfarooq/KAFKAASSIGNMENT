These <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a> had been living in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> (= Little Britain}. The political evolution of the English monarchy includes when it was part of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angevin_Empire_3749.html" title="Angevin Empire">Angevin Empire</a> which included parts of modern France, but not <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.

<p><a name="The_Map" id="The_Map"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Map</span></h2>
<p>I like the map. Thanks for adding it. Unfortunately I have a couple of minor quibbles over it.</p>
<p>Firstly the caption. It says "Territory controlled by the British Empire at its height" (which was during the 1930s)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, no, though this is misleading. The greatest <i>formal</i> extent was in the 1940s after peripheral areas like Sarawak and the Danish possessions in India were taken over. Certainly, this was merely a formal preliminary and tidying up exercise before the retreat from empire, but just like the way a eunuch's bones grow more than those of an entire man - and for similar reasons - the greates extent of the British Empire as measured on the map was after its ringbarking by the new world order: in the 1940s. PML.</dd>
</dl>
<p>but the map seems to show "every territory under Imperial control at any time". The Empire didn't control the eastern seaboard of North America when it was at its height for instance, although the map seems to show that it does.</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm not sure about some of the territories. Can you confirm at what time Libya was part of the empire&#160;? I always thought that it was under Italian control until the Second World War and under UN control until regaining independence.</p>
<p>However I repeat that the map is a good idea. Perhaps we need more than one, in order to show the evolution of the Empire through the years -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<p>I agree. This map was just the biggest one I could find. Does anyone have a better one? <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J._f353.html" title="User:J.J.">user:J.J.</a></p>
<p>This map is in error: Cyprus and Sri Lanka are shown as <i>white</i> instead of <i>red</i>. I think the borders of British control over Papua New Guinea may've been slightly different from what is portrayed too <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrusadeonilliteracy_6eb4.html" title="User:Crusadeonilliteracy">Crusadeonilliteracy</a></p>
<p>Also, it shows the whole of Somalia as red when only what is now Somaliland was British. And the southern Thai peninsula was never controlled by the British. I think it should show the British Empire at its height, and not every single territory ever controlled by the English/British, otherwise we should include much of France, and Hanover as well. Let's also try to get an image that shows the Falklands and Antarctica. Did the maps of the British Empire actually show it in red, or pink? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 09:19, 19 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is about an <b>Empire</b>, not about the philosophy or (disputed) economic motors of <b>imperialism</b>. I'm tired of having obsolete material from other articles pasted in 5KB chunks where it has no place (this article is already 33K, and has the makings of a very good 30K), and where the task of rewriting them is only multiplied needlessly (how many articles does <i><b>the same content</b></i> need to be in?). The article links to the existing <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Imperialism_8246.html" title="New Imperialism">New Imperialism</a> and related articles.

<dd>Tired or not, we're going to have to link imperialism and empire if we're going to illuminate what factors contributed to the expansion of the empire. The two sections that you're removing, which at least aren't copied verbatim from New Imperialism, are an imperfect start. We're working on a very contentious subject, and we're going to have to deal with many assessments that are disputed and subject to multiple interpretations. We both fully understand the controversy surrounding the content that you keep removing, but it can be integrated into the article in a neutral manner, after a little rewriting, without slanting the article toward a particular interpretation. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 19:27, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It <i><b>is</b></i> linked, so why repeat it here?

<dd>I've already rewritten it, thanks, and I requested nothing of the sort. I see no worthwhile revisions and have reverted accordingly, which is something I do <b>not</b> like to do.

My above challenge stands: one piece of actual <i>evidence</i> - is that too much to ask? Don't make this out to be an ideological disagreement, because there isn't one: I'd hoped you'd have worked that out by now, and I'd rather we were working together where there was real business to attend to. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraculus_67f8.html" title="User:Graculus">Graculus</a> 21:47, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can't avoid a certain amount of redundancy, because the link in running text doesn't necessarily explain its own significance. You need to set at least enough context so that readers can know whether they need to read <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Imperialism_8246.html" title="New Imperialism">New Imperialism</a> or can just say "yeah sure, economic engine of empire, I heard of it" and continue on. But the trick is to set it up for a broad range of readers without digressing into excruciating detail. Not a matter of evidence or proof, it's just a matter of good expository style. Since this is an encyclopedia and not a collection of self-published textbooks, we should also go for succinctness above all else, and then list all the books that readers should go to for the completely in-depth story (a list missing from this article btw, hint hint) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 22:33, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>US upper Midwest was claimed in the late 18th/early 19th centuries, although it wasn't exactly closely governed at the time.

<dd>I just came in here to post the same thing. One problem is that "At its height" is sort of an ambigious phrase. Does it mean at its height of power (presumably sometime in the late 19th century/early 20th), or is it just a way of saying "All the countries that have ever been part of the British Empire are..." I think it should be the latter, and I think the USA needs to be included on the list! In fact, if there are no objections here, I'm going to add the USA. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 05:25, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You could add specific colonies to the article under "First British Empire". "At its height" is clearly meant to mean at the height of its power, during what the article calls the 2nd British Empire. I gather an illustration once made this clearer. A "List of areas once under dominion of the British Crown" would be a different list. But the U.S.A. wouldn't be on either list, as it was not formed until after the colonies involved were no longer "in" the British Empire. -- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 05:34, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Size of empire?</span></h2>
<p>In the entry you stated the Mongol Empire was the largest empire ever. This is correct to some extent, it was the largest ever in the lifespan of one ruler and possibly in terms of population. The website below has figures on the sizes of the worlds empires:</p>

<p>The British Empire is widely considered as the largest empire in terms of land as maps and the figures from the site above prove. If you mean in terms of population the Mongol empire was the largest empire I think this should need clarify on the pages.</p>
<p>Cheers -Andrew</p>
<p>In terms of population is questionable. If it means total numbers present day China with over a billion takes it. If it means as a proportion of world population then that would still need proving. The British Empire was 1/4 of the world's population. If you include the Americas I doubt if Gengiz Khan did better. In area &amp; widespreadedness it certainly is. Neil Craig 10/11/4</p>

<p>The article, under the picture of John Cabot in Newfoundland, says that "Newfoundland was England's first overseas colony". Well, I was just down at Sandymount strand this evening and I can confirm without hesitation that there is an awful lot of sea between Ireland and England and, for that matter, Britain. As the great old song says 'The sea oh the sea long may it reign between England and me; it's a sure guarantee that some day we'll be free- oh thank God we're surrounded by water!"&#160;;-)</p>

<p>A new map has been uploaded, but I'm afraid I have some problems with it. Firstly it is a .jpg. It should be a .png. Secondly it's too small. A larger map would be handier (thumbnailed for this page). Thirdly it's not clear what date this map is for. It shows Iraq as part of the British Empire so I presume it is sometime between 1919 and 1941, however the geo-political boundaries look modern. Fourthly the image page has no information about its source or copyright status. Lastly - IT'S GREEN.

<p>Whether the edit war is sensible or not and which side's position is better is not an issue I want to go into, but it strikes me that the problem lies in the first bit of the 'Extent' section which starts 'At its height, the British Empire consisted of the following territories -' without giving a year for 'its height'. This leaves two options - (1) inserting a date; (2) listing all territories which were once under British control. Clearly, if we go for option (2), the thirteen colonies would need to be listed (along with a lot of other territories like Menorca, Heligoland and the Ionian Islands); if we go for option (1) we have the argument as to what date we pick, but after that we can go for a factual answer (and any sensible choice of date would be after the thirteen colonies were lost). Who supports which option? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">Jongarrettuk</a> 21:57, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Option 2 is basically what Mintguy suggested above. It's a good idea. It would be more work than option 1 but it would also be more informative. It makes sense to do option 1 short-term and option 2 long-term. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 04:45, 2004 Sep 27 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Superiority of the British Empire</span></h2>
<p>A recent anonymous editor removed the following text claiming it to be subjective (ie POV in Wikipedia jargon).</p>
<p>"Some argue that those countries which were colonised by Britain were spared the incompetence and brutality of some other European empires, such as the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> empires"</p>
<p>This seems to be based on a misunderstanding of what the statement is saying. Of course it is objectively verifiable, since it says that there are people who believe the superiority claim to be true and this can be checked by looking for the names of these people. It does not say that the superiority belief itself is true (and was almost certainly worded this way to avoid saying so). However I don't think that the statement should be returned to the article unless we replace "some people" by some named references. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 15:53, 2004 Oct 1 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That sounds very sensible. Furthermore I would suggest that the "some people" replacement would carry much more weight if it was a historian or politician from one of the former colonies. However, it may well be that there are no examples of such a quotation; if this is the case then the assertion may well be just a popular misconception in this country, and should probably not be made at all. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 21:51, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I come to this not as a historian but as someone who studied imperialism/decolonisation in politics. I think we should remember that we are not trying to justify the statement: our job is not to give the statement 'weight', but to present it to the reader as a viewpoint that is or could be held by some people (I for one hold this view at least as far as Africa is concerned), and ideally give him enough objective information to decide whether or not to accept it. The argument is basically based on two premises: 1. for e.g. most Africans in the late 19th/early 20th century the alternative to being colonised by Britain was not having an independent nation state, but being colonised by another European power; and 2. the British in Africa were not as brutal/incompetent as say the Belgians in Congo or the Portuguese in Angola. I definitely came across both statements when I was studying politics, and they might be easier to obtain examples separately. The counterargument that should be included to provide balance would be that of course this is only mitigation, and it does not excuse the British for what brutality or incompetence they caused or allowed to happen in the areas that they controlled. Alternatively, in an ideal (some might say fantasy) world the British would have established free states under their protection. I think as long as we make the arguments judiciously I can't think of anyone objecting. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Yong_429b.html" title="User:Andrew Yong">Andrew Yong</a> 20:42, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Superiority could be difined as success of the former colonies(democracy,standard of living, economic success).Britain did "establish free states under their protection". Some examples are Canada, Australia and New Zealand all of which enjoy a high standard of living at par or better than Great Britain, not to mention all the colonies in the carribean which enjoy for the most part political stability and high incomes.Correct me if I'm wrong, what other Nation or empire can boast that? Look at the success of the former colonies of France, Spain, Belgium, ect and you will see what I'm gettin at. P.S&#160;:please excuse my spelling...peace</p>

<p>I have some problems with anything pre-James I/VI in this article. Discussion of an English empire would surely be better elsewhere, that could include the Angle and Saxon settlement of Britain or Henry II's invasion of Ireland. The article does not explain how this background material is relevant to what resulted in the British Empire. I cannot see how the sort of economic and political manoeuvring described in section 1 had any bearing on the eventual form of the British empire unless it can be demonstrated that these acts were any different from those undertaken elsewhere in Europe at the time. Lumping a thousand years of history into one page smacks of an effort to exploit that supposedly convenient breakoff date of 1066, yet English society changed immensely between William I and Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>And another thing (!) How do a few shrewd royal marriages between the continental and English monarchies in the middle ages constitute 'English colonialism' anyway?. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a> 22:50, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree - apart from the fact that it wasn't Britain before then (or even prior to 1707 when Scotland &amp; England became 1 state rather than 2 with 1 head) the mercantile empire under discussion is different in kind from the dynastic Angevan Empire &amp; its offshoots. Neil Craig</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's fairer to say that the Empire started in the reign of Elizabeth I (with the founding of Roanoke and the East India Company, and the coining of the term itself by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dee_d7cc.html" title="John Dee">John Dee</a>). The French holdings of earlier English monarchs only need to be mentioned in order to make it clear that they are not considered to be part of the British Empire. Similarly the consolidation of England, Wales and Scotland is a necessary part of the context, but not part of the Empire. Naturally, the history of Ireland ruins this convenient distinction. The gradual English conquest would be relevant, but unfortunately I can't find an account of it anywhere in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/o/w/User%7ETownmouse_6fc6.html" title="User:Townmouse">Townmouse</a> 09:04, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
