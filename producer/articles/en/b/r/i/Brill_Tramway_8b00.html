It opened as the Wotton Tramway in 1871. It ran from <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quainton_Road_railway_station_c1ef.html" title="Quainton Road railway station">Quainton Road</a> (opened by the Aylesbury &amp; Buckingham Railway in 1868) to <a href="../../../w/a/d/Waddesdon.html" title="Waddesdon">Waddesdon</a> (renamed Waddesdon Road in 1922 and distinct from <a href="../../../w/a/d/Waddesdon_Manor_railway_station_91da.html" title="Waddesdon Manor railway station">Waddesdon Manor</a>, on the main line between <a href="../../../a/y/l/Aylesbury.html" title="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a> and Quainton Road), <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westcott%2C_Buckinghamshire_88e2.html" title="Westcott, Buckinghamshire">Westcott</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/t/Wotton_Underwood_4113.html" title="Wotton Underwood">Wotton</a> and Wood Siding.</p>

Magdalen Tower &amp; Bridge, Oxford: the proposed line from Brill was never built</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Plans for an <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, Aylesbury &amp; Metropolitan Junction Railway to extend the line from Brill to <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, 10 miles away, were drawn up in 1883, but never taken forward.</p>
<p>In 1888 Parliamentary powers for a similar scheme were obtained by the Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramway Company which, in 1894, took over the existing tramway. In December 1899 the Metropolitan acquired a lease on the line, but never took up an option to buy it <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Edwards &amp; Pigram (1983) <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> reproduced a map, based on a touring guide of 1894, which showed a possible route for the extension to Oxford. This identified intermediate halts at <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarstall.html" title="Boarstall">Boarstall</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studley.html" title="Studley">Studley</a> Wood, Stanton St John, and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headington.html" title="Headington">Headingtonwick</a> Farm. The Oxford <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminus.html" title="Terminus">terminus</a> would have been near <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdalen_Bridge_a67c.html" title="Magdalen Bridge">Magdalen Bridge</a>, on the edge of the city centre. Finance was never found for an extension and, indeed, to tunnel under Muswell Hill, west of Brill, which rises to about 600 feet, would likely have been prohibitive.</p>

<p>The next two locomotives were manufactured by <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._G._Bagnall_5bfc.html" title="W. G. Bagnall">W. G. Bagnall</a>:</p>

<li>"Buckingham", 0-4-0ST, works number 16, built 1876</li>
<li>"Wotton", 0-4-0T, works number 120, built 1877</li>

<p>They were unusual in having "reversed" inside cylinders which drove the front axle.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a> the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_and_Metropolitan_District_Railways_cc9e.html#Aylesbury-Verney_Junction" title="Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> took over the working of the tramway, and by then two <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manning_Wardle_0c50.html" title="Manning Wardle">Manning Wardle</a> locomotives were in use, one of which was replaced by another Manning Wardle in 1899:</p>

<li>"Earl Temple", works number 1249, built 1894</li>
<li>"Wotton No.2", works number 1415, built 1899</li>
