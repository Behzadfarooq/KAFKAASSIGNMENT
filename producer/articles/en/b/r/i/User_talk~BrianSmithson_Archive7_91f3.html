<p>While B.S. is in Japan.</p>
<p>The American Broadcasting Company did air only two half-hour specials on Charlie "Brown", which is the cartoon dog character I know of, so it is him. I am sure it did INDEED feature him, but I didn't watch these "specials" on television, has anyone seen these comics? - Why? Because it said Charlie "Brown", and who said he should not be aired. - I haven't watched any of the reruns of his own half-hour shows from the early 1990s to today.</p>

<p>Hi BrianSmithson - I've noticed you are an active participant on the MoS (fiction) page &amp; I was quite impressed by your User biography page. Quack688 and I have been working on a revised MoS (fiction) that better encapsulates our views on guiding new Wikipedia users to generate better articles on fictional subjects.</p>
<p>My hope is to generate a guide that is less prescriptive and confrontational. I've noted that some people have very strong views on what they think all fictional pages should be like. I personally feel a balance has to be struck so that we can push for an encyclopedic style while <i>not discouraging the active Wikipedia contributors that have helped made Wikipedia what it has now become.</i></p>
<p>The current page is also mainly focussed on discouraging an in-universe style. As you can tell from my previous posts, I think this style is not intrisically inferior. <i>I also feel that there are far more important features to focus on when developing a great article about fiction.</i></p>
<p>If you have a chance, please take a look at our <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_draft_revision_9841.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)/draft revision">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)/draft revision</a>. I'd be interested in your comments; feel free to leave them on the talk page and/or make changes to the draft itself.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kaissa</span></h2>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I am glad to see that you have written so much about Africa. I enjoy doing the same. I noticed your recent edit to Kaissa added the "Africa-bio-stub" to it. I just wanted to let you know that only people without national templates (like an African from Mayotte but not Comoros) should get the Africa-bio-stub template. Good work otherwise and keep it up!--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 04:25, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Thomas. I'm not sure what you mean. I'm laying the groundwork to propose a {{Cameroon-bio-stub}}, so I'm going through tagging pages that need it with {{Africa-bio-stub}} and {{Cameroon-stub}}. If and when my proposal is accepted, these will all be replaced with {{Cameroon-bio-stub}}. -- <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 04:29, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is not needed. All you need to do is do a hand count of the Cameroon stubs with people and then propose it. I am all in favor of dividing the Africa national stubs wherever possible, so you can count on my support for that. Let me know when you propose it so I don't miss it. But otherwise, you should revert the edits adding Africa-bio-stub, as its redundant and says at the top of the category. Check out <a href="../../../a/f/r/Category%7EAfrican_people_stubs_eb2c.html" title="Category:African people stubs">the category</a> to see for yourself. Also consider moving the stubs to the bottom of the page, as this is proper stub etiquette.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas.macmillan_a8c6.html" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">Thomas.macmillan</a> 04:37, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings Brian</p>
<p>I'm glad you take an interest in the African material. We need a lot more editors like that. The reason I wrote like I did was that <a href="../../../a/f/r/Category%7EAfrican_people_stubs_eb2c.html" title="Category:African people stubs">Cat:African people stubs</a> was getting completely out of hand. Back when we only created new stub templates whenever we were 100% sure we had 60 relevant articles or more, you can imagine how this category completely swamped with 20 articles from one country, 30 from another and 40 from a third, etc etc. I remember sorting 800+ politicians out of the entire mess, and that was just the beginning. Having all of this material grouped together also made it extremely difficult to check for new potential splitoffs since it meant that I had to count all of it everytime. Even worse, many articles were only tagged with {{<a href="../../../a/f/r/Template%7EAfrica-bio-stub_b74a.html" title="Template:Africa-bio-stub">Africa-bio-stub</a>}} rather than e.g. {{<a href="../../../s/u/d/Template%7ESudan-stub_b5ce.html" title="Template:Sudan-stub">Sudan-stub</a>}} and it makes more sense to me to sort material by country rather than by continent.</p>
<p>I couldn't see any better way to get this material under some kind of control. It is also a response to some of the criticism we've faced for adding too many stub templates to articles. Since it is pretty easy to browse e.g. <a href="../../../s/u/d/Category%7ESudan_stubs_71d6.html" title="Category:Sudan stubs">Cat:Sudan stubs</a> for articles about persons, we can still get a good idea about the size of this material.</p>
<p>After I wrote this note, WP:WSS has somewhat softened the requirements for new templates, so if you know of a country with a large number of biographical stub articles, e.g. 40 articles or so, feel free to propose an upmerged template at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>. Imagine this is the case for Cameroon. If we create a new {{<a href="../../../c/a/m/Template%7ECameroon-bio-stub_6f0a.html" title="Template:Cameroon-bio-stub">Cameroon-bio-stub</a>}} template but make it use the existing <a href="../../../c/a/m/Category%7ECameroon_stubs_6a4c.html" title="Category:Cameroon stubs">Cat:Cameroon stubs</a> category (rather than creating a new <a href="../../../c/a/m/Category%7ECameroonian_people_stubs_2a45.html" title="Category:Cameroonian people stubs">Cat:Cameroonian people stubs</a>), this will mean that we can begin using the new template before we have the required number of 60 stub articles. Once the material grows beyond the 60+ threshold, we can simply create a new category for the template to use. The benefit of doing things this way is that people can find a template under the expected name, and we can avoid a few high-risk categories from getting completely out of control. <a href="../../../a/f/r/Category%7EAfrican_people_stubs_eb2c.html" title="Category:African people stubs">Cat:African people stubs</a> was a very bad example of this.

<dd>I assume that the line about his performing in minstrel shows is true (or at least, since this is Harlan Ellison, part of his self-created history: it's sometimes hard to tell) - but the page is re-read so many times by his fans that I would have guessed any outright invention would have been removed long ago.</dd>
<dd>But, we are in cultural miscommunication territory here - I would never have associated "minstrel show" directly with "blackface ministrels". Thank you for responding to my query - I'll ask on the Talk page of the Harlan Ellison page if this category is appropriate for that biographical reference. Someone will know.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">pretentious prose!</span></h2>
<p>Yes, it's a problem, isn't it. Many inexperienced writers want to use short-cuts to spruce up their prose with overly formal, difficul-to-read constructions. "Whilst", "amongst", "upon" are words I particularly hate in most contexts. Long sentences need to be chopped up, but here, the boundary beyond which a sentence is <i>too long</i> is harder to establish.</p>
<p>I'm all for providing examples and asking them to fix it. Plain English is very important given the wide range of backgrounds—linguistic and educational—of our readership. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 10:50, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I can only really do it if I let the piece go fallow for a while before returning to it, and then it's still always better to have a second pair of eyes go over the thing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dixie authorship</span></h2>
<p>Hello, Brian Smithson. Joseph Byrd here. I appreciate the contributions you've made to the Encyclopedia, and your breadth of interest, but I'm confused as to why you removed my edits to the Dan Emmett page. Everything I said is well-documented, and I'm told by another editor that I've violated no copyright in my citation from a Dan Emmett outside link. I wrote defending Emmett's authorship of Dixie, and added a bit that refutes a common misinterpretation of his feelings about the song. I could easily quote you the details (which I felt were too scholarly to bother with in a popular setting). There is no doubt about the correctness, yet you essentially eviscerated everything I wrote. Would you care to explain why?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Josephbyrd 04:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. In Nathan's exhaustive book, he says, "Ëmmett was devoid of any business instinct. Instead of publishing and immediately copyrighting "Dixie,' which was on everyone's lips, he waited more than a year before giving it to Firth, Pond &amp; Co. They deposited it with the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York on June 21, 1860. Other publishers, considering the tune public property, were hard at their heels. For example, on June 26, Joh Church Jr., in Cincinnat, 'filed a piano arrangement...but acknowledged in a later edition, no doubt under pressure, the permission of the original publishers'."</p>
<p>There is also citation of a convention of music dealers that year, in which it was acknowledged that Emmett was the author.</p>
<p>The matter of Emmett's feelings about the legacy of his song is more complex. There is, I agree a story of Emmett's having said, "If I had known to what use they were going to put my song, I will be damned if I'd have written it." But that story is countered by the interview he later gave to the editor of The Confederate Veteran in 1895. And the context of the premiere performance, in the Bowery district, the heart of Democratic opposition to the coming war, together with the lyrics I quoted (likewise from Nathan), make it clear that he was sympathetic to the view that blacks were better off in the South.</p>
<p>As to Emmett's memory lapses and inconsistency, if that were the criterion, composers (including myself) would be in deep trouble. I'm currently being questioned by people regarding what I wrote or said 40 years ago, and my memories are as flawed as Emmett's. The alleged comment in the previous paragraph is at best third hand, being quoted from a letter from Col. T. Allston Brown, who was not even present at the conversation. It is thus third-hand hearsay. In any case, it is not justification for wholesale removal of an edit.</p>

<p>I saw your revert of my edit removing the link to CDU from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cameroon-related_topics_8125.html" title="List of Cameroon-related topics">List of Cameroon-related topics</a>. I've been trying to fix references to CDU (most of which refer to the German party). I found the Cameroon page pointing to the <a href="../../../c/d/u/CDU_3208.html" title="CDU">CDU</a> disambiguation page, but with no reference to the Cameroon party on that page. After you reverted my edit, I dug some more into this and found that there is a page on the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Union_of_Cameroon_ce8f.html" title="Democratic Union of Cameroon">Democratic Union of Cameroon</a> and have added that as a link on the CDU page, though it appears as though this party is more commonly referred to as DUC or its French acronym UDC.</p>
<p>I'm fairly new to disambiguation, so I'm curious about your suggestions about how to handle the current link to CDU on the list page. As I understand it, there we should avoid links to a disambiguation page if there's a specific page for the topic. Should I change the CDU link to point to the specific page like this?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Union_of_Cameroon_ce8f.html" title="Democratic Union of Cameroon">Cameroon Democratic Union</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Union_of_Cameroon_ce8f.html" title="Democratic Union of Cameroon">CDU</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or should I leave the CDU link pointing to the CDU disambiguation page?</p>

<dd>Hi, Rick. No, you did nothing wrong. The reason I restored the link was because <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Cameroon-related_topics_8125.html" title="List of Cameroon-related topics">List of Cameroon-related topics</a> is as much an administrative list as it is an actual Wikipedia article, so there are other concerns involved from the run-of-the-mill disambiguation link repair. The idea is that the acronyms on that page should remain linked until they are checked to ensure that the organizations referred to are listed on the appropriate disambiguation pages. For example, <a href="../../../c/d/c/CDC_b451.html" title="CDC">CDC</a> should stay linked until someone checks to make sure that the <a href="../../../c/d/c/CDC_b451.html" title="CDC">CDC</a> disambiguation page lists the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameroon_Development_Corporation_f0f4.html" title="Cameroon Development Corporation">Cameroon Development Corporation</a>. Only then should the link be removed from the list page. You did this for CDU, so I've gone ahead and removed the link. Thanks for taking the time to ask about this. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 06:00, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The change you are taking in the ALT section looks like you are from the Interac yourself. What kind of JET program are you in? Who organized it? Interac? In Japan everybody knows that Interac is owned by Selnate is owned by Selnate Utah, which is obviously a mormon company working with the BYU (mormon university). The head of Selnate is mormon and the the evidence of Selnate being a mormon company is very strong. The involvement of mormons in Asian English language training is very public fact, that is being hidden by Interac without success.</p>

<p>Why are you defending the Interac? I am curious about you now.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have nothing to do with Interac. I'm just a firm believer in Wikipedia's <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">source citation</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiability</a> policies. Rumors don't belong in articles unless there is proof that they are true. So far, you haven't shown that Interac is affiliated with the Mormon church, so I've removed the material. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 08:18, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
