<p>Apropos to the discussions below, why does this page still exist? Britain has always been a short form of Great Britain. The sole purpose seems to be to claim that the UK is the same as Britain, which goes entirely against Wikipedia's aim to be <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">accurate</a>. Just to confirm, the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines Britain thus: 'The proper name of the whole island containing England, Wales, and Scotland, with their dependencies; more fully called Great Britain.'</p>

<li><b>Disagree</b>. Regardless of perceptions of accuracy, "Britain" is used to refer to the UK far more often than it is as a reference to the island of Great Britain. The redirect should be to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, or the content changed to a disambiguation page to give visitors the choice. After all, they know which of the two they were looking for; we don't - although I think it far more likely that most visitors would be thinking of the UK, not the island. <a href="../../../w/a/g/User%7EWaggers_8e5b.html" title="User:Waggers">Waggers</a> 14:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Disagree</b>.

<li><b>Disagree</b>, but not for that reason. This article was meant to be about the WORD Britain; information about Britain itself is under Great Britain.

<li><b>Disagree</b> There are two different concepts here: The political entity (more fully the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) which is called Britain (<b>not</b> <i>Great</i> Britain) and includes Northern Ireland, and the geographical <b>Great</b> Britain which is occasionally referred to as Britain. <a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMucky_Duck_3e3b.html" title="User:Mucky Duck">Mucky Duck</a> 08:24, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Disagree</b>. Britain is most commonly used to mean the United Kingdom. For example the Economist magazine uses the term "Britain" in their section which clearly refers to the UK not GB. GB is clearly rather specific and geographical, while Britain is more versatile.~~Howard</li>

<p>Why is a page about Britain even mentioning Ireland? Ireland may have been part of the United Kingdom at one time, just as Northern Ireland now is (no ambiguity there) but it has not been part of Britain (or vice-versa) since the last Ice Age. However the article sems to claim that it was part of Britain until 1921!</p>
<p>This article is very misleading and I'm inclined to ditch the references to Ireland unless someone can come up with good reasons not to. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In response to Derek Ross: Part of the United Kingdom does mean that Ireland was literally connected to the mainland! It means that it was ruled and overseen by the United Kingdom (Actual full name when Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom-'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland') unntil it was granted independence in 1921! hmmm? Not up on your history are you?</p>
<p>Yes Derek Ross, it doesn't mean part of literally! Michael Collins went to London and did a deal with Westminster that partitioned the country in two, how it still is today, with the 6 counties of Ulster remaining as part of Britain-now the full name is 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.<a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETammiMagee_2d02.html" title="User:TammiMagee">TammiMagee</a> 14:39, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to The Oxford Companion to the English Language, when Ireland entered the Union in the early 19th century, it was referred to as "West Britain" (I don't know who by) - see <a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry/441278" class="external free" title="http://www.xrefer.com/entry/441278" rel="nofollow">http://www.xrefer.com/entry/441278</a> Whether this should be under "Britain" or "Great Britain" I'm not sure, but I should think the former. There is also the historical use of "Britain" before "Great Britain" was thought of. You have Great Britain the island, West Britain (for a time), and Brittany (Little Britain if you like) in France. I don't know enough about this to elaborate, but it seems there could be a decent historical article here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, many of the English (and maybe others, I don't know) refer to the UK as "Britain" in speech - perhaps this rather subtle twist resulted in the somewhat messed up article that was here. A note pointing this out could be useful. In any case, surely "Britain" alone deserves an article. I'll do a bit of research and see if I can put something together. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is old news now, but I want to go back on what I said here - I now think that it's correct that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> (I reserve the right to change my mind again later...). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the "West Britain" discussion belongs in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. A particularly interesting point for that article is whether Ireland was always part of the "British Isles" or whether it was added as "West Britain".</dd>
</dl>
<p>"West Britain" may be by analogy with "North Britain" for Scotland and "South Britain" for England which were also coined by some the more zealous Unionists in the 19th century. However none of these terms came into general use by the British or Irish population apart from in company names like <i>The North British Railway</i>. There is a small amount of logic in calling Scotland and England, "North Britain" and "South Britain", whereas calling Ireland "West Britain" just seems silly. Most Britons and Irishmen would think that West Britain meant Wales or Cornwall -- never Ireland. No doubt that's why it didn't catch on even in Unionist circles. You could add this North/South/West Britain info to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> article or the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> article if you really think it worthwhile but I don't see that we need a separate "Britain" article for it. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></p>

<dd>The BRitain/great brittan/brittany thing is already explained on the great britain article... <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKaren_Johnson_02f6.html" title="User:Karen Johnson">KJ</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>It's probably OK to redirect Britain and British to Great Britain, if the latter article discusses the terms and explains the confusion. One possible confusion would be if people from other islands describe themselves or are described by others as "British". It should be easy to explain why the NI Unionists are sometimes called "British" by the (rest of) the Irish.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, what's the correct term to describe a citizen of the UK, if it's not "British"? I guess it's "UK subject"?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Accoring to this discussion, articles like: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1815014.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1815014.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1815014.stm</a> 'Gibraltar wants to remain British' quote: "Gibraltar has been British for nearly 300 years and we want to continue to be British. We don't want to be Spanish." don't make a lot of sense. Perhaps the BBC (British(!) Broadcasting) misuses the term?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No worse than using "American" to mean "Unitedstatesian", is it? In linguistic matters, common usage is correct by default. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Often this is the case, which suggests to me that the redirect to "Great Britain" is incorrect. "Britain" was an old term for Great Britain and Britany which got reused for the new combined realm that became the UK. I.e., the association to the UK is now the strongest usage. So I think the previous versions of Britain and British should be reverted and the Britain article improved as required (don't remove the stuff about Ireland, which became part of the "British Empire", but improve as required).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not a good idea to confuse an article on Great Britain, which is a well-defined concept of an island, with stuff about "Britain" which is used in various ways.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>--</p>
<p>I think rather than re-direct all of "Britan" to "Great Britan" we should do this to make it clear that "Britain" is often used ambiguously. So I'm putting some text back here - a sort of disambiguation page, with a bit of text expalaining why there's confusion. I've tried to keep it a history of the word "Britain" and leave out politics as as much as possible. That can go in the other articles.</p>
<p>I don't think there's any ultimate authority for what is the "correct" use of an English word - just common usage. (There are "official" country names, but that doesn't help in this case). But we can say, for instance, that certain usages can be offensive to some people. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_G_ad96.html" title="User:Andy G">Andy G</a> 16:50 4 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. This page looks like a good explanation. I'm not sure about redirecting <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> here, though.

<dd>I don't know what word you'd use to mean "of Britain" if not "British" - it certainly seems ambiguous to me (usually context will sort it out, of course). That said, I think it's fine that <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> redirects here since this article explains the various usages of both words (I suppose it's also fine if it's a disambig page and doesn't redirect here). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>Sorry, I just meant that "British" can mean something other than "of Britain"; a redirect would suggest that it <i>only</i> meant "of Britain". Yes, I know that's not what I said, but that's what I meant. I really shouldn't keep coming here at 02:something in the morning... But yes, I agree that the term is ambiguous. I reverted <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> back to an old disambiguation page last night. However, I suppose if this page makes clear that "British" doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean "of Britain", then redirecting it <i>might</i> be all right. Then again, it might not, because someone seeing themselves being redirected to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> might just think that it means "of Britain", and not bother reading far enough into the article to find out that it might not. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 01:39 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>to the island forming the largest part of the territory of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>,</i></li>

<li><i>least accurately of all, to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> as a whole.

</ul>
<p>Surely if Great Britain is intended, the outlying islands are included - just as the Isle of Man includes the Calf of Man. For the single island alone, you'd probably say "mainland Britain".

<dd>You are incorrect. The Republic of Ireland competes in the Olympics as "Ireland". The United Kingdom competes as "GB", indicating Great Britain. As part of the nation of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland competes under the tag "GB". Although these terminologies are incorrect (for both "Ireland" and "GB"), this is simply how it is. In the case specifically of Northern Ireland however, a resident of NI can compete with the Republic of Ireland team if they so wish. Sometimes it depends on the governing body of the sport to which they belong. For example, some Judo clubs in Northern Ireland belong to the IJF (Irish [Republic] Judo Federation), and some to the NIJF (Northern Ireland Judo Federation) which is affiliated to the British Judo Federation. Reference to Northern Ireland and its inclusion in the national Olympic Games GB team is mentioned in the official website. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 08:01, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The US-led <a href="../../../i/s/o/Iso.html" title="Iso">Iso</a> committee did not use <i>UK</i> for this purpose on the IMO irrelevant grounds that the letters of <i>UK</i> stand for a non-geographical/generic term (which of course doesn't apply to their decision to use <i>US</i> for the USA).

<dd>With regard to what is "inaccurate", it is indeed inaccurate to describe the United Kingdom as "Britain", as "Great Britain", as "England", or to describe England as "Britain" etc etc. It is also misleading to perpetrate incorrect usage. I have personally come across many foreigners who are completely confused by the concepts - concepts that are really very simple. For example, someone telling me (I am a British citizen and a resident of the UK) that I was wrong and that the UK is England and vice versa.

<dd>But this isnt especially what I <i>think</i>. Look at the sources on the page - this is as used by the government and the BBC, not just your 'average man in the street'. Whilst defining terms technically, Wikipedia also has to reflect offical useage, even wherfe it may be wrong. Note that I use the term <i>inaccurate</i> to mean soemthing different to <i>incorrect</i>. The British Isles terminology page is clearly linked at the top of this article for people who are confused. But that does not change the <b>undisputable fact</b> that Britain means UK and that 'British' should direct here, to an article that expalins clearly its uses. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 00:14, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article describes the first recorded name for the British Isles as the "Isles of Elishah". The first time I saw this part of the article I did a google search for the term (actually at that point it said "Isles of Elishas") and the only references to it were either taken from copies of this article, or said that the term referred to the greek islands e.g <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd118.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd118.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/ebd/ebd118.htm</a> I deleted the reference to "Isles of Elishas" in this article.</p>
<p>The reference was put back in place by Setanta747 as "Isles of Elishah" with a user comment:</p>
<p>(Historical evidence strongly suggests the first inhabitants of the British isles were the descendants of Javan (from his sons Elisha and Tarshish), and of Gomer and Magog.)</p>
<p>While I am pleased that Setanta747 spent time to explain his views, this comment does not cite where this historical evidence can be found either online or in books, and describes the first inhabitants of Britain as being various Biblican characters for whom there is no other historical evidence.</p>
<p>I later added a "Citation Needed" but it was quickly removed by the same user... does anyone think this part of the article need to be looked at? <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaid100_d928.html" title="User:Kaid100">kaid100</a></p>

<dd>No, this is absolutely too much. "Try Google" is not a useful response to people who are asking for a source for a statement. We have all tried Google. We have all found Ez 27:7 and this mention of "the isles of Elishah". We all seem to have found the same "believed to refer to Greece" glosses. What no-one has yet found is a link between any of this and attested references to "Britain". <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are fairly clear on what constitutes a reasonable cite. "Try Google" is not one. This purported factoid should be removed from the article (and <i>certainly</i> from a section called "attested") until we have something more substantial than vague assertions of historical evidence in edit summaries. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 15:23, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is entitled "Britain". And the list is entitled "Earliest attested references". I think it's fair to take that as "references to Britain". I take it the book you added in a cite tag is your reference? What exactly does it claim? It's out of print and the reviews on the web are more interested in its claims about Cruthin being the original inhabitants of Ireland than in the idea that the Bible mentions any part of these islands. I only ended up with this article on my watchlist after correcting a link somewhere, so this is not a topic I have strong opinions on (beyond finding it unlikely that Ezekiel was referring to Britain). But I do have strong opinions on Wikipedia sources and quoting them: so what exactly does this book claim? And is the author someone in a position to demonstrate that isles of Elishah refers to the British Isles, rather than to parts of Greece? Finally, arbitrarily restoring this claim to view every time you edit the page is a bit unilateral. If there is any consensus on this talk page, it is that this information is at best dubious. So why do you keep reinserting it? Please, <i>explain</i> a bit more on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 12:02, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am aware of the title article and of the section heading. The last entry in the list also refers to the British Isles, and the history of that term is intrinsically linked to the name Great Britain. I think it's fair to take that as references to the British Isles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The book I added is <b>a</b> reference. The author is knowledgable about the history of both the British Isles and Christianity.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps this discussion, and the Isles of Elishah reference, would be better placed in the British Isles article. However, I still think the entire claim is highly dubious, and a quote from the book would be welcome (under fair use of copyright) either on a talk page or in the article itself. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaid100_d928.html" title="User:Kaid100">kaid100</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I added the following clarification to the inclusion of the term, which was then reverted without explanation. I think that if it is included, we should note that this is far from a certain reference and clearly disputed. I felt that this compromised between including it but also noting its questionable status. My version read:</dd>
</dl>
<p>'Ezekiel chapter 27 in the Bible (dated to c.500 BC) refers to the Isles of Elishah which some claim to be a refernce to the British Isles and Brtiain. This is because the Iseles of Elishah, like Britain, were at the time known for their production of a blue dye. This references is contested, however, with many claiming that it refers to islands in Greece <a href="http://dictionary.crossmap.com/definition/elishah.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.crossmap.com/definition/elishah.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.'</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, if we are contesting this version, perhaps we should be getting sources for all of these claims? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 15:50, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I note that Setanta747 has removed the compromise version and replaced it with his own. I have decided to take the liberty of removing the Isles of Elishah completely. My reasons are as follows:
<dl>
<dd>No webpage mentions any connection between Isles of Elishah, except this page and copies of it.</dd>
<dd>No Usenet article suggests a connection, and most wild theories- whether true or false- end up there at some point.</dd>
<dd>My copies of Mythology of British Isles by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Ashe_9fba.html" title="Geoffrey Ashe">Geoffrey Ashe</a>, Bulfinch's Mythology and the slightly lower-brow Mythology For Dummies make no reference to the Isles of Elishah</dd>
<dd>Many webpages suggest the Greek Islands are a possibility for the Isles of Elishah</dd>
<dd>The webpage linked in the article does not mention the Isles of Elishah, only a person named Elisha</dd>
<dd>As far as I can tell only one person has ever suggested a connection between the Isles of Elishah and Britain</dd>
<dd>By the user's own admission this is a reference to the British Isles, not Britain, and so I would argue it is more suited to the page on the British Isles</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If any user should put the Isles of Elishah back on the main page without consensus here, I think we should consider going to arbitration. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaid100_d928.html" title="User:Kaid100">kaid100</a> 18:09, 17 April 2006 (BST)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with almost of Kaid's points. However, if Mal aka <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">User:Setanta747</a> does not accept this suggestion that the thing be removed pending a quote (not just a book title), then I am not sure that arbitration is necessarily the immediate step from here.

But before anything like that, can I ask Setanta747 again for a nice quote from the book so that we are all sure what we are discussing? We seem to have moved from "The Bible mentions Britain" to "the Bible mentions the British Isles" to "A book about Irish Picts supports this" with no explanation of which of the first two "this" is. We really do need a quote and some context from that book.

<dd>I'm responding to the RfC.

<p>I agree that this is something to do; however, you have also ignored all the comments from the rfc.

<dd>My comment on vagueness was related to the lack of any direct quotes from the book you cite. The author of the website article does not appear, at present, to hold any qualifications related to the matter. It is not the main focus of the article, nor does it cite what historical evidence there is. It gives the impression, to me at least, of him repeating something he read elsewhere - in my opinion, it does not qualify under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Which means, pending authoritative quotes from the book, I don't think it should be included.

<p>To avoid edit-warring, I will stop editing the article page until this issue is resolved. Point-by-point:</p>

<dd>"No webpage mentions any connection between Isles of Elishah, except this page and copies of it."</dd>
<dd><i>.. I seem to recall adding a website reference as a source to my last edit (which I will be adding back once I have finished editing this talk page)</i><br /></dd>

Assuming the website you mean is <a href="http://www.soundchristian.com/man/" class="external free" title="http://www.soundchristian.com/man/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundchristian.com/man/</a> , the "Isles of Elishah are not mentioned on that page. If there is another page you mean, I would be happy to look at it.
<dl>
<dd>You should read the article more carefully.
<dl>
<dd>I did reas it carefully. As I said before, I can find no memntion of the Isles of Elishah, only a person named Elisha. Saying that Elisha was an ancestor of the inhabitants of Britain, even if true, is not the same as saying that the British Isles have also been called the Isles of Elishah</dd>

The initial response from the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_History_and_geography_5e1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/History and geography">RFC</a> has been the same. You have now come up with one book and one web page to support your idea, and you still haven't given us an exact quote. In fact, you are starting to appear downright evasive on the matter. In turn, I start to suspect that this is a fringe theory. <a href="../../../n/e/u/WP%7ENeutral_point_of_view_15f3.html" title="WP:Neutral point of view">WP:Neutral point of view</a> does <i>not</i> compel us to give equal time to fringe theories. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">It doesn't compel us to give any time to fringe theories.</a></dd>

<dd>About the web page you mentioned: <a href="http://www.soundchristian.com/man/" class="external free" title="http://www.soundchristian.com/man/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundchristian.com/man/</a> is a web page written from the point of view that the Bible is a reliable historical source and that all peoples on this earth descended from three people in the Old Testament. Wikipedia has a lot on this theory (and several variants of it) already: <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japheth.html" title="Japheth">Japheth</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japhetic.html" title="Japhetic">Japhetic</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomer_%28Bible%29_421f.html" title="Gomer (Bible)">Gomer (Bible)</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a> (who wrote a lot of this down), <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Israelism_2bd2.html" title="British Israelism">British Israelism</a>, and more. If this is the point you wish to see covered by Wikipedia, fret not: it is all here. What this web page <i>doesn't</i> include is any reference to Isles of Elishah. There's "Isle of Britain", "Isles of the Gentiles", "Tin Isles", but nothing related to Elishah.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So we are left with your book, <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Adamson_5f37.html" title="Ian Adamson">Ian Adamson</a>'s <i>The Cruthin</i>. Of which you say, in response to my mention of references to it on the web, "it's not about that", but you don't tell us what it <i>is</i> about; and further, "<i>when I find my copy of the book, I might consider typing in the paragraphs that the author mentions this in.</i>" Might consider? How .. considerate. From your responses to others ("I did cite it" etc), I think you may be misunderstanding what citing is. We need not just a book title, but either an accurate summary of what he's saying or some quotes directly from it, which interested readers can then <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">follow up for themselves</a>. If the book was in either of my local libraries, I would have found it and skimmed it by now just to find out what on earth this is all about. But it isn't. So I must rely on someone with the book bothering to summarise -- or to type in quotes with their context from -- the thing. Since you disparage the comments about it on the web (which is a surprise to me, since one of the top hits is a glowing five-stars-out-of-five review), we obviously cannot rely on impressions gained from the web, and are reliant on someone telling us what this wretched book's about and what, precisely, it says. You say you might consider this? Do let us know when you have finished your deliberations.</dd>

<dd>I will of course answer any questions put to me, but I feel that "Excuse me?" is a statement with a question mark at the end rather than a question.

Also, if Setanta747 is claiming that the name Elishah is the same as Elisha in Hebrew, a cite would be handy for that too.

I'm tempted to say that even with caveats the Isles of Elishah shouldn't be here. We can't find any evidence that they were ever connected to Britain before Setanta first added the reference on 20 March 2006. I'm even wondering if this is Setanta's own private theory <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a>.

<dd>No - you're just tempted, full stop. When you say "we", who are you talking about? You may wonder if this is my own private theory.. right up until you actually ask me if it is. As for "no-one has ever found any sign that this reference has ever appeared anywhere" - I have just told you: you stand corrected.

<dd>Okay I will ask you straight, Is this your own private theory? If anyone has found a sign that this reference has appeared elsewhere, then they've yet to post it to this discussion group.

<dd>No - it is most definately not my private theory. You say that you're not sure that a book reference counts as the person who referred to it (that was me by the way), can't find <i>his</i> copy of it and is unable to provide a quote from it. Yet I have accepted many factoids in other articles when editors have cited books as sources - without having insisted on quotes from those books.

<dd>I think you misunderstand me Mal, I was never rabidly against the idea of the "Isles of Elishas" referring to Britain or the British Isles, in fact I quite liked the idea when I first saw it, which is what led me to look into more details, leading me to find the 'Greek Islands' references. It was having my changes to the main page, like deleting the reference and later adding a 'citation needed', removed with no citations that led me to bring it to this discussion page, rather than because I was dead set against the idea.</dd>

<dd>As the debate has continued, I've spent some time looking for references to the "Isles of Elishah" online and in books, even heading to my local library to chase up the Ian Adamson reference. I have by comparison spent far less time on the Pretannike and Britannia references, and the fact that citations were found so quickly means that the "Isles of Elishah" reference does not compare favourably with them, especially since no pages or books were found that said that either Pretannike or Britannia might refer to any other place. It was Robdurbar that included a list of references needing citations without the Isles of Elishah, and that was the list I was going by. You can still see it at the top of this section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I see from your User Contributions page that you are used to taking the side of unionism against nationalism in pages connected to the Northern Ireland debate, often leading to long edit wars. That is a debate with firmly entrenched views, where citations will often not change people minds. My views are not entrenched. I would be quite happy for Britain to have been mentioned in the Bible -I am British myself- but I would rather the information given on Wikipedia about my home country was accurate rather than inaccurate, and that is why I have been trying to remove the reference. If you could share with me why you want to keep this factoid in so much, I think it would help us understand each others views. However, I notice that the more recent posts here, including this one, have concentrated less on finding evidence for the reference, and more on examining people's motives. That would imply to me that the discussion on the reference itself is now over.</dd>

<dd>You have stated here that I am <i>"used to taking the side of unionism against nationalism in pages connected to the Northern Ireland debate, often leading to long edit wars."</i> This is untrue actually. The vast majority of my edits have been of a NPOV point of view - what I usually do is change POV statements to a more neutral standard and these, for the most part, are supported by consensus. Occassionally though, some POV-pushers do try to revert some of my edits back. These are quickly reverted by other users in most cases though. On occassion I have also changed unionist-POV edits to a more neutral phrasing too. Perhaps you haven't noticed that as much - most unionist-POV edits are quite quickly reverted by other people.</dd>

<p>I'm posting here because I saw the RfC, &amp; have done some research that sheds some light on this source. Ian Adamson's work is criticized <a href="http://www.etext.org/Politics/INAC/historical.revisionism" class="external text" title="http://www.etext.org/Politics/INAC/historical.revisionism" rel="nofollow">here</a> by P.B. Ellis, an estabished historian, who labels Dr Adamson's research "historical revisonism." While Ellis' lecture is clearly polemical, he does show that Adamson's principal arguments are founded on shakey grounds. I would say the issue properly should be whether this identification exists beyond Dr Adamson's writings or it is solely his theory; if it is his own theory &amp; he is the most prominent advocate of it, then should we include it in this article? (Note: Dr Adamson is a medical doctor &amp; a politician; his background is not in history, archeology, or Biblical scholarship.) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:08, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Adamson's books are criticised, yes. They are also highly praised. Most of the criticism comes from <i>purists</i> who still believe that what is written in the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebor_Gabala_Erenn_4596.html" title="Lebor Gabala Erenn">Lebor Gabala Erenn</a> is the gospel facts. That historical documentation has been proven to be historical revisionism, and historical revisionism, with a specific emphasis on establishing the Gaels as the aboriginal inhabitants of Ireland, reached a peak in the 19th and 20th centuries. Adamson's work (and the work he based it on) is seen by many established historians as going some way to redress the balance in that respect.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Adamson "founded the Ulster-Scots (Ullans) Academy and is the author of many authoritative books on Ulster history." He speaks ten languages (including Ulster-Scots of course). He is also President of Belfast Civic Trust, founder Chair of the Somme Association, founder Secretary of the Farset Youth and Community Development, Belfast, a former member of the Boards of many other local public sector and voluntary organisations, including The Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Ulster Museum, the Titanic Trust, The Eastern Health and Social Services Board, the Ultach Trust. He clearly has more than merely a passing interest in history and culture.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I am not interested as much in defending Adamson against criticism and only offer the above in answer <i>to</i> the highlighting of criticism that was offered above. However, the criticism of his historical works by Ellis should also be addressed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ellis is obviously an Irish nationalist (as Adamson is obviously an Irish unionist). But Ellis claims that Adamson is anti-nationalist (part of the title of his article). He fails to mention Adamson's own words in the context of his books, which insist on his hopes that shedding light on certain glaring errors of the Gaelic Revivalists' (read: revisionists) accounts of history "provides for them a basis of common identity rather than the cause of that running sore which is 'The War in Ireland'".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ellis also contradicts himself, and the basis of his article, by stating that "the label [Historical Revisionism] is meaningless" and that "all historians worth their salt are 'revisionists'". And again, when his article's subtitle states: "The New Anti-Nationalist School of Historians" and then states that it is "not ... a new phenomenon".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is notable that Ellis does not appear to criticise nationalist interpretation of history which, he states, is "based on the premise that the Irish people had a moral right to fight for</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>their political, economic, social and cultural independence against the imperial ethics of their big neighbor" (which has nothing to do with ancient history). But he criticises what he called "anti-nationalist" interpretation only because he deems it wrong to have any other opinion on Irish history other than a nationalist (and anti-British) one. And that is the basis of all his criticism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further, his criticisms of Adamson's book make it clear that he has either not read it thoroughly, or has not understood it very well: he ignores much of what Adamson had said and researched, gives a poor summary of the book, and makes suggestions and draws conclusions that are contrary to what Adamson had actually written. He states that these "anti-nationalist historical revisionists" attempted to create a two-nation Ireland. Ironically history shows that, to a certain extent, and at various times in history, there were indeed two 'nations', or even four or more. But Ellis suggests that the two nations are the "a Catholic nation, which was Gaelic and nationalist, and a Protestant nation, which was English speaking and Unionist".. despite the fact that the Reformation and the development of Unionism were both late events in Irish history: Adamson doesn't mention in his book that the Gaels were Roman Catholic, not that the Cruthin were Protestant!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, Ellis' criticism itself is founded on shakey grounds. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 11:50, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My intent in supplying the link above was to prove some badly needed context for Ian Adamson. From the comments above, I think it's fair to say that you are the only person in this disucssion who had ever heard of him: the rest of us had no way of knowing whether he was a tenured professor, an independent scholar, or just some crank who spouts off rubbish at a bar. (And pointing to the Wikipedia article on Dr. Adamson does not help, because we have no way of knowing whether the two are correctly the same person. At the least, this link proves that they are.)</p>
<p>Whether or not his work is solid is irrelevant to this article, &amp; in a way I'll admit that I should not have brought it up. However, both the lecture I have linked to, &amp; you own words Setanta747, show that his claims are accepted only by a small &amp; clearly-defined segment of society. This clearly indicates that this identification is not a fact, but a claim that Dr. Adamson has made for reasons you know but have not yet shared with us. They may be convincing arguments, or they may not be. In any case, the only accurate way to introduce this information would be to state that "Dr. Adamson has argued that the British Isles [or what ever part of them he writes about] are identical with the 'Isles of Elishah' mentioned in Ezekiel 27."</p>
<p>However, I think even this sentence does not belong in this article, because it is clearly about the name <b>Britain</b> for part or all of the island (I admit I'm uncertain about this usage), &amp; not about the various names of the island. If this isn't the case, then why doesn't the article discuss another ancient name of this island -- <b><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion.html" title="Albion">Albion</a></b>? If you re-read <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>, then you will see that mentioning "Albion" beyond listing it at the bottom with the other "See also" is irrelevant. And the usage "Albion" is far better known and attested than "Isles of Elishah".</p>
<p>Does anyone else agree that this is an important point? Although the island had other names in the past, they are not necessarily important to the subject of this article; to mention either "Albion" or Isles of Elishah" in this article requires the contirbutor to prove that they are relevant. And because I can see no reason to mention "Albion" in this article, there is clearly no reason to mention a possible, but little known, identification with another. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:46, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well Adamson is from Northern Ireland, and reasonably well known here. I don't expect he'd be quite as well-known in other regions or countries as he writes about pretty specific topics. I don't think I did point to his Wikipedia article, did I? You say that Adamson's claims are only supported by a "small segment of society"... well I can't tell you that is not the case to be honest. But nor can I reasonably assert that it <i>is</i> the case. Certainly, the Ellis article doesn't necessarily shed light on that. Adamson's work was based on (other) scholars by the way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You say, <i>"This clearly indicates that this identification is not a fact, but a claim that Dr. Adamson has made for reasons you know but have not yet shared with us."</i> But that is simply not the case. How you arrived at that conclusion, I don't know. However, having found my copy of the particular book by Adamson, I have re-assessed my interpretation to it (I will type in the relevant part of the book later on), as I indicated in my comment above. Something similar to what you have suggested is how I am going to suggest here by the way. I'm not going to refer to him as "Dr" though, as that is not how he refers to himself in the book.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the reference to the <i>island</i> of Britain - as I've said, the two are linked. Britain comes from the word Pretani, which was used to refer to the island<b>s</b>. There are already references to the islands in the section ("Grate Briteigne", "British Isles" and the Pretannic Isles .. though I see this has also been changed). The introduction of the article also clearly shows that the word "Britain" is used to describe the UK. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 20:47, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, Telsa linked to Adamson's book above. As I said, his works aren't familiar to the rest of us, &amp; she may have been mistaken in the identification. And I called him "Dr" because it is the custom in my part of the world to use that title when referring to MD's. (I have found that people with Ph.D.s vary in their day-to-day use of this title in proportion to their own sense of self-importance; MDs are far less flexible.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for how I arrived at the conclusion that Adamson has only claimed the identification -- but is not a fact -- is a matter of historical evidence. He has expressed an opinion &amp;, I would hope, offered arguments for it. (Again, apparently only you are familiar with how he asserts the identification of the "Isles of Elishah" with Britain.) Unless he is citing some document where the author of the book of Ezekiel admits that by "Isles of Elishah" he meant Britain, then it is a theory. This is a matter of epistomology.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, you didn't respond to my fdar more important point: that the "Isles of Elishah" reference is as irrelevant as a reference to "Albion". Should I conclude that you accept my reasoning on this point &amp; you will take this discussion to another article? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 17:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that even if true, this reference would be more suited to a British Isles article. I sense that we won't find a solution to the question of the Isles of Elishah that will suit everyone, so I'm going to suggest that once the quote has been provided we put forward some proposals about how to include or not the reference and put it to a vote a la <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLLS_8909.html" title="WP:POLLS">WP:POLLS</a>.

<p>The terminology "Britain" is not a mere shortening of "Great Britain" since "Great" refers to the "greater" or larger isle in "Britain". Since "Britain" is the base of "British". The "British Isles" and "Britain" can be the same thing since Ireland is included in the "British Isles" and therefore "Britain" isnt the same as "Great Britain". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.151.178.146 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.151.178.146.html" title="User talk:67.151.178.146">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.151.178.146_68f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.151.178.146">contribs</a>) 18 August 2006.</small></p>

<dd>The OED defintion is:
<dl>
<dd><i>More fully (esp. as a political term) Great Britain.

<dd>Personaly I am doubtful about the fact that it is used for the island of Great Britain - its use as the informal name for the UK is at the very least far more common.

<p>I'm not going to revert the edit that says Britain can mean Great Britain but I would like an explanation as to why "geographical" Ireland isn't included in "geographical" Britain since Ireland is included in the British Isles. Doesn't British mean it's of Britain? And what about "Great Britain"? There was a reason that British Cartographers added the "Great" term to refer to the larger isle and not just the rest of Britain including Ireland (the isle, not the republic).

I personally have never heard anyone refer to the British Isles as "Britain" or even "Great Britain". My understanding is that the term British Isles (or the precursor thereof) is actually older than the term Britain. The earliest name for the islands was the Pretannic Islands, and Britain itself was called Albion. The "Pretannic" bit started to apply to the largest island as well, and the Albion name was lost except as a poetic name. The 'P' started to be pronounced as a 'B' in some languages.</p>
<p>If Corvidae's suggestion to make the British Isles be called "Britain" is ever taken up, however, it will leave the island consisting of England, Scotland and Wales stuck without a name, unless there is a serious plan to revive the name Albion. Personally I think both etymological sense and current usage imply that Britain and the British Isles are different things, especially since the term "British Isles" is avoided in the Republic of Ireland and I imagine calling the republic part of "Britain" would be even more repugnant to them. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaid100_d928.html" title="User:Kaid100">Kaid100</a> 23:41, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi first time here. Britain is described as England Scotland and Wales..... and as an island. Well we are part of the British isels, there's more than one island and Northern island is part of Great Britain. (in the game family fortunes one of the questions is name a group of islands, despite being a British game, none of the people surveyed mentioned the "British isles",&#160;!

<p>About this paragraph, which has now been removed by multiple editors but reinserted by one editor on multiple occassions:</p>
<p><i>When the Italian cleric, Polydor Vergil, was commissioned by the English king, Henry VII, in 1505 to write "the History of England" (1535), he gave the following description of Britain <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> in the introduction:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the whole Countrie of Britain ...is divided into iiii partes; whereof the one is inhabited of Englishmen, the other of Scottes, the third of Wallshemen, [and] the fowerthe of Cornishe people, which all differ emonge them selves, either in tongue, ...in manners, or ells in lawes and ordinaunces."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>This distinction of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> was also reflected by the first <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a> when, in 1351, he commissioned a survey of his <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Cornwall_0a31.html" title="Duchy of Cornwall">Duchy of Cornwall</a> lands to ascertain what was held, and by whom, of his tenants in "Cornwall &amp; England". There are many historical references to corroborate this distinction (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_status_of_Cornwall_8779.html" title="Constitutional status of Cornwall">constitutional status of Cornwall</a>) and it has been the Cornish perception of themselves up to the present day but hidden from the world by being classified, since 1889, as an English administrative county.</i></p>
<p><i>It is argued <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> that to ignore the Cornish as one of the constituent nations of Britain is to deprive the Cornish people of their history and rights as a national group within the United Kingdom and the greater Europe and deliberately facilitate actions detrimental to the future existence of the Cornish people.</i></p>

I really can't see the relevancy about something that either refers to the United Kingdom or England but not Britain being in a Britain article. It strikes me as POV (<i>it has been the Cornish perception of themselves up to the present day but hidden from the world by being classified, since 1889, as an English administrative county</i>) , uses weasal words (<i>it is argued</i>), references an extremely one sided website at number 2. I think it should be removed and would like to canvass the opinions of other editors. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 19:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The relevance, whether you like it or not, is a historic reference to <b>Britain</b> at the beginning of the 16th century - of which there are others. I would have expected a reasonable person to query the inclusion of Cornwall, and in line with a quest for knowledge, to question it but not, as earlier, to dismissively delete the whole item which sought to put the issue into some form of context. If you wish to suggest that the referenced site is in anyway wrong, or incorrect, then please give your reasons why. What you describe as a one-sided website does not mean that what is said is not valid or legitimate. That would be another discussion but please feel free....! Perhaps a way forward, would be to include the original Vergil quote - to which, I would add others - and leave the rest as a reference/endnote? -- TGG 13:14, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually plenty of other people have been removing it, so it's not just me - it is only yourself that has added it. The paragraph is horribly POV as I have indicated above, there is no reason for Cornwall to be given special status in this article. It is not treated as anything else but a County both in and outside the UK. All that quote talks about is different languages meaning different peoples - hardly a definition of special status. And I am afraid that one sided websites are unlikely to meet <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Finally, you have failed to address the weasal words and the POV and instead insinuate that I am unreasonable (<i>I would have expected a reasonable person</i>).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, I will further expand: <i>it has been the Cornish perception of themselves up to the present day but hidden from the world by being classified, since 1889, as an English administrative county</i>. Now compare and contrast with this from <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornish_people.html" title="Cornish people">Cornish people</a> - <i>The number of people living in Cornwall who consider themselves to be more Cornish than British or English is unknown. A survey found that 35.1% of respondents identified as Cornish, with 48.4% of respondents identifying as English, a further 11% thought of themselves as British.</i> This is hardly the Cornish perception of themselves - it is barely above one third.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless the Britain article is not the place to argue over the status of Cornwall. If there is some relevancy then it could be easily dealt with under the See also section with a link which would allow viewers to visit the COnsitutional status of Cornwall page if they choose, though that article is also in need of a serious clean up.</dd>

<dd>I am not sure why you simply pick up on language alone, or treat something as fundamental as ‘Cornishe people’ so dismissively, unless you are just expressing a POV based on prejudice? However dismissively you, and others, may wish to treat this, it points to a significant distinction. The quote, itself, was used by T.K.Derry &amp; M.G.Blakeway as the opening statement of their book on "The Making of Pre-Industrial Britain" (first published in 1969) and qualified with these words (my highlighting):</dd>

<dd>On the perception of the Cornish people issue. The article you have added says <i>the perception of the Cornish people</i> which defines that as a whole. From the other article it states <i>The number of people living in Cornwall who consider themselves to be more Cornish than British or English is unknown. A survey found that 35.1% of respondents identified as Cornish, with 48.4% of respondents identifying as English</i> which suggests that it is not clear cut as a whole, but rather 1/3 of the people of Cornwall. This is not to dismiss the Cornish people because of prejudice, as you suggest, but to state that those identifying as Cornish amounts to a minority - again not the perception of the Cornish people. Not identifying as Cornish, doesn't stop them being Cornish. Identifying as British does not stop one being Scottish or vice versa.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the inclusion of Cornwall as a constituent country. There is no basis to include it in the list and Wikipedia articles should not be used to argue that something should be amended or included/removed. Towns that were in Staffordshire, but are now in the West Midlands are shown as the latter becuase that is the current recognised status. Beyond the Cornish nationalist cause, Cornwall is recognised as a county of England in law and perception, domestically and internationally. Wikipedia must deal with the here and now, not what might, should or could be.</dd>

To call something lies, deception and propaganda would fail the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> requirement - propoganda is merely a form of perception which automatically brings in weasal words. It cannot be made more "wiki" because it cannot be encyclopedic. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_status_of_Cornwall_8779.html" title="Constitutional status of Cornwall">Constitutional status of Cornwall</a> has several sources listed that show that Cornwall is part of England, yet nothing of this has been put in here. Again this fails NPOV. To correctly fix this, would require massive expansion meaning this article would be more about Cornwall than Britain. This article correctly defines Britain as it is today accoding to custom and international law.</dd>

<dd><b>re website:</b> I see a problem with such things as disallowing ‘original research’ or some arbitrary qualification (by whom?) of what may be called ‘reputable sources’. Given that the website in question does contain referenced citations, why should it be a matter of concern? If it is considered as one-sided because the focus is specifically upon the rights of the Cornish people, then would it not be proper for those opposed to the Cornish position to include references to provide some presumed ‘balance’. What, indeed, would prevent others from including the said website retrospectively?</dd>

<dd><b>re perception:</b> You will, I hope, accept that there is a dispute over the status of Cornwall and her people – the reason, once again, why we are having this discussion! Therefore, ‘Cornish people’ has a different connotation according to whoever is using it. We also have the general, but intentionally derogatory, use of ‘nationalists’ (interesting in its own right?) to stereotype/stigmatise those arguing the ‘Cornish’ version of history. I would contend that this fragmentation of identity is for no other reason than that the ‘Cornish’ are being written out of history. If there is a Cornish people, a Cornish language and a Cornish territory, and history records this as distinct from the English people, the English language and English territory <b>within Britain</b>, then where is the justification for excluding this from an article <b>on Britain</b>?</dd>

<dd>Your interpretation of ‘the survey’ as indicative of only one third, clearly illustrates the Cornish Paradox and your misinterpretation of what I meant by ‘Cornish’. Do you, for example, consider everyone in England to be English? What is hidden from view by the survey you quote is how many of those surveyed are immigrants and how it measures factors such as continuity with Cornwall. If we simply concern ourself with the two identities of Cornish and English there will be those who consider themselves – and irrespective of origins - either Cornish or English. The former, according to the survey is 35.1%, the latter 48.4% with other nationalities (11% British although that is not a nationality!) making up the difference.</dd>

<dd>Hiding the Cornish Nation from public perception has the effect of inexorably marginalising the Cornish people out of existence and preventing a natural process of assimilation and integration of immigrants into the Cornish Community (q.v. recent concerns on multiculturalism). Whilst I would consider myself to be an inclusive person, it must be acknowledged that within Cornwall we are experiencing on a daily basis that which others elsewhere within Britain can only anticipate and fear. How can you justify a system that facilitates the ultimate destruction of one of the indigenous peoples of Britain, with the Cornish now a minority - an endangered species! - within their own country?</dd>

This whole discussion is about the disputed nature of Cornwall and how this is being perpetuated within an ‘incomplete’ article <b>on Britain</b>. For Wikipedia to solely deal with, as you say above, <i>Wikipedia must deal with the here and now, not what might, should or could be</i> - but to singularly exclude, in fact, <b>what was</b> - is somewhat flawed within the full spectrum of knowledge.</dd>

<dd>Your point, <i>propaganda is merely a form of perception</i>, seems to ignore the processes of manipulative control inherent in official propaganda. Surely, this can be made encyclopedic by showing the contrasting ways that perceptions have been, and are being, manipulated. If you feel that expanding the article to provide balance and npov would result in the article being more about Cornwall than Britain, then you might equally reflect upon why this should be seen as a necessary evil. Cornwall is misrepresented within Britain and one assumes that those who identify as Cornish must have the right to see that this is reflected in any article on Britain!</dd>

<p><i>Retabbed for easier reading</i> I will no doubt add to this tomorrow as the hour is late, but I wanted to respond to a couple of points quickly.</p>
<p><b>Original research</b> The relevant official policy is here <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Whilst it does not prohibit citing oneself, this appears to be restricted to publication in a respected journal. Has this been done for this information (whether by you or someone else)? If so, then it is <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citeable</a>.</p>
<p><i>it has been the Cornish perception of themselves</i> and <i>hidden from the world by being classified, since 1889, as an English administrative county.</i> are both surely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#SYNTHESIS" title="WP:OR">syntheses</a> unless there is a scholarly source for these.</p>
<p><i>It is argued [2]</i> references your website. How can this be anything but original research?</p>
<p><i>The Hidden Nation</i> is another synthesis unless a scholarly source can be found for this. I have tagged the section as being possible original research and as such it should be removed.</p>
<p><b>External links</b> <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_Links_1816.html#What_should_be_linked" title="Wikipedia:External Links">Wikipedia:External Links#What should be linked</a> states that <i>Sites that contain neutral and accurate material</i> should be linked to. <a href="http://www.kernowtgg.co.uk/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kernowtgg.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">Kernow TGG</a> certainly doesn't fit that criteria. On <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> it is described as <i>A radical look at factors affecting perceptions of Cornwall</i> - not, I would suggest, a generally recognised indication of neutrality.</p>
<p><b>Perception</b> I have to say that I am concerned that we are entering <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">soap box</a> territory here. Wikipedia should not be used to counter so-called propoganda. Statements such as <i>rides roughshod over Cornish rights</i>, <i>inexorably marginalising the Cornish people out of existence</i>, <i>Cornwall is misrepresented within Britain</i>, <i>those hiding under the yoke of the status quo</i> are all examples of my concern.</p>
<p><i>deliberately facilitate actions detrimental to the future existence of the Cornish people.</i> is neither NPOV and again looks like soap boxing.</p>
<p><b>Constituent country</b> It is being NPOV to report the facts as they are at the moment. Yes there is a court case, but unless that changes something, Cornwall is and will stay a county of England. No there was no Act of Union, but to say that means it must be counted as a constituent country has no basis in citeable fact except as an extrapolation of other information.</p>
<p><b>Etymology</b> Finally this page is about the Etymology of the word Britain or British. If there is a proper place for this it is in the see also page or possibly England or the UK. It is in effect a super disambiguation page. As there is no discussion of a country called Britain (there isn't one) this is not the proper place for it.</p>

<dd><b>Original research:</b> I know that the website has been in existence since 1997 and submitted to various organisations and academic instututions (in an attempt to awaken academia) as was a critique of the Duchy of Cornwall – the basis for the site - compiled for the reasearch organisation Cowethas Flamank and published in 1986 (a copy of which exists within the Duchy of Cornwall archives). The site has been included as a link (with comment) here -&gt; <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/britishisles/" class="external text" title="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/britishisles/" rel="nofollow">www.macs.hw.ac.uk/britishisles/</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have yourself quoted a survey showing that 35.1% of the population of Cornwall specifically describe themselves as ‘Cornish’ (as opposed to British or English etc.). How can the only too obvious fact of being classified as an ‘English’ county (hiding the facts of history) with an estimated 60% postwar growth of immigrants (mainly from affluent southeast England) be considered to be syntheses in showing how the Cornish are being socially and politically marginalised out of existence. Please see “Cornwall at the Crossroads? - 1988” by Deacon,George and Perry (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0 9513918 0 1</a> ) where this is analysed and which cites numerous references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The ‘it is argued’ hardly seems to be one of original research given the political culture within the Cornish Duchy and beyond – not least the many discussions that I have seen within Wikipedia. But, again, this identifies a hypothesis which, like the preceding comment is only too self-evident and provable. I accept that Wikipedia is not the place to attempt to prove it, but I would consider it a fundamental principle that all the facts are available as a resource within Wikipedia to enable others to draw their own conclusions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Marc Stoyle reference is a look at Cornwall the Neglected Nation?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>External links:</b> The kernowtgg site is radical in the sense that it is not afraid to present evidence and analysis normally avoided by ‘the Establishment writers’ whose future invariably rests in keeping faith with their paymasters. It is compiled from a ‘Cornish’ perspective as befits a site about Cornwall and the Cornish people. As a site, it seeks to maintain a neutral stance (within its remit) by not being critical of people (as individuals) but only of the existence of a hostile political and social inertia. The site has always welcomed some academic critique of the site – particularly with regard to its presumed failure over neutrality(?) – but it has been compiled with full knowledge of the status quo (legal or otherwise) and it is this that it sets out to address in order to provide <b>some balance</b> to a discussion on Cornwall.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Perception:</b> I have no wish to make this a soapbox. Life is too short and too much to do and I have already stated that my only aim is to record the existence of the Vergil quote (see Etymology below) within wiki principles</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Constituent country:</b> It is also, surely, NPOV to state facts as they were? I have no other agenda than stating this fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Etymology:</b> This is inherently the study of the evolution of words and suggests that my call for things to be recorded (that were) is equally valid to (what is). Perhaps, then, we could agree to expand the following sentence to include the mysteriously omitted reference to Cornwall? From which, we can then reference to “see also” and also update any associated referencing elsewhere as required to complete the jigsaw?

<dd><b>Original research</b></dd>
<dd>Thanks for the external link. From what I can see that is a personal website, but it does provide some usefulish info.</dd>
<dd><i>considered to be syntheses in showing how the Cornish are being socially and politically marginalised out of existence.</i> To make this not a synthesis you would have to provide a good reference for the actual decline in the population of Cornish. It would be like saying that the English are being marginilised out of existence by a Sottish dominated cabinet. Without cold hard facts, that is a synthesis.</dd>
<dd><b>Constituent country</b></dd>
<dd>The BBC article talks of the Cornish language (it's main argument for the Cornish nation that seems to extended) being almost extinct before the Act of Union between England and Scotland, where a sovereign state called Great Britain being formed. Therefore there were no constituent countries of Britain at this time, Wales having being formerly annexed into England before this date and Cornwall being ruled by the heir to English throne. it might be arguable that there were 3 consituent countries of the Kingdom of England at some point, but there would have to be some non trivial sources for that. To describe Cornwall as one now would be to misrepresent the current status of Brtain which is what this article is about.</dd>
<dd><b>Etymology</b></dd>
<dd>From the above I think this argument fails.</dd>
<dd><b>External links</b></dd>
<dd>The wikipedia guidelines/policy requires that the link be neutral. Whilst you state that it brings some balance the site is campaigning by nature which I suggest fails the requirement.</dd>
<dd><b>Solution</b></dd>
<dd>To stop us going round in circles can I suggest this as a plan of action, considering in multiple debates on Wikipedia it has been the conclusion that Cornwall be treated as part of England unless the Court case changes matters.

The misrepresentation of Cornwall as being in England, because it is treated as an administrative English county, is something that has been well debated, but any consensus to legitimise the misrepresentations has only been arrived at by fixing on the County Councils Act of 1888, and a marginalisation of 'a Cornish' perspective by the use of a preset ‘English’ Infobox template. For that reason, I cannot see how <b>Cornwall’s relationship to Britain</b> (the sole point of this exchange) can be sincerely, or honestly, covered within any of the articles that you suggest - because of that relationship.</dd>

<dd><b>Corineus:</b> Are you suggesting that the existing reference to Brutus et al is to be removed? Perhaps, there is a need, instead, to remove this arbitrary ‘etymology’ limitation and combine the articles of Britain and Great Britain under '<b>Britain'</b> and then, if necessary, put the etymological focus on Great Britain? The reason I say this, is because it is Britain that is, in truth, ‘the place’ (and invariably the default terminology) and ‘Great Britain’ is a final <b>evolution</b> of the name but, contextually, quite irrelevant.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> is about a country/place. This article is about a word. Consensus on Wikipedia (debated several times over) is that Cornwall is part of England unless/until the forthcoming court case changes thing. The whole section needs to be removed as original research anyway, but this page is a super disambiguation page anyway where this is not appropriate. The articles mentioned are the more appropriate place. Wikipedia is not the place to argue about a "perspective" from one point or another. Cornwall's relationship with England is far more relevant - if it is part of England then it fits under England - again consensus here. As for the County Councils Act <b>if</b> (a big if) it was not part of England (very debatable) then it is now - parliamentary sovereignty etc. As for the quote, as Wales was at that time annexed and therefore considered part of England, what is to say that they were three separate countries. He could have been referring to language or the common misconception of Britain being England and vice versa. Encyclopaedic entries cannot interpret.

<ul>
<li>I am suggesting that wiki has got Britain/Great Britain the wrong way around – for reasons stated!</li>
<li>I am not discussing whether or not Cornwall is a part of England but that it has a historic relationship <b>to Britain</b> before England even came into existence.</li>
<li>The quoted item is hardly original research since it was used in the introduction to a history of England commissioned by the king.</li>
<li>However it may be dressed up or euphemised, the quoted item has no relationship at all to the articles mentioned.</li>
<li>I am not referring to any relationship to ‘England’.</li>
<li>I find it quite bizarre, that academics(?) hide behind dubious State behaviour rather than an objective view of history, which is what, hopefully, we are discussing.</li>
<li>They were undoubtedly separate countries by virtue of language, people, territory and government and other qualify attributes with Cornwall a Royal Duchy. Unlikely to have been the equivalent of the modern misrepresentation and a contrived synonymy between Britain and England when used as an introduction to a history of England. You are, it seems, seeking <b>to interpret</b> with the specific aim of excluding the Cornish reference!</li>
<li>Whilst, I have stated a willingness for the section to be modified, I do not consider that you have given any legitimate reason why the quote should not be included and perhaps, this needs to be taken to some ‘higher authority’?</li>
</ul>
<p>You seem to be bypassing my queries with regard to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corineus.html" title="Corineus">Corineus</a> and the passage, in the Etymology section, referring to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brutus.html" title="Brutus">Brutus</a> <i>et al</i>. My interest in this is that it yet again misrepresents the actual reference by excluding the Corineus (Cornwall) association. Briefly: when Brutus and Corineus, his second in command, came to the island (Albion) he named the island Britain and his companions Britons. Similarly, Corineus, <b>who had precedence over all others</b>, called his chosen share of the island Cornwall and his companions Cornish. The reference to what became Wales, Scotland and England, only occurred after Brutus died when he allocated these places to his sons, Kamber (Wales), Albanactus (Scotland) and Locrinus (Logria, which eventually became England).</p>
<p>Whatever opinion, you may have on this presentation of history, it had a major influence on historical perception and which gave rise to the <b>Galfridian Conceit</b> used to further English supremacy over 'the island'. Even if a literary myth it reflects a particular understanding of Cornwall in the early 12th century, consistent with other contemporaneous knowledge. Therefore, as part of the etymology of Britain, it seems appropriate that the origins of Cornwall and Britain are very closely related. As I see it: include Corineus, <b>my compromise</b>, or delete the complete <b>misleading</b> Brutus reference and retain the Vergil quote! -- TGG 12:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A quick note - when an editor removes an article and gives a reason as has been done today, to call it vandalism is to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume bad faith</a>.</dd>
<dd>Now onto the substantive issues: original research is a good enough reason to remove the whole section. I have not done so as a courtesy, but as another editor has no done so, I will be doing so shortly. This is not vandalism, but editing as per the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> guidelines. It is also not up to someone to justify exclusion, it is up the editor to justify inclusion (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - (<i>The obligation to provide a reliable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not with those seeking to remove it</i>). We now have multiple editors removing a section and one adding it.</dd>
<dd>I have dealt with the quote as being open to interpretation - where are the scholarly sources, the non trivial references as per <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>? None have been provided and this has being going on for nearly a month.</dd>
<dd>As for Brutus ,if you wish to raise this as a separate point of discussion, please feel free or try and edit your quote in with sources, but the article took a lot of effort from a lot of editors to get the balance, so I would seriously suggest raising it on this talk page first. --<a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 15:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have now removed the section for the above reasons. The text is reposted here if further disucssions are required:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>When the Italian cleric, Polydor Vergil, was commissioned by the English king, Henry VII, in 1505 to write "the History of England" (1535), he gave the following description of Britain <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> in the introduction:</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"the whole Countrie of Britain ...is divided into iiii partes; whereof the one is inhabited of Englishmen, the other of Scottes, the third of Wallshemen, [and] the fowerthe of Cornishe people, which all differ emonge them selves, either in tongue, ...in manners, or ells in lawes and ordinaunces."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>This distinction of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> was also reflected by the first <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a> when, in 1351, he commissioned a survey of his <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchy_of_Cornwall_0a31.html" title="Duchy of Cornwall">Duchy of Cornwall</a> lands to ascertain what was held, and by whom, of his tenants in "Cornwall &amp; England". There are many historical references to corroborate this distinction (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_status_of_Cornwall_8779.html" title="Constitutional status of Cornwall">constitutional status of Cornwall</a>) and it has been the Cornish perception of themselves up to the present day but hidden from the world by being classified, since 1889, as an English administrative county.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is argued <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> that to ignore the Cornish as one of the constituent nations of Britain is to deprive the Cornish people of their history and rights as a national group within the United Kingdom and the greater Europe and deliberately facilitate actions detrimental to the future existence of the Cornish people. While it is also argued that the former kingdom of Cornwall exists historically in the same way as separate <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenet.html" title="Plantagenet">Plantagenet</a> kingdoms but is no longer relevant <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[</span>citation needed<i>]</i></a></sup> in modern day England.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>Because I cannot put the amount of time necessary to continue this discussion against the entrenched and retrospective prejudice and historical subjectivity which seems to be the wiki-way with respect to Cornwall, I shall have to leave it there for the moment. I would certainly like to take this to some higher authority for an objective decision and perhaps you might suggest the route to this? It is pointless suggesting an 'agree' - 'disagree' consensus because the Cornish presentation of facts can never win within such an alien and hostile environment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a statement of 'fact' the original Vergil quote cannot be argued against and together with its supporting use within the volume "The Making of Industrial Britain" has a meaning not left to interpretation - other than from a POV derived from prejudice (q.v. one edit refers to 'removal of nonsense'). Why should the Cornish as 'one of the distinct peoples' of Britain be excluded on some pretext not applied to the others within that quote?</dd>

<li>the Royal Duchy of Cornwall, as constitutionally extra-territorial to England, and,</li>
<li>a definitive territorial identity - unmatched by any Anglo-British county,</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>there is a distinct failure to treat this objectively and within a contemporaneous context, or to acknowledge
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>a) the relative merit of the quote, as emanating from a Royal Commissioned publication, and</li>
<li>b) a supporting reference, derived from a Royal source.</li>

<dd>I'm not so convinced. For sure, "Britain" is often used to mean the UK (for example the Economist does it all of the time), but when it is, don't you think that it is being used in a more euphemistic sense? I think it is also a mistake think of <i>Britian</i> and <i>British</i> as having a strict noun-adjective relationship, since one is an identity (and citizenship) as well as the adjective.</dd>

<dd>I'd broadly agree with Robdurbar's suggestion of moving most of the content to the Wiktionary entry. I think perhaps the beginning of the article as it stands would work fine as a disambiguation page (we need, for example, to make it clear that the spelling <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittain.html" title="Brittain">Brittain</a> is a surname).</dd>
<dd>I'd also be interested to see what the Chambers, the Collins or the NODE have to say about the word "Britain", since all of Sony Youth's examples are American dictionaries and may possibly reflect a subtle usage difference. Certainly, "Britain" is used to mean the UK by the Economist; it is also used by the BBC and other broadcasters, all British newspapers and the government itself. For example, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,,184840,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,,184840,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian style guide</a> says, under British: "Britain is the official short form of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Used as adjectives, therefore, British and UK mean the same." Please note: the official short form. It is NOT incorrect.</dd>
<dd>This has all been discussed at length above. By all means move the info to the Wiktionary, but please do not assume that the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> page should automatically redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>.

<dd>Seems okay to me too. Would prefer a merge with Great Britain and a disambiguation link to United Kingdom on top of there - but Rob's suggestion looks fair enough. --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 23:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ha, here's a laugh. You just moved a whole lot of information about the history of the usage of the term <i>Britain</i> to Wictionary, on the grounds that it was "about the word", and of course words go in dictionaries. Within half an hour, one of the regular Wictionary writers put a clean-up notice on the page, and asked in his edit summary, "Where did all this <b>encyclopedic</b> information come from?" He is right - just look at the neat tabular lay-out of Wictionary and it should be obvious to you that this kind of discussion does NOT belong there. The rule about not having dictionary entries in Wikipedia is meant to avoid us having articles which are <i>just</i> dictionary definitions. But when we get into complex matters of word usage, the history of the signifier is inextricably bound up with our understanding of the significant, and when Wikipedia is discussing a difficult concept like Britain, the history and variation of linguistic usage in relation to that concept is encyclopedic. I have not worked on this page for over a year, so I'm not going to argue for a simple revert, but do think about this again. The set of Wikipedia articls on Britain are impoverished if we have a sacred cow stopping us from telling the reader how GB came to be called GB. And if as I suspect the Wictionary people just delete this information as out of place, then some very interesting background to Britishness has been lost to the project. That would be a shame. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 13:18, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So add it to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britishness.html" title="Britishness">Britishness</a> article, or better still improve the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> etymology section with it. I've added relevent parts to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Briton</a>, maybe explain in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> why the government there is called <i>British</i> and papers like the Economist and the Guardian call the UK, "Britain", for short. Or if you really must start a new article called Historical names for Great Britain. But do you really think that all the articles linking to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> expect to be met with an etymology and usage guide? --<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESony-youth_5dca.html" title="User:Sony-youth"><span style="font-family:Zapfino, sans-serif">sony-youth</span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/o/n/User_talk%7ESony-youth_2df0.html" title="User talk:Sony-youth">talk</a></sup> 14:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh absolutely not - the muddle of Britain/UK-articles needs your terrible swift sword, and I'm not wanting to stop you. I hadn't noticed there is an article on Britishness. You may be right - this linguistic information has a lot to do with Britain as an identity, so maybe it belongs there. Good idea. But I feel bad about butting in after you have been debating this without me, so I'm not going to do it. I've alerted you to a danger, but those of you working on this need to find the solutions. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 22:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
