<p>WIth reagrds to your attempts to get anti homosexualism recognised, I noticed your edits on <a href="../../../k/u/_/Talk%7EKu_Klux_Klan_ac6a.html" title="Talk:Ku Klux Klan">Talk:Ku Klux Klan</a>.</p>
<p>Homophobia is not a phobia. It is a neologism that utilises the suffix phobia in a non-standard way. the lead to the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a> article describes it correctly as "the fear of, aversion to, <b>or discrimination</b> against homosexuality or homosexuals." Not the use of aversion and siscrimination, not just fear, and the use of OR, meaning that these are not always present.</p>
<p>Homophobia may be a "new" word, but it is the currently accepted term for this behaviour and/or attitude. Anti-homosexualism, as your research seems to provide sources to its previous existence as a term, should be mentioned historically in this article, not as an article of its own just yet, as it just contains the same material as homophobia, as they are two words for the same thing.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 17:12, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Welcome <a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a>, I believe I understand your point (though you may want to check what you wrote for typos). Anti-homosexualism, as I understand its definition, does not include aversion, or any other attitude of the mind. It is an "ism" a plan of action. Such plans of action rarely if ever have anything to do with fear or aversion to homosexuality. In the same way anti-Semitism has nothing whatsoever to do with fear or aversion to Jews. Jews are the target because they make easy political scapegoats. The same is true of homosexuals, gypsies, the handicapped, etc. Anti-homosexualism is a much bigger and more serious word than homophobia. You or I could be homophobic, but if we round up a mob and go looking for homosexuals to thrash then that becomes Anti-homosexualism. Homophobia doesn't cover it. Homophobia is a state of mind, Anti-homosexualism is a plan of action. With regard to discrimination I don't accept that definition for homophobia I think that is an error discrimination is a verb, the definers of homophobia cannot seem to decide if it is a noun, or a verb. They try to make it a catch all. Anti-homosexualism is a noun. Just like "plan" is a noun. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritcom_bbf5.html" title="User:Britcom">Britcom</a> 18:55, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're mistaken that the difference between a noun and verb has anything to do with this. The word <i>discrimination</i> is always an abstract noun. The word <i>homophobia</i> is also always an abstract noun. The word <i>anti-homosexualism</i> is always an abstract noun. The word <i>plan</i> is sometimes a noun and somtimes a verb. ZayZayEM has a valid point, and it's not enough for you to say "I don't accept that definition." I hope that you are able to show verifiable evidence in published literature to indicate that others have this view about these definitions and that you insert these references <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html#Usage" title="Anti-homosexualism">here</a> to replace the "[citation needed]" tags. If these citations do not exist, I'll still support keeping this article in Wikipedia in a dramaticly altered form as a historically important word and/or a word that describes a concept that overlaps with homophobia with a differing emphasis (as was done for <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeophobia.html" title="Judeophobia">Judeophobia</a>). Note that <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Islamism_556c.html" title="Anti-Islamism">Anti-Islamism</a> has redirected to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamophobia.html" title="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a> for some time. This is an example of a similar non-standard but common usage of the suffix "-phobia." <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 20:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Britcom has quit Wikipedia in disgust. See <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anti-homosexualism_f17a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anti-homosexualism">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anti-homosexualism</a> for information on why Britcom would want to quit. He no longer wants to be associated with people who are more concerned with their own egos and small minded self-righteousness, then getting it right. Britcom has recently come to the conclusion that Wikipedia is overrun by hypocrites and territorial quangos who punish rather than foster those who would add to Wikipedia's content. Don't be fooled by Wikipedia's claims of neutrality and inclusion. Wikipedia is an exclusive club and if you are not one of the anointed, you will be ostracized and your edits condemned.</p>

It looks like <a href="../../../o/r/e/User%7EOren0_GWSkeptic_db27.html" title="User:Oren0/GWSkeptic">this</a> and will also add you to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_who_are_skeptical_of_anthropogenic_global_warming_5ee2.html" title="Category:Wikipedians who are skeptical of anthropogenic global warming">Category:Wikipedians who are skeptical of anthropogenic global warming</a>.

<p>I have just been reading you some of the stuff that you have written. I find you very interesting. You are very opinionated and on top of that have very strong opinions. You do not like to conform. People seem to get up you at how you edit because you love to edit from a non-neautral point of view.</p>
<p>For that I respect you.</p>
<p>Although the views you hold are of a secular nature.</p>
<p>I am a Christian and are very similar to your charicteristics except that I oppose most of all of your opinions (I have yet to read all that you have wrote).</p>
<p>I hope to enjoy, opposing what you stand for. We are very similar people on different side of the fence.</p>

<dd>Thanks for your interest in my edits, I enjoyed writing most of them. Here is something to chew on for a while: I believe the concept of "Neutrality" is bogus. Reason and Logic are better suited for having a debate. Facts and History are flawed, because people lie and have lied about things for thousands of years. Therefore what are the chances that some (or most) of what we are taught about anything might be false? I think the chances are at least 50/50. If that were true, then how can you trust anything any book, school, web site, newspaper, TV program, or even parent, has ever told you? Answer: you can't, (with few exceptions). The only subject that can be relied upon for factual and absolute truth, is... Math; not History, not Science, not English, not Social Studies, not even Religion. It is amazing isn't it that there are no lobbying groups or political parties or marketing firms out there spending millions of dollars to convince their target audience that <b>2+2=5</b>. Imagine how some people could cash in if they could convince people that <b>2+2=5</b>. I loan you $2 today, and then another $2 tomorrow, and when the loan comes due, I tell you that the two loans add up to $5 and you agree. Isn't that crazy? Well, I found out that what makes Math true can be applied to anyone's notion of what truth is, and thereby arrive at a dependable and repeatable result. This philosophy can be described very simply: "Truth <i>is</i>... all else is <i>not</i>. That is the same as the definition of God. The Bible says: God is the creator and has ultimate authority over everything in the Universe, including us. Therefore if God says something is true, it becomes true simply by virtue of His authority. Man does not have that kind of authority. Though many try to trick others into believing a lie long enough for them to get what they want and then get away before the truth is discovered. Some of those lies have been going for hundreds of years without being discovered except by a very small group of people who are often disbelieved by others when they expose the lie. The trick is, people are vain and don't like the idea that they can be duped, so (incredibly) they defend the lie and try to keep it from being discovered by others, naturally this means that the victims of the lie actually denounce those who are trying to expose the lie, because the longer the lie is kept a secret, the longer the victims of the lie can forestall their own humiliation and embarrassment. I enjoy exposing those lies every chance I get. I do this with logic, a bit of very unsportsmanlike devils advocacy, and a little bit of what I call "marketing terminology". I enjoy slaying the sacred cows of people who engage in unquestioning faith in their ill conceived doctrines, or even better, those villains who actually orchestrate such lies as a means to their evil ends. They both deserve their fates. The sooner the liars, hypocrites, and fools are cut down, the sooner the absolute truth will become apparent and accepted by the masses just as the truth of Math remains without question. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritcom_bbf5.html" title="User:Britcom"><font face="Rockwell, helvetica" color="red"><b><i>Br</i></b></font><font face="Rockwell, helvetica" color="blue"><b><i>it</i></b></font><font face="Rockwell, helvetica" color="black"><b>com</b></font></a> 02:45, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Britcom — thanks for your comment on my talk page. I'm sure that we do have interests and some opinions in common. I'm not terribly interested in geology, but the book you pointed to does seem interesting. I don't know if I'll have time to read it, though. From the table of contents, it looked as if he was opposing Newton's theory of gravitation, which seems pretty major to me — aside from distortions caused by relativistic movements, Newton's laws of gravity are still considered an accurate practical model of physics. (Of course, Newton himself believed that his writings on physics, mathematics and optics were just a sideline, and that his real contribution to the world was his theological writings — however, his heirs disagreed, and actually suppressed some of his more esoteric theological writings. But I digress...) Anyway, I'm somewhat sceptical of a scientific hypothesis that requires that <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_mechanics.html" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a> be thrown out completely — I'm not sure whether Brown's work does this or not, but if it does that would be a mark against it for me, at least considering it scientifically. (That's not to say that a good science fiction story couldn't be made based on it — there's a lot of good science fiction based on bad science!)</p>
<p>As for the homophobia business — I actually agree with you that "anti-homosexualism" might be a more accurate term than "homophobia" for organized and theory-based opposition to homosexuality; however, "homophobia" is the word that's widely used, so that's what Wikipedia has to use primarily. Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> should use the senses in which the word is used in reliable sources — and I think that by and large, it does. There may be an argument for expanding the "criticism of the term" section, perhaps pointing out more explicitly that many social conservatives object to the term and/or its usage to mean "opposition to homosexuality". (The section mentions two organizations in particular, but there's probably a case for a broader statement.) If specific claims elsewhere in the article have been refuted by reliable sources on the conservative side, it would be appropriate for the article to mention them, in keeping with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't follow the earlier deletion debate around <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html" title="Anti-homosexualism">anti-homosexualism</a>, and if you wanted to re-open it at DRV I'd be willing to consider an argument for it as a distinct term, as long as the resultant article avoided <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. It would be helpful if you could point to modern sources which distinguish "anti-homosexualism" from "homophobia", or clearly use the two in different senses. If any exist, that would be a very strong argument for overturning the decision to make <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-homosexualism.html" title="Anti-homosexualism">anti-homosexualism</a> a redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a>. As I said at <a href="../../../h/o/m/Talk%7EHomophobia_b495.html" title="Talk:Homophobia">Talk:Homophobia</a>, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a> article isn't going anywhere, but like all Wikipedia articles it's a work in progress, and subject to improvement by consensus. I hope that the article's regular editors can address your concerns — but I advise you to concentrate on specific elements in the article rather than trying to engage in a general discussion about homosexuality and the LGBT movement. The latter is more likely to result in tempers getting frayed than the article being improved. People of good conscience disagree about this subject, but we can work together to find a neutrally worded compromise that's acceptable to everybody: that's the Wikipedian ideal, at least, and I think it's worth striving towards. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 09:27, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
