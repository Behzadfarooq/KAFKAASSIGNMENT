<p>The BHHRG was founded in 1992. It is run from the Oxford home of historian Professor <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stone_a652.html" title="Norman Stone">Norman Stone</a>, who has on occasion taken part in BHHRG activities, and was co-founded by his wife Christine Stone and fellow Oxford historian <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Almond_9a12.html" title="Mark Almond">Mark Almond</a> (who is also its chairman). Its trustees comprise Mark Almond, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Daniels_%28psychiatrist%29_db87.html" title="Anthony Daniels (psychiatrist)">Anthony Daniels</a> (who writes for the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a> under the pseudonym Theodore Dalrymple), <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Laughland_c1d4.html" title="John Laughland">John Laughland</a>, Christine Stone and Mary Walsh. Almond, Daniels, Laughland and Stone are members of Britain's conservative intelligentsia and are regular contributors to British newspapers. Chad Nagle, an American lawyer who frequently contributes to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a> isolationist <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiwar.com.html" title="Antiwar.com">antiwar.com</a> website, is also associated with the group. <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Malcolm_acfc.html" title="Noel Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a>, a prominent Balkans specialist, appeared on a 1994 list of founders and spoke on its behalf as recently as 1999 but has apparently since left the group.</p>
<p>The BHHRG is not an "official" <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsinki_Committee_6d73.html" title="Helsinki Committee">Helsinki Committee</a>, as it is not affiliated with the Helsinki Committees' umbrella organisation, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Helsinki_Federation_for_Human_Rights_b535.html" title="International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights">International Helsinki Federation</a> (IHF). The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>'s representative in the IHF is the British Helsinki Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, established in 1976. This led to the BHHRG being mistakenly labelled the British Helsinki Committee, which prompted the British Helsinki Subcommittee to ask visitors to its website to</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>"PLEASE NOTE that the so-called British Helsinki Group is NOT affiliated with the IHF"</b> <a href="http://www.ihf-hr.org/members/com_details.php?sec_id=2&amp;com_id=47" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ihf-hr.org/members/com_details.php?sec_id=2&amp;com_id=47" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For its part, the BHHRG website says nothing on the subject.</p>
<p>The membership, management and funding of the BHHRG are somewhat obscure. These aspects do not appear to be discussed at all on its website, and the details of its trustees are given only in its legally required returns to the UK's Charity Commission. Its published accounts state that it received £417,332 in income between 1997-2003 and spent £449,086 in the same period. The organisation appears to have fallen on hard times recently, with its funding falling by nearly 99% after 2001. A possible reason is suggested by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i>, which reports that</p>
<dl>
<dd>"the group lost almost all its supporters when it threw its weight behind people like Mr <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Milošević</a>." <a href="http://www.economist.co.uk/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=3446916" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.co.uk/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=3446916" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The identity of its backers is also unclear. Still with them in 1999, <a href="../../../n/o/e/Noel_Malcolm_acfc.html" title="Noel Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a> explained that the group does not disclose its donors</p>
<dl>
<dd>"for obvious reason[s]: they [critics] would then start to campaign [against the group] with the financial backers." <a href="http://www.tol.cz/look/Transitions/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=7&amp;NrIssue=21&amp;NrSection=2&amp;NrArticle=5598&amp;search=search&amp;SearchKeywords=%22War+of+the+monitors%22&amp;SearchMode=on&amp;SearchLevel=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tol.cz/look/Transitions/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=7&amp;NrIssue=21&amp;NrSection=2&amp;NrArticle=5598&amp;search=search&amp;SearchKeywords=%22War+of+the+monitors%22&amp;SearchMode=on&amp;SearchLevel=0" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Only a few contributors are known by name. Material that the BHHRG issued in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> cited the Tory peer <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Pearson_of_Rannoch_5cdb.html" title="Lord Pearson of Rannoch">Lord Pearson of Rannoch</a> and the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_and_Lucile_Packard_Foundation_1079.html" title="David and Lucile Packard Foundation">David and Lucile Packard Foundation</a> as donors. The BHHRG's "About Us" page states that it "does not receive funding from any government" but, according to a Foreign Office source, it did receive money from the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office_9bfa.html" title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> for an election observer mission in 1995 <a href="http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ReportID=146&amp;CountryID=14" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ReportID=146&amp;CountryID=14" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The source said funding was cut off because they found the group prejudiced, and partial and unreliable <a href="http://www.tol.cz/look/Transitions/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=7&amp;NrIssue=21&amp;NrSection=2&amp;NrArticle=5598&amp;search=search&amp;SearchKeywords=%22War+of+the+monitors%22&amp;SearchMode=on&amp;SearchLevel=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tol.cz/look/Transitions/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=7&amp;NrIssue=21&amp;NrSection=2&amp;NrArticle=5598&amp;search=search&amp;SearchKeywords=%22War+of+the+monitors%22&amp;SearchMode=on&amp;SearchLevel=0" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>It has received no funding from this source since then <a href="http://www.bhhrg.org/about.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bhhrg.org/about.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and its advocates now say this proves the group is independent of governments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Helsinki_Human_Rights_Group_8b1b.html" title="Edit section: Activities and achievements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Activities and achievements</span></h2>
<p>The BHHRG website states as the main activities of the Group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring the conduct of elections in OSCE member states.</li>
<li>Examining issues relating to press freedom and freedom of speech</li>
<li>Reporting on conditions in prisons and psychiatric institutions</li>
<li>Covering asylum and immigration issues</li>
</ul>
<p>The BHHRG publishes reports from first-hand observers, concentrating particularly on election monitoring in central and eastern Europe, as well as publishing frequent unsigned commentaries (just like the Economist does) about ongoing events in the region. A common theme in many of its publications has been a critical view of Western "meddling in the internal affairs" of central and east European countries, notably the former <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_fb6f.html" title="Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>.</p>
<p>Among its achievements the BHHRG's website states:</p>
<ul>
<li>1992 - BHHRG was the first NGO to expose the human rights situation in the former Soviet republic of Georgia</li>
<li>1993 - BHHRG exposure of fraud in the conduct of Russia's constitutional referendum was later admitted by the authorities.</li>
<li>1996 - BHHRG report of election fraud in Armenia's presidential election was only acknowledged in 1998</li>
<li>1998 - BHHRG predicted war in Kosovo in late February (after US envoy Robert Gelbard called the Kosovo Albanian separatist KLA a 'terrorist group')</li>
<li>1999 - BHHRG was the first human rights group to visit the notorious Sangatte camp for asylum seekers in France</li>
<li>2001 - BHHRG exposed the scandal of trafficking in women from Moldova</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Helsinki_Human_Rights_Group_8b1b.html" title="Edit section: Most controversial aspects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Most controversial aspects</span></h2>
<p>The media connections of some of BHHRG members (especially <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Laughland_c1d4.html" title="John Laughland">John Laughland</a>, a <a href="http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/conspiracies.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/conspiracies.html" rel="nofollow">self-avowed</a> conspiracy theorist and passionate <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0751523240/026-9459103-6884454" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0751523240/026-9459103-6884454" rel="nofollow">advocate</a> of "national sovereignty") has enabled it to propagate its views through a number of major newspapers in Britain and the US. Yet it did not really become famous until publicly denouncing what were widely perceived as democratic movements against authoritarian former Communist rulers.</p>
<p>Among actions critics of the BHHRG find ill-advised:</p>
<ul>
<li>The BHHRG based part of a Latvia report on an interview with Alfreds Rubiks, the Communist who led the "National Salvation Committee" which would have co-ordinated repression had the coup against Gorbachev not failed in 1991 <a href="http://www.atlanticblog.com/archives/001759.html#004187" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atlanticblog.com/archives/001759.html#004187" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In March 1997, BHHRG member Anthony Daniels wrote an article for the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Telegraph_062c.html" title="Sunday Telegraph">Sunday Telegraph</a>: "The Media Back the Communists as Usual", in which he claimed that British journalists Miranda Vickers and James Pettifer, were "supporters of the former Stalinist regime of the late <a href="../../../e/n/v/Enver_Hoxha_8c6e.html" title="Enver Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a>", the former communist dictator of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albania.html" title="Albania">Albania</a>. They sued the paper for libel and settled out of court, with the <i>Telegraph</i> paying £10,000 to each and printing an apology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another leading member, Christine Stone, has also written approvingly of <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwe.html" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>'s <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mugabe_10bb.html" title="Robert Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>. <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3446916" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3446916" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other statements by the BHHRG include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being the first to denounce the Milo Djukanovic regime in Montenegro as anti-democratic and run by gangsters, denouncing the elections there as worse than in Milosevic-era Serbia. Later, some of these facts became accepted even by Djukanovic's supporters in the West.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>denouncing as a "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a>" staged by his former protégés the November 2003 "<a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Revolution_d47f.html" title="Rose Revolution">Rose Revolution</a>" in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a> which deposed president <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduard_Shevardnadze_58b5.html" title="Eduard Shevardnadze">Eduard Shevardnadze</a>, whose torture of political prisoners they themselves boast had denounced (this is cited by them as an example of how the Western powers use and then dispose of their agents in the so-called Euro-Atlantic space).</li>
<li>claiming that the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_Former_Yugoslavia_9b11.html" title="International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> should not be prosecuting <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a> for his alleged <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mil-2ai011029e.htm" rel="nofollow">crimes</a> because they find fault with its <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc/index.htm" rel="nofollow">procedures</a> (there is such a thing as a fiar trial in normal countries) and</li>

<li>proving that elections in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> "met democratic standards", unlike the OSCE that could not back up its contrary claim, because it did not - in fact - observe the elections.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Laughland_c1d4.html" title="John Laughland">John Laughland</a> (who said that reports of mass graves in Iraq were exaggerated for political purposes) characterised some supporters of Ukraine's <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viktor_Yushchenko_fcb8.html" title="Viktor Yushchenko">Viktor Yushchenko</a> as "neo-Nazis" and many of those backing him on the streets as "druggy skinheads from Lvov" whereas principal elements of the Jewish community <a href="http://eng.maidanua.org/static/enews/1101681430.html" class="external text" title="http://eng.maidanua.org/static/enews/1101681430.html" rel="nofollow">supported Yushchenko</a>.</p>
<p>These last claims prompted the publication of well-documented articles "exposing" the BHHRG's exploits. The British weekly <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a> published "Yanukovich's friends: A human-rights group that defends dictators" <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3446916" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3446916" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. (Without a byline about who wrote the story). The daily <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">Guardian</a></i> published "PR man to Europe's nastiest regimes" <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/ukraine/story/0,15569,1362616,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/ukraine/story/0,15569,1362616,00.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, written by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Aaronovitch_456d.html" title="David Aaronovitch">David Aaronovitch</a>, to which <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Laughland_c1d4.html" title="John Laughland">John Laughland</a>, the subject of the article, objected <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,,1365930,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,,1365930,00.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, saying that it was "almost identical to" an article on a web site carrying "virulently antisemitic articles about the Jewish proclivity for rape, and about how the gas chambers at Auschwitz could not have existed". The controversy attracted many <a href="http://www.ukar.org/barcla/barcla01.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ukar.org/barcla/barcla01.html" rel="nofollow">comments</a> on the <a href="http://www.tomgpalmer.com/archives/016326.php" class="external text" title="http://www.tomgpalmer.com/archives/016326.php" rel="nofollow">internet</a>. The BHHRG's advocates reply by quoting one Aleksandr Tsinker, "Head of the Observer Mission from the <i>Institute for East European and CIS Nations</i>" — an organization publicly known for nothing else — as saying that the Ukrainian election "was a free expression of the voters' will". <a href="http://www.ukraine-eu.mfa.gov.ua/cgi-bin/valnews_miss.sh?lpos1200411020.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukraine-eu.mfa.gov.ua/cgi-bin/valnews_miss.sh?lpos1200411020.shtml" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>Some of the BHHRG's statements have been favorably quoted by the isolationist right in the US, by opponents of US foreign policy, as well as governments regarded by Western authorities as authoritarian and criminal, such as that of Belarus.</p>
<p>Its critics have accused the BHHRG of taking a predetermined ideological line while observing elections. A British Foreign Office official quoted by Jeremy Druker said of them:</p>
<dl>

<p>The BHHRG is almost always more critical of social-democratic than nationalist rulers. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Economist_bbe2.html" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i> characterises the BHHRG's opinion as "an intense dislike of liberal internationalism." Tom Palmer of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian.html" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a> <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cato_Institute_745b.html" title="Cato Institute">Cato Institute</a> summarizes their position as being that</p>

<dd>the mass movements to unseat [governments in eastern Europe] are nothing but stooges for the west, out to integrate those brave little authoritarian-socialist regimes into the 'New World Order,' privatize their state industries, and strip them of their assets. <a href="http://www.tomgpalmer.com/archives/016326.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tomgpalmer.com/archives/016326.php" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>

<p>The BHHRG's commentaries indeed allege that Western governments and international organisations are seeking to implement a "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Order_%28political%29_64c9.html" title="New World Order (political)">New World Order</a>" in central and eastern Europe <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22New+World+Order%22+site%3Abhhrg.org&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22New+World+Order%22+site%3Abhhrg.org&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Its supporters claim that the organisation exposes matters which Western governments and biased international organisations such as the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> and the OSCE had rather remained unknown.</p>
<p>For instance, it claims it denounced human rights abuses committed in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a> while these were ignored by the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Mark Almond, who has written on Balkan matters <a href="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/about/bi_books/long_reviews.cfm?book=177" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/about/bi_books/long_reviews.cfm?book=177" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, has criticised the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on behalf of Albanian separatists in <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> as a "violation of international law" which resulted in "cultural genocide" against Serbs. <a href="http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?CountryID=20&amp;ReportID=218" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?CountryID=20&amp;ReportID=218" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> As self-proclaimed monitors of Human Rights in the countries concerned, they accuse other, intergovernmental organisations of being undemocratic, unelected, unaccountable, non-transparent meddlers in their internal affairs.</p>
<p>The OSCE has criticized the BHHRG for letting its journalists pose as impartial election monitors while publishing partisan polemics in newspapers, and for relying on short-term observer missions with a handful of people, an approach the OSCE abandoned as open to manipulation in 1996. (The OSCE now uses large-scale long-term missions of four to six weeks with dozens of experts and hundreds of observers. <a href="http://www.newstatesman.co.uk/200204010025.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newstatesman.co.uk/200204010025.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>) The BHHRG dismisses the OSCE's position as an attempt to stifle legitimate criticism and independent reporting.</p>

<p>The BHHRG has also been denounced for failing to mention that it enjoys no recognition from the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Helsinki_Federation_for_Human_Rights_b535.html" title="International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights">International Helsinki Federation</a>, but has been quite at odds with other organizations with similar names, at least since 1996. The International Helsinki Federation (IHF) felt the need to issue a <a href="http://www.ihf-hr.org/members/com_details.php?sec_id=2&amp;com_id=47" class="external text" title="http://www.ihf-hr.org/members/com_details.php?sec_id=2&amp;com_id=47" rel="nofollow">public statement</a> disclaiming any connection with the group. The Greek National Committee of the said Federation, which has been effective throughout the Balkans, also published a <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/pressrelease/3-8-97.html" class="external text" title="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/pressrelease/3-8-97.html" rel="nofollow">press release</a> to denounce what it felt was the BHHRG's impostures, while others accused it of "nam[ing] itself so as to usurp the prestige of its elder". <a href="http://www.ukar.org/barcla/barcla01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ukar.org/barcla/barcla01.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Monika Horaková, a Roma member of the Czech parliament, said in an open letter condemning a BHHRG's report in 1999:</p>

<dd>"I had thought that the Helsinki Group was a non-partisan body interested in exposing and helping to solve human rights abuses in the world. This report caused me to question my previously held beliefs. However, I have since learned that the BHHRG has no connection to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights in Vienna. It is a disgrace that the BHHRG is using the good Helsinki name to mislead the public into thinking that their racist propaganda is somehow affiliated with the well-respected Helsinki Group." <a href="http://www.pili.org/lists/piln/archives/msg00344.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pili.org/lists/piln/archives/msg00344.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></dd>

<p>Supporters of the BHHRG reply that the name "Helsinki" is not trademarked anywhere and no official imprimatur is needed for any group wishing to monitor the implementation of the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsinki_Accords_e7ec.html" title="Helsinki Accords">Helsinki Accords</a>. They note that the European Commission established a "Helsinki Group on Women and Science" <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/science-society/women-science/helsinki_en.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/science-society/women-science/helsinki_en.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> in Helsinki in 1999, with no connection with the monitoring of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helsinki_Accords_e7ec.html" title="Helsinki Accords">Helsinki Accords</a>.</p>
